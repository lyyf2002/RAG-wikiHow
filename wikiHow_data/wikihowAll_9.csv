Example: (Smith 194);
, If the information used comes from the editor's notes, introduction, or other text created solely by the editor, you should use the name of the anthology's editor as the author's name. Include the page number, as well.



Typical Form: (ELastName PageNumber)

Example: (Doe 2)

, If you used information directly from one work within a larger anthology, cite the individual work instead of citing the full anthology.Typical Form: ALastName, AFirstName. ""Title of Work."" Title of Anthology. Ed. EFirstName ELastName. City of Publication: Publisher, Year. Page range of entry. Publication medium.

Use the virtual location for online reports.,
Check your entry for errors and proper formatting.",How to Cite an Annual Report in APA Style1," Usually it is a company that is the author of an annual report. Sometimes, however, there is an individual author. If so, lead the entry with this. Type the author's name at the beginning of the entry and add a period at the end.
If XYZ Corp's annual report was written by William Brown, the APA citation would include this name directly after the location and look like this: William Brown. XYZ Corp. (2001). XYZ Corp. Annual Report.. Smith, WI.
If there is no author, but an editor, include the editor's name where the author's name would go followed by (Ed.).;
, Unlike books or other sources that begin with an author's name, in an annual report, the first information given is the company's name, followed by the year the annual report was published.Write the company's legal name with a period immediately following the name. Make sure you include the company's business structure designation if it is included as part of its name.
Add 1 space, then write the date for the year in which the annual report was published.
Enclose the date in parentheses and add a period. For example, XYZ Corp's 2000 annual report published in 2001 would be cited as: XYZ Corp. (2001).

, This will be found on the cover page of the report and is usually a simple title indicating that the document you are reading is an annual report for a certain company or entity. Press the space bar once after the period for the annual report published date.
Type the company's annual report title in italics and include a period at the end. For example, XYZ Corp.'s annual report would be cited as XYZ Corp. (2001). XYZ Corp. Annual Report.


, Just like any other citation, the report will have been published in a location, which needs to be mentioned. You will need to include the city and state of the publication, which can be found on the cover page or within the first few pages of the report. Sometimes there are pages with publication information that will include the locations.


Add 1 space after the period for the annual report title.
Type the city name, a comma, 1 space and the state abbreviation where the company is located.
Add a colon immediately after the state. For example, if XYZ Corp is located in Smith, Wisconsin, the city and state would be APA cited as: XYZ Corp. (2001). XYZ Corp. Annual Report.. Smith, WI:

, Sometimes there is no physical printing location of the report, and it can only be found online. In this case include the URL where you found the report. Instead of putting a city and state following the title, you'll need to put the URL as a location. Type ""Retrieved From,"" after the title, followed by a colon, and copy and paste the URL.


For example: XYZ Corp. (2001). XYZ Corp. Annual Report.. Retrieved from: www.xyzcorp.org/annualreport.
This also applies to if you received the report from a database online. You would use the database information, instead of a URL, following ""Retrieved from:"", Since APA entries will follow a very specific set of punctuation and formatting options, you'll want to make sure to double check it carefully. Using the above example, it would be: XYZ Corp. (2001). XYZ Corp. Annual Report.. Smith, WI: Author. William Brown.


If there was no physical location, but only a URL, it would look like this: William Brown. XYZ Corp. (2001). XYZ Corp. Annual Report.. Retrieved from: www.xyzcorp.org/annualreport.

Switch to the editor when appropriate.,
Cite individual works for most entries.,
Use whole anthologies when citing the editor.",How to Cite an Anthology2," Typically, you'll need to cite an individual work within the anthology instead of citing the entire book.

Example: (Smith, 2012/2015)

, If you need to cite information provided by the editor of an anthology, you should use the editor's name instead of using an author from the book. Cite the anthology's publication year, as well.



Typical Form: (E.LastName, Year)

Example: (Doe, 2015)

Place the company's name, date, and page number in parentheses.,
Make sure to cite any information or ideas that are not your own.",How to Cite an Annual Report in APA Style2," There are many ways to cite your information within a text depending on the citation style, including footnotes or merely an author's last name. APA in-text citations follow the information you're citing, and use the title of the report in parentheses before the punctuation. They do not use footnotes.An example would be: ""According to XYZ's annual report, the company failed to meet profit expectations during the first quarter (citation).""

, The specific information that goes in the parentheses is important. This will let people reading your work follow up on your sources, both for verification purposes but also to help with their own research. Include the title of the report, the report's date, and the page number within the parentheses.For example: (XYZ Corp 2010, p. 210).

, While citations are important for helping other researchers, they are also an important part of intellectual honesty. Any ideas, statistics, or quotes that you take directly from the annual report, should be cited with specific place you pulled the information from.


When in doubt, it is better to cite too much than risk plagiarism or intellectual dishonesty.

Use the first part of your full citation.",How to Cite a Website Using MLA Format," When it comes to a website, it can be difficult to find an author for the whole website. However, you may be able to find one on the ""About Me"" page. You can also use an editor or compiler. If you can't find one, you can skip this step and begin with the next part, the website name.When listing the name, put the last name first, followed by a comma and the first and middle names (if available).
It should look like the following name: Roberts, Rebeca.
Put a period after the name.
In the case of authors, you're now allowed to use a handle (such as a Twitter handle) rather than the author's name if you can't find a name, such as @felinesforthewin.;
, The title of the website is the main name given to the website. You'll often find it in the header of the website, at the top of every page. Normally, you'd put what MLA calls the ""Title of Source"" next, which refers to the smaller section where you found your information, such as the page name or a journal article in a larger journal. However, if you're using a whole website, you leave this part out and just put in the name of the website.The name of the website should be in italics.
It should look like the following citation: Roberts, Rebeca. Cats Who Sleep,

Use a comma after the website title., If you find other people who contributed to the website besides the main editor, you can include it after the name of the website. Usually, you add in how the person or persons contributed, such as ""edited by"" for editors.Add contributors in using the following method: Roberts, Rebeca. Cats Who Sleep, edited by John Jacobs and Joseph George,
Put a comma after the contributors.
If the website doesn't have other contributors, leave this part out.

, Normally, a version and number would come next, such as with a journal, but most websites don't have versions or numbers, so move on to the publisher. The publisher in this case is the organization or sponsor of the website.If the name of the publisher is the same as the website, you can leave off the name of the publisher.The publisher will follow the comma after the other contributors: Roberts, Rebeca. Cats Who Sleep, edited by John Jacobs and Joseph George, The Cat Institute,
If there are no other contributors, follow the website title with the publisher: Roberts, Rebeca. Cats Who Sleep, The Cat Institute,
Follow it with a comma.

, The location does not refer to the place it was published. While older editions of the MLA Handbook required the place of publication, that is not included in the 8th edition for the most part. The location, instead, refers to the place you found the information. In this case, that is the website's URL address. The URL address is what's found in your browser's address bar at the top of your computer screen.Don't use the ""http://"" or ""https://"" before the website. Instead, begin with ""www.""
Add the website after the publisher: Roberts, Rebeca. Cats Who Sleep, edited by John Jacobs and Joseph George, The Cat Institute, www.thewebsiteforsleepingcats.com.

, In the past, when you couldn't find a piece of information, you'd need to add things like ""n.d."" for ""no date"" or ""n.p."" for ""no publisher."" However, now MLA recommends that you just leave the information out. You don't need to put anything in it's place.You can add the date you viewed the page if you wish, but you aren't required to include it. The date goes before the location.

, Once again, you begin with the author's name. In this case, you're looking for the author of the page you're citing, not the whole website. Often, the author's name will be at the top of the page or near the bottom, before the comments. If the whole site was put together by one person, you can use that person's name. Otherwise, if you can't find an author, leave it off and begin with the title of the page.Start with the last name first, followed by the first and middle names, if applicable: Fitzgerald, Rosa.
Use a period after the name.
If you can't find the author's name, you can use a handle in place of the name., Next, find the title of the page you're citing. You must have a title of the page. Otherwise, you might as well be using a full website citation. The title is usually at the top of the page, under the header for the whole website.Put the page title in quotation marks: Fitzgerald, Rosa. ""The Sleeping Habits of Elderly Felines.""
Use a period before the final quotation mark.

, After the page title, you need the website name, just as you did when you cited a whole website. The website name is usually found at the top of any of the website's pages, in the website's main header. If you can't find it there, look on the ""About Me"" page.Put the website name in italics: Fitzgerald, Rosa. ""The Sleeping Habits of Elderly Felines."" Cats Who Sleep,

Use a comma after the website name.

, If you find someone else who contributed to the page or who edited it, you can add that name in next. You should also add in a description of how the person contributed, such as ""edited by,"" to indicate what the person did.The contributors come after the website name: Fitzgerald, Rosa. ""The Sleeping Habits of Elderly Felines."" Cats Who Sleep, edited by John Jacobs,
Put a comma after the contributor.
If you don't have other contributors, leave this part out.

, The publisher is the sponsor or main organization of the website. You can find it on the ""About Me"" page, or sometimes on the bottom of any of the website's pages.If the publisher name is the same as the website name, you don't need to include it.Add the publisher after the contributors. If there are no other contributors, add it after the website name: Fitzgerald, Rosa. ""The Sleeping Habits of Elderly Felines."" Cats Who Sleep, edited by John Jacobs, The Cat Institute,
Use a comma afterwards.

, In this case, just like in the case of citing a full website, the location is the website's URL address. To find the URL address, look at the address bar at the top of your browser. It should begin with ""http://"", ""https://"" or ""www."" Copy and paste it into your citation, except always leave off the ""http://"" or ""https://"" and begin with ""www.""Place the website's URL after the publisher: Fitzgerald, Rosa. ""The Sleeping Habits of Elderly Felines."" Cats Who Sleep, edited by John Jacobs, The Cat Institute, www.thewebsiteforsleepingcats.com/sleeping-habits-of-elderly-felines.

, An in-text citation goes in your essay where you are referencing information from the website. It doesn't matter whether you are quoting from the source directly (with quotation marks) or paraphrasing from the source (in your own words without quotation marks). Either way, you need to add a citation to tell where you found the information.If you use information from other sources without citing it, it's considered plagiarism, with the exception of factual, common knowledge.
Citing your sources is also a courtesy to your readers. It lets them know where they can find more information on the topic., Once you get to the end of the sentence you're citing, use an open parenthesis. The parentheses indicate to your reader that you are opening a citation. The citation goes before the period at the end of the sentence, though if you're using quotation marks, they should come before the parentheses.You can also add a citation directly after the citation, preferably before a comma or other punctuation mark, if you're citing more than one source in a sentence.

, Normally, with a book source, you use the author's name and page number. Because websites don't always have authors, use whatever comes first in your citation, be it the author's name, the title of the page, or the title of the website. You do not need to use a page or paragraph number with the website.Therefore a citation would look like the following in a sentence: Cats enjoy sleeping for many hours a day (Fitzgerald).
You only use the last name when using the author's name.
Use a shortened form of the title. Try to stick to 3 or 4 words that will lead the reader directly to the citation at the end. If you are using the page title (because the author's name is not available), it would look like the following sentence: Cats enjoy sleeping for many hours a day (""Sleeping Habits of Felines"").

, You can also use the name at the beginning of the sentence without parenthesis. However, unlike MLA, you also put the other information in parenthesis at the beginning of the sentence. For example:

Create a citation page in your research journal.,
Gather information.,
Make sure you know which citation system to use.",How to Cite a Website2," Set aside several pages just for citations. It's easier if you keep all the information in one place. If you want, you can number the citations as you go and then refer to that citation in your notes by the number. Just be sure you don't lose the citation page.

, When citing a website, gather as much information as possible about the webpage:


Copy the URL, which is the website address that is in the box at the top of the browser.
Find the author of the page, which may be at the top under the title or down at the bottom. Sometimes the author's name is on the ""About"" page.
Write down the website's name, which is usually in the banner at the top of the page.
Copy down the title of the article, if applicable. It should be listed at the top of the page.
Find the publication date. It should be at the top or bottom of the page, but it's not always listed.
Note the date on which you retrieved the information.

, Your assignment or school should specify which citation system you'll be using. If you don't know, MLA is a safe bet for humanities, while APA is most often used in the sciences and Chicago in religion.

"
"
Know the format.,
Cite the website in the text.,
Include the website on your works cited page.,
Alphabetize your citations.",How to Cite a Website3," For MLA style, you'll embed a reference to your citation in the text, then include a works cited page at the end of your essay.

, Directly after the sentence in which you reference the information from the website, put in a reference to your works cited page.Do not put a period at the end of the sentence (yet).Put your reference in parentheses. Start the parentheses one space away from your last word.If you know the author of the website, cite the author's last name. Usually MLA citations include the author and page number; however, because most websites don't have page numbers, you can simply use the author's last name.If you don't know the author's last name, use the title of the piece, placing it in quotations. If the title is long, you can use what's called a partial title. For example, shorten ""Yiddish Theater in 19th-Century Prague"" to simply ""Yiddish Theater.""Close the parentheses. The close parenthesis should come directly after the last letter of the author's name or after the last quotation mark.Put a period at the end of the sentence. The period ending the sentence should come directly after the parentheses without a space., Use the following format with the first line not indented but the subsequent lines indented.Author's Last Name, Author's First Name. ""Website Name."" Version number (if applicable). Publisher or organization, date of publication (year). Publication medium (Web). Date you accessed the material (day month year).
Note that MLA no longer requires the inclusion of URLs in works cited page citations because URLs aren't necessarily static. If your instructor requires one, place it directly after the date of access: Date of access. http://www.piesforeveryone.com.
The citation looks like the following when complete: Smith, Jess. Pies for Everyone. The Baking Company, 2005. Web. 25 July 2007. http://www.piesforeveryone.com.
If you are citing one page on the website, place the page title in quotation marks before the website name: Smith, Jess. ""Cherry Pie for Beginners."" Pies for Everyone. The Baking Company, 2005. Web. 25 July 2007. http://www.piesforeveryone.com.
Leave the author off if one isn't listed. Use ""n.p."" in the publisher's place if you can't find one and ""n.d"" in place of the date., Use the first word in each citation to alphabetize them on the works cited page.

If you know the author of the text and the date it was published, put the last name of the author, a comma, and the date (year) of publication inside the parentheses.If you don't know the author, put the title of the work in quotations, a comma, and the date (year) of the publication inside the parentheses.Close the parentheses. Place the close parenthesis directly after the date.Put a period at the end of the sentence right after the close parenthesis.
You can also include the citation near the beginning of the sentence.

Use footnotes.,
Follow the footnote format for a website.,
Cite the website in your bibliography.,
Alphabetize the reference list.",How to Cite a Website5," The Chicago Manual of Style mandates the use of footnotes when citing sources in the text. You'll have an entry for your source on the footnote and another entry in the bibliography.To insert a footnote, click at the end of the sentence where you are making a citation. The footnote number will come directly after the period. Under ""References"" in Microsoft Word, click ""Insert Footnote."" It will create a footnote number behind the sentence and a corresponding footnote at the bottom of the page.

, Cite your website in a footnote as follows:


1. Author's First Name Author's Last Name, ""The Webpage Title,"" the publisher, organization, or website name, publication date or access date, URL or DOI.It should look something like this citation: 1. Jess Smith, ""Cherry Pie for Beginners,"" Pies for Everyone, 2005, www.piesforeveryone.com.
The DOI is the digital object identifier. It is a unique number assigned to online articles, so people can find them, much like an ISBN number. However, it's usually only assigned to academic articles. You can search for an article's DOI on Crossref.org.If you don't know the publication date, add ""accessed"" in front of the year in the footnote and ""Accessed"" in front of the year in the final citation.If the author is unknown, begin with the first piece of information in the citation you have., Complete the entry in the bibliography for the website. It is essentially the same information as the main entry, but you change some of the commas to periods and reverse the author's name.


Author's Last Name, Author's First Name. ""Title of Webpage."" Lastname, Firstname. “Title of Web Page.” the publisher, organization, or website name. publication date or access date. URL or DOI.

Insert an in-text citation.,
Cite the textbook on the Works Cited page.",How to Cite a Textbook2," Place the in-text citation in parentheses, as soon as possible after the quote or clause being referenced. As with APA style, punctuation goes outside the parentheses. Include the following, unless you can work them into the text, in which case there is no need to repeat the information in the in-text citation:


Author's last name. If you cite multiple authors (of different textbooks) with the same last name, include first initials or, if necessary, full first names. If the textbook was written by multiple authors, as is often the case, list all authors' last names in the order they appear on the title page.
Page or page range being cited. Do not place a comma between the author's name and the page numbers, and do not preface the page numbers with ""p."" as in an APA-style in-text citation. Examples: (Doe 42), (P. Smith 202), (R. Smith 16).

, Include all of the following information, or as much as is available to you, in the Works Cited entry for each textbook:


Author's name, last name first, ending with a period. If there are multiple authors, list them in the order they appear on the title page, separated by commas (including a terminal comma). Preface the last author's name with ""and.""
The textbook's title as it appears on the title page, written in italics. End with a period. If the book is not a first edition, include the edition number after the title, but not italicized. End with a period. Example: 2nd ed.
City of publication, followed by a colon, then the publisher's name, followed by a comma, then the year of publication followed by a period. For example: New York: Dover, 2003.
Include ""Print."" - the medium of publication - at the end of the listing.

"
"
Insert an in-text superscript and note.,
Cite the textbook on the Bibliography page.",How to Cite a Textbook3," CMS uses notes, rather than in-text citations, to cite references. Place a superscript as soon as possible after the quote or clause being referenced. The corresponding note (either a footnote at the bottom of the page or an endnote at the end of the chapter or book) should include the following:


Author's full name, followed by a comma. If the note is the second citation for this particular work, include only the author's last name, followed by a comma. Use the same method for listing multiple authors of the same volume.
The textbook's title as it appears on the title page, written in italics, followed by a comma. If this is the second citation for this particular work, use an abbreviated version of the title.
Next comes the following information contained within parentheses: the textbook's place of publication, followed by a colon, followed by the publishing company, followed by a comma, followed by the date of publication. Example: (New York: Penguin, 1999). If this is the second citation for this particular work, omit this information entirely.
Page number, or range of page numbers separated by an en-dash, followed by a period. Example: 99–104. The same format is used for succeeding references to the same work.

, Include all of the following information, or as much as is available to you, in the bibliography:

Use indents correctly.,
Alphabetize your list.,
Use proper capitalization.,
Correctly cite authors.,
Correctly cite titles.",How to Cite a Source in APA Format1," When you create your ""references"" page at the end of your essay, you will need to give a list of your citations. When you do this, write them so that the first line is flush to the margin, and additional lines are indented.


There should be no line spaces between items on a references list. Your ability to tell citations apart will come from the first line being aligned with the left margin.
Do not number your citations, use only the indents to tell them apart.;
, Your entire ""references"" page should be listed in order alphabetically by the last name of the authors. The authors listed in individual citations do not need to be put in alphabetical order, but should be listed in the order they are named on their work(s).

, Throughout all of your citations, make sure that the names of all authors, titles of books and other works, and all directly cited and previously capitalized words are left in the upper-case.

, In APA format, all authors names are cited with the last name, then first name. For a single author, you can list both their first and last names. For multiple authors, cite their last name and their first initial. A citation with more than three authors must have all the names listed in the reference citation, but can be simply listed as (author 1, et al.) in your in-text citations.

, For large works such as complete books, journals, or magazines, italicize the title of the piece. You can also choose to underline the name of the work as well. If you are referencing only part of a journal entry or chapter of a book, you do not need to italicize it. Always make sure that the major words of the title are capitalized as well."

If you note the author's name within the same sentence, however, only the page number must still appear within the parentheses.


Example: In Doe's “Sample Story,” the protagonist embarks on a figurative journey into her childhood (41).

;
, Begin the citation with the last name of the story's author, followed by the first name. The title of the short story follows after that.Example: Doe, John. ""Sample Story.""

, If you found the short story in an anthology of works, you need to name and italicize the title of the anthology. Name the editor, as well.



Example: Doe, John. ""Sample Story."" A Collection of Stories. Ed. Jane Smith.
If the anthology was written and edited by the author of the short story, you do not need to include a reference to the editor.

, The citation should conclude with information about the publisher, including the publication city, the publisher's name, and the year in which the anthology was published (not the original publication date of the story).

Alternatively, list the author or authors in parentheses after the sentence.,
Include the page number in parentheses.",How to Cite a Textbook in MLA1," One way to cite a quotation, paraphrase, or other borrowed information in text is to introduce the author in the sentence. If the textbook was written by more than one author, list all the names. Only use the last name, unless there are two authors with the same last name. In that instance, include the first initial, as well.


According to Smith, that information is incorrect (12).
Johnson and Smith believe otherwise (74).
T. Doe and J. Doe explain things a different way (249).;
, If you do not introduce the author or authors in the sentence, you must include the last name or names in the parentheses.


Studies suggest otherwise (Smith 12).
Some scholars suggest other alternatives (Johnson and Smith 74).
Matters can also be explained in another way (T. Doe and J. Doe 249).

, Regardless of where you specify the author or authors, the page numbers from which the information came should be specified in parentheses after the information. If including the author's name in parentheses, do not separate the name and page number with any punctuation.


Erikson believes these rumors to be true (89-92).
Some scholars doubt these rumors (Keller and Orion 110).

, You can usually find this information on the copyright page in the beginning of a book or anthology. Place a colon after the city.


Example: “New York:”

, This will go right after the city and colon. Properly capitalize the name of the publisher. You can find the name of the publisher in a few places, but most likely on the copyright page of the book.


Example: “New York: Penguin,”

, Place a period after this number. This will come after the publisher and comma.


Example: “New York, Penguin, 1990.”

, Use a dash to indicate a block of page numbers. Place a period after these numbers. If you are citing a single play published by itself rather than as part of an anthology, you can skip this step.


Example: “105-120.”

, In most cases, it will be ""Print,"" but it may also be ""Web."" If you are citing a web-based source, including an eBook, make sure you add a date of access after the medium. This would be the date you accessed the online material. Write the date of access in the format of date, month, year.


Example for print: “Print.”
Example for web: “Web. 15 Apr. 2014.”
If you accessed the web material from a database, put the name of the database after the year of publication in italics. Example: “New York: Penguin, 1990. Academic Search. Web. 15 Apr. 2014.”

, You will need to cite the act, scene, and line numbers for the piece of the text you’re incorporating into your paper. Following the quote, you would put the in-text citation in parenthesis in this format: (act.scene.lines). For example, if you are quoting a line from act 2, scene 5, lines 1-4, the in-text citation would look like this: (2.5.1-4).Some instructors might want you to use Roman numerals instead of arabic in your in-text citations to represent the act and scene numbers. If they want you to use Roman numerals, the in-text citation would look like this: (II.v.1-4)., If your quote is longer than 3 lines, you will need to block it, which requires an indent of one extra inch from the left margin. The name of the speaker should have this extra inch indent, and subsequent lines of dialogue should be an inch and a quarter. Write character names in full capital letters.Just like when quoting a regular piece of prose in MLA style, long quotes need to be blocked in a similar fashion. Use the ruler at the top of your word processor to slide the margins where you need them to be.

, Make sure to detail the publication type: print, audio, video, etc.


“Bruno, Jessica. Feeding Hedgehogs. Fayetteville, Arkansas: Catfish Publications, 1995. Print.”

, To reference the citation in your paper, use parenthesis at the end of the sentence you’re paraphrasing.


Put the author and the page number in the parenthesis: “Hedgehogs mainly consume insects (Bruno 22).
For a source within a source, the reference page citation will stay the same. That is, if Bruno paraphrases Jeff Jones as saying hedgehogs don’t eat much vegetation, then you make a citation for Bruno on the reference page and change the in-text citation: “Hedgehogs don’t eat much vegetation (Jones cited in Bruno 22).”

New York University Press., Gather the following information and prepare it in this order: author(s) name, date of publication, article title, name of journal or periodical, volume number, and the page numbers you are referencing.


For example: Gill, Smith, Percy (June 8, 1992). Growing Concerns in Adolescent Drug Abuse. Psychology Quarterly, 21, 153-157., Websites can be difficult because often they lack all the necessary information for an accurate citation, such as the author or publication date.

For example: Alexander, 2012. Tips for Healthy Relationships. http://www.psychologywebsitehere.com/tipsforhealthyrelationships., In-text citations are required by APA format and are used to cite a source within your writing. They must be given at the end of the sentence which uses information from the cited source, and before the period at the sentence. Place in-text citations in parentheses, and include the author name and the date of publication. If you don’t have either of these, use the title of the work you are citing.


If you don’t reference the author in your sentence, end the sentence with (Jones, 2001).

, When directly quoting the text of the work, you should also include the page number on which you found the quote after the publication dates.The page number should always stay within the parentheses, regardless of whether the author and dates appear there or within the sentence.


Example: In “Sample Story,” the protagonist looks through “numerous photo albums, glimpsing at her past,” before embarking on a figurative journey into her childhood (Doe, 2010/2015, p. 41).

Indicate the lines of the poem you are using in a parenthetical citation.,
Use a hyphen or a dash to indicate the first and last lines that were cited.",How to Cite a Poem2,"

, It should be set apart.

, The entire blockquote should be aligned at the second indentation within the body of your work. This will continue to provide a separate feel to your blockquote.

, You will not use backslashes. Instead, you will mirror the lines of the poem you cite.

, For example, if you cite several consecutive lines of Barrett Browning's poem, after your blockquote you would put: (7-11) without punctuation.

Say the name of the poem and the author before you read it or quote a few liens from it.,
Read the poem or the quote from the poem first, and then give the attribution.,

Notice most of the periods are replaced with commas and the publication info is put in parenthesis. You also add the page number where you found the information to the end.
To use a source that was quoted in another source, leave the end reference the same.
However, you will change the in-text citation to include both reference sources: “Joe Jones, Hedgehog Food (Conway, Arkansas: Small Books Press, 1994), 45, quoted in Jess Bruno, Feeding Hedgehogs (Fayetteville, Arkansas: Catfish Publications, 1995), 22.”

"
Use paraphrasing to incorporate research into your own writing.,
Use a thesaurus to improve your paraphrasing.,
Make sure to change the structure of the sentences to paraphrase properly.",How to Cite a Paraphrased Statement4," Paraphrasing is just putting something in your own words. When you are writing a research paper, you will paraphrase research the majority of the time.


The only time you want to use a quote is when something is said in a unique way. If the original author said, “Veggies are green,” that isn’t a particularly unique way of saying it; you can easily rewrite it.
However, if the author said, “The vegetation is such a succulent green that the sunlight dances off of its leaves,” that is a more unique way of saying it; in that case, you may want to quote the author by placing quotations around the phrase and using the text word-for-word.

, When you paraphrase, use a thesaurus to help you pick out new words if you can’t think of ones on your own.


Just make sure that the word you choose has the same connotation as the original.
Connotation is the feeling or emotional punch a word has, beyond the dictionary definition.

, Paraphrasing isn’t just changing the words, it also means changing the structure.


Therefore, you can’t just take a phrase like “The cat likes to lick ice cream” and replace it with “The feline loves to lap ice cream.”
Rather, you need to structurally change it: “Because the cat enjoys ice cream, he was lapping it up.”

Use parenthesis to make an in-text citation at the end of the sentence.",How to Cite a Dictionary Meaning in MLA," Only use one set of double quotation marks around the term.For example: “Charming.”;
, So, it would look like: “Charming” John’s Dictionary.

, The edition will be included on the back side of the book’s title page. If you are using a first edition, it is not necessary to include the edition number as it would be redundant.


For example: “Charming” John’s Dictionary. 4th ed.

, This information will be on the back of the book’s title page.


For example: “Charming.” John’s Dictionary. 4th ed. 2002.
Entries in a dictionary do not have specified author so you do not need to provide this information in your citation., It is important to specify if you accessed a print source, rather than a web source.


Your citation should look like this: “Charming.” John’s Dictionary. 4th ed. 2002. Print.

, You will add in-text citations to end of the sentence you are citing.


For example: “The word “charming” means very pleasing or appealing (“Charming”)
Because dictionaries are always organized alphabetically, you do not need to list the page number where you found the definition.,, You should also add a period after the website name.


For example: “Charming.” Merriam-Webster.


, Put a period after the date.


For example: “Charming.” Merriam-Webster. 2014.

, In this case, it would be the web. Be sure to capitalize the word “web,” and add a period.


For example: “Charming.” Merriam-Webster. 2014. Web.

, You can use your web history to determine the exact date.


For example: “Charming.” Merriam-Webster. 2014. Web. 11 November 2014.

"
"
Read any introductory material that accompanies the document.,
Summarize.,
Ask questions.,
Make connections.,
Make inferences.,
Write down anything else you thought of while reading the document.,
Write down any immediately apparent biases you see.,
Compare the primary source to secondary sources.,
Think about who the author is.,
Consider the author’s purpose and intended audience.,
Consider when the source was written.,
Analyze the overall reliability.,
Think about how a scholar might use this source.,
Write or speak about the source.",How to Analyze a Primary Source," If you have found a primary source in an archive or online, there may be a short summary of the document set. If you are reading a primary source that your teacher or professor gave you, there may be a paragraph of introductory material. If there is no introductory material at all, pay close attention to the title, author, and date.


For example, if your textbook contains a diary entry from a Southern slaveholder written in 1840, perhaps the introductory material tells you how many slaves he held or where his plantation was.;
, Primary sources are often very dense, and many are full of jargon. Sometimes, especially if you are working with an older document, you will run into words and phrases that are unfamiliar to you. Summarizing as you read will help you keep track of what the document is saying. Jot down a short 5-10 word summary at the end of every paragraph or at least every section (if it’s a longer text). Maybe the slaveholder’s diary begins with a paragraph all about the crops he is planning to plant this year. Your summary could simply say, “Crops = tobacco, wheat, corn.”

Bullet points, keywords, and lists are a great way to do this.
Re-copying lengthy text directly into the margins is probably not that helpful.
Consider a quick sketch in lieu of a written summary. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy. Venn diagrams, charts, stick figures, etc. are great.



, If something doesn’t make sense, write down your question about it. If an element of the text leaves you wanting to know more, write down your question about it. If you come to a section in the slaveholder’s diary about one of his slaves falling ill, you might write, “Who is in charge of health on this plantation? Slaves? Or the wife of the slaveholder?”

, It’s important to put the document in the context of other things you know. You can try to make connections to other texts, lectures (especially if you’re analyzing the source for a class), your own life, or current events.


Perhaps you saw the movie, Twelve Years a Slave. The slaveholder’s diary reminds you of a scene from the movie. Jot down the title of the movie and perhaps a short description of the scene.

, Texts always have implied meanings. Read “between the lines” and write down your speculations and conclusions. If the slaveholder’s diary included a paragraph about his son and daughter, and how he worries about his daughter finding a husband but is happy that he will be able to provide for his son, you might infer that his son will inherit the plantation. In the margins, make a note of your inference: “Son will probably inherit from father.”

, Remember that there is really no wrong way to annotate. The idea is to get all of your thoughts and questions about a document down on paper.

, Biases are prejudices for or against people or things. Every primary source has an element of bias to it. Literally no source ever created has NO bias. If the author is making sweeping generalizations about a group of people, you should note that they appear to have a bias for or against this group. If you don’t notice any biases immediately, move on. They may be tricky to find at first. For example, if the slaveholder notes in his diary that “all African slaves” look, feel, or behave a certain way, you should note the racial bias in the source. Then you should look carefully for other elements of racial bias.

Finding bias doesn’t mean that you will need to throw out the source and not use it. Instead, it means that you will need to think critically about what this source tells you about its creator.



, Think about what you have read textbooks or heard in lectures on topics related to your primary source. Ask yourself, “What, if anything, seems untrue/unlikely/unclear/unbelievable about this source?” and “How does this compare with what I know from other sources? Does it support those sources or contradict them?”


Perhaps an entry in the slaveholder’s diary mentions that all of his slaves are in good health are rarely ever ill. Check your textbook and lecture notes to learn about the healthcare provided to slaves on antebellum plantations. Does his entry seem accurate? Could he be an exception to the rule, or does he have some reason to write untrue statements? , Consider their gender, race, class, career, location, etc. Do any of these factors make you feel skeptical about the trustworthiness of the source?


For example, a white Southern slaveholder writing about his slaves in 1840 was likely writing with some element of racism and racial bias. As an elite male, he would also have a class and gender bias. Keep these biases in mind as you read. Even if you determine that what the slaveholder says about his slaves is not reliable information, you can still learn about the slaveholder himself based on what he writes.

, Especially think about their motives and whether that might have influenced what they wrote.


Maybe you learned in class that, in the 1800s, diaries had a different purpose than they do today. Rather than a record of private thoughts, they were written for public consumption after the death of the author. With that in mind, you might consider that the slaveholder wanted to paint a rosy picture in his diary. Ask yourself

Who created the source and why?
Was it created through a spur-of-the-moment act, a routine transaction, or a thoughtful, deliberate process?
Does the creator of the source speak for a larger group of people or just for themself?
Did the creator wish to inform or persuade others? (Look closely the words in the source. The word choices may tell you whether the creator was trying to be objective or persuasive.)
Did the creator have reasons to be honest or dishonest?
Was the source meant to be public or private?, Sometimes, if a primary source was created even a little while after an event occurred, a person looking back on the event will have a different perspective than they would have had they created a source during an event.


An entry in a slaveholder’s diary about what he did yesterday is likely to be more factually accurate than an entry reminiscing about his childhood.

, Remember that even if you determine that an author probably had reason to be untruthful, the source may still be useful.


For example, though you may not learn true facts about the lives of Southern slaves by reading an 1840 diary of a slaveholder, you can learn about racial biases (of white slaveholders) in 1840.

, What kind of research/topics would it be helpful for? What might a scholar have to be careful about if they were using this source?A slaveholder’s diary would be very useful to someone writing about the ideas and ideals of 19th century Southern gentry. It might even be useful to someone tracing the history of slavewomen’s participation in plantation healthcare, but a person studying that topic would have to be very careful to note and account for the slaveholder’s biases.

, Whether you were analyzing a primary source for a class discussion, an essay, or for your own personal use, you can use what you learned about the reliability of the source to write or speak about it in a more informed way. As you write or speak, note the possible biases and discuss how the source may still be useful.


You might write, ”Though some Southern slaveholders claimed that their workforce was always in good health, diary entries from some plantation owners indicate that contagious diseases frequently ran rampant through slave quarters.”

Understand what plagiarism is.,
Be familiar in the area that you are talking about.,
Restate the subject to yourself a couple of times.,
Reference your quotes and sources.,
When in doubt, give credit.,
Understand some basics about copyright.,
Understand what doesn't need to be cited.",How to Avoid Plagiarism," The American Heritage dictionary defines plagiarism as: ""the unauthorized use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one's own original work.""Thus plagiarism not only includes the word-for-word copying of another piece of work, but close imitation of it also. Using synonyms and other word choices is not an excuse to justify plagiarism. You should write a piece of text strictly in your own words and then cite your sources. You can help yourself write a good paraphrase that is not too close to the original by thinking of the paraphrase more as your interpretation or reflection on what you read, rather than a re-wording of what you read.



Original source: ""The law of the land prohibited slaves from seeking remuneration from their masters for even the most heinous crimes.""

Plagiarizing: ""The law of the land forbade slaves from seeking damages from their masters for even the most vile crimes.""

Not plagiarizing: ""Even injured, tortured, or taunted slaves could not press for remuneration from their masters according to United States law at the time. (Jefferson, 157)""


Plagiarism also applies to:Downloading a paper from the internet.
Hiring someone to write something for you.
Attempting to make the ideas of others appear like they are your own.

;
, By understanding the subject, you are more likely to write in your own words, rather than restate someone else's definition of this subject. Look for information on the topic you want to write about. This can be on the Internet or in books, although books are almost always more authoritative than the Internet.


The trick here is to grab several different sources of information. If you're relying on just one source — a book about slavery — the chances are higher you'll inadvertently copy or plagiarize. If you rely on three books about slavery, one documentary, and two original sources, the chances are much lower that you'll inadvertently plagiarize.

, The key is to understand the material and be able to express its meaning in your own words. Try to avoid reading from another author's material too much, as you will be more inclined to restate that author's exact statement.



Original source: ""Slaves worked grueling 12-hour days, from sun-up to sun-down, surviving on little more than 1,200 calories of starches and their own blood, sweat, and tears.""

Reworked: ""Surviving on about half of what we today consider the suggested caloric intake, slaves in the 19th century worked bitter, back-breaking hours. (Jefferson, 88)""

Reworked: ""In the 19th century, slaves worked for as long as there was light, receiving little in the way of nutrition. (Jefferson, 88)""



, You must include a bibliography or works cited in your paper. If you use a direct quote from another author's work, then you must quote it and cite it properly. Many teachers accept the standard MLA format, unless otherwise specified.


You can avoid inadvertent plagiarism by inserting quotation marks (if an actual quote is used) and citing your source immediately when you make a quote or a paraphrase from that source. If you wait to do so, or if you leave inserting quotation marks and citations as the last step in writing your paper, you might forget a quotation or a citation and get in trouble for plagiarism.

, There are a lot of ways to do this in order to avoid plagiarism. Here are a few:


Mention the source inside your paraphrase: ""According to Richard Feynman, quantum electrodynamics can be described using path integral formulations.""
Put quotation marks around unique phrases you think could be interpreted as being copied: ""A 'paradigm shift' happens when one scientific revolution forces the community to think of the world in a fundamentally different way.""

, Plagiarism can be more than a bad academic practice, it can be a violation of the law if you break copyright. Here is what you need to understand to stay legal:


As a general rule, facts cannot be copyrighted. This means that you are able to use any facts you find to support your writing.Although facts are not subject to copyright, the words used to express them are, particularly if the wording is original or unique (copyright covers original expression). You are free to use information from other materials in your articles, but you must use your own words to express it. To avoid this, you can take the existing facts and put them into your own words. There is a grace on how different the phrase can be; adding a comma is not enough. However, changing the grammar around is., Not every single thing in academic research needs to be cited, or else research would be too painful for people to undertake. The following things don't need to be cited in your research and final papers:


Common sense observations, folklore, urban legends, and well known historical events, such as the date of the Pearl Harbor Attacks.
Your own experiences, insights, creations, and musings.

However, if you used these same experiences, insights, creations, or musings in a previous assignment that you submitted academically, or got published, you would need to first obtain your instructor's permission to re-use the material and, if you receive permission, include a self-citation.


Your own videos, presentations, music, and other media created and originated by you.

However, if you used these same videos, presentations, music, or other media created and originated by you in a previous assignment that you submitted academically, or got published, you would need to first obtain your instructor's permission to re-use the material and, if you receive permission, include a self-citation.

Familiarize yourself with the accepted citation styles.",How to Cite a Book2," Use only one style when citing a book reference—each style has very specific rules about capitalization, punctuation and placement of the facts. That said, all styles are designed for the same purpose: to give proper credit where credit is due. Listed below are the most common styles:


Modern Language Association (MLA) style. This is a citation style most often used within the liberal arts and humanities departments of universities.
American Psychological Association (APA) style. This citation style is most often used within the social sciences departments of universities and is always used when writing for the American Psychological Association.
The Chicago Manual of Style. This citation style is often used for writing papers in literature, history and the arts. However, the majority of scholars use either APA or MLA style for citations.

"
Cite book references within the text and on the reference page.",How to Cite a Book3," The APA (American Psychological Association) requires book citations to occur in both places. For example, if you were citing the book, The Epic of America, you would reference it within your text with the title (italicized) and the year of publication: The Epic of America, (1931). You would also properly cite the book on your reference page with the specific formatting rules for citing authors, editors and books:

,

, The quotation or phrase you use in the text of your paper has to appear first on the left-hand margin of the corresponding entry on your Works Cited Page.

, The MLA format follows the author-page method of in-text citation. Only the author of the book, and the page number or numbers that refer to your quote or paraphrased passage must be in your text, but your in-text citation must also be completely referenced on your Works Cited page.


Kingsolver stated that his prose was considered by many to be ""at times, pedantic"" (Kingsolver 125). This informs your reader that the remarks by the author named Kingsolver can be found on page 125. Your readers can find the name of the book and other pertinent details on your Works Cited page, which will cite the corresponding reference to this in-text citation:
Kingsolver, Ronald. Give Me a Moment. New York: Random House, 1932. Print.

, Again, page numbers are required, but it is important to provide detailed information about the edition of the book you are quoting, since someone reading your paper will need to know which edition to refer to. (This rule almost always applies to classic and literary works.)


The corresponding reference on your Works Cited page (for a work that has two or more editions) must include the page number of the edition you quoted from followed by a semicolon, and the the volume, part, chapter, section or paragraph. Use the required abbreviations without capitals:
Volume (vol.)
Book (bk.)
Part (pt)
Chapter (ch.)
Section (sec.)
Paragraph (par.)

, If you are citing a book that has more than 1 author, you must include the names of all authors in your citation:

, If you use quotes from 2 or more books by the same author, you must reference each book in your text and on your Works Cited page:


Lipton states that daily writing practice is “critical to a writer’s success” (Practice, Practice, Practice! 5). However, Lipton also states that “one must sometimes walk away and do anything but write for a week at a time” (A Writer’s Advice 7). These citations inform the reader that quotes are being used from 2 different books by the same author.

, If you quote from different volumes of a multi-volume work, you must include the volume number in your citation. That number is followed by a colon, a space and the page number(s):


…as Tangener wrote in A History of the Universe (1: 87-101). This tells the reader that the quote can be found in volume 1 between pages 87 and 101.

You will need this information to create a proper ASA in-text citation.For our example, let’s say our author’s last name is Brooks.;
, Paraphrasing means to put an idea taken from a source into your own words. ASA citations require that you put the citation information in parentheses. Let’s say that are example paraphrased sentence is:

, It should be on the front or back of the title page. Add this date after the author’s last name, placing a space between the two.Let’s say our book was published in 2003. This means our example would be:


“Bookshelves are the best for holding books (Brooks 2003.” Note that there is a space between the author’s last name and the date, but no comma (commas are sometimes used in other in-text citations).

, While this is not always required, it is generally best to add the page number that you found your quote on. This will both help you refer back to where you found the quote, and will validate your citation.Let’s say you found your example quote on page 27:

The proper way to create an entry on a reference list is described in the following steps.

, While you only use the author’s last name in your in-text citation, you use his or her full name in your reference list citation. Include the first and middle names or initials. You should be able to find the author’s full name on either the cover or title page of the book. Let’s say our author’s name is Kelly D. Brooks:


The citation up to this point would look like this one: “Brooks, Kelly D.”
Keep in mind that even if you end on a first name (not an initial), you will follow the name with a period. For example, if the author’s name was Kelly Darla Brooks, your citation would end in a period like this: “Brooks, Kelly Darla.”

, Again, this date should be found on the front or back of the title page.You should place a period after the date as you did with the author’s name. Your example would look like this:


“Brooks, Kelly D. 2003.”

, The title can be found on the cover or title page. Don’t forget to include the subtitle (separated out with a colon) if the book has one. Use title case with title, meaning you should capitalize all important words (but not prepositions, conjunctions, or articles unless they begin or end the title). Also, use italics for the title.Let’s say the title of our book is “Book Storage 101” and our subtitle is “The Books We Love and How to Keep Them.”:


“Brooks, Kelly D. 2003. Book Storage 101: The Books We Love and How to Keep Them.” Use a space after the colon in the middle, and end the title with a period.

, This is generally found on the back side of the title page.Use the city and state, especially if the city isn’t a major one like New York or Washington, D.C. Let’s say that your example book was published in Fort Worth, TX. Use a space, then add the place of publication with a colon after it:


“Brooks, Kelly D. 2003. Book Storage 101: The Books We Love and How to Keep Them. Fort Worth, TX:”

, This should either be found on the front or back of the title page (and sometimes can be found on both).Let’s say your example book was published by Cowboy Hat Press; you’ll add a space, the publishing company, and a period to complete the citation:


“Brooks, Kelly D. 2003. Book Storage 101: The Books We Love and How to Keep Them. Fort Worth, TX: Cowboy Hat Press.”

Understand academic standards.Scholarly writers are held to a higher standard of rigor than casual writers and even some branches of journalism.,
Consider the author’s scholarly reputation.Within each field, there are a handful of scholarly thinkers considered the giants of the discipline.,
Focus on scholarly, peer-reviewed sources.These sources should be your first avenue of research when undertaking an academic project.,
Use discretion with all websites.,
Avoid self-published material at all costs.,
Distinguish between scholarly and non-scholarly books.,
Avoid using textbooks except for background information.,
Consider the timeliness of the source.,
Use unacceptable sources and methods in an acceptable way.,
Seek a second opinion.",How to Evaluate the Credibility of a Source2," As such, you must hold your sources to a higher standard as well.


Citing information from an unreliable source makes academic audiences wary of your entire argument because it is based on information held to a lower level of integrity.
Academics have a long memory; too many transgressions into the land of unreliable sources, and you’ll be a marked writer with a marred reputation.

, For example in literary theory, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucalt are three towering figures whose work provides the bedrock of the discipline; citing them would go a long way toward establishing your credibility as a scholar within the field.


This is not to say that less-established scholars’ work is not credible. Sometimes, citing a scholar who goes against the tide of established thinking provides you with ammunition for a compelling devil’s advocate argument.
In academia, these types of arguments are sometimes more valued than those based on the writings of famous thinkers because they suggest you have the ability to question accepted thinking and push the boundaries of the discipline.
Be aware of any credibility scandals that may have befallen even well-established academics. For example, critical theorist Slavoj Žižek’s reputation and credibility has been significantly damaged after a 2014 accusation of plagiarism., They have the highest possible level of credibility, and you can always feel safe using them. There are two elements to unpack for this designation: “scholarly” and “peer-reviewed.”


Scholarly sources are written by experts in a particular discipline for other experts in their field. They are written to inform, not entertain, and assume a high level of previous knowledge because they are written specifically to people who have a vested professional interest in technical information relevant to their specialization.
Peer-reviewed articles are not only written by experts, but are also read and evaluated by a panel of peers — other experts in the field. This panel of experts determines whether or not the sources used in the article were credible, whether the methodologies used in studies are scientifically sound, and render a professional opinion as to whether or not an article meets the academic standard of integrity. Only then will an article be published in a scholarly, peer-reviewed journal.
Almost all peer-reviewed journals require a subscription fee. However, if you have an active .edu email account from a university where you either attend or work, you can make use of the library’s subscriptions to databases to access these journals.
Using the library website’s database search engine, use the advanced search to restrict your search results to “peer-reviewed” sources.

, If you are using any online source other than a scholarly university database, you should exercise caution because anyone can publish their thoughts on the internet, regardless of the merit of those thoughts.


As a general rule, all .gov websites are credible because they have the weight of governmental institutions behind them.
Websites that end in .com and .org are sometimes credible, but sometimes not. In these cases, you need to look at the institution or organization that is producing the information. A private individual does not have the credibility needed for academic work; however, a large, established organization like the American Medical Association or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do.
There are large, famous organizations that are still known to have biases. For example, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals will provide only that information which supports their cause, whereas the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services might provide the same family of information without agenda bias.
Websites that end in .edu also fall into the category of “sometimes credible.” Individual faculty often provide course websites that include information pertinent to classes they teach. These sites may include lecture materials and interpretation of sources. While faculty at a university are reputable, this information does not go through the “peer-review” process discussed earlier. As such, you should be more cautious with it.
If at all possible, look for that same information from a peer-reviewed source, rather than a professor’s personal .edu source.

, If an author is unable to convince a publisher to house their ideas, it’s likely because their ideas carry little weight. Never cite an author who self-published their work.

, If an author has had their manuscript accepted for publication, that means that someone has deemed their ideas worthy of discussion. However, there is a significant and important difference between books published for scholarly and non-scholarly purposes.


Scholarly books are written with the sole purpose of informing; they offer new ideas, criticize old ones, and present new data or theories relevant to an audience of academic scholars. Non-scholarly books might deal with scholarly subject matter — sociology, for example, or politics. However, they are written to entertain a lay audience, not to inform a scholarly audience.
Scholarly books are often published by university presses (Amherst College Press) and professional associations (American Historical Association), whereas non-scholarly articles are published by commercial publishers (Houghton Mifflin).Scholarly books will provide an extensive list of references to bolster their academic credibility, whereas non-scholarly books often make claims without any credible referential support.

, Textbooks are wonderful teaching aids; they condense technical information into easily understandable language for students who are learning that material for the first time. However, they include only that information that is accepted by consensus within a field. As such, you should not rely on such obvious (to academics in the field) information to create the main thrust of your academic argument.


Use information from a textbook only for the background information necessary to build the foundation for your more innovative argument.

, Scholarship is a continually evolving body of knowledge, and information that is once groundbreaking may be proven incorrect or outdated within a few years or even months. Always check the date of publication for a source before making a decision about whether or not it is reliable information for your project.


For example, as recently as the 1960s, most scholarly linguists believed African American Vernacular English to be a deficient, broken form of standard American English reflective of African Americans’ lack of cognitive abilities. By the 1980s and 90s, the majority of linguists had come to embrace African American Vernacular English as a distinct dialectical variation of American English with its own patterned grammatical structures and diction.The entire line of thinking reversed itself within a couple decades.

, So far, we have discussed many types of sources that are unacceptable for scholarly writing: many websites, non scholarly books, etc. However, there are ways to use those types of sources to your benefit without citing them.


Students are always told, “Never use Wikipedia.” That’s true — you should never cite Wikipedia for multiple reasons: it’s written anonymously, so you can’t know the credibility of the author, and it’s continually updated, so it’s not a stable source.
However, if you find information that you find useful, that information may be cited in a more reputable footnote. If the cited source meets the other standards for credibility, read that source and cite it. Use Wikipedia as a starting point that points you toward better sources.
Do the same for any other websites that don’t meet the high standard for academic integrity.
If you cannot find that information corroborated in scholarly sources, that’s a red flag that the information is not trustworthy, and you should not include it in your argument.

, If you are belong to a college community in some way — as student, faculty, staff, or alumnus — check with the English department to see if you have access to a university writing studio. The staff at the writing studio will be able to provide you with a professional opinion on the credibility of a given source. If you are a student, show the source to your professor and ask for their advice in evaluating it.


Always seek your second opinion ahead of the deadline for your project. If one or more of your sources proves problematic, you will find yourself deleting sections of your paper and scrambling for new sources at the last second.

Evaluate consistency.,
Investigate the financial or funding sources for sponsored research.",How to Evaluate the Credibility of a Source3," Generally, the more time and money that is invested into the creation and publishing of the material, the more likely you are to find reliable information. A poorly designed website or pamphlet, or a site that is covered in unsightly advertisements and pop-ups, is not likely to provide information from an individual or organization invested in preserving their reputation or image.


Look for high-end, professional finishes to websites and print publications.
Note that this does not mean that all information found in well-packaged sources is credible. Templates for well-designed websites are inexpensive and easily available.

, A source is more credible if written by someone with a degree or other credentials in the subject of interest. If no author or organization is named, the source should not be considered highly credible. However, if the author is presenting original work, evaluate the merit of the ideas, not the credentials. Credentials have never guaranteed innovation and the history of science tells us that the big advances in sciences tend to come from outsiders, not the establishment. Some questions that you should ask about the author are:Where does the author work?
If the author is affiliated with a reputable institution or organization, what are its values and goals? Do they benefit financially by promoting a particular view?
What is his or her educational background?
What other works has the author published?
What experience does the author have? Is s/he an innovator, or a follower and promoter of the status quo?
Has this author been cited as a source by other scholars or experts in the field?
In the case of an anonymous author, you can check who published the website with http://whois.domaintools.com. It will tell you who registered the domain name and when, how many other domains they have, an email address to reach the person or organization as well as the mailing address.

, Find out when the source was published or revised. In some subject areas, such as the sciences, having current sources is essential; but in other fields, like the humanities, including older material is critical. It's also possible that you're looking at an older version of the source, and an updated one has since been published. Check with a scholarly database for academic sources (or an online bookstore for popular sources) to see if a more recent version is available. If so, not only should you find it, but you can also feel more confident about the source — the more printings or editions, the more reliable the information.

, The institution housing the information can often tell you a great deal about how credible that information is. For example, you should feel more comfortable trusting information found in The New York Times or The Washington Post — two newspapers with proven track records of journalistic integrity and public retraction of errors — than that found in a source like Infowars, which has a wide readership, but often publishes misleading or blatantly incorrect information., Scan the document in question for tone, depth, and breadth before absorbing the information in it. Are those three elements appropriate for your project?Using a source that is too specialized and technical for your needs may lead you to misinterpret the information given, which is just as hurtful to your own credibility as using an unreliable source.

, You should make use of resources like Book Review Index, Book Review Digest, and Periodical Abstracts to determine how and why others have criticized the source. If there is significant controversy surrounding the validity of the source, you may wish to avoid using it, or examine it further with a skeptical eye.

, Citing other reliable sources is a sign of credibility. It is, however, sometimes necessary to verify that the other sources also show a pattern of credibility and are used in context.

, If the source's author is known to be emotionally or financially connected with the subject, be aware that the source may not fairly represent all views. Sometimes research is necessary to determine relationships that indicate the possibility of bias; look up the author and the publishing institution to see if they have been accused of biased work in the past.


Be conscious of wording that indicates judgment. Conclusions that describe something as ""bad or good"" or ""right or wrong"" should be examined critically. It is more appropriate to compare something to an objective standard than to label it with words that represent abstract concepts — for example, ""...these and other illegal acts..."" is preferable to ""...these and other despicable acts...""
The former describes the acts in terms of the law (an objective source, somewhat) whereas the first example judges the actions according to the author's own belief of what is a despicable act.

, Sources that apply different standards to those who agree and disagree with them are suspect. If your source praises one politician for ""changing to meet the needs of his constituency"" but criticizes an opposing politician for ""changing his position with opinion polls,"" then it is likely that the source is biased.

, Determine the sources of funding for the work to get an idea of the potential influences on it. Various sources of funding can sway the information presented or the way a study is conducted in order to align with their own agendas.


For example, the BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) banned all tobacco research funded by tobacco companies in 2013 because they determined that the special interests of the research funders would lead to biased, unreliable conclusions."
,How to Cite Sources2,
"
Gather your information about each source.,
Books.,
Journal articles.,
Magazine articles.,
Newspaper articles.,
Websites.,
Government documents.,
Letters and interviews.",How to Cite Sources3," First you need to find out what kind of information you'll need from each type of source. If you're using a strict format that requires the copyright year of each book you refer to, it can be a pain to go through all of your research without knowing this, then have to go back, find all the books at the library, and determine the copyright date. Generally, it's better to record more information than less, just in case.

, Collect the full names of all authors, title of the book, city of publication, publisher's name, and the year of publication. If the book is published by an organization and the individual authors aren't listed, write down the full name of the organization. For electronic books, also record the URL and date of access.


Encyclopedias and dictionaries - Also get the full name of the author who wrote the entry (if it is given), the entry title, the number of volumes in the set, and the edition. Write down the volume you're using and the page numbers, unless the content is organized alphabetically.
Anthologies and collections - Note the author and the title of individual work you're citing (poem, play, short story, etc.), the full names of any editors and compilers, and the page number(s). If the work was previously published in another book, record the information for the original source as described above.

, Collect the journal title, article title, author name(s), volume and issue number of the journal, date of publication, and page numbers of the article. If it is an online journal, also record the page or paragraph numbers (if applicable), URL, and the date you accessed the site. If you are accessing the article through a database, also record the database name.

, Collect the author(s) names, title of the article, title of the magazine, volume number (if applicable), date of publication, and page numbers. For online magazines, get the date of access and URL as well. If you access the magazine through a database, find the vendor/supplier of database, database name, accession number of article (if applicable), and the date of access.

, Collect the name of the author of the article, title of the article, name of the newspaper, date of publication, and the section, page and column location of the article. If the newspaper is online, get the URL and date of access, too. If you found the newspaper article in a database, write down the URL, date of access, database, and library through which article was accessed (name, city, and state).

, Get the author's name (if given), title of work, group responsible for the site (if applicable), date site was last updated, date of access, and URL. If you have trouble finding everything except the last two items, you might want to reconsider the validity of this source. For postings, also get the title of posting, post number (if numbered), date of posting, URL the post was made to, and URL of message archives.

, If published by the US government, get the issuing agency, title of the document, number of the Congress, session number of Congress, place of publication, date of publication, document number (if given), and SuDoc number.

, Collect the names of the author and recipient (or interviewer and interviewee), date written/conducted, name of collection, name of depository, and the depository's location.

Place a reference next to each statement that you've cited.,
Place an MLA reference.,
Use Turabian footnotes.,
Place an APA reference.,
Use the CSE Citation-Sequence.,
Use CSE Name-Year.,
Cite in Chicago Manual of Style.,
Use Legal/Blue Book format for citations in legal documents.",How to Cite Sources4," When you're writing your final paper, be sure to keep track of which source each cited statement came from. How you do so depends on which format you're using.

, Write author (last name) and page number in parentheses. If the author is already mentioned in the statement, just put the page number in parentheses. If there are two authors, name them both with ""and"" in the middle. Use commas if there are more than two authors. Place the citation before a punctuation mark.


E.g. Leaving the ground in sod increases the organic matter of the soil by 15% in 10 years (Alison 45).

, Add a superscript number at the end of the statement to denote which source it is referring to. Even if you refer to the same source multiple times, it gets a new superscript number every time. Start the superscript numbers from 1 every time you start a new page.


E.g. Leaving the ground in sod increases the organic matter of the soil by 15% in 10 years.1


, Write the author (last name or organization name) and year in parentheses. Use commas. Add ""p."" and a space before the page number if the statement is a direct quote. If the author is already mentioned in the statement, put the year in parentheses next to the name (and put the page number in parentheses at the end of the statement, if applicable). Place the citation before a punctuation mark. If there are two or three authors in parentheses, use ""&"" instead of ""and"".


E.g. Leaving the ground in sod increases the organic matter of the soil by 15% in 10 years (Alison, 1987).
E.g. Allison (1987) asserted that ""leaving the ground in sod increases the organic matter of the soil by 15% in 10 years"" (p. 45).

, Add a superscript number at the end of the statement to denote which source it is referring to. Unlike with the Turabian footnotes, there's only one superscript number for each source. It's possible to have superscript numbers on one page that are out of order if a source was cited on a previous page. You can also cite multiple sources at once by specifying a range, or using a comma. The citation can go in the sentence or at the end, after punctuation.


E.g. Leaving the ground in sod increases the organic matter of the soil by 15% in 10 years.3 As discussed earlier in this paper, the root system of the sod aerates the soil.1 Multiple studies suggest that this is a phenomenon observed in every soil type.8-12


, Write the author last name and publication year in parentheses. If the author is already mentioned in the statement, just put the year in parentheses. If there are two authors, name them both with ""and"" in the middle. Use commas only if there are more than two authors. Place the citation before a punctuation mark.


E.g. Leaving the ground in sod increases the organic matter of the soil by 15% in 10 years (Alison 1987).

, Chicago style usually lists author and then date. This style is recommended for natural and social sciences, as well as the other humanities.


Similar to MLA as described above.

, Depending on the type of work, may use in-line citations or footnotes/endnotes. The general format follows the form of case name or author and article name, followed by a comma, then Authority Name , followed by the date in parenthesis.


For example, Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803) (a case named Marbury v. Madison, found in the fifth volume of the reports of the U.S. Supreme Court, starting at page 137), 12 U.S.C. §3401 et seq. (a statute beginning at section 3401 of the 12th volume of the United States Code) and Warren and Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harvard L.R. 193 (1890) (a journal article from the fourth volume of the Harvard Law Review).

Assemble the list of works cited or references.,
Don't forget to put your sources in order!,
Make sure to include all of your sources in your bibliography.",How to Cite Sources5," This is what the reader will refer to when they see a citation and want to find out where you got the information. It usually goes at the end of the work (except when you use Turabian footnotes) and is sometimes referred to as a bibliography (when it includes sources that were not directly cited). The following links contain guidelines and examples for commonly used styles:


APA
Turabian
MLA

, For most formats, you will need to put your sources in alphabetical order.Don't forget!

, You do not want to be accused of plagiarism, especially if you are in college as this can get you kicked out.

Start your entry with the name of the author or authors.,
Add the title of the online article, next.,
Add the name of the publication in italics.,
Type the publication date with the format month, day, comma and year.,
Type in the page numbers, if applicable.,
Finish with the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), database name or URL.",How to Cite an Online Article2," Follow the format last name, first name, initial and a period (full stop).


If you are using a numbered list, the author's name should be written in opposite format: first name, initial and last name, with a period.
If there are 2 authors, place a comma and the word ""and"" between the names.

, Place it in quotation marks. Include a period inside the quotation marks.

, Place a comma after the name.


If you are citing from a scholarly journal, rather than a newspaper or magazine, type the volume number. Add the year of the journal in parenthesis, followed by a colon.

, For example, ""February 16, 2012."" Add a comma after the date.


Type in the edition, if it is a newspaper. For example, ""February 16, 2012, late edition.""

, Separate them with a dash.


Some professors prefer the addition of an access date, although it is not required by Chicago style. If requested, add the date the information was accessed, leading with the word ""Accessed."" For example, ""Accessed January 5, 2013.""

, If you can find the DOI, it is preferred, otherwise use the URL or library database name. When using the DOI, write ""doi"" then a colon and then the number.


If you can only find the URL, place a period after the full URL to finish your entry. If you use the name of a database, capitalize it and place a period after it.

, Place a period after the parenthesis.

, Do not use quotation marks, italics or capitals. Place a period after the full title.

, Add a comma, then the volume number. Add the issue number in parenthesis, if applicable, followed by a period.

Make sure MLA is the correct style for your document.,
Be able to recognize the two components of citation.,
Include the right information in the in-text citation.Every time you reference material in your paper, you must tell the reader the name of the author whose information you are citing.,
Learn when in-text citations are necessary.Every single source that contains information you used must be included in your Works Cited and cited in-text.,
Choose the appropriate in-text citation method.In-text citations are often parenthetical, meaning you add information to the end of a sentence in parentheses.,
Adjust in-text citations if you have multiple sources from an author.If you have two sources from ""James Smith,"" an in-text citation of (Smith 235) may confuse the reader.,
Include the first initial if you have authors with the same last name.Say you used information from essays by James Smith and Susan Smith.,
Format the citation in the Works Cited.Any information that gets cited in-text must have a corresponding citation in the Works Cited.,
Follow the format for an essay found in an anthology.You may have found your essay in an anthology along with other essays curated by an editor.,
Include different information for essays published in journals.,
Add electronic information for sources found in online databases.Many essays can be accessed through a school's online library databases.",How to Cite an Essay1," MLA is the formatting style of the Modern Language Association. It's used in humanities areas like English studies, comparative literature, foreign language and literature, or cultural studies.If you are writing for a class or to publish, check the teacher or publisher's preference for formatting style. Students should read assignment sheets and course syllabi. Writers seeking publication should check submission guidelines. If you still can't tell what style you should be using after reading the directions, contact the instructor or publisher.;
, When citing an essay, you include information in two places: in the body of your paper and in the Works Cited that comes after it. The Works Cited is just a bibliography: you list all the sources you used to write the paper. The citation information you include in the body of the paper itself is called the ""in-text citation."", You must include a page number that tells the reader where, in the source, they can find this information. The most basic structure for an in-text citation looks like this: (Smith 123).


In MLA, in-text citations always come at the end of the sentence. The period that would end the sentence comes after the parenthetical citation.

, The most obvious time to use an in-text citation is when you quote from a source directly or refer to it by title or author. However, you also need to use an in-text citation any time you use information that you got from a source, but which isn’t “common knowledge.”


This can be a tricky concept to master. If you can’t determine if information is common knowledge or proprietary (work that belongs to the original author), cite it anyways to be safe.
Failing to attribute information that is the product of someone else's work is plagiarism. The repercussions can be severe.
For example, it is common knowledge that World War II broke out in 1939. Nobody owns that information.
But specific strategies, quotes from important figures in the war, and statistics about how many people were involved in the war are all examples of specific, proprietary information. The author of the source you used to research that information had to do the work of finding that information out. You must attribute it to them.

, But if you include that necessary information in the language of the sentence itself, you should not include the parenthetical citation.


Correct: A recent study determined that Himalayan brown bears eat both plants and animals (Rathore and Chauhan 6652).
Correct: Rathore and Chauhan determined that Himalayan brown bears eat both plants and animals (6652).
Incorrect: Rathore and Chauhan determined that Himalayan brown bears eat both plants and animals (Rathore and Chauhan 6652). — You should not list the author(s) parenthetically if that information is in the sentence itself.

Plagiarism: A recent study determined that Himalayan brown bears eat both plants and animals. — The writer did not attribute proprietary information to the people who conducted the study.


, When they look up the source on your Works Cited sheet, they will find two different articles by James Smith. To avoid this confusion, you must include a shortened version of the essay's title, so the readers know which essay to look for.


Imagine that the two James Smith articles are titled ""Beloved and the Haunting Trauma"" and ""Writing What You Know."" You want to reference the first article in-text.
Correct: James argues that ""One of Sethe’s most deeply held beliefs in Beloved is the physical persistence of memory"" (""Beloved"" 235).
Correct: It could be argued that Sethe is haunted by ""the physical persistence of memory"" (Smith, ""Beloved"" 235).

, An in-text citation of (Smith 689) doesn't tell the reader which author provided the information. In that case, include the first initial of the author's last name in the in-text citation: (S. Smith 689).

, When the reader sees a quote or idea that they would like to know more about, they will look up the source author by the last name you listed in the in-text citation. They will also know which page of the source they should look at to find the information they want. Depending on where you found the essay, your citation will follow a different format.


Regardless of what format you follow, one thing remains constant across all citations. You always indent all lines that come after the first line of a Works Cited citation. This lets the reader know where one citation ends and the next one begins.
MLA also uses title case ever time a title is given. This means that first word and all major words are capitalized: The Sound and the Fury. This is distinguished from sentence case, in which only the first word is capitalized: The sound and the fury.

, In this case, you must include the following information in this exact order:


Lastname, First name. ""Title of Essay in Title Case.” Anthology in Title Case. Ed. Editor's Name(s). City of Publication: Publisher, Year of Publication. Page range. Print.
For example: Smith, Jane. ""An Essay about wikiHow."" wikiHow: The Collected Essays. Ed. Mark Jones. New York: wikiHow Publishers, 2015. 115-124. Print.

, If you found the article in an academic journal, you have a different set of information to include. Some of the information — like author name, essay title, and page range — stay the same. But you should follow this format exactly:


Author(s). ""Title of Article."" Title of Journal Volume.Issue (Year): pages. Medium of publication.
For example: Smith, Jane. ""An Essay about wikiHow."" The Journal of wikiHow 13.2 (2015): 115-124. Print.

, Examples include EBSCOHost, JSTOR, and Lexis-Nexis. These databases store electronic versions of print journals as PDFs. The article you're citing may have originally appeared in a print journal, but you accessed it online. You need to let the reader know how they, too, can access it online:


Last, First. ""Title of Article."" Title of Journal Volume.Issue (Year): pages. Database. Web. Date of Access.
The date of access is the date on which you found the essay. In MLA, all dates follow this format: Date Month Year. For example: 15 July 2015.
For example: Smith, Jane. ""An Essay about wikiHow."" The Journal of wikiHow 13.2 (2015): 115-124. JSTOR. 15 July 2015.

Follow the basic style of MLA formatting in print journals.,
Make it look like this.",How to Cite Journal Articles1," MLA is a consortium of teachers and scholars dedicated to promoting learning and establishing writing standards. Many scholars and academics choose MLA citations because of its ease and universality. Here's the format to follow when citing a print journal in MLA:



In the following order, include the author's name, the title of the article, the name of the journal (italicized), the series number/type of the journal (if applicable), the volume number (if applicable), the issue number (if applicable), the year of publication, and the page numbers of the article.;
, In practice, the above structure should lend itself to a citation that looks like this:


Last, First M., and First M. Last (if multiple authors). ""Article Title"" Journal Title. Series Volume. Issue (Year Published): Page(s). Print.

"
"
Start with the interviewee's last name, first name and initial.,
Type in the title of the interview, if given.,
Add the name of the interviewer, with the same name format of last name, first name and middle initial.,
Use the title of the journal, television broadcast or other medium in italics.,
Include the producers, if they are notable.,
Write the date of the edition, broadcast or periodical.,
Add the publication location.,
Write the name of the publisher, followed by a comma and the year it was published.,
Include the page numbers, if possible.",How to Cite an Interview1," Add a period (full stop) at the end.


Put the word ""Interview"" in place of the title, if there is not a title. Follow it with a period.;
, Place the title in quotation marks. Include a period before the end quotation mark.

, Add a period afterward.

, Add a comma and the edition name, if applicable. Add a comma at the end.


Use the abbreviation ""ed."" for edition.

, Use the last name, first name and initial format.

, This will be in month, day and year format. Use a period before the next information.

, Use a semi-colon.

, Add a period.

, Finish the entry with a period.


If limited information is available about the interview, reduce the citation to the information that is available.

"
"
Determine if APA is the right style for your document.,
Learn what information to include in-text.In MLA, you only needed to include the author's last name and the page number in-text.,
Distinguish in-text between multiple sources by the same author.In the Reference List, you will list multiple essays by the same author alphabetically by the first major word of the title.,
Add the first initial if you have authors with the same last name.Just as you would in MLA, you provide a little bit of information about the author's first name to clear up reader confusion.,
Format the citation in the Reference List.",How to Cite an Essay2," APA is the formatting style for the American Psychological Association, but it's used in the social sciences, business, and nursing as well.Just as you would for any paper, check assignment sheets and submission guidelines to make sure APA is appropriate.

, In APA, though, you must add a third element: the year in which the essay was published. A further difference from MLA is that you include the in-text citation wherever the cited information is. Whereas in MLA, the in-text citation always goes at the end of the sentence, in APA it can interrupt the sentence.


If you mention the author by name in the sentence, the year appears in parentheses immediately after it. For example: Morrow (1998) argues that ""quoted material"" (p. 54).
The page number always appears immediately after the quoted or referenced material appears. For example: Morrow (1998) argues that cats bring their owners dead squirrels out of spite (p. 54), though other research suggests the opposite.
If you don't name the author in the sentence, put all three pieces of information in the parenthetical citation. For example: It may be argued that cats bring their owners dead squirrels out of spite (Morrow, 1998, p. 54), but it seems unlikely.
The order of information in the parenthetical always goes Author, Year, Page #.

, The first essay will be considered ""a,"" the second ""b,"" and so on. Add this letter designation to the year in the in-text citation to show which essay you're discussing.


Imagine you have two essays by Morrow titled ""A White Christmas"" and ""Summer in the South."" You want to cite the ""Summer in the South"" essay.
The first major word of ""A White Christmas"" is ""white,"" so it comes after ""Summer in the South"" on the Reference List. You would list the year for ""Summer in the South"" as 2004a.
For example: Morrow argues that ""the heat contributes to the slowness of southern culture"" (2004a, p. 87), and it could well be true.

, Imagine that you have essays by Morgan Morrow and Timothy Morrow, but you want to cite Morgan's essay:


It could be argued that ""the heat contributes to the slowness of southern culture"" (M. Morrow, 2004a, p. 87).

, The Reference List is a bibliography, just like MLA’s Works Cited. The entries on this list also depend on where the essay appears or how it’s accessed.

Decide which kind of Chicago style formatting you should use.While APA and MLA are used by different types of disciplines, Chicago can be used by a wide range of writers.,
Place footnotes at the bottom of the page.When using the notes-bibliography system, you show that you want to cite a quote, idea, or other content by using a footnote.,
Put endnotes after the body of the paper.A second way to format the notes-bibliography system is to point the superscript notes in-text to a full bibliography at the end of the document.,
Format your notes properly.Notes are single-spaced, but you should skip lines between entries.,
Shorten the note for each source after the first usage.If you use a source on the first page of your paper, then again on the 10th, then again on the 14th, your notes will get bloated with repetitive information.,
Create a bibliography.The bibliography in this style is optional because all the sources are cited in notes already.,
Format the bibliography entries properly.Unlike the notes, information in the bibliography entries are separated by periods instead of commas.",How to Cite an Essay3," The catch is that there are actually two system of Chicago formatting.


The notes-bibliography system: used in the humanities (literature, history and the arts). It provides notes at the bottom of the page, and sometimes a full bibliography at the end of the text.
The author-date system: used the physical, natural, and social sciences. It provides parenthetical in-text citations that include the author and date of publication, as well as a bibliography.

, At the end of the sentence that contains the borrowed material, place a number in superscript. The first source cited on the page is “1,” the second source is “2,” and so on. This numbering system resets with each page, and you start over with “1” instead of moving on to “3.”


At the bottom of the page, create a space for footnotes that is separated from the body text by a typed lined is 1.5 inches wide.
Match each source to its information in the text by using the same number, but do not raise it into superscript.

, It’s formatted in the exact same way, but the numbering reaches from the first to last page, rather than restarting with each new page.

, The first line of each source is indented, just like a paragraph, but subsequent lines are not.

For example: 2. Brown, David, “How to Make Friends,” The Journal of wikiHow 15 (2015): 352-361.
Essay accessed through online database: use the exact same format as that for the print journal, but add the doi (digital object identifier) if available. If not available, add the url.
For example: 3. Condron, Ursula, “Getting Along,” The Journal of wikiHow 12 (2013): 299-312, doi: 10.1163/157006598X00125.

, You can provide only the name and page number, or name, shortened title, and page number. Either way, you include a note pointing the reader to the first note for that source, where they can find full bibliographic information.


12. Meisner, 118. 12. Meisner, ""The Way We Live,"" 118. This style is used if you have multiple sources by the same author.
If you have multiple authors with the same last name, just include the first name.
For example: Stanley Meisner, 118. , However, many people choose to create a consolidated list of sources. While the notes are numbered and appear in the order in which the sources appear, the bibliography is alphabetized. If you include a range of sources, some of which you read but did not specifically need to cite for the paper, you should call the document a ""Selected Bibliography."" If you include only the sources you used in the paper, call it a ""Works Cited"" or ""Reference List.""


Just like the notes, bibliography entries are single spaced, with a skipped line between entries.
But unlike the notes, the first line is not indented, while subsequent lines are indented.

Create a reference list.",How to Cite an Essay4," Just like in MLA, the Chicago Author-Date style inserts a parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence, before the period. But the information included in the parenthetical is more like APA: author, date, and page number. There is no punctuation between the author and date, but the date and page number are separated by a comma:


The worldwide population of bees is in significant decline (Brown 2011, 203).
Brown points out that the worldwide population of bees is in significant decline (2011, 203).

, If you have multiple essays by the same author, the reader should be able to distinguish them by the year you've provided. But, if you have two articles by the same author and published in the same year, you mark them with a letter, like in APA. The letter again corresponds with the alphabetization of the essay titles by first major word: (Smith 2005a, 192).

, The Notes-Bibliography system does not require a bibliography, but the Date-Author system does. Like in MLA or APA, the reference list appears after the text of your essay has finished.

Gather all the pertinent information.,
Choose which style you want to use.,
Insert an in-line citation right after you’ve referenced a text.,
Format your bibliography correctly.",How to Cite a PDF1," For both in-line and bibliographic citation, you’ll need to know basic information about its creation.


Journal Articles: You’ll need to copy down the author’s name, title of the article, name of the journal, volume number, issue number, date of publication, page numbers of the physical copy, and the web address of the journal article.Ebooks: You’ll want to know the author’s name, the title of the book, the publisher, place of publication, year of publication, date accessed, and website where the ebook can be located. On occasion, publishers of physical books will out-source the production of ebooks. If this is the case, a separate publisher will be listed for the ebook version. You’ll need to have information for both publishers.;
, The most commonly used styles in academic and professional writing are MLA, APA, and Chicago Manual of Style (sometimes also called “Turabian” after the style manual’s editor). Choose the style used by your field, or the style stated as preferred by your profession or workplace.


Use MLA if you study literature, arts, or the general humanities.
Use APA if you study psychology, education, linguistics, or other social sciences. Journalism and communications often use APA style as well.
Use Chicago Manual of Style if you study history, political science, information science, or journalism and communications. Publishing and editing commonly use a form of Chicago style.
In certain cases,the publisher may request a specific citation style that is not commonly used in the field, or may refer you to their own “in-house” style guide. Use whatever is appropriate for your writing., If you want to avoid charges of plagiarism, you’ll insert a citation into the body of your text. Your goal is to tell the reader that the information just presented is taken from another author. It shows the reader that you are well-versed in the existing literature and that you are interested in building off of others’ work.Where the citation goes, and the type of citation, depends on what style you are using. Examples for each major style are given in this article.

, Learn how to format a bibliography/works cited page. Depending on the style you settle on, you’ll need to follow different guidelines. For the most part, you’ll need to alphabetize your sources.

,How to Write a Letter to Grandma1,
"
Establish if the interview counts as a ‘personal communication.’ If you conducted the interview, it is considered ‘personal.’ If another person created the interview and published it for general use, it is considered ‘published.’ Personal interviews are cited parenthetically (or internally) in the text, but not included in your works cited or reference list.This status of ‘personal communication’ also applies to other documents that are ‘unfindable’ to other people, such as a private emails.For personal interviews, you may also want to include a transcript of your typed questions and answers.,
Paraphrase or directly quote the interview.,
Follow the interview information with a parenthetical citation.,
Begin with the name of the interview subject.,
Add the phrase, “personal communication.” Insert a single space after the comma and the phrase should appear immediately thereafter.,
Finish with the date of the interview.,
Place your citation in parentheses.,
Include the author’s name directly in the text.",How to Cite an Interview in APA1," This should be included in an Appendix, immediately following your References page.;
, Use the information as you normally would while writing. However, know that you must include an internal citation if you mention anything beyond ‘common knowledge’ that is part of the interview.


The internal citation format looks the same whether you quote or paraphrase. It does not change.For example, if you write, “The people in the command room cheered after the event.” If you know this because your interview subject told you so, and this information is not readily available via a textbook, etc., then you must cite it. Failure to do so counts as academic dishonesty.

, Immediately after the sentence in which you paraphrased or quoted the interview, include a parenthetical citation, essentially a full citation contained with parentheses.You should place the previous sentence’s period after your citation. For example, in the text you will see, “The people in the command center cheered the event (R. Smith, personal communication, October 15, 2000).” Your citation counts as a continuation of that sentence for reference purposes.

, Include their first initial followed by a period, add a space, and follow it with their full last name. The initial and last name should be capitalized. Place a comma after their complete name.In the case of research interviews, your subjects may need to remain anonymous. Therefore, their full names cannot appear within your citation. Instead, if you have numerous interview participants to keep track of, you can assign them codes, such as “Male participant 23,” or, “Participant 23.”The code name will then take the place of the traditional name in the internal citation. For example, your citation will look like, “(Participant 23, personal communication, October 15, 2000).""

, It should be kept in all lower-case letters. Follow it with a period and another space.This phrase cannot be abbreviated, so make sure to present it consistently every time in internal citations.

, Take a space after the previous comma. Write out the month in full followed by the numerical day. A comma should be placed after the day number, add another space, and include the numerical year in four-digit format.For example, a date should appear as, “October 15, 2000,” not, “Oct. ’00,” or, “October 15.”

, The parentheses should open at the start of the citation (place it right before the author’s first initial) and close at the end of your citation (place it right after the year date). Remember to place the sentence’s period after your closed parentheses., You may end up stating the interviewee’s name in the text, in the area directly preceding the citation. If that is the case, you can go with a somewhat pared down version of your internal citation. Simply remove the author’s name from within the parentheses and cite as you normally would.


This is done because it is understood that the reader can get the interview subject’s name from the preceding sentence. Otherwise, listing it twice that close together would bog down the text.
You might write, “Robert Smith describes how the people in the command room cheered after the event (personal communication, October 15, 2000).”

Use in-text citations for quotes.,
Cite a publication with one author.,
Cite a book with multiple authors.,
Cite a publication with no known author.,
Cite a web page.,
Cite personal communications or interviews.,
Create a reference list.",How to Cite a Quote2," Place parentheses with the proper citation inside after directly after quoted material. APA style uses the author-date message.

Example:
Smith (2013) states that citing quotes can be challenging.
This means that if you write the name of an author you are quoting, you must follow that name with the year of publication in parentheses.

, Publications include books, newspapers, journal articles, magazines, etc.
The author remarks on the ""difficulty of citing quotes,"" (Smith, 2002, p. 32) but does not go into depth.or
Smith (2002) mentions the ""difficulty of citing quotes"" (p. 32) but does not go into depth.
The author’s last name, the year of publication, and the page number (preceded by a ‘p.’) should appear in parenthesis after the quote. If you state the author’s name in your sentence, the name must be followed by the year of publication in parenthesis and the quote must be followed by the page number. Follow the same procedures if the book has multiple authors., This should include the authors' last names, the year of publication, and the page number.



These scholars agree that ""quotes are useful"" (Hu, Koller, and Shier, 2013, p. 75).or
Hu, Koller, and Shier agree that ""quotes are useful"" (p. 75).


, Instead of using an author’s name for the in-text citation, use the title of the publication followed by the date.In a study, it was determined that “the sky is in fact blue” (“Obvious Observations,” 2013).


, If possible, cite a web page like any other document, using the author-date style.
Another study showed that “clouds are white” (“More Obvious Observations,” n.d., para. 7).
If there is no author name or date available, use a shortened version of the web page title in your parentheses, along with n.d (which stands for “no date”). If a web page does not have page numbers, signal which paragraph your quote is from by writing ‘para.’ (which stands for paragraph) followed by the paragraph’s number., Personal communications like e-mail and interviews are not considered recoverable data, so they are not recorded in your References list at the end of the work.
The message affirmed that “the sky is in fact blue” (John Smith, email, August 23, 2013).
Include all of the following in a parenthetical citation, placed as close after the quote as possible: Your source's name, form of communication, date of the communication.

, This is where you list all of the sources you have quoted in your paper. List your references in alphabetical order. Keep in mind that all lines after the first line of each entry should be indented one half-inch from the left margin.Book with one or more authors:
Lastname, First Initials (year published). Title of Book. Location: Publisher.

Book with no author:Title of Book. (Year). Location: Publisher.

Web page:

Create an in-text citation of a work with no known author.,
Create an in-text citation for a web page.,
Create an in-text citation for an interview or personal communication.,
Create a Works Cited page.",How to Cite a Quote3," How you make the in-text citation depends on what kind of source you pulled the quote from.

, Provide a word or phrase (the author’s name) and the page number. If you state the word or phrase in the sentence, you do not need to add it to the in-text citation.The meat factory workers of Chicago “were tied to the great packing-machine, and tied to it for life” (Sinclair, 99).or
Upton Sinclair described the workers as ""tied to the great packing-machine, and tied to it for life” (99).


, If there are three or less authors, list all of the authors’ last names in alphabetical order within the parentheses followed by the page number. If there are more than three authors, write the last name of the author who appears first in the alphabet, followed by ""et al."" and the page number.





Two or three authors
The authors state, “citing quotes can be annoying” (Hu, Koller, and Shier 45).

More than three authors:
The authors state, “citing different sources can be confusing” (Perhamus et al. 63).



, Use a shortened title of the work in place of an author’s name.

Citing sources can get annoying because “it can take a while” (Cite like a Champion 72).


, List either the web page’s author, website name, or article name in parentheses. You do not need to put a page number.



The sky is blue but “clouds are white” (Obvious Observations Online).


, Include the first item that appears in that source's listing on the Works Cited page--usually the interviewee's last name.



An email message confirmed that “the sky is indeed blue” (Smith).


, This is where you list the full bibliographical information for each source that you quoted or cited in your paper. You should list your sources in alphabetical order. Use the following formats:

Endnotes appear at the end of a paper, similar to how Works Cited pages look, though endnotes are formatted differently.

Look for the author.,
Look for page numbers.,
Cite ebook PDFs in MLA bibliographic format.,
Cite journal article PDFs in MLA bibliographic format.,
Note whether the journal article is from an online-only journal.",How to Cite a PDF2," To provide a complete MLA citation, you must provide the author of the file and the page number of your reference (when possible). If the author is mentioned in the statement, just put the page number in the parentheses: According to Spiers, college has become too expensive (48). Otherwise, use a parenthetical with both the name and the page number at the end of the sentence or quotation: Some argue that college has become too expensive (Spiers 48).If there are two authors, put both last names in parentheses with ""and"" in the middle followed by the page number: Dogs have evolved alongside humans (Draper and Simpson 68).
If there are more than two authors, use commas to separate the authors’ last names followed by the page number: Embroidery should be considered a “fine art form” (Kozinsky, King, and Chappell 56).
If no author is listed, use the institution’s name: Dinosaurs became extinct millions of years ago (Smithsonian 21).
If no institution is credited, just start the citation with the title of the piece: According to experts, energy drinks should not be over consumed (“Impact of caffeine consumption” 102).
MLA in-line citations should not indicate whether or not your source is in a PDF file.
In all of these scenarios, the parenthetical citation goes before the final punctuation of the sentence., Some ebooks and PDF files have fixed page numbers, where the page numbers don’t change depending on your display. If your document has fixed page numbers, use them.. If there are no page numbers, do not try to give them. You can cite by chapter or section instead.


For example, to cite a PDF without page numbers that is divided into sections, you can cite it by section: According to Blankenship, caffeine intake should be limited to 200mg per day (ch. 2).
If the PDF or ebook is not divided into any identifiable sections, cite the file as a whole and do not give page numbers: Blankenship’s study on caffeine consumption, “Too Jittery, Joe?” suggests that caffeine intake should be limited to 200mg per day.

, According to MLA guidelines, you should indicate the type of electronic file you have accessed for ebooks, such as “PDF file” or “Kindle file.”


The basic format is: Author’s last name, Author’s first name. ‘’Book Title’’. Place of Publication: Publisher, Year of Publication. Ebook publisher, Year of Ebook publication. File type.
For example: Smith, John. The Fantastic Novel. London: Great Publishing House, 2010. Google Books, 2011. PDF file. 1 December 2012.
If your ebook is not a PDF file, cite the file type you have. For example: Smith, John. The Fantastic Novel. London: Great Publishing House, 2010. Kindle file.

, In your works cited page, cite journal articles you access from an online database by giving the publication information just as you would for articles in print. This is followed by the name of the online database where you found the article and the medium (Web), as well as the date you accessed the file.The basic format is: Author’s last name, Author’s first name. “Article title.” Journal Title Volume number.Issue number (Date of publication): page numbers. Database name. Medium. Date of access.
For example: Doe, Jane. “Interesting Citation Article.” Journal of Citation Information 4.7 (2006): 82-5. Academic Access Premier. Web. 20 November 2012.

, Some academic journals are now available only online and do not provide PDFs with pagination. If your PDF is from an online-only journal and does not have page numbers, follow the basic model for your works cited page but add the words “n. pag.” in place of page numbers.For example: Doe, Jane. “Interesting Citation Article.” Online Journal of Citation Information 4.7 (2006): n.pag. Web. 20 November 2012.

If the author is already mentioned in the statement, put the year in parentheses next to the name (and put the page number in parentheses at the end of the statement, if applicable). Place the citation before the final punctuation mark. If there are two or three authors in parentheses, use ""&"" instead of “and"".

You can also use a shortened heading in quotation marks: Higher education professionals think that “education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” (Mandela, 1996, “A few words on education”).

, In APA style, you must state the type of file you consulted in square brackets, such as or If you are using a proprietary ebook format, such as a Kindle file, you should note this too.The basic format is: Author’s last name, Author’s first initial.

Include the interview in both your internal citations and your reference list.,
Go to your “Reference” page.,
Start your reference citation with the author’s last name.,
Include the date of publication.,
Include the title.,
Follow the format of the original source.,
Follow with a DOI, if available.,
Create your internal citation.",How to Cite an Interview in APA2," If the interview appeared in a magazine or other publication, then it falls under these guidelines. The reference information will now appear throughout the text (as it is used) and also at the end of your work in your reference list.

, This is a page at the very end of your work that lists the accumulated sources from throughout your paper. It should be organized alphabetically, so that readers can find citation information quickly., Follow this with a comma and a single space. Then, include your your author’s first initial, capitalized, and followed immediately by a period and another space. , Follow the name with the four-digit date of publication in parentheses. Place a period immediate after the closed parentheses and add another space.


Your date should look like, “(2000),” not, “(’00).”
If you cannot find a date for the work substitute “n.d.” without quotation marks in its place.

, Follow the date with the full interview title. If the interview is not titled, then include a single line description. This description should be contained within square brackets. It will often include the phrase “Interview with” followed by the interviewee’s full name, followed by a comma, and a few words of bio information.If you use brackets, add a period immediately after the closed bracket. For example, it will look like, “.” Or, it could look like, “The Most Amazing Interview Title.”
If you include a published work in the brief bio description, make sure to italicize the title.
Include the title exactly as it appears within the published text.

, At this point your entry may look different depending on the original publication style. If you are working with a journal entry with a single-author, then you will want to follow that general citation style. That will determine what additional information you include in the citation.


For example, when working with a single-author journal entry your citation will proceed with the full journal title, the volume number, and the page numbers of the interview. It will look similar to, “Word, J. (2000). . Journal of Writing Studies, 20, 400-411.” Note that the journal title is italicized as well.If the volume number is not available, it can be omitted. Note that the consecutive page numbers are separated with a dash. To include a series of non-consecutive page numbers you would list them with commas in between. Always end your citation with a period.

, The DOI, or Digital Object Identifier, is new to the 6th edition of the APA Citation Manual. It allows an interested party to trace the source digitally. You will find the DOI in a database record for a digital magazine or perhaps at the top of a downloaded pdf. Include the DOI directly after the page numbers.For example, a DOI reference citation for a published interview might look like,”Word, J. (2000). . Journal of Writing Studies, 20, 400-411. doi:453432342342.”

, As the full information is included in the reference list, you are free to use an abbreviated in-text citation style. Immediately after a paraphrase, include the last name of the author followed by a comma and the publication year. All placed within parentheses.If you quote the published interview directly, then you must include a page number as part of your internal citation. Add a comma after the publication date and write the page number out preceded by a “p.” An in-text citation in this situation should look like, “(Wood, 2000, p. 402).” ""Wood"" is the author's last name, ""2000"" is the publication year, and ""p.402"" means the quotation was found on page 402 in the text.
In contrast, if you mention the author directly in the text, you can follow a distinct in-text citation style. With this format you include the publication date in parentheses immediately after your mention of the author's last name and add the page numbers at the end of the sentence in parentheses as well. For example, “Wood (2000) stated that “reality is subjective” (p.402).” By looking at this sentence you can tell that the author's last name is Wood, the work was published in the year 2000, and the quote can be found on page 402 in the text. This is a good approach if you are looking to avoid heavy citing."

Create both an internal citation and a reference list citation.,
Craft your reference citation.,
Follow standard internal citation rules.",How to Cite an Interview in APA3," Since this is a traceable source you will want to double-up the citations the same way you did for the published interviews. You will need to include an alphabetized entry in your reference list. You will want to follow the rules when citing internally as well.

, Begin with the last name of the interviewee (the person being interviewed), followed by a comma and their first initial, followed by a period. Place the date in parentheses. The four-digit year should come first, followed by a comma, then the full month day and numerical day.Follow the date with the interview title, if available. The title should be in italics. Then, in parentheses, state the interviewer’s first initial and last name, followed by a comma and the label “Interviewer.” Then, in brackets, write out “Audio file. Close the brackets and add a period.
If your audio file came from a website, at the end of your citation write, “Retrieved from,” followed by the website. Or, you can include the DOI here, if available.

, When you add an internal citation for an audio file interview, you will include the same information as with a published source, minus the page numbers unless you are working from a transcript. You will use the interviewee last name followed by a comma and the date, all in brackets.

Discuss school Internet usage with the school administration.,
Create an Internet code of conduct.,
Create a classroom website.,
Teach research skills.,
Create a Google Custom Search Engine.",How to Use the Internet in Your Classroom1," Many schools have rules dictating when and what sites are acceptable for school use. You will want to base your classroom rules on school-wide rules.;
, With students, it is always a good idea to give them some guidelines and tell them what discipline will be dealt if they ignore them. As well as creating a safe classroom environment, a school-approved Internet code of conduct can help children to learn how to navigate the Internet carefully.

, This general educational aid is like a bulletin board of important information for students and parents. You can post homework assignments, calendars, upcoming events, suggested resources and more.


If your school does not provide you the capabilities to create a class website, you can create an account at SchoolNotes.com. Students and parents can search for your website using the school's zip code.

, Although students may have the ability to use a search engine, they may not be aware of how to find reliable sources. You may consider teaching a lesson on Internet research.


Begin this class in the computer lab, if possible. Students who learn from experience as well as through handouts and lectures are more likely to adopt new skills.
Suggest search engines other than Google or Bing. Post search engines like Internet Public Library and Think Quest on your classroom website. Suggest that they conduct a search on these sites first, and move to Google if they cannot find information.
Teach children to analyze a URL. Students should give priority to .edu, .gov and .mil websites, because they are highly regulated. Next, they should choose .org websites over .com, because a .com website is more likely to post information that sells products and they have a lower burden of accuracy.
Tell students to find the author, sources and the date when the information was published. These are clues into the accuracy and reliability of the website. Ask them to look for red flags, such as misspellings, sponsorships by companies and personal bias.
Ask students to create a bibliography of all the sites they used for projects. EasyBib can help students to site information correctly, while asking them to input the necessary information.

, At google.com/cse/ you can specify the websites that you want the students to search and remove those that are forbidden. Give the search engine code to your students and refine it throughout the year.

Consider other factors.",How to Understand the Benefits of All Girls Schools," Many students and parents select all-girls schools because they encourage women to enter fields that have been traditionally dominated by men, such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). In co-ed schools, boys are often expected to enter these fields whereas girls are often expected to succeed only in the humanities or the arts.Girls who graduate from single-sex schools are three times more likely to become engineers than girls who attend co-ed schools.In a 2013 study, science faculty at six leading research universities were asked to assess the resumes of potential students they could mentor. The resumes were identical, with the exception of one being named ""John"" and the other ""Jennifer."" The faculty members overwhelmingly favored the male student, rating him as more competent and hireable than the female applicant based on nothing other than his gender.;
, Studies have indicated that in co-ed settings, male students are often preferred over female students. For instance, studies have shown that teachers are far more likely to praise and give in-depth responses to a boy's comments in class whereas they might only acknowledge a girl's comments with a nod or a quick response.In co-ed settings, teachers are also more likely to encourage male students to work through problems on their own, while they tend to step in and help female students who struggle with a problem.
In an all girls setting, girls are far more likely to speak up frequently and make significant contributions to class than in a co-ed setting.
Girls studying in a single sex setting also earn higher scores on their College Board and Advanced Placement exams than girls who study in co-ed settings., All girls schools tend to be smaller than co-ed schools, which means your teachers will be able to tailor the material to your personal learning style and interests.


In a personalized setting, your teachers and professors will be able to write detailed letters of recommendation

, If you are interested in attending an all-girls school for high school in the United States, you can find detailed rankings of them from websites such as Niche.You can find a directory of women's colleges at http://www.womenscolleges.org.

, No amount of research will replace actually talking to graduates about the benefits of their school. Ask them questions about their experiences at the school and why they would recommend attending.


Many schools will have events where you can speak to alumnae and learn what kinds of career paths the graduates of their school have taken.

, People such as Hillary Rodham Clinton, Meryl Streep, Gwen Ifill, Eudora Welty, Natasha Trethewey, and Gloria Steinem are all graduates of women's colleges.


Twenty-two percent of women in Congress are women's college graduates.

, Alumnae of women's colleges tend to be very supportive of their school and their younger, fellow graduates. You will have a successful and powerful network in place after you graduate from your school.

, When you are deciding upon a school to attend, you shouldn't just pick the first one you find. Instead, plan to visit at least a few options to compare the best one for you.


If your parents are encouraging you to attend a girls' school for high school, try to talk to other students who attended the school at their parents' urging. What do they think of it? Are they happy they came to the school?
If you are concerned about your dating prospects, remember that many girls' schools will have social events with local boys' schools or other private schools.

, Many girls' schools and women's colleges will have visiting weekends for prospective students. During these visits, you can generally stay with a student and experience life in the dorms and also attend a few classes. You should ask current students for their honest opinions about the school and why the wanted to attend it.

, While the benefits of single-sex education are great, you should also consider other attributes of the school that might be important to you. Some of these might include:


Location. Is the school in a beautiful rural setting or a bustling city? In which setting will you be happiest?
Facilities. What are the buildings on campus like? What kind of labs or learning centers are available to students? Does it have a nice library, a theater or artistic space, a gym, etc.?
Career opportunities. This will be more of a priority if you pick a women's college. Does the school have a good career center? Do they support students in finding internships, externships and other opportunities?
Campus life. If it is a boarding school or residential college, you should see the types of dorms or apartments available for students. What kinds of activities happen on campus for students? Are there clubs or extracurricular could you participate in during your time there?

Ask a local police official and local fire official to visit the facility.,
Using the two-way radio policy, conduct a tornado/fire drill to ensure that all users are able to use the radio effectively and understand the new process.",How to Use a Two Way Radio Policy to Protect School Students and Staff," Administrators must calculate the number of staff employed and having access to their facility, then order a corresponding number of two-way radios and chargers, plus ten.


Staff should be counted as every single adult in regular attendance of the facility, the extra ten radios should be distributed to anyone given access to the school facility for things such as contract work, parents meeting with staff, and law enforcement or security visits/inspections.
Purchase surge protectors that will accommodate all of the radio chargers, plus ten additional.
The one time cost (expenditure) for this equipment for 70 individuals will be well under $3000.00 (based on $1800 for radios and $280 for surge protectors at market value, without a contract).;
, Select a small, locked-room in which to store radios while they are being charged at night and when not in use. Maintenance will be responsible for the management, distribution and upkeep of this room and its contents.

, Make a list of all the currently numbered locations in the facility. This list should include each numbered classroom, gymnasiums, cafeterias, outdoor locations where training takes place, etc,. If there is no currently assigned number for a location, excluding restrooms, hallways, closets, and various storage facilities, assign numbers and place them prominently at the physical location, and then mark the appropriate radio with that number.

, Use the same one provided to incoming students and staff and make sure all the location numbers are present. On this diagram, note the default channel the facility will be using for communication. Make copies of this diagram and distribute.


One copy should be given to the local police department.
One copy should be given to the local fire department.
One copy should be prominently displayed in the administrative office for each department, including the cafeteria, maintenance, medical staff, etc,.
One laminated copy should be affixed to each entry/exit point in the facility where it can be read easily.
Additional copies will be used for daily ""Clear"" logs, for check-in/reporting by each radio operator and should be placed in the administrative office files for easy access. (All copies used for logs must be filled out with the date, school name, log-in overseer name, and must never be reused. All logs are to be kept for the entirety of the school year, in their original form.)

,, This individual will get their radio from the locked-room each working day and, after ensuring that it is in proper working order, will take it to their workspace. Provide this individual with a log sheet copy, daily and have them affix the date, school name, and their own name at the top of the layout sheet, prominently. Assign a minimum of two reliable back-up ""Hubs"" for this responsibility. (This responsibility must be assigned to an adult, employed by this facility, not a trusted student or volunteer for legal purposes.) Responsibilities for the ""Hub"" will include:


Coordination with maintenance supervisor responsible for two-way radios, chargers and surge protectors (outlet extensions) to ensure that necessary repairs requiring disbursement of funds or outside expert consultation are carried out satisfactorily.
Day-long interaction with each radio operator.
Keeping the log for each radio communication with operators. The ""Hub"" will document the full name of each radio operator who checks out a radio each morning and the times that radio operator calls their check-in ""Clear"", as well as making a notation of the content of each radio transmission.
Oversight of the operation of radio communication within the facility. (Interrupting any ""chatter"" between users, then documenting offenders, coaching radio operators as necessary to ensure proper radio usage, and reporting any malfunctions to administrative staff and documenting accordingly.)
Reporting emergencies to 911 operators and coordinating with law enforcement and emergency personnel during emergencies. This ""Hub"" is to provide the officials with their log sheet upon first contact so emergency officials will be aware of the exact location of the emergency report and all access points relative to that location. (In the event of an emergency, the secondary ""Hub"" person is to provide emergency workers and the tertiary ""Hub"" with ongoing information regarding the completed evacuations via their copy of the ""Clear"" and ""Clear, prepare for names"" school radio/facility layout diagram. The tertiary ""Hub"" is to coordinate with law enforcement to offer information, instruction and support to users in the process of evacuation.)
Visually checking the locked-room area for broken door or window locks, missing radios, broken equipment, and compromised electrical equipment, then documenting conditions of the location on the log sheet before filing each end of day.
(This is not a full time position. The assignees should be familiarized with the process of filling out the logs alongside any other visitor log/data sheet maintained by office personnel.)

, Conduct a brief meeting with staff. Distribute radios based on the location to which each staff member is assigned. Demonstrate the proper use of the radio to attendees. Explain the rules of two-way radio operation as follows:


The two-way radio is to be used strictly for the purposes of securing the facility and its occupants, never to be used in place of a telephone for private ""chatter"" between users.
Each individual must go to the locked-room and check out a radio upon arrival for work in the morning/afternoon/evening and return radio immediately prior to leaving the facility.
Upon picking up radio, user is to turn it on and go directly to their workspace.
Upon entering their workspace, the user must put down any items being carried except the radio, and conduct a thorough visual inspection of their workspace.
After ensuring that workspace is safe for occupancy, the user should press the microphone button (when they don't hear anyone speaking through it) and call out the number assigned to that two-way radio and the word ""Clear.""
User may then place radio where it is visible and can be accessed easily at all times and prepare themselves for the workday.
Upon initiation of class, the user (if a teacher with an assigned class) must take the roll of students present and record properly on their paperwork, then press the microphone button (when no one can be heard speaking from it) and clearly state the two-way radio number and the word ""Present"" or (if necessary) ""Prepare for list"". When they hear ""Confirm"" from the radio, the user must clearly say, then spell the name of any student unaccounted for so the absence can be noted by the ""Hub"".
User is to follow this procedure at the beginning of each scheduled class throughout the day.
When the user is ready to leave their assigned area at the end of the workday, the user is to visually inspect their workspace area, exit and lock any appropriate doors, then press the microphone button and state the number assigned to the radio, then the word ""Clear"". The user is to then go directly to the locked-room and turn the radio off, place the radio on the appropriate charger, see that the charging light displays, then exit the building.

, This will ensure that, should anything happen to a teacher, students will be aware of the simplest means of immediate contact with help outside their physical location. Teacher should then place the radio in a visible and accessible location within the classroom with a firm warning to students to use it should an emergency arise. Teachers should remind students to maintain radio contact with others outside the location in the event of an emergency, if at all possible.

, User is to press the microphone button and, first, call out the radio number, then state their location if they are not where they are assumed to be based on the radio number, then state their emergency and let go of the microphone button.


Emergency Instructions to staff:

Three channels will be used to communicate. Channel one is the default; the user is to stay on this channel while inside facility. Channel two is for successful evacuations and evacuated without all charges reports. Channel three is for evacuation assistance/instructions (by direction of assigned ""Hub"" user, only.)
Press the microphone button.
State the radio number clearly.
State the word ""Emergency"" if there is a fire, tornado, roof collapse, etc,. Then release the microphone button.
""Hub"" individual is to call the Emergency Services immediately and upon contact with operator, state the name of the school and the two-way radio user number of the user who has reported an ""Emergency""
Regardless of response heard, user is to press microphone button again and briefly describe the emergency, if possible.
Users in the immediate vicinity of that radio users location should immediately take precautions to protect their charges by getting them out of the building and to their evacuation point.
Users who have evacuated students must change their radios to the predetermined secondary communication channel and (without interrupting other transmissions) press the microphone button and state ""Clear"" when they have moved their charges to their assigned evacuation point. The assigned ""Hub"" individual will use this channel to communicate instructions to evacuated staff, so communication with those in potential danger will be uninterrupted on the default channel. Evacuated users should maintain their presence on this channel only and await instructions.
Upon first responder arrival (Police), the ""Hub"" individual who is in direct contact with the user experiencing the ""Emergency"" is to hand a two-way radio to the officer (even if the only radio at hand is their own) and allow the officer to establish contact with the user experiencing the ""Emergency"". The ""Hub"" is to follow any instructions given by officers, after getting another usable radio, if time and the situation permits.
Users of two-way radios who remain in the building should turn their radios down, upon hearing ""Emergency"" and hold them close to their ear to prevent compromising their safety and revealing their location to potential intruders, if possible. They are to stay on the default channel that the ""Emergency"" was reported on, unless there is opportunity or need to switch channels and offer information relevant to the emergency itself. They are to use what they hear and see to determine their best course of action. Users are to interact with officers to verify their location and condition, upon request. Any user not experiencing the emergency due to proximity from disturbance report must evacuate and change radio frequency channel to the secondary channel upon successful evacuation. Any charge not accounted for while evacuating should be reported on the secondary channel upon arrival of evacuation point by radio number, first, following with the words ""Clear"" or ""Clear, prepare for list."" Upon hearing ""Confirm"", user is to clearly state the name of any student they were unable to evacuate and their last known location within the facility.
The back-up ""Hub"" radio user should take a copy of the radio roster/facility diagram from the file and record a check mark (or highlight) beside each radio user who reports ""Clear"" and make notation of names and last known locations of missing students reported upon class evacuation.
Users experiencing difficulties and/or confusion following an ""Emergency"" call by another user, may check the secondary channel periodically, and if hearing other users communicating, wait until radio quiet, then pressing microphone button, state the radio number (following location if different from radio assignment), then ask for advice/assistance to evacuate.
In the event of an ""Emergency"" report from a user, the tertiary back-up ""Hub"" should use their radio to direct staff reporting difficulties evacuating to the third designated channel for instructions. If this radio user does not know what the emergency is, or the location of the emergency at the moment a user requests assistance, they are to instruct the user to maintain their presence on the default channel and wait for assistance, or instructions.



, This will allow the law enforcement personnel to monitor and/or use those frequencies to offer instructions to facility staff and each other without radio interference or confusion.

, Introduce them to your three communication ""Hubs"" and show them the two-way radio roster/facility diagram that you've posted on each entry/exit point. Tell them, and provide them with a copy of, the procedure you will follow during reported emergencies and what channel they should use to communicate directly with radio users within the facility.

, Stress the importance that every user maintain proper protocol throughout the exercise and troubleshoot/resolve any conflicts discovered, immediately thereafter. Stress the importance of limited radio communication during an emergency, advising them on how to be concise in their radio communications and reminding them to release the microphone button any time they are not speaking, unless otherwise instructed.

Understand that interpreting is all about accuracy.,
Recognize what is expected of you as an interpreter.,
Have the right skills.,
Be persistent.,
Train well.,
Stay on top of your languages.,
Make note of the following:


Interpretation should always be in a target language.",How to Train Effectively as an Interpreter," What is being presented in the target language must preserve the exact meaning and tone of what is uttered in the source language, whether done simultaneously or consecutively.;
, All interpreters find this profession demanding and challenging. When an interpreter is working, he or she cannot afford to have a bad day. One bad interpreter can ruin a conference.

, Strong research and analytical skills, mental dexterity, and an exceptional memory are important for a good and efficient interpreter. A good interpreter needs a good short-term memory to retain what he or she has just heard and good long-term memory to put the information into context. Ability to concentrate is a factor as is the ability to analyze and process what is heard.

, A strong base is required to be a good and efficient interpreter. So many aspirants join this race, but very few make it to the top. The main aspect that differentiates is Training, effort, intelligence, presence of mind and some of your own inner latent talents and initiatives.

, Training is a very crucial stage in the career of any interpreter. An interpreter aspiring for a good career in this field has to reap the benefits of training through others’ experience. The basics should be very solid and strong. This is a big side of the effort. The other side of the coin is type and level of training imparted to the trainee.

, Human language is a fluid entity---languages and dialects constantly evolve and change. If you miss a nuance or meaning, you risk mistranslation. Maintain your language skills by traveling, watching films, news, and television, listening to music, reading novels, newspapers, and comic strips, etc.

, A person feels very comfortable in his own mother tongue or that language where he has got good command over it. A trainee should understand what is being said in the training and he should also express his thoughts during discussions. Grasping the content is much easier in a mother tongue. Since his birth, a person speaks, writes, and expresses in his own language—be it in Hindi or Urdu or Spanish or French, all of a sudden, he lands up in training conducted in English, as a source language. He will be totally uncomfortable and uneasy. The basic purpose of training is defeated.
Interpretation through target language helps in better understanding of the subject by the trainees in much less time. The participation of trainees, as well as persons who are conducting the training, is at the maximum. The result is much better and good.
Interpretation in target language helps trainees to understand difficult words, contexts, cultures etc. of other people and countries in a better and long lasting manner. They can add their own contents to the inputs of the training.
Certain professional subjects require in-depth knowledge. Thorough and sound knowledge helps the interpreters to build their own vocabulary and a better understanding of the subject. This becomes a solid base for the interpreter in the future days. This is only possible when training is imparted in the target language.
The trainee is in a better position to contribute his inputs in his own language after hearing in his own language.
By imparting training in the target language, a trainee is able to understand and achieves knowledge of higher levels of other countries of various subjects for which he will do interpreting at a future date.

Figure out the basic proficiency of the student.,
Form lesson plans.,
Flesh out lesson plans.,
Continue to provide tailored education.",How to Tutor in Introductory Accounting," One of the first steps in tutoring basic accounting is to correctly assess where the individual student is at and to figure out where that student needs to go. Make sure to include this ground-laying work before going on to practical lesson implementation.


Some initial diagnostic exams and quizzes, as well as course focus surveys, can be helpful in assisting a trainer who needs to gauge the level of a student interested in building accounting skills.;
, From the initial point where the student's level has been assessed, much of the work in building a tutor's basic accounting program involves detailing how, where and when a class will occur.


Schedule future course dates and hours. A major part of tutoring is scheduling the classes and arranging them to flow together. Plan a series of classes, set dates and fill them with a progressive set of lessons that will help the student gradually build an array of basic accounting skills.
Start to put together lesson plans. Come up with a rough draft of how classes will go and what they will cover. It may make sense to present a rough syllabus at the beginning of the program.

, As course dates approach, assemble the needed materials, as well as more in-depth props and resources for accounting ""labs"" or other hands-on activities.


Keep in mind some basic principles of tutoring. One of these is the value of diverse activities, where a ""closed to open"" approach makes sense. Students start out with some informational materials, advancing throughout the session to more open-ended implementation exercises where they will practically use what they have learned.
Build in exams and more diagnostic material. In order to provide benchmarks and see where the student is going, it's often helpful to contain more testing elements in courses.

, Build classes and sessions according to the unique skill level, interests and job role of a particular student.


Make sure that specific accounting modules are addressed within the class. Items like A/P, A/R, payroll and regulatory compliance are often part of a beginning accounting course. Keep these categories in focus when planning a variety of tutoring sessions.

Done!",How to Write a College Level Essay," Then, make sure to research it as much as possible. Know the material inside and out and become an expert on it. This will help connect the dots between various points in order to form a compelling argument.


Some essays in school require academic sources. These can sometimes be tricky to pick out because not everything is considered academic. For help in this area, you can refer to L. Lennie Irvin’s piece, “What Is ‘Academic’ Writing?” where he eases the student’s fear of the unknown and guides them to understand what academic writing is, how to pick it out, and discusses the benefits of using academic writing. ;
, After immersing yourself in your research and learning all there is to know about the topic, analyze the information. Don’t think just surface level- what is the author actually saying? What is his or her argument and why is he or she trying to prove that point? Is the author accurate? Credible? Dissect their piece and read like the author.


Conventions are methods used in writing to enhance the product and make it more readable and understandable. They also determine what category or genre the piece belongs in. Types of conventions include but are not limited to mechanics, format, sentence structure, and word usage. So consider the following questions as well: What genre is the work and what conventions are used? Why did the author pick that genre and include those specific conventions?
Reading Mike Bunn’s “How to Read Like a Writer” will help you understand how this can be done.He discusses in his piece how to notice decisions the author makes and the conventions used in their work so you can make similar decisions in your own.

, While researching and your argument is forming, mark pieces of evidence in the research that could be useful pieces of evidence for your paper. Don’t be afraid to mark more than you need because it’ll give you more options later on when you finalize what evidence you’re using.

, This is a part of brainstorming. At this point, a million different ideas and connections are forming in your head and it is important to get them all out. Don't pay attention to the format or flow. In fact, use a pen to keep yourself from erasing anything because everything that comes out is important. Just write and write for ten minutes straight and get everything in your head on paper. Later, you will shift through it all and pick out the most important points that fit together the best.

, Synthesize your main points and argument of the paper into a coherent sentence or two. This doesn’t need to be permanent and is subject to change. It will serve as a guideline for the paper in the time being. Incorporate it into the introduction and when the essay is complete, it will inform the reader what you are writing about and what you are arguing.

, Next, make an outline of your essay. Separate your points into appropriate paragraphs and write notes about what you are going to include. After you have this all written down, ensure your ideas flow and you have enough points by picking evidence for each point.


Go back through the evidence you marked earlier or flip through your research again to find additional evidence if it does not sufficiently back up your claims. After this is complete and your outline logically flows, you are ready to begin writing!

, Compose your introduction that starts with a hook to capture the reader’s attention. In the paragraph, include your sources, thesis, and a “road map” for your essay. The “road map” is to give the reader a sense of where you are taking the subject and how you are going to prove your point without specifically stating, “First, I will talk about this. Then, about that”, etc.

, Make sure each body paragraph has a single main idea. If there are more than one, the paragraph can get confusing and one point will get overpowered by the other. Each paragraph should also have a topic sentence that tells the reader what that paragraph is going to tell them. Once again, don’t explicitly say, “In this paragraph I will explain...”.


Also, incorporate your evidence into appropriate places and ensure they flow. Evidence can be used in a quote but don’t forget that you can paraphrase too. Change it up so your essay doesn’t seem repetitive and make sure to use each of your sources equally.

, Tie together your essay with a final conclusion of your argument. Give your reader something to walk away with after reading your essay. For example, have a call to action, leave them pondering a question or with something memorable, or maybe you’ll even end up blowing the reader's minds with something they’ve never thought of or considered. Just make sure they don’t finish your essay thinking “so what?” or “what was the point?”.

, Cite your sources in the appropriate format. Don’t forget this step- no plagiarizing! If you have any questions on citations, you can refer to Diana Hacker's ""A Pocket Style Manual"" which provide a plethora of information on citations, grammar, and formatting., First, set your paper aside. Give yourself a little break to refresh your mind and then come back to revise. One helpful technique is to slowly read your essay out loud to yourself. The key is to read it out loud because you will catch more mistakes that way.


If you have a peer to revise with, trading with them and getting their opinion can be very helpful. If there are multiple people to trade with, go for it! The more opinions the better. Then you can pick and choose what revisions you agree with. You can repeat this step a few times by stepping away from it and coming back to ensure you caught all your mistakes.

, Reflect on your writing, the process of how you completed it, and how you feel about your work. This process identifies the positives and the negatives of the paper, which could help improve it. Write down what you consider to be the downfalls of your paper and you can even go back to the revision stage and fix these once they are identified.

, When you are satisfied with your paper and you have fixed everything that you possibly can, you have completed your essay!

This guide assumes you are writing a traditional summary, with no opinion and very little analysis. If the assignment asks you to include your own thoughts, read the instructions for book reports or book reviews instead.

, If you have the time, reread the book with a notepad or voice recorder nearby. Make brief observations as you read, describing the tone, setting, characters, and plot. Also jot down any passage or idea that jumps out at you, even if you're not sure why.


If you don't have detailed notes or the time to write them, skim through the book and find the most important passages. The chapter titles can help remind you where to find the central scenes.
You don't need to cover every detail. For example, the first Game of Thrones book has too many characters to describe every one. Focus on Ned Stark, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen, and skip scenes that do not include any of them.

, Separate your notes into two to four sections, dividing the book wherever a major plot shift occurs. This will help organize your summary, helping you devote equal time to each part of the book.


For example, you can divide Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone into three parts: First Term at Hogwarts; Uncovering Mysteries; and the Challenges to Find the Stone.
You can choose other ways to divide it if you feel it makes more sense. For example, it's natural to divide Game of Thrones into its three separate plot lines, even though the book jumps between them.

, Pick out the most important points from your notes and construct a short outline. Don't make this too detailed. A bullet point list is enough to keep yourself on track while writing the summary.


Divide your outline the same way you divided your notes. These can be the main bullet points, with sub-bullet points underneath them.

, This is not necessary for all school assignments, but a summary of a more ""literary"" book usually includes a sentence or two on the main theme. Reread your notes on the passages that grabbed your attention to see if you can figure this out. If you're not sure, try to answer the following questions:


Did the main character change between the first page and the last? If so, you can summarize this character development.
If there are multiple plot lines, what do all of them have in common? Do they each encounter a similar challenge?
Is there a scene where the main character has a major revelation? This revelation is probably a major theme.

, Include the author and the book title, plus a description of the book's premise in no more than two sentences. If you have a comfortable grasp on the novel's themes, you may choose to include this as well. Here are a couple examples:


""In J K Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the title character discovers a dark mystery hidden in a school for wizards.""
""F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby chronicles the tense relations between the newly rich Jay Gatsby and the 'old money' of 1920's New York. Through the voice of Nick Carraway, a young Midwesterner, Fitzgerald steadily destroys the glamorous illusion of wealth.""

, Use your outline and notes to summarize the main plot points, section by section. Keep these brief and straightforward.


As you write, keep in mind how much space you have left. You can't afford to spend half your space on the first section if you have three more to go.

, If you're struggling to fit everything within the maximum length of the assignment, take some time to edit what you've already written. Go through it word by word and make the following changes:


Delete anything related to a side plot, a minor character, or an unimportant scene.
Remove every adjective and adverb that does not add useful information to the sentence.
If you are writing a pure summary, not a review, get rid of your own opinions and interpretation.

, There are two ways to handle the final plot point, depending on the purpose of the summary:


If this is a school assignment, describe the climax of the book the same way you summarized the rest of the plot.
If you are writing a summary for a mass audience, don't give away the ending! Think of the cliffhanger you see before a TV commercial; this is the sense of intrigue and excitement you want to create. Try describing the main character's final goal or challenge, without giving away how he meets it.

, If you think the author had a major purpose in mind, and not just light entertainment, insert a few words on the theme near the beginning or end of the summary. Finding the main theme can sound intimidating, but you don't need a brilliant idea for a book summary. If you're stuck, try to answer these questions using your notes:


Is there an idea the narrator brings up again and again?
Was there an inspiring message, or a pessimistic one? Was there a moral the main character learned, or should have learned?
Why should someone read this book, besides the plot? What would you say to convince her?

""Our writing is rising and writhing, our sun shone on our cinders, our love laughs and lives!",How to Think Along the Roots or Think from Root to Fruit," Old English þencan is the causative form of the distinct Old English verb þyncan ""to seem, to appear"" (past tense þuhte, past participle geþuht), from Proto-Germanic *thunkjan (cognates: German dünken, däuchte). Both are from PIE *tong- ""to think, feel"" which also is the root of thought and thank. The two Old English words converged in Middle English and þyncan ""to seem"" was absorbed, except for its preservation in archaic methinks ""it seems to me."" As a noun, ""act of prolonged thinking,"" from 1834. The figurative thinking cap is attested from 1839.

along (prep.) Old English andlang ""entire, continuous; extended; all day long; alongside of,"" from and- ""opposite, against"" (from Proto-Germanic *andi-, *anda-, from PIE *anti ""against,"" locative singular of *ant- ""front, forehead;"" see ante) + lang ""long"" (see long (adj.)). Sense extended to ""through the whole length of.""

long (adj.) ""that extends considerably from end to end,"" Old English lang ""long,"" from Proto-Germanic *langgaz (cognates: Old Frisian and Old Saxon lang, Old High German and German lang, Old Norse langr, Middle Dutch lanc, Dutch lang, Gothic laggs ""long""). The Germanic words are perhaps from PIE *dlonghos- (cognates: Latin longus, Old Persian darga-, Persian dirang, Sanskrit dirghah, Greek dolikhos ""long,"" Greek endelekhes ""perpetual,"" Latin indulgere ""to indulge""), from root *del- ""long."" The adverb is from Old English lange, longe, from the adjective.


the -- definite article, late Old English þe, nominative masculine form of the demonstrative pronoun and adjective. After c.950, it replaced earlier se (masc.), seo (fem.), þæt (neuter), and probably represents se altered by the th- form which was used in all the masculine oblique cases (see below). Old English se is from PIE root *so- ""this, that"" (cognates: Sanskrit sa, Avestan ha, Greek ho, he ""the,"" Irish and Gaelic so ""this""). For the þ- forms, see that. The s- forms were entirely superseded in English by mid-13c., excepting a slightly longer dialectal survival in Kent. Old English used 10 different words for ""the"" (see table), but did not distinguish ""the"" from ""that."" That survived for a time as a definite article before vowels (that one or that other). Adverbial use in the more the merrier, the sooner the better, etc. is a relic of Old English þy, the instrumentive case of the neuter demonstrative (see that).
root (v.1) ""dig with the snout,"" 1530s, from Middle English wroten ""dig with the snout,"" from Old English wrotan ""to root up,"" from Proto-Germanic *wrot- (cognates: Old Norse rota, Swedish rota ""to dig out, root,"" Middle Low German wroten, Middle Dutch wroeten, Old High German ruozian ""to plow up""), from PIE root *wrod- ""to root, gnaw."" Associated with the verb sense of root (n.). Extended sense of ""poke about, pry"" first recorded 1831. Phrase root hog or die ""work or fail"" first attested 1834, American English (in works of Davey Crockett, who noted it as an ""old saying""). Reduplicated form rootin' tootin' ""noisy, rambunctious"" is recorded from 1875.
root (n.) ""underground part of a plant,"" late Old English rot, from a Scandinavian source akin to Old Norse rot ""root,"" figuratively ""cause, origin,"" from Proto-Germanic *wrot (cognates: Old English wyrt ""root, herb, plant,"" Old High German wurz, German Wurz ""a plant,"" Gothic waurts ""a root,"" with characteristic Scandinavian loss of -w- before -r-), from PIE *wrad- (see radish (n.), and compare wort). The usual Old English words for ""root"" were wyrttruma and wyrtwala. Figurative use is from c. 1200. Of teeth, hair, etc., from early 13c. Mathematical sense is from 1550s. Philological sense from 1520s. Slang meaning ""penis"" is recorded from 1846. In U.S. black use, ""a spell effected by magical properties of roots,"" 1935. To take root is from 1530s. Root beer, made from the extracts of various roots, first recorded 1841, American English; root doctor is from 1821. Root cap is from 1875.
root (v.3) ""fix or firmly attach by roots"" (often figurative), early 13c., from root (n.); sense of ""pull up by the root"" (now usually uproot) also is from late 14c. Related: Rooted; rooting.
root (v.2) ""cheer, support,"" 1889, American English, originally in a baseball context, probably from root (v.1) via intermediate sense of ""study, work hard"" (1856). Related: Rooted; rooting.;
,,,), from Latin fructus ""an enjoyment, delight, satisfaction; proceeds, produce, fruit, crops,"" from frug-, stem of fruit ""to use, enjoy,"" from suffixed form of PIE *bhrug- ""agricultural produce,"" also ""to enjoy"" (see brook (v.)). The Latin word also is the source of Spanish fruto, Italian frutto, German Frucht, Swedish frukt-. Originally in English meaning all products of the soil (vegetables, nuts, grain, acorns); modern narrower sense is from early 13c. Also ""income from agricultural produce, revenue or profits from the soil"" (mid-14c.), hence, ""profit,"" the classical sense preserved in fruits of (one's) labor. Meaning ""offspring, progeny, child"" is from mid-13c.; that of ""any consequence, outcome, or result"" is from late 14c. Meaning ""odd person, eccentric"" is from 1910; that of ""male homosexual"" is from 1935, underworld slang. The term also is noted in 1931 as tramp slang for ""a girl or woman willing to oblige,"" probably from the fact of being ""easy picking."" Fruit salad recorded from 1861; fruit-cocktail from 1900; fruit-bat by 1869.
brook (v.) ""to endure,"" Old English brucan ""use, enjoy, possess; eat; cohabit with,"" from Proto-Germanic *bruk- ""to make use of, enjoy"" (cognates: Old Saxon brukan, Old Frisian bruka, Old High German bruhhan, German brauchen ""to use,"" Gothic brukjan), from PIE root *bhrug- ""to make use of, have enjoyment of"" (cognates: Latin fructus). Sense of ""use"" applied to food led to ""be able to digest,"" and by 16c. to ""tolerate.""
frustum (n.) ""remaining piece after a part has been cut off,"" 1650s, in mathematics, from Latin frustum ""piece broken off,"" from PIE *bhrus-to-, from root *bhreu- ""to cut, break up"" (see bruise (v.)).
prudence (n.) mid-14c. (c. 1200 as a surname), mid-14c., ""intelligence; discretion, foresight; wisdom to see what is suitable or profitable;"" also one of the four cardinal virtues, ""wisdom to see what is virtuous;"" from Old French prudence (13c.) and directly from Latin prudentia ""a foreseeing, foresight, sagacity, practical judgment,"" contraction of providentia ""foresight"" (see providence). Secondary sense of ""wisdom"" (late 14c.) is preserved in jurisprudence.
provide (v.) early 15c., from Latin providere ""look ahead, prepare, supply, act with foresight,"" from pro- ""ahead"" (see pro-) + videre ""to see"" (see vision). Related: Provided; providing. Earlier in same sense was purvey, which is the same word as deformed in Old French.
from (prep., adv.) Old English fram, preposition denoting departure or movement away in time or space, from Proto-Germanic *fra ""forward, away from"" (cognates: Old Saxon, Old High German, Gothic fram ""from, away,"" Old Norse fra ""from,"" fram ""forward""), from PIE *pro-mo-, suffixed form of *pro (see pro-); the Germanic sense of ""moving away"" apparently evolved from the notion of ""forward motion."" It is related to Old English fram ""forward; bold; strong,"" and fremian ""promote, accomplish"" (see frame (v.)).
pro- word-forming element meaning ""forward, forth, toward the front"" (as in proclaim, proceed); ""beforehand, in advance"" (prohibit, provide); ""taking care of"" (procure); ""in place of, on behalf of"" (proconsul, pronoun); from Latin pro ""on behalf of, in place of, before, for, in exchange for, just as,"" which also was used as a prefix. Also in some cases from cognate Greek pro ""before, in front of, sooner,"" which also was used in Greek as a prefix (as in problem). Both the Latin and Greek words are from PIE *pro- (cognates: Sanskrit pra- ""before, forward, forth;"" Gothic faura ""before,"" Old English fore ""before, for, on account of,"" fram ""forward, from;"" Old Irish roar ""enough""), extended form of root *per- (1) ""forward, through"" (see per).
per (prep.) 1580s (earlier in various Latin and French phrases), from Latin per ""through, during, by means of, on account of, as in,"" from PIE root *per- (1) ""Base of prepositions and preverbs with the basic meanings of 'forward,' 'through,' and a wide range of extended senses such as 'in front of,' 'before,' 'early,' 'first,' 'chief,' 'toward,' 'against,' 'near,' 'at,' 'around'"" .

Be descriptive.,
If you are describing a table or graph, talk about variables.,
Save humor for elsewhere.,
Keep it concise.,
Remove anything that isn’t strictly necessary.,
Cite your source under the graph or table if it comes from somewhere else.,
Cite according to Modern Language Association style.,
Cite according to American Psychological Association style.,
Cite according to Chicago Style.",How to Write a Caption," This first rule is the most important. Tell the reader exactly what is going on in the picture or figure. Why exactly are you including this image? The reader should be able to answer that after reading your caption.


For instance, if you’re including a picture of a field in a paper about biology, your caption should tell why the field is important to your discussion.;
, What does each side of the bar graph represent? Your reader should have enough information from the caption, the key, and the graph to be able to make sense of it without reading your paper.

, Unless you are writing a humorous paper that includes humorous graphics, generally captions are better left serious due to the need for conciseness.

, That is, it should be no longer than a paragraph, but really, a sentence should be sufficient, at most. In fact, captions don’t even need to be complete sentences. For a photograph, it’s okay to make it shorter than a sentence, such as “Kayley on the Ferris wheel.”

, For instance, the above caption could have said “Kayley waves her hand on the giant green Ferris wheel,” but the extra information that provides isn’t necessary for the reader to understand what’s going on in the picture.

, How you do this depends on the style guidelines you are using. Below, you’ll find how to provide source information in various formats.

, For example: “from Bob Davis, Motorcycles on the Road, (Boulder: Mountain Road Books, 2004) 55. Print.”



Note: The caption goes before the “from.”

, For example: “Note. (caption). Reprinted from Motorcycles on the Road (p. 55), Bob Davis, 2004, Boulder: Mountain Road Books. Copyright 2004 by the University Press. Reprinted with permission.”

, For example: “Source: Bob Davis, Motorcycles on the Road, Boulder: Mountain Road Publishers, 2004, 55.”



Note: In this one, the source goes after the caption.

This will help you think about and develop what you want to write about, how you want your writing to sound, and, even as important, how you don't want to sound.


Read what you want to write. If you want to write a sci-fi novel, for instance, start reading the masters of the genre like Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick and Ray Bradbury.
Keep up a regular reading schedule. Even if it's only 20 minutes a day before you go to sleep, you'll notice an improvement in your writing.

, As you start writing, try writing in different places to find what works best for you. Where can you concentrate best? Where do you find inspiration? Where can you focus? It could be at your desk at home, at a busy coffee shop, in a secluded corner of a library, in a park or anywhere you feel like.


You might find that different places work for you based on your mood or what writing step you're in.
Different locations might lend themselves to different activities. For instance, you might brainstorm best on your bed at home and edit best at a library.

, Will you write everything down by hand or use a laptop? As with finding a place to write, finding your way to write will develop over time.


Be wary of distractions. While typing may be quicker, it can also lead to distractions such as checking your email or websites.

, Write down plot ideas. There's always an idea before a well-written book, and the possibilities are endless. You could write about calculus. You could write about Mercury. You could even write about yourself. There is nothing you can't write about. Try answering these questions:


What happens in your story?
What's the main topic?
Who's the main character?
Why should the reader be interested?

, If you're writing about a subject you're not an expert on and want to make sure you are presenting the topic or information realistically, look up the information or seek out an expert to ask questions.


Search for information online. Type your topic into a search engine and sift through the top 10 or 20 results.


Note: Be cautious about information you retrieve online, especially if you are writing a research paper or an article that relies on factual information. Internet sources can be unreliable. Published books, or works found in a journal, have to undergo a much more thorough vetting process before they reach publication, and are therefore safer to use as sources.


Check out a library. Yes, believe it or not, there is still information to be found in a library that hasn't made its way to the Web. For an even greater breadth of resources, try a college or university library.

, It doesn't matter how many spelling errors or weak adjectives you have in it. This copy is just jotting down those random uncategorized thoughts. Write down anything you think of that you want included in your writing, and worry about organizing everything where it belongs later.

, Set a timer and write continuously until that time is up. You won't have time to worry about errors and mistakes if you're rushing to get the words out. It doesn't matter if you never use it, just beat the writer's block by filling the blank page and get your writer's muscles writing.

, Clean up misspellings, grammatical errors and weak writing such as repetitive words. Flesh out the plot and start thinking of anything you want to cut out.


Edit ruthlessly. If it doesn't fit in with the overall story, if it's unnecessary, or if you don't like what you've written, cut it out.
Check for coherency. Do all parts of the story make sense together? If so, continue. If not, consider revising whatever doesn't fit in.
Check for necessity. Do all parts of the story contribute? Does each section give necessary background, advance the plot, build suspense, or develop an important character?
Check for anything missing. Are all your characters properly introduced? Do the plot points flow smoothly into one another, or are there some logical gaps?

, Remember that spell check alone doesn't always do the job. Only you can catch the difference between to, too, and two, or their, there, and they're. Although they may be spelled correctly, they may not be used in the correct context.

, For this draft, take more time thinking about each section as you analyze, edit or re-write it. Think about bigger changes like moving sections of the story around.

, This is an important step, as other people will see what you actually wrote, and not just what you think you wrote.


Get feedback from someone whose opinion you respect and trust, and who either reads a lot or writes themselves.
Ask them to be honest and thorough. Only honest feedback, even if it's a wholesale criticism of your entire story, can make you a better writer.
If they need some guidance, give them the same questions you've been asking yourself.
This is particularly critical if any aspect of your story revolves around a technical area in which you're not an expert. Make sure at least one of your readers is an expert in that area.
Join a writer's group in your area or online to share your writing, read others' writing, and provide mutual feedback.

, You don't have to like or agree with everything that's said to you about your work. On the other hand, if you get the same comment from more than one person, you should probably take it very seriously. Strike a balance between keeping aspects that you want and making changes based on input you trust.


Re-read the story with your readers' comments in the back of your head. Note any gaps, places that need to be cut, or areas needing revision.
Re-write using the insights gained from your readers and from your own subsequent critical reading.

, Cut out words that serve only as window dressing. If a word isn't essential to the telling of the story, or the semantics of the sentence, omit it. It's better to have too few words than too many. Too many words and your writing becomes stuffy, pompous, or unreadable. Be especially careful of:


Adjectives. Adjectives describe nouns, but sometimes the description is redundant. Beginning writers often make the mistake of peppering their writing with far too many adjectives in an attempt to ""be descriptive.""

Take the sentence: ""He stepped aside, an indignant wrath boiling up inside his loins."" ""Indignant"" means angry, but so does ""wrath."" Here, the adjective is just getting in the way without offering anything new. Far better would have been: ""He stepped aside, wrath boiling up inside his loins.""



Idioms and slang. Idioms, such as ""a piece of cake"" or ""foam at the mouth,"" don't always translate into enjoyable writing. Like slang, they date the piece (who says ""suck the milk of nations"" anymore?) and can be misinterpreted (can you decipher slang from the 1920s?).

, In the beginning, practice writing like Hemingway instead of Faulkner. If you're not familiar with either' work, here's a comparison. Which one do you find easier to understand?



""Maera lay still, his head on his arms, his face in the sand. He felt warm and sticky from the bleeding. Each time he felt the horn coming. Sometimes the bull only bumped him with his head. Once the horn went all the way through him and he felt it go into the sand. Some one had the bull by the tail. They were swearing at him and flopping the cape in his face. Then the bull was gone."" — Ernest Hemingway, In Our Time.

""It was of the men, not white nor black nor red but men, hunters, with the will and hardihood to endure and the humility and skill to survive, and the dogs and the bear and deer juxtaposed and relieved against it, ordered and compelled by and within the wilderness in the ancient and unremitting contest according to the ancient and unmitigable rules which voided all regrets and brooked no quarter;"" — William Faulkner, The Bear.

, Verbs are perhaps your best friends. A well-placed verb will make a sentence dazzle and keep it free from other kinds of words, such as adjectives or nouns, that can clutter it up. Ezra Pound once said that, at its most basic, a sentence is a transfer of power.Verbs help make that transfer possible.


Take the following sentence: ""He went into the room."" There's nothing wrong with this sentence. On the other hand, it's a little bland. You can spice the sentence up, and be more specific, by introducing a subtler verb instead of ""went."" How about ""crept,"" or ""barreled,"" or ""slid"" instead?
Use the active voice instead of the passive voice, as a rule of thumb.

Active voice: ""The dog found his master."" Here, the dog is doing the work, so to speak. He is actively finding his master.
Passive voice: ""The master is found by his dog."" Here, the dog is more removed from the action. The master is being found; the dog isn't finding.



, Expanding your vocabulary will give you the option of being more precise with your words. You shouldn't use a ""big"" or ""fancy"" word when there is a more commonplace word that means the same thing, but you may be forced to use a big word every once in a while. Those big words are like a rainy-day fund: use them sparingly and only in a pinch.


How many people do you think know the definition of ""sesquipedalian?"" Not very many, probably. (It means ""long"" or ""long-winded."") If you're going to use it, use it in the right context. It probably won't fit next to more ordinary words, but it may work if you're using ""sesquipedalian"" to be ironic, satirical, or funny.
Get in the habit of memorizing technical words. If you want to describe a house, you're probably going to need to know some architecture terms: ""eaves,"" ""columns,"" ""façade,"" ""trim,"" ""jamb,"" and the list goes on. Because these are technical terms, there aren't really any synonyms for them. You're stuck with either calling it ""gold trim"" or ""gold stuff on the side of the wall."" You decide which sounds better.

, Figurative language include metaphors and similes, which you've probably already heard of. Use figurative language sparingly, but for effect. ""The cleats were hard and misshapen"" might be made more vivid by introducing a simile: ""The cleats were hard and misshapen, like some shell spit forth by the sea.""

, You probably think punctuation is boring, and you may be right. The thing is, it's supposed to be boring. Punctuation helps us understand what words arranged in a certain way mean, and virtually nothing beyond that. It should be there, but not noticeable. People make the mistake of trying to get punctuation do too much, be flashy, or call attention to it, whether purposely or not.


Exclamation points. Use exclamation points sparingly. People don't often exclaim things; nor do sentences often merit exclamation. Elmore Leonard, the great crime writer, has this to say: ""Keep your exclamation points under control. You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose.""
Semicolons. Semicolons act as hybrid periods, connecting two sentences that have logical connection. Still, Kurt Vonnegut argues against them: ""Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you've been to college.""Although Vonnegut's assessment might be a little harsh, it's probably only good to use them from time to time.

, Archaic writing means you use writing conventions that people writing 300 years ago preferred. Archaic writing is hard to understand, sounds less natural to the modern ear, and — believe it or not — is harder to write.



Archaic: ""The reasons are fourfold.""


Modern: ""There are four reasons.""




, Think of what you want to say before you say it. Try to get to the point where your words consciously reflect thoughts. A lot of people simply put words onto paper and hope that they're somehow in the same ballpark as what they originally meant. This is just plain lazy writing.

, For example, you don't need email notifications if you constantly check ManageBac. Some notifications might just annoy you in email and then you would consider it spam, so to turn it off, turn off the notification settings., The message box is at the top right corner of the ManageBac page.

, Click Add event. This button is next to the Full calendar button. To continue adding an event, type in the name of the event. For example, ""Cross Country"". You can choose whether or not to add a location and notes but the name of the event is a must.

, Pick the date of the event from the calendar. Then select the time of the event and whether or not it is am or pm. You can also choose whether or not the event is an all-day event. This means that the time doesn't matter. For example, a school carnival would be an all-day event but a cross country race wouldn't be an all-day event because it only lasts for 2 or 3 hours. Once you're done, click Add Event.





, Click or go to the event that you added. At the top right corner of the event page, you can see two buttons: Edit Event and Delete. You know what to do. Click Edit Event to edit the event and similarly, click Delete to delete the event. Have fun with ManageBac!

Put an ""-s"" after most nouns to make the word plural.,
Be on the lookout for compound nouns.,
Put an ""-es"" after words that end with ""-ch"", ""-sh"", ""-x"", ""-z"", ""-s"" or sounds like these letter combinations.,
Put an ""-es"" after words ending in ""-o"" preceded by a consonant.,
Put an ""-es"" after words ending in ""-y"" preceded by a consonant.,
Put an ""-es"" after some words ending in an ""f"" sound.,
Be aware of mutated plurals.,
Be aware of collective nouns.",How to Use Plurals and Possessives in Writing2," ""Cat"" means there is a only one cat. ""Cats"" means that there is more than one cat. This covers most words in the English language.


An ""-s"" without an apostrophe is also used to show the plural of an acronym in all capitals (such as ""POWs"" for ""prisoners of war"" or ""RBIs"" for ""runs batted in"") or for decade labels such as the 1880s or 1950s. (When the decade label is abbreviated, such as ""'50s"" for ""1950s"", an apostrophe is used before the number 50 to show the truncation.)
An apostrophe -s may be used to indicate a plural for single lowercase letters, abbreviations with periods or other abbreviations where the ""s"" alone would be confusing such as ""x's"". Generally, apostrophes are only used for lower-case letters. Capital letters and numbers, such as used in ""MP3s,"" do not require an apostrophe. In general, an apostrophe is not used to indicate a plural.Abbreviations for units of measure do not have plural forms, while abbreviations used to indicate parts of writing either take no plural (""ch"" for ""chapter"" or ""chapters"") or a single letter for the singular and a double letter for plural (""p"" for ""page"", but ""pp"" for ""pages"").

, Certain compound words require identifying which word is the word being pluralized. For compound words such as ""daughter-in-law"" or ""attorney general"", the first word is pluralized (""daughters-in-law"" or ""attorneys general"").

, For example, the plural of ""ditch"" is ""ditches"", the plural of ""brush"" is ""brushes"", the plural of ""fox"" is ""foxes"", the plural of ""fuzz"" is ""fuzzes"" and the plural of ""dress"" is ""dresses.""


If the word already ends in ""-e"", the plural is formed by adding an ""-s"": the plural of ""judge"" is ""judges"", and the plural of ""phrase"" is ""phrases.""
Some plurals of words ending in ""-s"" double the final ""s"" before adding the plural suffix. The plural form of ""bus"" may be written as either ""buses"" or ""busses"", depending on whether ""bus"" refers to a vehicle (""buses"") or an electronic component (""busses"")., The plural of ""tomato"" is ""tomatoes"", and the plural of ""zero"" is ""zeroes.""


Words ending in ""-o"" followed by a single consonant that English gets from another language typically form their plurals by adding ""-s"". The plural of ""piano"" is ""pianos"".Some words ending in ""-o"" preceded by a consonant can form their plurals using either ""-es"" or ""-s."" The plural of ""tornado"" can be written either ""tornadoes"" or ""tornadoes"", and the plural of ""volcano"" can be written either ""volcanoes"" or ""volcanoes"".

, First, however, you need to change the ""-y"" to an ""-i."" For example, the plural of ""berry"" is ""berries"", and the plural of ""lady"" is ""ladies.""This rule does not generally apply for proper names that end in ""-y"": the plural of ""Tony"" (the man's name or the theater award) is ""Tonys.""
A few words ending in ""-y"" preceded by a vowel also change the ""y"" to an ""-i""; the plural of ""money"" can be written as ""monies.""

, You will need to change the ""-f"" to a ""-v."" The plural of ""calf"" is ""calves"", the plural of ""knife"" is ""knives"" and the plural of ""leaf"" is ""leaves"", except when referring to the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. However, the plural of ""proof"" is ""proofs"", not ""proves"", which is a form of the verb ""to prove."" Some words ending with ""-f"" can form their plurals by either adding ""-s"" or changing the ""f"" to a ""v"" and adding ""-es"", such as ""hoof"" (""hoofs"" or ""hooves"") or ""staff"" (""staffs"" or ""staves""). For some words, the preferred form depends on usage; the plural of ""dwarf"" is ""dwarfs"" when referring to short real people and ""dwarves"" when referring to a race in fantasy literature.
It is helpful to consult a dictionary if you aren't sure whether you need to convert the ""-f"" to a ""-v"".

, Mutated plurals have irregular plural forms. For example, “children” is the plural of “child” and “women” is the plural of “woman.” Latin and Greek words are another form of mutated plurals. These nouns maintain their Latin and Greek form when they are plural. For example, ""criterion"" or ""phenomenon"" form their plurals by dropping the ""-on"" and adding an ""-a"" (""criteria"", ""phenomena"").
Other unusual plurals include ""mice"" (plural of ""mouse""), ""geese"" (plural of ""goose""), and ""feet"" (plural of ""foot""). ""Sheep"" and ""moose"" are the same as singular or plural nouns in English.

, Collective nouns are singular when they refer to a group and plural when they refer to an individual. Some common collective nouns are “group,” “staff,” “team,” family,” “audience,” committee.” Staff is singular in this sentence because the the group is acting as a unit: “The staff is very satisfied.” Staff is plural in this sentence because the sentence is referring to what individuals are doing: “The staff are working in different locations this week.”


Names of companies ,organizations and sports teams are considered singular. The sports team, the “Tennessee Titans,” is singular even though there is an “s” on the end.
American and British English conventions differ on whether to use plural verbs with collective nouns. American English usually uses singular verbs with collective nouns, such as ""The crowd is going wild for this team."" British English may use a singular or plural verb with collective nouns, such as ""The crowd are going wild for this team."""
"
Form the possessive of a common or proper singular noun by adding an apostrophe followed by an ""s."" This rule can be applied to all singular nouns, whether they end in ""s"" or not.,
Form the possessive of a plural noun by adding an apostrophe.,
Form the possessive of a personal pronoun without using an apostrophe.,
Form the possessive of compound nouns carefully.",How to Use Plurals and Possessives in Writing3," For example, ""Agnes's book,"" ""Mary's book,"" and ""the dog's toy"" all follow this rule. , If the word ends in an ""s,"" add an apostrophe after the ""s."" If the word does not end in an ""s,"" add an apostrophe followed by an ""s.""If you want to make an irregular plural noun possessive, you need to add an apostrophe followed by an “s.”


The possessive form of ""lions"" would be ""lions' "", while the possessive form of ""children"" would be ""children's"", as in ""The children's toys fell into the lions' den at the zoo.""

, The correct forms of the third person singular ""he"", ""she"" or ""it"" are ""his"", ""hers"" and ""its"", without apostrophes. The correct form of the first person ""I"" is ""my"" if the item possessed is named and ""mine"" if it isn't. Similarly, the possessive forms of the first person plural ""we"" are ""our"" and ""ours"", respectively; for ""you"", they are ""your"" and ""yours"", respectively; and for ""they"", they are ""their"" and ""theirs"", respectively. , The placement of an apostrophe is different when the nouns act separately or together. In this sentence, the compound nouns are acting separately: “Jane’s and John’s bikes are in the garage.” Both Jane and John have their own bike in the garage. In this sentence the compound nouns are acting collectively: “John and Jane’s bike is in the garage.” This sentence indicates that John and Jane share possession of a bike.


Just think if the entities share ownership over what they possess, then they also share the apostrophe. If they own separate things, then they each need their own apostrophe.
While the first component in a compound noun, such as ""daughter-in-law"" or ""attorney general"", may pluralize the first word in the compound, the possessive is always appended to the last word in the compound, as in ""daughter-in-law's"" or “attorney general’s.” In the case of the plural possessive, it would be acceptable to write ""daughters-in-law's"" or ""attorneys general's"", but it would be less confusing to show possession with a prepositional phrase, such as ""of my daughters-in-law"" or ""of the attorneys general.""

"
"
Use active voice.,
Reduce phrases to words.,
Omit expletives.",How to Win a 25 Words or Less Competition2," Sentences that use passive voice are much wordier than sentences that use active voice. In active voice, the subject of the sentence is doing the action.For example, “The paper was completed before the deadline by Jessica” is wordier than “Jessica completed her paper before the deadline.”

, Reduce descriptive and modifying phrases to one word. Replace a descriptive phrase that follows a noun with one-word adjectives. For example, “People who are experienced with taking photos know how to manipulate lighting,” can be revised to “Experienced photographers know how to manipulate lighting.”A modifying phrase can be reduced to an adverb. For example, “Sympathizing with his pain, she listened to his story,” can be replaced with “She listened sympathetically to his painful story.”

, Expletives like “there is” and “there are” are wordy. They are also a weak way to start a sentence. Instead, be more direct.For example, instead of saying “There are a lot of people around the world that love chocolate,” say, “People around the world love chocolate.”

Know the criteria.,
Customize your entry.,
Think outside of the box.,
Count your words.,
Check your spelling and grammar.",How to Win a 25 Words or Less Competition3," This way, you know what kind of answer you should provide. The terms and conditions usually include the criteria that will be used by the judges to judge the entries. The criteria is usually something like “the most creative and original” or “the most inspiring.”For instance, if the competition’s criteria is creativity, then you might decide to write a poem or a short story.
Also, remember to read the prompt carefully.

, Are the judges the promoters, the owner of the company hosting the competition, the suppliers of the prize, or an independent panel? Find out who the judges are and tailor your response to them.For example, if the CEO of Macy’s is the judge, then tailor your answer to be something about Macy’s or shopping at Macy’s.
Avoid providing ready-made answers that you have used many times before.

, To think outside of the box is to view things from a different perspective. This means stepping outside of your comfort zone when faced with a challenge. Instead of relying on tried and tested methods, choose a different method.


By stepping into another role, you can view something from a different perspective. For example, pretend you are a person from a different time period, like the 1940s, and answer the prompt from this perspective.
Try reframing things in order to view something from a different perspective. For example, instead of looking at the glass half empty, look at the glass half full.

, Try to make the most of the word limit, but do not go over it. You will be disqualified if you exceed the word limit, even if it is only exceeded by a single word. Keep track of your words by counting them as you go along.Make sure to count your words before you submit, as well.
Before submitting, check that your personal information is correct as well, for example, your e-mail address, phone number, and other identifying information.

, Spelling and grammar are also important. Even if you have great content, too many spelling and grammar errors can prevent you from winning. Therefore, remember to double-check your spelling and grammar before you submit.There are websites online that can help you improve your grammar and spelling, for example, you can use Grammar Book, Grammarly, Purdue Online Writing Lab, Daily Grammar, and Dr.Grammar, to name a few."

Focus on the plot.,
Outline your story.,
Decide on what your climax will be.,
Don’t over plan to avoid predictability.,
Home in on the plot.",How to Transition from Non Fiction to Fiction Writing1," In some ways, this aspect of writing fiction is not so different from nonfiction, because you’re still telling a story in nonfiction.


In both places, you are building tension throughout the story by releasing information little by little, until you reach the climax.
However, in fiction, it’s all about the story, whereas in nonfiction, the story may be secondary to other essential information.;
, Whether you are writing a short story or a novel, having a plan will help you get started.


Outline how characters meet and what happens to move the plot along.
Outlining your fiction will help you make sure your work continues moving at a steady pace.

, What will be the crux of the story? What is its central point? You will be moving towards the climax throughout your whole story, so make sure it is well developed.


A climax could be a sudden realization, a couple coming together, a car crash, a death, etc.
Make sure your climax flows naturally with the story.
Although the climax should conclude a period of suspense, it should not come out of nowhere.

, Though it depends on the writer, many writers feel the story does better if they have a general idea of where it will go, but leave some things open ended.


That way, you’ll make discoveries along the way.
If you are surprised, then your reader will be, too.

, The setting is important, but if you use focus too much on the setting, your readers will skip over it to get to the plot.


In all fiction writing, the plot is the backbone of the piece.
Without a well-developed plot taking center stage, fiction loses its sense of purpose and drive.

, Write ""____ is: ....."" You can skip this step if you have already written a sentence or have one in mind.

, Always ask yourself ""why is this here?"" You need to keep track of what your audience knows and what they may need to be told or reminded of.

, Concision and accuracy are your objectives. Unfortunately they also contradict. You must remain as concise as possible, but you also need to describe as thoroughly as possible. This is why scientific and academic writing is ""dense."" Its object is to get a point across, not to be fun to read.

, Try to get a feel for whether they need something more concise or more detailed. Everyone has a different preference. If the writing is for school, ask the teacher about it. Run specific sentences by them if you can and ask them for their opinion. Once you understand what they want writing for them will be easier.

, Leave the writing alone for an hour, a day, a week, then a month if you can. But leave it at least for a day.

Make your characters unique.,
Think about how the motivations of the characters move the plot along.,
Try making short scenes with your character, including dialogue.,
Choose a point of view.",How to Transition from Non Fiction to Fiction Writing2," While you have characters in some sense in nonfiction (depending on what you’re writing), your characters in fiction will need to be created from the ground up, so creating character sheets can be helpful.


Write down their physical characteristics, their likes and dislikes, and what keeps them awake at night.
Think about what motivates them and what they fear.
Draw a diagram of how your characters interact.
You can base these characters on people from your real life, if you chose, but you should probably disguise them somewhat.

, Don't forget to give your characters quirks, flaws, and personalities.


Your readers want real characters they identify with.
Also, include diversity; your characters should reflect real life.

, What do they want that makes the plot move forward?


It’s their desires and their secrets that will help you tell the story.
Dig deep into your own emotions.
If you’re emotionally honest through your characters, your readers will be able to tell.

, Dialogue can be really difficult to write at first.


Try reading it aloud to see if it sounds awkward; you’ll be able to tell.
You don’t have to use full sentences, as we often don’t speak in full sentences in real life.
When writing dialogue for your story, think about whether it moves the plot along or not. If it doesn’t, cut it out.

, Decide who’s going to be telling the story, as well as what the readers know and what the characters know.


Choose first or third person, and stick with it throughout the story.
The point of view that you choose will have a large impact on the perspective of the story, so give this decision a good amount of thought.

Look closely at your writing style to decide if it needs changing.,
Think about diction to create a specific mood in your work.,
Try writing short stories first.,
Use writing prompts to get yourself started.,

Read writing books to understand the technical aspects.,
Take a one-day workshop or a long-term writing class.,
Find people for editing and workshopping.",How to Transition from Non Fiction to Fiction Writing3," Depending on what kind of nonfiction you have been writing, you may need to change your style a bit for fiction writing.


For instance, journalistic writing is very short and choppy. That style can work in fiction, but you might also try writing slightly more complex sentences.
Don’t be afraid to try different ways of starting a sentence. Varying length and structure will keep your reader more interested in the writing.

, Diction refers to the words you choose to set a mood.


For instance, “protest” and “objection” are listed as synonyms. However, “protest” has political overtones, while “objection” is sometimes used in court.
Therefore, their connotations, the meanings they have separate from their dictionary definitions, are quite different.
Choose the word the best fits your story and the tone you are trying to set.

, Starting out with short fiction can be a good way to dip your toes into the world of fiction writing.


In fact, you can begin with flash fiction, which is generally under 1,000 words (depending on who you ask).
Longer fiction takes more planning and development, so beginning with something shorter will help you learn the craft.

, Using writing prompts can be a good way to to explore fiction writing, without the burden of long plot brainstorming sessions.


You can find writing prompts online, or you can use a special object or an old photograph.
Use anything that will help get you started writing.

, Read all genres of fiction to get a broad understanding for what genres are included in fiction writing.


This will help you become a better writer, because you will be exposed to different styles of writing and different ways of telling a story.

, Though they may not be the most entertaining, they will help you hone your craft.


You can also find an ample amount of material on the internet to help you learn to write better.

, Workshop leaders will usually teach you about a particular style of writing.


You’ll also spend time writing in a workshop, in the style that they are teaching you.
Classes will help you delve more thoroughly into writing.
You’ll also find peers doing the same thing you are, which is invaluable; they’ll know what you are struggling with and can help you become a better writer.

, Workshopping is different from a workshop, as it is more focused on editing what you have already written.


In workshops, you may pass out your work beforehand or exchange it at the meeting.
You can find people to workshop with at your local library, in writing classes, and even online.

Determine whether you have a dictionary-style thesaurus or a traditional format.,
Find the word alphabetically, then proceed to the entry.,
Select the synonym you will use.",How to Use a Thesaurus1," A dictionary style thesaurus has an alphabetical list of words, like a dictionary, with a short list of synonyms for each one. A more traditional layout has an index that will send you to a longer, numbered entry.
,

In a dictionary thesaurus, you'll find the words alphabetically in the main body of the book, followed immediately by a list of synonyms. Some terms (in the photo, the ones in SMALL CAPS) may be cross references. If you want one of these senses, look up those entries, instead.


 


In a traditional format, use the alphabetical index at the back. That will lead you to a number.





The number takes you to the entry. The reason for this extra step is to allow longer, more detailed entries. Rather than list a small selection of synonyms for each term, with a lot of duplication, there is an index to longer, numbered entries. All the words in the entry will appear in the index just once.







, Make certain that you know what the word means and whether it suits your purposes before you use it. For instance, the entry for ""intention"" contains both ""goal"" and ""raison d'être"". Though they are both valid synonyms, they have different meanings and connotations. If you don't know that the French phrase refers to a reason for being rather than a short-term objective, consult a dictionary to find out, or select a different term."

, If it is something that exists, you'll need to look at pictures or video to make sure you describe it correctly. If you are describing something in your mind, take an extra moment to really picture it.

,, Accurate language is used to make writing more accurate and concise, but common writing is easier to read. Your audience determines the balance you should use. Does your audience prefer ""cried"" or ""mourned."" Will they get a better picture from ""released"" or ""radiated."" And will they appreciate the use of ""ursa minor"" over ""constellation"" or do they not care?

, It's the writer's mantra. In all ways do your very best to show what is happening rather than tell what is happening. ""the sword fell from his hand and he gave up"" might be more interesting as ""the sword slipped from his sweaty hands as he fell to his knees."" Creative writing is all about holding people's attention, so give them interesting details to pay attention to.

Use strong verbs in the sentence.,
Start the sentence with a verb.,
Make the sentence more descriptive with an adverb.,
Make the sentence into a question.",How to Uplevel a Sentence1," Strong verbs are usually connected to a direct action the subject is doing in the sentence. They carry a specific meaning. Avoid weak verbs, such as ""to be"" or ""have."" Strong verbs will grab the reader’s attention and add more intent to the sentence.For example, rather than write, “The man was going up the hill,” you may write, “The man strode up the hill” or “The man ran up the hill.”
You may also use strong verbs in an academic paper to describe a source. For example, rather than write, “Shakespeare has an argument that man is trapped by his own ambition,” you may write, “Shakespeare argued that man is trapped by his own ambition.”;
, This will put the reader right in the heart of the action from the very start. Use a verb with -ing at the end, followed by a comma. The verb should describe the action of the subject in the sentence.For example, you may write, “Jogging, Mark nearly stumbled over a rock.” Or you may write, “Screaming, Sarah crawled away from the bear.”

, Adverbs are a great option for adding more description and detail to a sentence. Adverbs end in -ly and describe the verb in the sentence. It should appear after the verb.For example, you may write, “Fred sang soulfully to the crowd,” or “Della wept quietly in the corner.”

, Sometimes you can uplevel a sentence by transforming it into a question. Having questions in a paragraph can help to vary the sentence type and add complexity to your writing. Use “who,” “what,” “where,” “how,” and “why” to start the question.For example, you may change a sentence like “I wonder how you dig a hole in winter” to “How do you dig a hole in winter?” or “I question why we say a prayer before dinner” to “Why do we say a prayer before dinner?”

"
"
Improve the sentence with more than one adjective.,
Describe an emotion with an adjective.,
Repeat the same adjective twice.,
Create similes and metaphors with nouns.",How to Uplevel a Sentence2," Adjectives should describe the subject of the sentence in detail. They should paint a detailed picture of the subject for the reader. Having more than one adjective will add more detail and give the reader a better sense of the subject. Use a comma to separate the two adjectives.For example, you may write, “He was a tall, lanky man” or “She had a wide, eager face.”
Having more than two adjectives in one sentence to describe the subject can make the sentence wordy and confusing. Try to have no more than two adjectives in a sentence.

, You can also use adjectives in the sentence to tell the reader how a subject is feeling emotionally. Place the adjective at the beginning of the sentence and end it with -ed. You can have more than one adjective at the beginning of the sentence, but try not to have more than one to two at a time.For example, you may write, “Confused and scared, the kids ran from the room.”
You do not have to use “and” to separate the two adjectives. For example, you may write, “Elated, thrilled, she held up the winning trophy.”

, Another way you can use adjectives to uplevel your sentence is through repetition. Use a comma to separate the adjectives. Try to only use the same adjectives twice in a sentence. Repeating it three to four times can make the sentence feel redundant.For example, you may write, “She was a quick study, quick because she had to be” or “It was a cold night, so cold you could see your breath outside.”

, Similes and metaphors compare one thing to another. You can use descriptive nouns to create similes and metaphors. Adding them to a sentence can give it more detail and complexity.Similes use “like” or “as” to describe a subject. For example, you may write, “She was as skinny as a pole” or “She is like a raging tornado.”
Metaphors compare one thing to another without “like” or “as.” For example, you may write, “He was a bull in a museum,” or “He is the missing piece in the puzzle.”

"
"
Use “but,” “so,” and “and.” Connecting terms can be a good way to extend the length of a sentence and make it more complex.,
Make a compound sentence with a colon.,
Create a compound sentence with a semicolon.",How to Uplevel a Sentence3," “But,” “so,” “and”, and “yet” are all good connectors you can put in a sentence to give it more detail. Always put a comma before the connector.For example, you may write, “She wanted to go to the party, but she had homework to do first.” Or you may write, “He finished dinner early, so he went for a walk around the neighborhood.”
Another example would be, “They ran through the square shouting, and it angered the locals,” or “We needed another person, yet we resisted asking our mother.”

, Compound sentences is when two independent clauses are brought together. Use a colon to separate the two clauses so they are still distinct and easy to read. Only combine two clauses that relate to each other directly.For example, you may write, “I was tired: I hadn’t slept in two days” or “She was confused: she hadn’t seen the smoke in the woods.”

, You can also make a compound sentence with “some” and “others” using a semicolon instead of a colon. This is a good option if you want to compare two groups or perspectives in one sentence.For example, you may write, “Some people love swimming; others can’t stand being in water” or “Some enjoy talking; others prefer to listen.”

Focus on tone in your diction.,
Pick words that cater to your tone.,
Consider your age group to adjust your vocabulary.,
Use alliteration to add spice to your prose.,
Think about sound as you are writing.,
Use metaphorical language to add interest to your word choice.",How to Use Better Word Choice in Stories1," The tone is just the mood of a story, how it feels, and your word choice plays into setting it up.


For instance, “surly” and “morose” are listed as synonyms.
However, “surly” focuses more on irritability and gruffness, while “morose” focuses more on sadness.
They have very different connotations. A connotation is the meaning or the feeling that goes beyond the dictionary definition of the word.;
, When choosing words, pick ones that play into your tone, rather than work against it.


A dark, noir-type story needs dark words, not ones that bring to mind rainbows and sunshine.
On the other hand, a cheerful story needs cheerful words.

, Focus on the group you’re writing towards.


One way to tell what kind of vocabulary you should use is to read in the genre you’re writing in, as it will help you to develop a sense of the vocabulary level.
You don’t want to use extremely long words for 6-year-olds, but that doesn’t mean you can’t throw in the occasional long word in a kid’s book, as it helps them improve their vocabulary.
The same holds true for adult books. Certain genres (such as romance) have simpler vocabularies than other genres (literary fiction, poetry).

, While alliteration (the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words) isn’t used as often in stories, it can still be beneficial to your writing.


It can make it sound more poetic.
Try using it in places where it is not forced.

, The sounds of the words you choose should reflect the mood of the story.


Is this a harsh story? Then your word sounds should reflect that with harsh, guttural consonant sounds, such as “kick,” “punk,” and “puncture.”
If it is a softer story, try softer sounds, like “hush,” smoothing,” and “wash.”

, You don’t always need to use a literal word to describe something.


For instance, you don’t have to say “The sky was blue.”
Instead, you can say, “The sky was the color of the ocean just before dusk.”
It’s longer, but it gives the reader a better picture of what the sky actually looked like at the time.

Simplify your writing when possible.,
Keep diction in mind during revisions.,
Think about your audience during revisions.,
Choose the most specific word possible.",How to Use Better Word Choice in Stories2," Don’t make your writing overly complicated.


Keep it simple, because your reader does not want to look up every other word.
Use big words like a potent spice; spread them sparingly throughout your writing. They will make your writing better, while still keeping the writing enjoyable for the reader.
Cut out most adverbs. Most of the time, they aren’t needed, so use them sparingly throughout your writing.
Look for other unnecessary words, such as “like,” “so,” and “then.” Cut out what’s not needed.
Cut out repetition and don’t use the same word over and over.
Your reader will get tired of reading words such as “like” over and over again, so change up your word choice to keep your diction natural.

, Don’t just think about diction while you’re writing, consider it while you’re revising.


Look at each word and consider how it fits into the whole.
Is it really the best word for the sentence? For the story?

, If you have a wide, general audience, consider keeping words that will appeal to a variety of people.


For instance, avoid slang, since slang tends to be generation-specific.
For a wide audience, keep it simpler, but don’t be afraid to add in a few bigger words in places.
However, if you are writing for a particular age group, feel free to add in some slang terms, as long as you are sure you know how to use them right.

, During revisions, make your word choice more precise by finding the words that most specifically express your meaning.


For instance, don’t just say the streetlight was “strange.” Say it was “eerie.”
“Eerie” has a much spookier effect than “strange.”
Similarly, if you are writing a sentence about rainbows, choosing words related to color makes sense, because it plays on the theme: “The rainbow stretched across the watery blue sky like a handful of violets and roses arched over a vase of water.”
By choosing flowers that have color names instead of just saying “wildflowers,” you’re reinforcing the subject of the sentence.
In another example, if you are writing about a fight, you want to choose visceral words to describe it, ones that metaphorically punch the reader in the gut: “He lashed out with one arm, blindly punching into the dark before connecting flesh to flesh.”
Words like “lashed,” “punching,” and “flesh” all create vivid imagery in the readers’ minds.

Revise your draft.",How to Summarize a Journal Article," Abstracts are short paragraphs written by the author to summarize research articles. Abstracts are usually included in most academic journals and are generally no more than 100-200 words. The abstract provides a short summary of the content of the journal article, providing you with important highlights of the research study.


The purpose of an abstract is to allow researchers to quickly scan a journal and see if specific research articles are applicable to the work they are doing. If you're collecting research on immune system responses in rodents, you'll be able to know in 100 words not only whether or not the research is in your field, but whether the conclusions back up your own findings, or differ from it.
Remember that an abstract and an article summary are two different things, so an article summary that looks just like the abstract is a poor summary.An abstract is highly condensed and cannot provide the same level of detail regarding the research and its conclusions that a summary can.;
, Make sure you know what specifically the authors will be discussing or analyzing, why the research or the topic matters, whether or not the article is written in response to another article on the topic, etc. By doing this, you'll learn what arguments, quotes, and data to pick out and analyze in your summary.

, Skip ahead to the conclusion and find out where the proposed research ends up to learn more about the topic and to understand where the complicated outlines and arguments will be leading. It's much easier to comprehend the information if you read the researchers' conclusions first.


You still need to go back and actually read the article after coming to the conclusion, but only if the research is still applicable. If you're collecting research, you may not need to digest another source that backs up your own if you're looking for some dissenting opinions.

, To avoid having to read through the whole thing twice to remind yourself of the main idea, make sure you get it right the first time. Take notes as you read and highlight or underline main ideas.


Pay special attention to the beginning paragraph or two of the article. This is where the author will most likely lay out their thesis for the entire article. Figure out what the thesis is and determine the main argument or idea that the author or authors are trying to prove with the research.

Look for words like hypothesis, results, typically, generally, or clearly to give you hints about which sentence is the thesis.


Underline, highlight, or rewrite the main argument of the research in the margins. Keep yourself focused on this main point, so you'll be able to connect the rest of the article back to that idea and see how it works together.
In the humanities, it's sometimes more difficult to get a clear and concise thesis for an article because they are often about complex, abstract ideas (like class in post-modern poetics, or feminist film, for example). If it's unclear, try to articulate it for yourself, as best as you can understand the author's ideas and what they're attempting to prove with their analysis.

, Continue reading through the various segments of the journal article, highlighting main points discussed by the authors. Focus on key concepts and ideas that have been proposed, trying to connect them back to that main idea the authors have put forward in the beginning of the article.


Different areas of focus within a journal article will usually be marked with sub-section titles that target a specific step or development during the course of the research study. The titles for these sub-sections are usually bold and in a larger font than the remaining text.
Keep in mind that academic journals are often dry reading. Is it absolutely necessary to read through the author's 500 word proof of the formulas used in the glycerine solution fed to the frogs in the research study? Maybe, but probably not. It's usually not essential to read research articles word-for-word, as long as you're picking out the main idea, and why the content is there in the first place.

, Efficiency is key when you're doing research and collecting information from academic journals. Read actively as you comb through the material. Circle or highlight each individual portion of the journal article, focusing on the sub-section titles.These segments will usually include an introduction, methodology, research results, and a conclusion in addition to a listing of references.

, In a quick free write, describe the academic journey of the article, listing the steps taken from starting point to concluding results, describing methodology and the form of the study undertaken.There is no need to be too specific; that's what the actual summary will be for.


When you're first getting started, it's helpful to turn your filter off and just quickly write out what you remember from the article. These will help you discover the main points necessary to summarize.

, You might refer to these as the main supporting ideas, or sections, of the article. While these may be marked clearly with subheadings, they may require more work to uncover. Anything that's a major point used to support the main argument of the author needs to be present in the summary.


Depending on the research, you may want to describe the theoretical background of the research, or the assumptions of the researchers. In scientific writing, it's important to clearly summarize the hypotheses the researchers outlined before undertaking the research, as well as the procedures used in following through with the project. Summarize briefly any statistical results and include a rudimentary interpretation of the data for your summary.
In humanities articles, it's usually good to summarize the fundamental assumptions and the school of thought from which the author comes, as well as the examples and the ideas presented throughout the article.

, Make sure all the major keywords that are used in the article make it into your summary. It's important that you fully examine the meanings of these more complicated terms so that your summary reader can grasp the content as you move forward with the summary.


Any words or terms that the author coins need to be included and discussed in your summary.

, Journal summaries don't need to be anywhere close to the length of the articles themselves. The purpose of the summary is to provide a condensed but separate description of the research, either for use for the primary research collector, or to help you redigest the information at a later date in the research process.


As a general rule of thumb, you can probably make one paragraph per main point, ending up with no more than 500-1000 words, for most academic articles. For most journal summaries, you'll be writing several short paragraphs that summarize each separate portion of the journal article.

,, You're not critiquing the article, you're giving an overview of it., Toward the beginning of the article, possibly in the introduction, the authors should discuss the focus of the research study and what the targeted objectives were for conducting the research. This is where your summary should begin. Describe, in your own words, the main argument the authors hope to prove with their research.


In scientific articles, usually there is an introduction which establishes the background for the experiment or study, and won't provide you with much to summarize. It will be followed by the development of a research question and testing procedures, though, which are key in dictating the content for the rest of the article.

, This portion discusses the research tools and methods used during the study.In other words, you need to summarize how the authors or researchers came to the conclusions they came to with first-hand research or data collection.


The specifics of the testing procedures don't usually need to be included in your summary in their entirety; they should be reduced to a simple idea of how the research question was addressed. The results of the study will usually be processed data, sometimes accompanied by raw, pre-process data. Only the processed data needs to be included in the summary.

, One of the most important parts of the summary needs to be describing what the authors accomplished as a result of their work.Were the authors successful and did they meet their objectives for conducting the research? What conclusions have the authors drawn from this research? What are the implications of this research, as described in the article?


Make sure your summary covers the research question, the conclusions/results, and how those results were achieved. These are crucial parts of the article and cannot be left out.

, For some summaries, it's important to show how the relationships among the ideas presented by the authors develop over the course of the article. The primary objective of the summary is to present a brief overview of the authors' essential points to the reader, making it important that you unpack those arguments and explain them in your own words. Fill in the blanks and assumptions, helping to clarify the research and summarize it briefly.


This is sometimes more important in summaries dealing with articles in the humanities. For example, it might be helpful to unpack dense arguments about poet George Herbert's relationship to the divine with more pedestrian summaries: ""The author seeks to humanize Herbert by discussing his daily routines, as opposed to his philosophies.""

, A summary of an article shouldn't editorialize, or offer your own interpretations of the data, unless explicitly stated as part of the assignment. In general, the point of a summary is to summarize the authors' points, not to offer your own additions and editorials.


This can be difficult for some inexperienced research writers to get the hang of at first, but remember to keep the ""I"" out of it.

, Quotations are more often used when writing a college paper or essay, and are less important for a journal article summary. Focus more on paraphrasing the ideas when writing a journal article summary without losing focus of their meaning and intended content.

, Always use the present tense when you are discussing the contents of a scholarly article.This will help you maintain a parallel grammatical structure throughout.

, Good writing happens in revision. Go back and compare the focus and content of what you have written to see that it matches and supports the context of the journal article. A journal article that has been properly summarized provides potential readers with a short review, which is important when they are browsing and searching for specific information about a particular topic.

Determine why you need an ellipsis.,
Reduce length of block quotes.,
Get to the point.,
Make a pause or trail off.",How to Use an Ellipsis1," There are two main ways an ellipsis is used. One way is to indicate that a quote has been abbreviated. The other is to indicate a pause or trailing off, generally in speech.


You must be very careful not to influence the meaning of a quote when you replace text with an ellipsis. Only use an ellipsis to shorten a quote if a section is redundant or does not change the meaning.
Only use an ellipsis to indicate a pause or trailing off in creative or casual writing. An ellipsis used in this way in formal writing, such as for a student essay, would be seen as lazy or even perfunctory.;
, One reason to use an ellipsis to shorten a quote is because the quote is so long that it needs to be offset by increased margins, or “blocked.” It is desirable to eliminate the use of block quotes unless every word is necessary for the purpose of the paper.


For MLA formatting, block a quote if it is more than four lines of prose or three lines of poetry.For APA formatting, block a quote if it is 40 words or longer.For Chicago style formatting, block a quote if it is 100 words or longer.For example, here is a quote that is long enough to be blocked, but an ellipsis is inserted to make it fit in an essay without having to offset it as a block quote:

Original: ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only."" --Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities

With ellipsis: ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times ... for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only."" --Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities




, Another reason a writer would abbreviate a quote is to eliminate irrelevant information. A quote may not be long enough to block, but if it contains information that will distract the reader, a writer may choose to exclude it.


If you are a journalist with a low word limit, it's useful to remove sections of quotes that don’t greatly add to the meaning.If you want to omit the first part of a sentence because it does not add to the meaning of the quote, begin the quote with an ellipsis, following the capitalization of the sentence.
For example, we can abbreviate the last phrase of the Dickens quote used above even more using both an opening and interior ellipsis: ""... in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received ... in the superlative degree of comparison only."" --Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities

However, the opening ellipses is not necessary if you are using MLA format., If you’re writing an informal work, such as with creative writing, it is permissible to use ellipses to show that a character is thinking, hesitant, afraid, and so on. An ellipsis also creates an element of suspense when a character trails off because it presents an unresolved idea.


You can use an ellipsis in personal writing as well, such as in informal emails or diary entries. In this case, the ellipsis would indicate your thoughts have trailed off.
You also use the ellipsis technique to indicate that a character’s thoughts have trailed off, not just their dialogue.
For example, if you wanted to have a character in a story pause, they might say, ""I was running ... but then I fell.""
To show a character trailing off, they might simply say, ""I was running ...""

"
"
Choose a section of the quote.,
Study the quote.,
Create the ellipsis.,
Add a period when you delete a sentence.",How to Use an Ellipsis2," Although choosing which section of a quote to abbreviate for a student paper or published article is up to editorial discretion (ie, it’s up to you), you must be careful not to influence the meaning of the quote in any way.


To make sure you aren’t changing the meaning, choose words that are not essential to understanding a quotation.
Leave verbs and new subjects alone, but take out words that are already understood by the reader. In other words, it’s permissible to remove phrases that are redundant or repetitive.For example, here is another Charles Dickens quote, this time from the novel Our Mutual Friend: ""I cannot help it; reason has nothing to do with it; I love her against reason.""
Here is the quote with a redundant phrase removed: ""I cannot help it ... I love her against reason.""



, Write out the full quote and study it to determine which parts may not be necessary. Then use a highlighting tool to select these words and phrases. Read the quote aloud, omitting these highlighted words.


If you can tell that you have changed the meaning, work with the highlighted areas until you have preserved the original meaning of the quote.
For example, if you were working with the above quote, the bolded words are marked for removal: ""I cannot help it; reason has nothing to do with it; I love her against reason.""

, Once you have studied the quote and selected passages to omit, go ahead and delete or erase them. In place of the removed section(s), write an ellipsis.


If the removed section leaves the quote grammatically incorrect, add a word or short phrase that bridges the gaps in square brackets after the ellipsis.
For example, it would look like: ""She played in the sun ... hated it.""

, If you have determined it is possible to delete the rest of a sentence or a whole sentence, you need to add the period that would have been there after the ellipsis. The ellipsis would then look like it has four dots.Remember that an ellipsis has only three dots. The fourth dot is always a period.
Begin the next part of the quotation with a capital letter if it is the beginning of a new sentence.
For example, if you were quoting from the same passage as the Dickens quote in this method, you would take out the sentences we used above and leave the sentences around it like this:

""To enlighten with the lights of a stone passage, a flight of stairs, a brown window-curtain, and a black man .... What a use for the money, and how worthy of its old misuses!""



"
"
Choose where to add an ellipsis.,
Indicate passage of time.,
Indicate an unfinished thought.",How to Use an Ellipsis3," To determine where you want to add an ellipsis in creative or informal writing, you should ask yourself a question: Do you want to add an ellipsis to express passage of time, or do you want it to express an unfinished thought?

, One way to use an ellipsis to indicate a pause is when you want to describe passage of time without words. This ellipsis most often occurs in the middle of a sentence.


Insert the ellipsis between two words where the pause occurs.
The passage of time can be very short, almost instantly, such as with this sentence: “I was um … thinking about you today.”
The passage of time can be much longer, days or weeks, such as with this sentence: “Weeks later … I finally heard from my old boss about the job.”
An ellipsis used to express passage of time can often be substituted for the phrase “and then.”

, When a piece of dialogue or a thought is said to “trail off,” this means it is an unfinished thought. You should use an ellipsis to express an unfinished thought at the end of the sentence.


Insert the ellipsis after the last word to trail off at the end of a sentence.

“I was thinking about you today ...”


If the ellipsis occurs at the end of the sentence and the sentence would normally end with a question mark or exclamation point, place it after the ellipsis.

“Were you thinking about me today...?”

Think about the point of your paper.,
Write an outline of your paper.,
Come up with a short list of questions and choose one.",How to Start a Paper2," If you are covering research, there is a definite answer your research has provided. What was the question?


This can be as abstract or concrete as you see fit. It could be the direct questions your paper poses or it could be a question directly stated to the reader, asking them for their thoughts and opinions.

, Just because you can't come up with an introduction doesn't mean you can't write a skeleton of what you want to say. Cover the main and supporting points; don't worry about detail.


This outline will help you realize what it is your paper says. That way, you'll be able to understand what questions you are asking and answering.

, Using your outline, come up with 2 or 3 questions that your paper touches upon. Seeing as your paper probably has at least 3 points, try to have one question per point.


Think of what you are clarifying with your paper. If there is a standard point of view your paper is challenging, your could ask a question of the accepted definition of a word, concept, or societal norm.

, Now that you've found out what it is exactly you're writing about, go. Come out with it right out of the gate. Your introduction will be direct and to the point; you can deal with the details later.


Consider the following example: ""The illusion of power drives men to do many things. It causes them to go mad, to destroy, and to distrust. In Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov does all this in his quest to become an Übermensch and seize the power he believes he deserves.""With this start, the reader knows exactly what to expect and how the author feels about the work.

Write to someone you already know.,
Assess your reasons for writing.,
Find the inmate’s mailing address.,
Send updates about your life.",How to Write a Letter to a Prison Inmate1," If you know someone who is currently serving time in prison, consider writing to them to see if they would be interested in corresponding with you.


Try reaching out by saying something like, “I was wondering if you would be interested in corresponding with me while you’re there. I would like to send you some letters, if that is alright with you.”
Consider writing to any family members or other loved ones who is incarcerated.
Remember that they may not want to correspond with you and that’s okay. It's their choice.;
, If you want to write to someone who is incarcerated, make sure you only have good intentions for doing so. Receiving letters can be a great way to life an inmate’s spirits and keep them hopeful while they are serving their time. However, if you really only want to write them to tease them or make them feel guilty for being locked up, that is a selfish reason to write and you might actually end up doing more harm than good.


Only write to a prison inmate that you know if your intentions are positive and helpful.
Also keep in mind that there are restrictions about what you can and cannot write about to inmates. You absolutely can’t write to a prison inmate with the intent to blackmail them – this will definitely get you into some trouble. You also can’t include any contraband items, like nude photos.

, In order to write to any inmate, you’ll need to get their mailing address at the prison. You can contact the prison to ask for a specific inmate’s address and they will normally release that information to you. Additionally, you could get in contact with other family members or close friends of the inmate to see if they already have the inmate’s address.
When you address the envelope, be sure to write legibly and include all of the required information to ensure your letter is delivered. The address will probably include the inmate’s correctional facility identification number, so you’ll need to include that as well.

, In your letters, send the inmate updates about things that are happening in your life and things you know they would be interested to hear about. Remember that they might feel like they are missing out, so having this connection to the outside world could be a very positive thing for them during their incarceration.


Tell them about significant events in your life like birthdays and graduations. Let them know how your social and family life is going – like if you are dating someone new or a funny anecdote about how your child is driving you crazy.

Identify the proper person for the request.,
Learn the format for a business letter.,
Leave enough time for the request.,
Use a proper greeting.,
Introduce yourself.,
State the favor you're asking.,
Keep it simple.,
Tell your recipient why the favor is important.,
Offer to provide assistance to the recipient.,
Close the letter politely.,
Proofread your letter before sending it.",How to Write a Letter Requesting a Favor," Many times, part of making a request is finding out who the right person to contact is. Generally, you should ask the person most qualified to fulfill your request, and it may take some work to find out who that is.


If you are writing to ask a favor of a company, then you might need to call the company secretary to identify the appropriate person. Get this person’s full name, address, phone number and title.
You might need to write a different request letter to ask someone who you should write to. In this case, still follow these steps for writing a request letter.;
, Your request letter should use the proper business letter format, as it is likely a formal request. This applies whether you're sending an email or a hard copy letter.Become familiar with the following format and be sure to use it when writing your letter.Place your name, title, and address on the top left of the paper.
Place the date below this.
Put the person's name, title, and address below this.
Address the person appropriately. Start with ""Dear Mr."" or ""Dear Mrs.""
Have 1-inch margins around the paper and use single spacing. Don't indent, just use a double space in between paragraphs.
Use an easy-to-read font such as Times New Roman or Arial, in 12-point font.
End with ""Sincerely,"" then leave 4 lines so you can manually sign your name. Below this, type your name and title.

, Keep in mind that whoever you're writing to probably has other tasks to complete, so your request may take some time to get to. If your request is time-sensitive, be sure to give the recipient a enough advance notice to process it. Generally, allowing a week for requests is a good guideline, though bigger tasks could very well take longer.


For example, you wouldn't ask for a letter of recommendation from a teacher 2 days before it's due. That is an unreasonable request. If you'd planned ahead, you'd know that such requests usually require 2 weeks to fulfill.

, The recipient of the letter should be greeted and addressed properly.""Dear"" is the accepted opening for this style of letter. Openings like ""Hi"" or ""Hello"" are inappropriate and unprofessional for a business letter.
Use Mr., Mrs., and Ms. as appropriate. Never use only someone's first name.
If you're unsure of a person's gender, use the full name in the greeting instead of Mr. or Mrs. For example, ""Dear Casey Smith."", If this is an unsolicited request, the recipient will need to know who's making the request. Make a brief introduction of yourself, such as your job/position or affiliated organization. This will help your reader understand who is making the request.Your introduction can only be a sentence or two. You don't need to provide a biography, you just need to give the recipient an idea of who you are.
Introducing yourself has two advantages. First, it's polite. Remember, whoever you're writing to probably doesn't have to grant your request, so good manners will show that you've put thought and effort into contacting him or her. Second, identifying yourself will help the recipient understand who you are and better process your request.
If you've met the person before, it might help to remind him or her. For example, you might write: “We met last week at the sports banquet. I was pleased to make your acquaintance.”

, After introducing yourself, start a second paragraph. Politely, but clearly, state the favor you need. Also fill in any necessary details the recipient will need to meet your request, like dates and times.Don't: demand help with ""I need your help"" or ""I heard you could do this for me""Do: request help with ""Would it be possible..."" or ""I would be grateful if you would...""

, Don't go crazy with detail. You should be able to make your request in a few sentences. What's most important is that what you need is clearly stated.

Don't: include unnecessary flattery or apology.Do: cover all necessary info, such as the time frame.

, In certain cases, you might need to convince the recipient that he or she should grant your request. This should also go in the second paragraph. Have all your supporting evidence ready and briefly state why this request is important, and why granting it would help the recipient.For example, you might be requesting that a company sponsor an event you're putting on. You could stress that the company will receive good exposure by doing this. You could say: ""If you were to provide the necessary funding, we will announce your company at the event as an official sponsor. This will give you exposure to the community and identify your company with a good cause.""Don't: pressure someone with ""This is extremely important."" or ""It would really mean the world to me.""Do: provide specific info such as a deadline or a concrete incentive.


, Always demonstrate your willingness to work with the recipient. A simple statement like ""Please let me know if you need any more information"" can show the recipient that you're willing to work together and be as much help as you can be.

Don't: pressure the reader with references to past favors you've done.Do: acknowledge ""I understand if you're not able to do this.""

, When you've stated your request and provided all the necessary information the recipient may need, then close on a polite note. Thank the recipient for considering your request, and say that you look forward to hearing back. Then end with a proper salutation like ""Sincerely.""For example: ""Thank you very much for your time in considering this request. I look forward to hearing back from you on this matter. Sincerely, John Smith.""

, Never send a letter without proofreading, especially a formal business letter. Any spelling or grammar errors will make your letter look unprofessional, and could decrease your chances of having your request granted.Read your letter at least two more times before sending. That way, you can catch any mistakes you might've made.
Just because you're typing your letter doesn't mean that your spelling and grammar check will catch everything. Never rely exclusively on these programs. You still need to proofread the old fashioned way.

Find an inmate on a pen pal registry.,
Get involved in some kind of program.,
Make sure the addresses are legible.,
Introduce yourself.,
Be cautious about releasing personal information.",How to Write a Letter to a Prison Inmate2," There are quite a few inmate registries on the internet that provide profiles of inmates who are interested in finding a pen pal. Spend some time reading through the available profiles to find someone you would like to get to know.Try to find someone with common interests so that you can have something to build on in conversation.
Make sure you choose an inmate with the same expectations as you. You don’t want to pick someone who is looking for a romantic relationship if you are not interested in that as well.

, Many prisons offer inmate assistance programs of various kinds that you can become involved in. These programs are designed to benefit the inmates and help them to use their time productively while incarcerated.


Some such programs provide educational or tutoring support for inmates.

, Print your name and address on the envelope neatly. You should do this also in the body of the letter in case something happens to the envelope. Make sure the inmate’s name, address, and inmate ID are clearly legible as well.To make sure mail does not get lost, put your pen pal's last name and correctional I.D. number on the back of each page or picture.

, In the first letter, give some basic background information about yourself. You can describe your hobbies, interests, or a small personal description. Be sure not to include anything too personal. Introduce yourself just as you would to any person you are meeting for the first time.You can also give some words of encouragement and respond to things in their personal ad if they have one, like their love of reading for example.

, Regardless of how close you become with your pen pal, try to remember that they are in prison for a reason. Unless you know them well (from real life or otherwise), be cautious about providing them with any personal information about yourself or your family.Consider using a post office box or mailbox, rather than a home mailing address, when writing to your inmate pen pal.
Limit what personal information you include in your letters. You can send plenty of stories and details without sending information that might compromise your personal security.

Be honest and friendly.,
Ask questions.,
Be patient.,
Research the prison’s guidelines.,
Remember special occasions.,
Send a picture of yourself.,
Be a friend and mentor.",How to Write a Letter to a Prison Inmate3," Remember to be open and honest, but to keep a level-head. These inmates are not objects for amusement; they are human beings. If you choose to contact them, you should treat them with courtesy and respect regardless of what they are incarcerated for.Treat your inmate pen pal with as much kindness and courtesy as you would anyone else in your life.

, Give your inmate pen pal something to respond to by asking them questions in your first letter. This will help break the ice a bit and hopefully make them feel more comfortable corresponding with you.Try asking them about their hobbies, interests, favorite music, favorite books, etc.
Steer clear of more serious questions until later in the relationship, especially questions about their possible criminal offenses (what they are incarcerated for).

, Don't freak out if you do not get a reply right away. Remember that mail is slow for prison inmates and most prisons only give inmates mail on certain dates in the month. The inmates are very happy to receive contact from the outside world. Just because you do not get an immediate response does not mean they don't want to talk to you.Since prisoners’ email must be thoroughly screened before being distributed, it can often take much longer than regular mail.

, If you decide you would like to send a gift to a prisoner, be sure to find out the prison's policy on prisoners receiving gifts. This varies from prison to prison, but most prison systems have websites that you can search that will provide you with all of the necessary information regarding what is and is not permitted.Try to watch your language in your letters and anything else you send to the jail. Prisons frown on overt inflammatory language, and some strictly forbid it.
Do not send unapproved gifts, information about other inmates, or any other unauthorized items. This would create problems for the prisoners.
Check with the inmate you are writing to and verify with the prison’s official guidelines before sending any items.
Make sure you follow any special mailing guidelines that may be required for inmate mail. Again, this information should be listed on the prison’s website.

, Birthdays can be a lonely time, so try sending a card or a special birthday letter. Remembering a prisoner on their birthday can have a great impact. You can find their birth date on their personal ad, if they have one.


Try sending a greeting card. Greeting cards can be a great way to make someone feel special; you can find so many friendship cards to send a ""hello."" This can take the pressure off of you worrying about what to write, especially in the beginning.

, This way a prisoner has a face to put with your name. Some prisoners are looking for a relationship, but others are just looking for a friend and providing a picture can be a nice sign of friendship.Of course, only send a picture if you feel comfortable doing so.
Make sure any photos you send are appropriate (no nudity or lewd content), otherwise they'll get confiscated.

, Be a friend to your pen pal and possibly a mentor later on. A good pen pal can help inmates overcome addictions, find family and friends, and be a positive line to the outside world. Your inmate pen pal will have a better chance of creating a productive, successful life once they are released if they have more positive, supportive influences in their life.Listen to them talk about their problems if they want to, but encourage them in the right direction.

One way to do so is to write the letter on professional letterhead, if possible. This letterhead could be the official letterhead of your place of work., At the very top of the letter, put the date on which you write the letter. The date should be left-justified., Below the date, provide the official name and address of the judge. This will normally be the courthouse in which she presides. For example, you may write:


Honorable , United States District Judge, 11 Commerce Street, Dallas, TX 75242.This name and address should be left-justified and written out as you would an address at the top of any letter, below the date, as in this example.
Below the name and address of the judge, provide the appropriate salutation. The appropriate salutation for addressing a judge is “Your Honor” or “Dear Judge ., You should write down the defendant’s first name at the beginning of the letter. This can go in the first sentence of the letter or separately between the address and the salutation as follows:RE: ., In the first paragraph of the letter, you should begin by introducing yourself and saying what your profession is. Do not be modest about your credentials, particularly if you are held in high esteem in your community because of your professional or private work. Highlighting your credentials shows the defendant’s reputation and relationships in the community in a positive light. For example, you can write: ""My name is ____________________, M.D., a practicing physician and Chief of Staff of ________ Medical Center in ________________, Florida."", Also in the first paragraph, highlight your relationship with the defendant by stating what capacity you know the defendant in. Write how long you have known him and highlight the positive aspects of your relationship (e.g. love, friendship, respect).For example, you can write: ""I have been a lifelong friend of ___________. Our families were friends before our births. _______ and I were friends during childhood and have remained close after high school, college, and during our adult lives. I know ______________ about as well as any person other than his immediate family could. I know him to be an industrious, hardworking, family man who is community-minded and other-centered. He has worked hard in his church family and, in fact, worked very hard in his job as __________________________."", In the second paragraph, write a general statement of support.Let the court know if the defendant has been candid about his legal problems and has shared those problems with you. If the defendant has admitted his wrongdoing to you, tell that to the judge, as this is seen as a positive.Also say if you are able to help the defendant after his legal troubles are over, perhaps by offering him a place to stay or a job., In paragraph 3, write a statement on the character traits of the defendant. Highlight positive character traits such as honesty, courage, love,or state why you think the defendant is a family man, a hard worker, or a good parent.Always try to provide examples of how the defendant depicts these character traits and offer any stories or personal experiences you have with the defendant that further highlight these positive traits., You may add anything else that you feel will be helpful to the defendant. Make sure the additional material is both concise and informative., In paragraph 4, conclude the letter by explaining to the judge in your own words that the defendant understands that he has done wrong and expresses regret at his actions. Also state that the defendant would like to learn from this experience and move forward with his life. For a request of leniency, state why you believe that society would not benefit from sending the defendant to prison and how all the parties involved would suffer from such a result.You can write, for example: ""I believe that an extended prison term will serve as a tremendous hardship for his wife, who will bear the responsibility of trying to repay the costs of the court case and restitution. I believe that ________’s daughters, one of whom has assumed a large portion of the restitution cost, will be tremendously adversely affected if he is required to go to prison."", You should not make any disparaging comments about the judge, prosecution or other parties involved in the case. Focus on the defendant’s positive traits while at the same time not diminishing the significance or seriousness of the offence."

Ask who you’re addressing the letter to.,
Find out what information to include.,
Get a signed release from your tenant.",How to Write a Letter Showing Proof of Residence for a Tenant1," Get the person’s name and their mailing address. You should mail the letter directly to the person instead of giving it to your tenant.;
, Does the tenant only need a letter stating the dates they rented from you? Or do they need more information? Clarify ahead of time what your tenant needs so that you are sure to include all of the information.


For example, your tenant might need a landlord reference letter, which is different from a proof of residence. With a reference letter, you give your opinion about whether you would rent to the tenant again.Avoid providing information that isn’t requested. For example, don’t include information about the rent in your letter unless your tenant asks you to.

, Some property management companies protect themselves by having tenants sign a release. In the release, the tenant identifies what information they want released and agree not to sue you for releasing it.


Find a release used for employment references and adjust it to fit your circumstances.

Sign the letter.",How to Write a Letter Requesting Non Deportation of a Person," Under federal law, non-citizens who commit certain crimes can be deported. However, some people may qualify to apply for pardons. The pardon is called a “Cancellation of Removal.”These people can complete an application and give it to the judge in their removal proceedings.


As part of the application, the non-citizen can submit letters from friends, families, and others. These letters can argue why the detained person should be allowed to stay in the country.
Once a judge decides that a person qualifies for a pardon, then the judge must weigh the good things about the person against the bad things they have done. Ultimately, the judge must decide if the person “deserves” to stay in the country.The purpose of the letter is to bolster the judge’s sense of the worth and value of the applicant.;
, The immigration judge will read the letter to get a better sense of the applicant as a person. Positive factors the judge will consider include:family ties in the United States
how hard the removal will be on the person’s family
the applicant’s work record
ties to business or property
community service
successful rehabilitation from drugs or other criminal behavior
good character

, Before drafting the letter, you should try to understand why the requestor has asked you to write the letter. Does he or she want you to highlight specific incidents that illustrate good character? Is there something specific that the requestor wants you to write? You should try to understand why you were asked.


Since the person requesting the letter could be in detention, communication could be difficult. If the person has a lawyer, you may want to speak to the lawyer. Although the lawyer cannot share confidential details about the case, you could use the lawyer as a go-between who can ask the requestor what the letter should be about.

, Ideally, you will have a couple of weeks. Unfortunately, you may be rushed to produce a letter within a day or two. No matter how much time you have, you should clear out a couple hours to sit down and outline what you want to say.


Try to think of concrete examples to support any judgment you make. Even if you are talking about your feelings, you should be able to use specific examples to support your point.
For example, suppose you want to explain why you would miss your daughter terribly if she is deported. You can support that statement by explaining how you grew closer by coming to the United States, since your daughter helped translate for you and helps you pay your bills. These details explain why you will miss her.

, If you are writing a letter in support of a family member, then you should write from the heart.If you are supporting an employee or a member of your organization (church, volunteer organization, etc.), then you should focus on being honest.


Because sincerity is so important, you should not copy other people’s letters. Although you can look at sample letters to get a handle on formatting and length, you should always use your own words and ideas.

, At the top of the letter, you should include the date. A couple lines down, include the salutation.Since you are addressing a judge, your salutation should read, “Dear Immigration Judge” or “Your Honorable Immigration Judge.”If you know the requestor in a professional capacity, then you should use letterhead.

, Use the first paragraph to introduce yourself. State your name, age, relationship to the requestor, address, occupation and immigrant status.Also state how long you have known the requestor.If you are relative, you will state your relationship to the person detained: “I am Imelda Sanchez, the wife of Richard Sanchez. We have been married for six years and have known each other for nine years total. Richard is the father of my two children, Emily and Michael.”
Alternately, if you are an employer, you would state that fact: “I am Bob Akin, the sole owner of Akin Carpentry, where I have supervised Simon Alfred for the past eighteen months.”

, In the second paragraph, you need to explain why you believe the person should not be removed from the country. Here is where you should refer to the reason why the requestor has asked you to write the letter. For example, if you are a family member, then you will want to describe the impact removal will have on your family. Describe in sufficient detail how the family relies on this person to pay bills and buy food. You should also describe the emotional ties the family shares with the detained person.You could write, “My children and I rely on my husband every day. Without his job as a construction worker, we would not have enough money to pay the rent on our two bedroom apartment or to put much food on the table. Because of my disability, I have only been able to work part-time and therefore cannot support my two children on my own. Even more important is the love and support my husband provides our family.” Again, it is important to use your own words; explain your situation in sufficient detail.
Alternately, you might have been asked to write a letter because you live in the country that the detainee would be deported back to. In your letter, you could explain the hardships that the person would face.For example, the person may face religious persecution or extreme poverty.

, If the requestor is an employee or volunteer, then you will want to include the requestor’s job title as well as their skills. Include information about the dates and location of employment and be detailed about why you find the requestor a good employee. Immigration judges are looking to see that those applying for Cancellation of Removal are hard-working and will be productive members of society should they stay.


For example, you could write, “I have employed Mr. Alfred as a carpenter for the past eighteen months, beginning in March 2014 and ending when he was arrested by immigration officials. During that time, he never missed a day of work and even showed up when sick. He arrived on time and never left early, unlike my other employees.”
You should also state your opinion of the requestor’s honesty and trustworthiness. Be specific.For example, do not simply state, “I trust Mr. Alfred a lot.” That is too general—and unpersuasive. You will need details to show the reader why you believe the requestor has the character traits you say he does.
Instead, you could write: “Within two months I felt comfortable leaving Mr. Alfred to supervise the other two workers on our team, whenever I had to go to the hardware store or to meet with a client. He supervised the other workers and made sure that they completed tasks on time. Within another four months, I trusted him to talk to clients directly. Just before his arrest, he was helping me collect payments from clients.”

, The letter should close with a strong recommendation that the requestor not be deported.You can write, “Based on my close acquaintance with Ms. Amaya, I strongly recommend that she not be deported.”

, In the final paragraph, include contact information so that the judge can reach you if necessary. Include your phone number and email address (if applicable) at the end of the letter. If your mailing address has not been included as part of the letterhead, then include the mailing address here as well. Also specify what times are best for reaching you.


After adding the contact information, insert “Sincerely” and then space down a few lines and type your name.

, Use blue or black ink. Because the requestor is in the middle of deportation proceedings, you should have the letter notarized.Accordingly, you should wait to sign the letter until you appear before the notary public. Be sure to bring sufficient personal identification. A valid driver’s license or passport should be sufficient.
To find a notary near you, use the locator from the American Society of Notaries. Notaries may also be found at most large banks or at courthouses.

, If you don’t know who you are sending the letter to, then use “To Whom It May Concern.”However, you should use the person’s name if you know it.

, In the first paragraph, explain that you are writing to verify that the tenants live on your property. Also include the address where they live.For example, you can write, “I am writing to confirm that Mr. Richard Alley currently lives as a tenant on my property located at 1234 End of the Road, Jonesport, Maine 04649.”

, You may also need to state how long someone has rented from you. You should include the dates and when the current lease expires.


For example, you can write, “Mr. Alley began renting form me on January 1, 2011. His current lease is set to expire on December 31, 2017.”

, Your tenants might want you to provide other information, depending on the circumstances. Include that information here, in its own paragraph.


For example, you might need to include information on the rent. You can write, “Mr. Alley’s current rent is $700 a month.”

State you are willing to answer questions.,
Sign the letter.,
Show the tenant your letter.",How to Write a Letter Showing Proof of Residence for a Tenant3," The purpose of a tenant reference letter is to inform a potential landlord about your tenant. For that reason, you should go through your records and check if you had any problems, such as the following:


Timely rent. Was the tenant ever late with rent? If so, did they promptly pay or did you need to pester them?
Complaints. Did another tenant complain about excessive noise or a pet?
Tidiness. When you walked through the apartment, was it kept in neat condition? Did they notify you about repairs that were needed? You might need to enter the apartment, in which case you should give your tenant proper notice.

, Also, they might challenge its accuracy and claim they lost out on the place because of your reference. For this reason, you should decline to write a landlord reference if it can’t be mostly positive.


Be honest with the tenant. Say, “I don’t think I can write a positive letter. Can you ask a previous landlord?”
Also avoid lying in your reference letter. You might think this is a good way to get rid of a bad tenant. However, the future landlord might sue you for misrepresentation.

, Open a blank word processing document and set the font to Times New Roman 12 point or something similar. Your letter should be organized like a standard business letter.


Use letterhead if you have it, and leave sufficient space up top.
Use “To Whom It May Concern” as the salutation unless you know who you are addressing.

, Identify how long the tenant has rented from you and any other information your tenant wants included in the letter. You should also explain why you recommend the tenant.


For example, you might write, “I recommend Alice Jones as a tenant. Ms. Jones started renting from me on June 1, 2014 in Jonesport, Maine. Ms. Jones has been an excellent tenant, and she’s never been late with rent. Because she has been so easy to rent to, I would rent to her again.”
Remember not to go overboard with praise. A landlord might think that you are trying to get rid of a problem tenant. Instead, use a neutral tone throughout the letter., Few tenants are perfect, so it wouldn’t be surprising if a tenant was late with the rent once or twice or had a complaint about excessive noise. You can identify any problems with your tenant, and then explain how they corrected the problem.


For example, you can write, “During the past three years, only one tenant has complained about Ms. Jones’ dog, about a month after she moved in. However, after speaking to Ms. Jones, she took her dog to a trainer, and I’ve never had another complaint since.”

, In your final paragraph, tell the future landlord how to contact you. Include your email address and telephone number.For example, you can write, “Please call with questions. I can be reached at home at 111-1111 or by email at happy_landlord@email.com.”

, Type “Sincerely” and leave several blank lines before typing your name. Sign your letter using an ink pen.

, Give them a chance to review the letter before you send it off. If there’s negative information in the letter, they might decide not to use it. Make a copy of the letter before mailing it.

If you don't have prepared letterhead, most computer word processing applications have letterhead templates which can make your letter look more polished and professional.;
, Following the traditional format for a business letter, your letter should include your name and address as well as the judge's name and the address of the court.Your word processing application may have a template you can use for business letter format. If you're not using a template, type your name on one line, then type your address on the following lines as though you were writing it on an envelope. When you've typed it, use the formatting options to move the entire block over to the top right-hand corner of the page.Make a double space after your address, then write the judge's name and the address of the court on the left-hand side of the page. Type the address using two or three lines, just as you did your own address.Use the correct title when writing the judge's name. Typically you can address the letter as ""Judge "" or ""Honorable ."", Use the date you plan to send the letter, rather than the date you are writing your first draft.


Your subject line should refer to the individual for whom you're writing the letter as well as the case name and file number. If you don't have that information, you can ask the person for whom you're writing the letter, or copy the caption from a document filed in the case.

, Use the judge's proper name and title to address your letter, rather than using a generic salutation such as ""To Whom It May Concern.""


Generally, you should either address the judge as ""Dear Judge ,"" or ""Your Honor.""Make sure you use the judge's correct title. You can call the clerk's office and ask if you are unsure.Your salutation and the rest of the letter should be left-justified., Leave space for the body of your letter, then include a closing such as ""Sincerely,"" or ""Respectfully yours,"" with space for your signature.


Leave at least four lines for your signature, then type your name below that space.You also may wish to include your phone number or email address below your name. There's no need to include your address, as you put that information at the top of your letter.
If your job title or place of work is important to the letter or the reason you were chosen to write the letter, you might want to include that under your name.

, Making a list of the points you want to make or the things you want to say before you start writing your letter can help keep your writing focused and organized.


If the person for whom you're writing the letter is represented by an attorney, you may want to meet briefly with the attorney to discuss what you plan to include in your letter. Make sure the information you want to include will actually be of benefit.
You also may find it helpful to brainstorm before you decide what you want to focus on in your letter. Think of positive character traits, then find examples or anecdotes that demonstrate those traits. For example, if you intend to show that the person about whom you're writing is honest, you might relate a story where the person found a wallet with cash and went out of her way to find and return it intact to its owner.
You might want to think of three or four overarching points you want to make, and then organize any other information or anecdotes about the person within those points. This will keep your letter organized.
If you're writing a letter on behalf of a criminal defendant, you may want to mention certain character traits about that person and provide examples. For example, you may know the defendant to be a loyal friend and family member.If you're writing a letter on behalf of a parent involved in a custody case, avoid making disparaging or insulting statements about the other parent. Keep your focus on the person for whom you're writing the letter and their relationship with their child.
Your points should flow from your relationship to the person and the knowledge you naturally would have. For example, if you are co-workers, it's appropriate to include the fact that the person is hard working. However, if you're just a friend or neighbor, you may not have enough knowledge to back that statement up – even if you believe it strongly.

, At the beginning of your letter, tell the judge who you are and your relationship to the person for whom you're writing the letter.


If you have strong feelings for the person, you should include a statement to that effect. This includes not only love, but also respect or friendship.Additionally, you should mention how long you've known the person if that isn't made clear by your relationship. For example, if you've been the defendant's friend for 10 years, the judge probably will give your opinion more weight than if you've only known him for three months – but the judge won't know unless you tell him.
If relevant, include dates and locations to indicate how long you've known the person.For example, you might write ""I first met Sally Spade in English class in 1994, during our sophomore year of high school, and we've been friends ever since."" You don't have to write a biography of your relationship, but relating key dates and events will reinforce how important the person is to you.
If your job title or education lends more weight to your opinion or is related to the subject of the letter, you should include that as well.In some situations, this information may have relevance because you are a co-worker of the person for whom you're writing the letter.
If you're writing a character letter for a parent involved in a custody dispute, you also should include your relationship to the child, especially if you worked with the child outside of the home, for example as a teacher or coach.

, Tell the judge why you're writing the letter, and include a brief summary of what you intend to show through your letter.


If you're writing your letter on behalf of a party in the case, state that fact clearly.For example, you might write ""I am writing on behalf of Sally Spade regarding her petition for custody of her son Sam.""
If you're writing a letter in support of a criminal defendant, you should include a statement indicating that you understand the crime with which the defendant has been convicted. If you are able to help the person in any way, such as by providing him or her a place to live or a job, you should include that information as well., The body of your letter should include several paragraphs, with each paragraph addressing a single topic of discussion or point you want to make.


The body of your letter should be single-spaced, with a double-space between each paragraph.Regardless of the purpose of your letter, include specific examples for every statement you make.The judge won't necessarily be impressed if you simply say that you believe the person is trustworthy. However, if you provide an example of his or her trustworthiness, your words will carry more weight.
If you're writing on behalf of a convicted defendant, include any knowledge or understanding you have of the defendant's family, and how they will be affected by his sentence.Keep the tone of your letter friendly and conversational. Don't worry about using legal terms – just write in your own words.The best examples to use are everyday occurrences.The judge wants to know how the person for whom you're writing the letter acts in ordinary circumstances, not in situations that are rare or outside the norm.
Provide as many specific details in your anecdotes as possible. If your example relates to something that happened repeatedly, let the judge know. For example, you might write ""Sally was the biggest supporter of Sam's baseball team, arriving an hour early to help the coach and keeping score on many occasions.""
If you're referring to a single, specific event, include as much detail as you can, including dates and locations.These details make your story more believable, which will help your letter carry more weight.

, While it doesn't have to be long or elaborate, you should close your letter with a couple of sentences thanking the judge for his or her time and consideration.If you're asking the judge to do something in particular, include that statement in your closing as well. For example, if you're requesting leniency on behalf of a defendant in a criminal case, you might include a statement to that effect along with a brief statement as to why you believe this best serves justice or society at large., In addition to making sure your letter reads smoothly and makes sense, you want to make sure it says what you want it to say.


A good way to check the flow of your writing is to read your letter aloud. This will force you to slow down rather than skim, and you'll hear when something doesn't sound right.

, Even if you used a word-processing application with an auto-correct function, it may not pick up every error.Although you should run your letter through a grammar and spelling check, they won't pick up some types of errors. For example, if you type ""hear"" when you meant ""here,"" the spell-check function won't alert you to that error, because ""hear"" is itself a word.

, A friend or family member may be able to point out parts of your letter that are confusing or don't flow well.


Be open to critique from anyone else who reads your letter. Since you know what you intend to say, you will tend to read your words in that light. However, someone else may read your words to say something very different. If your reader doesn't understand or get your point, it's likely the judge won't get it either.

, When you print your letter, use plain white or ivory paper of a traditional size – the longer legal size of paper is no longer common in courts and will cause complications with filing.


Sign your letter using blue or black ink, and make copies of your signed letter for your own records before you send it.
In some circumstances, the court may require your letter to be notarized. The person for whom you're writing the letter, or her attorney, should be able to tell you whether this step is necessary.
If you have the letter notarized, this means you'll sign it before a notary public. The notary will check your identification and sign the letter as well to verify that it was you who signed it., Mail your original signed letter to the address you were given for the judge.


Depending on your reasons for writing the letter, an attorney may want to read it before you send it, or may want to send it themselves. For example, if you're writing a character letter on behalf of the defendant after conviction of a crime but prior to sentencing, his or her attorney may want to review the letter to make sure the content adequately supports the defendant's cause."

Sign with a witness.",How to Write a Letter of Permission2," Typing is recommended for most letters of permission, such as a letter of consent to travel or a letter of medical authorization. Write the letter by hand only in informal situations, or for short notes that only need to be shown once.

, A clear, short title lets the reader know the letter topic immediately. For example, write ""Medical Treatment Authorization"" or ""Letter of Consent for Traveling Minor."" Type this in bold font.


In American English, the subject goes at the top of the letter. In British English, the subject goes after the salutation., If the letter will be kept with the child and shown whenever necessary, open with ""To Whom It May Concern:"" or skip the salutation entirely. If you are sending the letter to a specific person, address them by their professional title and full name.

, Begin with a direct statement clearly stating the letter's purpose. Include the full names of yourself, your child, and the person you are granting permission to. If the child has another custodian or parent, write the letter together if possible. Here are a couple examples:



Medical authorization: ""I, (full name), grant (full name of babysitter/teacher/etc.) the authority to obtain medical treatment for my child, (full name of child), as detailed below.""

Consent to travel: ""We, (full name of parents), are the legal guardians of (child's full name). (Child's full name) has our consent to travel with (names of people accompanying child), as detailed below.""

, You may write this as a list, instead of paragraph form. Include all of the following information:


Your relation to the child (custodial parent, non-custodial parent, or legal guardian)
Child's full legal name and birth date
Child's current home address
(Optional) Child's sex, place of birth, and nickname (if commonly used)

, If the people reading the letter would find additional information useful, add it here. Here are suggestions for the most common permission letters for minors:



Medical authorization: Child's allergies, medical conditions, and current medications; doctor's name, address, and phone number; health insurance plan and ID numberConsent to travel: Passport number and date of issue, If the adults are close and trusted family members, you may grant permission for the adults to ""(obtain and consent to medical treatment for the minor / travel with the minor) as they see fit."" In other circumstances, list exactly what is and isn't allowed:



Example for medical authorization letter: ""I authorize (adult's name) to give and consent to treatment for minor illnesses and injuries. In an emergency, (adult) should attempt to contact me. (He/she) may seek and consent to emergency transport, as well as treatment deemed advisable by and supervised by a licensed medical professional.""

Example for consent to travel letter: ""I authorize (adult's name) to take (child's name) to the Grand View Hotel in Oakville, South Dakota from January 12th through January 18th, and supervise (him/her) on excursions in the surrounding area.""

, Note when the authorization expires, or state that it is valid until you revoke it in writing.

, Write ""You may direct questions and concerns to me at:"" followed by your full name, phone number(s), and home address.

, Ideally, have the document notarized, or find a lawyer or other official to act as witness. This makes people more likely to believe the letter.Otherwise, ask a neighbor, coworker, or other adult with no relation or close connection to anyone involved. Print and sign your name with the witness watching, then have the witness print and sign her name.


Clearly label the two signature lines ""parent"" (or other role) and ""witness.""
For a simple letter authorizing field trip attendance or absence from school, you do not need a witness. Just close the letter with ""Sincerely"" or ""Regards,"" followed by your printed name and signature.

Send your letter.",How to Write a Letter of Request," In order to write a clear, effective letter, it is crucial that you have a clear sense of your goals and the letter's purpose.


A good way to make sure your thoughts about these topics are clear is to get three blank pieces of paper and label them ""why I am writing this letter,"" ""the purpose of this letter,"" and ""other thoughts.""Without worrying too much about details, take a few minutes and write down your thoughts about the letter on these three pieces of paper. Make lists and brainstorm the big picture ideas you have about the situation that has prompted you to write the letter, what you hope the letter will achieve, and any other important information you think may need to be included.;
, Essential to setting the right tone in your letter is understanding the audience you are writing for.After your initial brainstorm, on another piece of paper, write down what you know about the recipient of your letter.


For example, what is this person's position, and how can he or she be of help? Will this person be making a final decision about your request, or making a decision about whether or not to pass your request on to a higher authority?
It's also a good idea to consider the recipient's knowledge of the topic you are writing about.If your reader is not well versed in the topic you are writing about, this will necessitate a different type of writing (i.e. use of simpler language and the inclusion of more background information) than if your recipient is already an expert on the matter.

, Finally, before you begin actually composing the letter, create an outline to organize your thoughts into a logical, coherent order.Consider the main points you want to make, and the secondary points you will use to support those points. Make sure your ideas are organized in a way that will make sense to your reader.

, Writing your letter in the proper, professional format of a business letter is a good way to make positive first impression.


In the top left corner, you should include first, your full address, second, the date, and third, the full address of the sender.There should be a line of space between each of these.
You may also include a subject line after the recipient's address, but this is optional., Begin the main text of your letter with a proper, respectful salutation.


If you know the person you are writing to, you can use their first name, e.g. ""Dear Tim."" Otherwise, you should use the person's last name and the proper title, (eg. Dr., Mr., Ms. or Mrs.).If you do not know the name of the person you are writing to, use a salutation like ""Dear Sir or Madam,"" or ""To Whom It May Concern.""

, In the first paragraph of any letter of request, you will need to introduce yourself and clearly but briefly state the purpose of the letter, e.g. ""I am writing in hopes that you will consider making a contribution to the Boston Citizen's Charity Fund.If you have had any previous interaction with the recipient of your letter, the opening paragraph is also a good place to remind them of the nature or your association or the contact you've had in the past.For example: ""I am a student in your drama 101 class,"" or ""I'm the president of the Boston Citizens Charity Fund, an organization you've generously donated to for the last 10 years,"" or ""I contacted you last month about the possibility of a class trip to your amusement park.""
Establishing a connection is not only helpful to the recipient, but may also promote feelings of affinity with you that might increase the chances of your request being granted.

, Your body paragraph (or paragraphs) should provide additional context and information and more specific details about your request.This your opportunity to spell out exactly what you are asking for and make your case for why your request should be granted.


Be thorough but brief. You should clearly explain what it is you are requesting and why the matter is worthy of consideration, but your reader will not want to read your life story.Be straightforward and specific about what you are requesting. The receiver should be left with no doubt as to what you want.For example: ""I'm hoping you'll consider repeating your generous contribution this year,"" or ""I'd like to respectfully request an opportunity to resubmit this paper.""
Be courteous and use a tone that is appropriate for you reader.Be factual and keep your emotions in check. If you must discuss your feelings about a matter, state them factually rather than emotionally, e.g. ""I was very disappointed when I saw my grade,"" not ""I'm so mad about this grade!"", In your concluding paragraph, you should make your recipient aware of any relevant time constraints you face,and also express your gratitude for their consideration of your request.For example, if you are writing to request information or a meeting with someone that must occur before a certain date to be of any use to you, politely make that clear in the conclusion.
Even if your recipient ultimately does not grant your request, the fact that they have taken the time to read your letter and consider your wishes is worthy of thanks.

, Finally, your letter needs an appropriate and polite closing. Good options include ""Respectfully,"" ""Sincerely,"" or ""Best regards,"" followed by your name.If you are sending a physical letter, leave four lines of empty space between the closing and your typed name. In this space, sign your name with a pen.
If you are enclosing any materials with your letter, this information should come after your closing, e.g. ""Enclosures: 2."", After finishing the first draft of your letter, set it aside for a few days, if time permits. This will give you a different perspective on it when you return to it., Give the letter a close reading to make sure your writing is clear, flows well, and accomplishes the goals you set out to accomplish in part 1. Make any necessary revisions.


A good way assess your writing is to read your letter out loud. This will help you to notice any missing words and generally get a sense of whether the language flows well and strikes the appropriate tone., After you've made any substantive edits, give the letter one more look to catch any spelling and grammar mistakes that you might have missed the first time.


It's a good idea to have someone else read your letter for this purpose as well. It is much easier to overlook your own errors., Send your letter to its recipient. Make sure you keep a copy for your records until the matter is settled."
"
Check who you're addressing.,
Brainstorm.,
State the basic facts in the introduction.,
Keep your letter one to two pages in length.",How to Write a Letter of Recommendation for a Nanny2," Before you begin your letter, know who you're addressing. Most of the time, your nanny will be using your letter of recommendation for many different jobs. Therefore, something like ""Dear Sir or Madam"" or ""To Whom it May Concern"" is usually appropriate.However, in certain situations you may be addressing someone specific.


If your nanny is applying for a specific job that requires letters of recommendation, you should address whoever's in charge of hiring. If your nanny is applying to a job through an agency, it might be a good idea to address that agency in your letter. For example, ""Dear Hiring Staff of Lancaster Nannying.""

, Before you write the letter, do some basic brainstorming. This will help you sort through your thoughts before trying to write the letter. Pause and consider why you would recommend your nanny.


You can start by jotting down a list of words. Write down your nanny's best attributes on a piece of paper. Challenge yourself to think of 5 or 10 words that best describe your nanny's best qualities.
Then, write down your best memories of working with your nanny. The best letters of recommendation will include anecdotes and stories that speak to your nanny's talent.
You may want to ask your nanny to e-mail you his or her resume. This can help jog your memory as it's a good idea to list your nanny's personal achievements and career success in a letter of recommendation.

, Once you've brainstormed a little, you can start writing your letter. In your introduction, you'll begin by recommending your nanny and then proceed to state the basic facts.


You'll usually start your letter with something like, ""I am writing this letter to recommend Lacey Shepherd to your nanny agency."" If you want to set your letter apart a little, you could give a slightly more glowing recommendation. For example, ""I would highly recommend the services of the Lacey Shepherd for your agency. She has been an extraordinary asset to me as a working mother.""From there, you should state the basic facts. List the dates of employment, whether your nanny was a live-in or live-out nanny, and her basic responsibilities. For example, ""Lacey worked for me from March of 2014 to April of 2015. She lived in a small guest room in my basement Mondays through Fridays. She supervised my children, Charlie and Olivia, while I was at work. She was responsible for getting the kids ready for school in the morning, driving them home after school, preparing snacks and meals, and accompanying Olivia to her various extracurricular activities on the days I worked late."", One or two pages, single spaced, is usually adequate for a letter of recommendation. Any longer and an employer may get bored and stop reading. As you continue writing your letter, keep the length requirement in mind. If you're particularly enthusiastic about your nanny, you may accidentally go overboard. Try to keep things brief and to the point as you write your letter."
"
Focus on four of your nanny's most positive traits.,
Be personal.,
Include a story.,
Highlight special skills and achievements.,
Explain why the employment ended.",How to Write a Letter of Recommendation for a Nanny3," As you continue the letter, focus on your nanny's positive traits. Focus on the characteristics that were most important and helpful to you as a parent. You do not want to come off as hyperbolic by listing too many traits. However, not enough can make it look like you don't have much to say. Four is a good middle ground.List traits in terms of features and benefits. What positive attributes did your nanny have and how did those attributes help you? A prospective employer is interested in how a job candidate could benefit him or her.For example, don't just say, ""Lacey had a lot of patience."" Instead, write something like, ""Lacey is a tremendously patient person, which was helpful as Charlie has a learning disability. Lacey took the time needed to help Charlie with his homework each night and, as a result, he excelled in school. He earned a B+ in math the semester Lacey worked for us."" The trait is Lacey's patience and the benefit is your son's academic success., Many letters of recommendation are somewhat impersonal and removed. However, as a nanny plays the role of a caregiver, your letter should be a little more personalized. Don't be afraid to be somewhat sentimental. Discuss how your nanny made a positive impact on your life. For example, write something like, ""Lacey had an immeasurable positive impact on my family's life. During the time she was working with us, my grandmother passed away. Her positive attitude and understanding nature helped me and my family get through a very difficult time."", People are naturally drawn to stories. After writing about your nanny's positive traits for a paragraph, it's a good idea to dedicate the next paragraph to a specific, memorable story.Read over the traits you listed above. Say you claimed your nanny was very hardworking. Can you think of a time she used this trait to help you as a parent? Is there a story you can tell to illustrate this strength?
For example, say your daughter wanted to act in a pageant for school. You had volunteered to make costumes for some of the other children, but had an unexpected obligation come up at work. Your nanny stayed late on a Friday night to help you finish all the costumes you had put off, making jokes and maintaining a positive attitude to keep you calm. This would be a great anecdote to include in order to illustrate your nanny's work ethic.

, Any special skills or impressive achievements should be listed here. This can help set your nanny apart from the bunch during the application process.


Achievements should showcase how your nanny went above and beyond the call of duty. Focus on achievements relevant to the job. It may impress you to know your nanny was an honors student at Brown, but it may not be important to someone looking for someone to watch their kids. Talk about achievements that occurred while your nanny was working with you. For example, something like, ""Lacey helped Olivia memorize a William Blake poem for a school contest. She stayed after hours each night to help. Due to Lacey's dedication, Olivia came in second place.""Any special skills also warrant mentioning. Maybe your nanny is a highly skilled chef. Maybe she's good at arts and crafts. Any skills that would prove useful to a parent should be listed.
Stay away from jargon, however. For example, if your kids have special dietary needs that your nanny had to keep track of, avoid listing any medications or medical terms. The person reading the letter does not need to know this. He or she only needs to know that your nanny was able to keep track of your kid's diet., It's a good idea to explain why the employment ended. This can help show the potential employer things ended on good terms. It's also an opportunity to express regret at losing your beloved nanny. For example, try something like, ""When Lacey moved out of the suburbs and into the city, the weekly commute became too difficult. She decided to seek work closer to her new apartment. While she is very much missed at our home, I am happy that she is moving forward with her life. She would be a valuable attribute to any family."""

Look at multiple positions to find one that would fit you best.
Get a sense of what the position you're interested in requires of its applicants. It's important to do this before applying, because even though it is not a paid position, there may still be a certain skill set, level of experience, or education background required for that position.;
, Once you've found a position that you're interested in, you should familiarize yourself with the company or organization that you're interested in working with. Even though you may be interested in and qualified for a certain position, you may find that the organization's values are significantly different from your own. Before applying to any position, you want to ensure that you will be happy working in that position and that you would be a good fit for the organization.


Read the organization's mission statement and values. These should be available somewhere on the organization's website, and can save you time and frustration down the line.

, If the volunteer position you're applying to was listed online or in print, the announcement should have a contact person listed for interested applicants. You'll want to know who is responsible for hiring/recruiting new personnel, as well as that person's contact information.


If no contact person is listed in the announcement, try searching on the organization's website to determine who is in charge of personnel. You may need to contact the organization's human resources department to find this information.
If hiring decisions are made by a high-ranking executive, you may need to address your letter to that individual.

, You should write your letter the same way you would if you were applying for a paid position. Be professional and consistent in your letter, as a poorly-written letter of interest could cost you the position.


Use a uniform type size and font that are appropriate for a business letter. Stick with a font size between 10 and 12 points, and choose a font that is easy to read and has clean lines, like those in the sans serif family. Some examples of professional-looking fonts include Arial, Century Gothic, Futura, Lucida Sans, News Gothic, Technical, Times New Roman, and Rockwell.Do not use any unusual or unique colors in your letter.

Start with his or her full name (or a proper title, if no first name is given - for example, Ms. Stone), the department that person works in, the name of the organization you are hoping to work with, and the organization's address.You may wish to include the date on your letter so that the person reviewing your application can see when you applied. This can be inserted between your contact information and the organization's., The first thing you should do (after including your contact information and the organization's contact information) is to address the letter's recipient with a proper title. If the recipient is a doctor or has earned a doctorate, address him or her as Doctor. If not, use Mr. or Ms. If the gender of the recipient is unclear, use the person's full name rather than a title.If there is no contact person listed in the announcement and you cannot find out whom you should address your letter to, you may be able to get away with using a subject line instead of a formal salutation., This part of the letter is the venue in which you will market yourself to the administration at your organization of choice. You want to introduce yourself and make your intentions known right from the start.


Include a statement of interest in the position.
Mention where you saw the announcement for this volunteer opportunity.
Write two to three sentences outlining your experience and expertise in the field of your interest.
If you have a formal education or have taken coursework in the field to which you're applying, mention that in this section.

Let the hiring party know that you are willing and able to work toward the organization's goals.

, Now that you've introduced yourself and formally declared your interest in volunteering your time and efforts, let the hiring party know a bit more about yourself.


Discuss your employment and volunteer history, and talk about how that experience it is relevant to the position.

In your closing paragraph, you'll want to wrap up the letter by laying out what you are able to commit to.


Let the hiring party know how much time you can commit to each week. If you have specific days or times that work better for your schedule, let the hiring party know when you're available to volunteer, if you are accepted into the organization.
Do not assume that you have the position. Writing about yourself and your availability as though you already have the position could be a turn off for the organization's hiring party.
Ask the hiring party for the opportunity to meet in person to discuss the position further, and let him or her know when you would be available for an interview.

, Be sure to look for any typos, misspelled words, grammatical errors, and punctuation errors. These can make an application letter appear sloppy and unprofessional., Even though you discussed your skills, experience, and qualifications in the letter, you should still send a resume with your letter.

Attaching a resume also shows a certain amount of professionalism on your part. It lets the hiring party know that you take the position seriously, and are willing to work for the opportunity to be a part of the organization.

, Though not every internship requires letters of recommendation, some do request them. Even if they are not required, including letters of recommendation can be another way to demonstrate your commitment to professionalism.Letters of recommendation should be written by professional or personal references who can attest to your character and capabilities.In lieu of letters of recommendation, you may want to include a list of professional references with each reference's contact information. This will allow the hiring party to reach out to your references, if he or she needs to, and it shows that you are able to maintain positive working relationships with current and former employers and/or colleagues.

, The organization should specify whether letters are to be submitted online or as a hard copy (which can be sent by mail or dropped of in person). Follow the organization's requirements. If sending your letter by mail, be sure that you have affixed the correct amount of postage to your letter, and that you have the correct contact person's name and mailing address for the envelope.

, Wait at least a few days (perhaps even a week) before following up, and don't be too pushy or demanding. Simply send a cordial email or place a call during business hours to the contact person for that volunteer position. Let him or her know that you've sent in an application letter and that you wanted to formally express your interest in the opportunity to be a part of the organization. And above all else, remember to be professional and courteous.

, This is a polite and professional way to let the hiring party know that you appreciate his or her time. The thank you note can be an actual letter or an email, and you should send a note to each interviewer you met with.Address the interviewer by name.Thank him or her for the opportunity to meet and discuss the position.Try to mention something specific that the interviewer talked about during your meeting. Letting him or her know in the thank you note that you were interested in what he/she said shows that you were paying attention and that you take the opportunity seriously.Close with a polite ending that does not assume that you have earned the position. Say something like, ""I look forward to discussing this opportunity further,"" or wish the interviewer luck with the selection process.
Some organizations are inundated with volunteer requests and may ask that you do not follow up. In each case, do as instructed.

Write the address (‘’Anschrift’’).,
Write the date (‘’Datum’’).,
Choose a formal salutation (‘’Anrede’’).,
Follow etiquette when writing the content of your letter.,
Select a formal closing (‘’Briefschluss’’).",How to Write a Letter in German1," It’s only necessary to write an address on a letter if it is formal. Otherwise, you can just write the addresses on the envelope or package. The components of addresses in German come in a different order than in English: title, name, street and number, postal code (‘’Postleitzahl’’), and location. For example:Frau (Ms.--use ""Herr"" for Mr.) Marianne Mülller, Zeughofstrasse 23, 1121 Berlin, Deutschland;
, This is usually placed in the top right corner of a document. There are multiple ways to write a date on a German letter, which may vary from the way it is written in English. You can also choose to write the place (‘’Ort’’) you are writing from along with the date. For example, all of the following are acceptable ways of writing “from Berlin on April 13, 2017.” Pay special attention to the placement of periods (don’t use dashes, slashes, or commas):2017-04-13
13.04.2017
13. April 2017
Berlin, 13.04.2017
Berlin, den 13. April 2017

, Letters in German should always begin with a short greeting addressed to the reader of the letter. For formal correspondence, there are a number of acceptable salutations. If you are corresponding with a professional (such as a doctor or official), include their title. Make sure to pay attention to differences in spelling depending on whether you are writing to a man, woman, or both:Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren (Dear Sir or Madam)
Sehr geehrte Damen (Dear Madam)
Sehr geehrte Herren (Gentlemen)
Sehr geehrte Frau Müller (Dear Ms. Müller)
Sehr geehrter Herr Mülller (Dear Mr. Mülller)
Sehr geehrte Frau Bundeskanzlerin (Dear Ms. Chancellor)
Sehr geehrter Herr Professor Müller (Dear Professor Müller)
Sehr geehrte Frau Dr. Mann, sehr geehrter Herr Mann (Dear Dr. Mann, dear Mr. Mann)

, For formal correspondence in German, you can be direct about the purpose of your writing. However, it is a still a good idea to structure your letter carefully, and to show courtesy.Start the body of your letter with a brief introduction (identify yourself, greet the addressee, briefly explain the purpose of your letter). Unlike in English, you do not capitalize the first word in the body of your letter.
Follow this by writing in detail about the purpose of your letter. Be clear about what you are requesting, explaining, or inquiring about (for example, registering a complaint or asking about a business opportunity).
End the body of your letter with a short closing that summarizes the purpose of your letter, explains if/how you would like the addressee to follow up, and thanks them for their time.

, The closing of your letter should be courteous and respectful. Like the salutation, it can take one of several forms. Pay special attention to the spelling, since closings that sound very similar in English will be written in distinctly different ways in German. Potential closings (and their approximate English equivalents) include:Mit freundlichen Grüssen (Yours sincerely)
Mit freundlichem Gruss (Sincerely)
Freundliche Grüsse (Kind regards)
Mit den besten Grüsssen (With best regards)
Beste Grüsse aus Berlin (Best regards from Berlin)
Herzliche Grüsse (Warm greetings)

You can also send a letter of congratulations for those who are lower than you in the hierarchy or work at the same level as you.
Sending a congratulatory note can strengthen your existing relationships at your workplace and tell the recipient that their achievements are being noticed.
Congratulating someone you had not interacted with earlier opens up networking opportunities for you.
Your letter can act as a starting point to aid your future interactions.
Being on good terms with coworkers can benefit your future work-related interactions.;
, If you want your letter to have the greatest possible impact, it is always highly appreciated if you promptly express your happiness regarding someone’s achievement.


At the latest, you should write your letter 2-3 days after receiving word of the accomplishment.
If you delay, the impact of your letter will not be that significant.
A tardy letter may give the impression that you are only sending the letter out of politeness or as an afterthought, and are not truly happy for the person.

, The language that you use in your letter should not be complicated.


The receiver should be able to easily understand what you are expressing, or else the purpose of the letter will be lost.
Simple language often sounds more sincere than flowery, intricate writing.

, The tone of your writing should be positive, concise, and to the point.


Avoid extensively lengthy writing that may give the impression of exaggeration.
Don't include unnecessary details that do not serve the purpose of the letter.

, Keep your praise genuine when writing your letter to present a caring tone.


Congratulate the person in an honest manner, instead of being fake.
Be genuine, and sincerely express that you are happy without any exaggeration.
Your sentiment should not be so overboard that it could be mistaken as sarcasm, condescension, or jealousy.

Consider why you are going to write a proof of employment letter.,
Think about who should write the proof of employment letter.,
Gather the required information.,
Use company letterhead.,
Address the letter as specifically as possible.,
Explain who you are.,
Provide employment verification.,
Summarize the employee's duties.,
Avoid sharing sensitive or illegal information about the employee.,
Give the recipient your contact information.,
Sign the letter and send it.",How to Write a Letter for Proof of Employment," Depending on who your audience is for your employment verification letter, your content and tone may vary. If you are writing an employment verification letter for a financial institution, you may take on a more professional tone and you may have to include financial information (e.g., salaries, commissions, raises, and bonuses). In contrast, if you are writing a letter for an employee who is applying for new jobs, your tone may be more friendly and you might omit financial information.


Understanding the purpose and scope of your employment verification letter will help you draft a letter that most closely fits the needs of the recipient.

, Normally, employment verification letters will be written by employers on behalf of employees.In this situation, an employee is likely to approach you, the employer, and ask you for an employment verification letter for a specific purpose. On the other hand, it may be possible for an employee to write an employment verification letter himself or herself. In this situation, you, the employee, will write the letter yourself and then ask your employer to sign it or adapt it to their liking.Whenever possible, the employer should write the letter on behalf of the employee, not the other way around.


If you are an employer writing a letter for an employee, you will be able to customize the letter to your specifications and you will be able to control the message. Also, writing the employment verification letter yourself, as the employer, will give the letter genuineness and authenticity. However, the major drawback is the time it takes to write these letters. As an employer, you are likely to have a busy schedule and writing these letters may become time consuming. With that said, employment verification letters are often short and concise, so you may not have to spend too much time writing, especially if you have gone through the process before.
If you are an employee writing your own letter, you will be able to dictate what information is conveyed to the recipient and you will not need to take time relaying your ideas to your employer. Also, writing your own letter may ease any pressure your employer feels about the time it may take to write one of these letters themselves (i.e., writing your own letter may make your boss happy because they will not have to do it for you). However, an employer will always have to sign the letter and they may not want to sign off on what you wrote. If this is the case, you may have to spend even more time re-writing the letter or you may force the employer to write it for you.

, Once you understand who your audience is and who will be writing the letter, you will need to gather the information necessary to write a complete employment verification letter.


If you are the employer, you will need to have a conversation with the employee about what they want out of the letter. This will include information about who the letter will be sent to, what the purpose of the letter is, what specifics need to be included, and when it needs to be sent.
If you are the employee and you are writing your own letter, you will have all of the information you need to write the letter, although you may want to talk with your employer first and ask what they expect out of an employment verification letter. This will help ensure you write the letter to your employer's specifications so they will sign off on it.

, When you begin writing an employment verification letter, you always want to use official company letterhead. If you are the employer, you should always have this handy; if you are the employee, you should ask your employer if you can use their official letterhead. Using official letterhead will legitimize the letter and will help your recipient trust the content of the letter.


If you do not have official letterhead available, you can start by using a computer to create a header on your letter. When doing this, the header should include the employer's company name, address, phone number and email address. It should also provide information about who is writing the letter (and their job title) and the date the letter is being written.

, If you know the name of the recipient, address the letter directly to him or her. If you do not know who will be reading your letter, address it to the organization generally, with an attention line explaining what the letter is about.


For example, if you know the address and name of the person you will be sending the letter to, write that directly below your header. Follow this with an appropriate salutation such as ""Dear .""
If you do not know who to address the letter to, send it to a generally appropriate department with an attention line explaining what the letter is about. For example, if you are sending a letter to a financial institution for the purpose of an employee getting a loan, you may send the letter to the financial institution's local branch office with an attention line that says, ""Employment Verification for for the Purpose of Loan Procurement."" Follow this with an appropriate salutation such as ""To Whom It May Concern.""

, In the first body paragraph of your employment verification letter, you want to explain who you are and what the purpose of the letter is. You will include what your title at the company is, how long you have worked there, and how long you have known the employee you are writing the letter for. Even if you are the employee writing the letter yourself, you will still write the letter as if it is coming from your employer since they will be the one signing off on it.


For example, you could write: ""My name is Bob Jones and I am the Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing at ABC Corporation. I have been working at ABC Corporation for 12 years and have known employee for seven years. I am currently employee's direct supervisor and have been for the past three years.""

, The next body paragraph will summarize the employee's employment with your company. It will include the dates of the employee's employment, their title at the company, whether the job is temporary or permanent, and whether the employee still works there. This paragraph will include the employee's financial information if it is necessary.


For example, an acceptable paragraph may say: ""This letter is to confirm the employment of employee. Employee has worked for ABC Corporation for seven years, starting on September 7, 2003. Employee holds the title of associate sales director, which is a permanent position here with ABC Corporation. Employee is still currently working as an associate sales director at ABC Corporation as of January 7, 2011.""
Another example may look like this: ""This letter is to confirm that employee worked for ABC Corporation for seven years. Employee worked at ABC Corporation from September 7, 2003 until January 7, 2011. Employee held the title of associate sales director while employed at ABC Corporation. Employee worked full-time for all seven years they were employed with ABC Corporation and they were paid an annual salary of $65,000.""

, This paragraph will describe the employee's duties at your organization. This information will be most useful when you are writing an employment verification letter for an employee applying for another job. While an employment verification letter is not a letter of recommendation, it never hurts to include any positive feedback you have about the employee. It will help your reputation as an employer and will help your employee in their search for a new job, property, or loan.


One possible way to write this paragraph would be: ""Employee's duties with ABC Corporation included the following: Employee was responsible for selling radiators in the San Francisco region of California. Employee held a managerial position and was responsible for motivating a sales team of between seven and nine people. Employee was required to ensure customer satisfaction, deal with customer complaints, and was required to report quarterly to corporate headquarters about their sales progress.""

, Most states have some laws regulating what you can and cannot say in employment references and other statements to prospective employers.Some states allow you to provide information about an employee only with that employee's consent.Other states allow an employer to reveal almost anything about an employee so long as they were being honest and were making the statements in good faith.Before revealing any sensitive information, be sure you look at your state's laws. You can start by looking here.


For example, Alaska allows an employer to reveal information about job performance, and the employer will be immune from liability for making those statements unless the employer knowingly or intentionally discloses false or misleading information, or information that violates an employees civil rights.Another example is Connecticut, where an employer is allowed to reveal any truthful statement of facts., The final full paragraph of your employment verification letter should include your (the employer's) contact information. It is necessary to include this information in case the recipient of your letter has any follow-up questions or concerns. Make sure you state that it is okay for the recipient to contact you.


For example, your contact paragraph may say: ""If you have any questions or require more information, please do not hesitate to contact me at (555) 555-5555 or at js@ABCCorp.com."", Once you have completed your letter, you will include a closing, sign the letter, and you will either give it to your employee or send it to the recipient yourself.


Close your letter with ""Sincerely,"" or ""Best"".
Always sign the letter using your official signature and job title.
Include any official stamps or verifications your company usually uses for these types of letters.

Address the letter to the specific child.,
Create positive reinforcement.,
Ask the child to do something.,
Stay positive.,
Stay in character.",How to Write a Letter from Santa1," If you want the child to believe the letter is really from Santa, you should address it to that child. Mention the child’s age in the letter too. Mention their name in the body of the letter at least twice in addition to addressing it to the specific child.


Thread details into the letter that show Santa knows the child. For example, you could praise something specific that the child did that year. You could thread references that are specific to your household, also. For example, if your house doesn’t have a chimney, you could explain that Santa can get in anyway.
You could also reference a favorite pet, the child’s interests, or something he or she did recently at school. You could mention family events or excursions to make the letter seem believable.You may want to mention the birth of Jesus Christ, if you are religious.;
, Use the letter to encourage the child to continue to be good. Explain specifically what the child did that deserved rewarding. Tell the child whether he or she made Santa’s “naughty or nice list"" (only mention it if they are on the ""nice"" list though!)


Inform the child that, if he or she continues to demonstrate similar positive behavior, the child will be rewarded at Christmas time.
Focus on milestones and achievements from the past year (such as the child becoming potty trained or earning a Cub or Girl Scouts badge). This will encourage the child to demonstrate positive behavior throughout the rest of the year, also.

, You could ask the child to do something specific. Children take requests from Santa seriously, so here’s your chance!


Ask the child to leave cookies and milk and to not forget to give a carrot to Rudolph and the other reindeer! You could instruct the child to go to sleep early on Christmas Eve. Basically, close the letter with instructions.
You can ask the child to perform specific tasks throughout the year too (whatever the child needs to work on), such as doing his or her homework on time or helping with the dishes.

, This cannot be emphasized enough! A letter from Santa is not the time to scold or discipline a child for misbehavior! Describe good qualities the child demonstrates, such as having a good sense of humor, smiling a lot, and caring about animals.


Use words that are positive. Even if your child has misbehaved in key ways, encourage him or her for the things that he or she has done right over the year. Children like to be told they are liked and loved, that they are interesting and special, that they make people smile, and that their company is appreciated.Many websites have lists of affirming words that may have meaning to a child. They include “kind, respectful, willing to help, responsible, trustworthiness, gentle, and good.” Use warm, affirming words that indicate that the child is loved and appreciated.

, When writing a letter to your child, make sure to say the things you would expect to hear Santa say.


Stay jolly and merry.
Talk about the reindeer or Mrs. Claus.
Don't forget to Ho-Ho-Ho

Select an informal greeting.,
Write the body of your letter.,
Close your letter informally.",How to Write a Letter in German2," When writing an informal letter in German, as in English, you have more freedom in terms of starting your letter. It’s not necessary to write the date or address, though you can if you want. Give your letter an informal salutation that suits who you are writing to. Pay special attention to the spelling. For example, write “Liebe” (“Dear”) if you are writing to a woman, but “Lieber” (“Dear”) if you are writing to a man. Try one of these greetings:Guten Tag, Frau Müller (Good day, Ms. Müller)
Liebe Frau Müller (Dear Ms. Müller)
Lieber Heinrich (Dear Heinrich)
Hallo, Andreas (Hi Andreas)
Mein lieber Schatz (My dear honey)
Hallo mein Liebling (Hello my darling)
Hallo meine Süße (Hello sweetie - female)
Hallo mein Süßer (Hello sweetie - male)

, Since you are writing an informal letter, you have plenty of freedom for choosing what to say and how to structure it. In general, try to keep your ideas grouped together, and separate paragraphs with line breaks to make your letter easy to read.


Remember that you do not need to capitalize the first word of the body of your letter.

, Even for letters to friends or family, it’s courteous to include an clear closing in your letter. You can be more casual or even intimate, depending on who you are writing to. Try one of these common closings:Herzlichst (Cordially)
Viele Grüße (Lots of regards)
Liebe Grüße (Lots of love)
Alles Liebe (Lots of love)
Dein (Yours - male)
Deine (Yours - female)
In Liebe (With love - for romantic relationships)

Format the addresses.,
Put the addresses on the envelope or package.,
Mail your letter.,
Follow standard letter-writing conventions when sending an email.",How to Write a Letter in German3," If you are sending a physical letter, you will need the name of the person, business, or organization you are writing to (and their title, if applicable), their street address, the postal code, and location. You should also include the destination country, especially if you are writing from overseas.

If you are writing to Germany or another location, contact your local post office for information about how to deliver the letter. You may also have private shipping options from carriers like FedEx, DHL, and UPS., For the most part, the guidelines for writing a letter in German apply when sending an email or other electronic correspondence.

Even though email is instantaneous, it still pays to show courtesy and respect, especially when writing to people you don’t know."

Address the letter with the person's first name to maintain a friendly tone.,
State the word “Congratulations” immediately to get to the point.,
Mention the reason for your congratulations.,
Express your confidence in the person's abilities.,
Sign off with an encouraging and polite note to end your letter well.,
Proofread your letter to ensure it is perfect.",How to Write a Letter of Congratulations2," Although you will be keeping an otherwise formal tone throughout your letter, it is nice to address the person with their first name to open the letter casually.

When you are speaking for more than one person and want to include them in the letter you can simply state, “my wife/ partner joins me in congratulating you on…”

, Since you have a solid reason to congratulate your business associate, it is necessary to mention that reason in your letter.


Not stating the reason will make the person wonder whether or not your congratulations is purely generic.
You should always state your reason for congratulations early on in your letter.
This will illustrate what actually motivated you to write the letter.

, When writing a letter of congratulations to someone, you should make sure to express your confidence in their abilities.


You should mention that you always notice the person's zeal and potential, or the efforts the person had been putting into work-related endeavors.
Referring to the person's good qualities in your letter will make the recipient feel great about their abilities and give them the confidence to pursue their future endeavors.
For example, you may write: ""Your willingness to go the extra mile has always been quite well known"" OR ""This promotion definitely shows that your hard work, determination, and sheer dedication has been noticed and regarded in the best possible way.""

, Make sure to end your congratulatory note very politely to leave a good impression.


Ending your note politely will leave a good taste in the recipient's mouth, and create lingering feelings of goodwill towards you.
The ending should contain a wish for many more achievements in their future.
You can also re-reference their current accomplishment and restate how the company is benefitting from their work.
For example, you may end with something like: ""I wish you success in all your future endeavors. Best Regards, <Your name>""

, The last step, but one of the most important, is to proofread your letter.


Your letter should be free of all grammatical errors and typos.
The sentence structure should also flow smoothly.
Putting in the extra effort to proofread can take your letter of congratulations to the next level.

Write Santa through the United States Post Office and get a letter back.,
Don't miss the due date.",How to Write a Letter from Santa2," The Post Office has a longstanding “letters to Santa” program for children.


First, have the child write a letter to Santa. Have the child address it to Santa Claus, North Pole. When the child isn’t looking, write Santa’s response on the back of the letter. Then, send the letter to the following address: North Pole Holiday Postmark, Postmaster, 4141 Postmark Dr, Anchorage, AK, 99530-9998.
Be specific in the letter. Reference your child’s accomplishments, such as how proud Santa is that the child helped at something specific. Sign it, Santa Claus. Put the letter in a new envelope addressed to the child. Put a first-class stamp on it. The return address on the envelope should say Santa Claus, North Pole.

, If the Anchorage postmaster receives the letter by Dec. 15, the postmaster will remove Santa’s letter addressed to your child, apply the North Pole postmark, and send it back to your child.


The child will then receive the letter from Santa in the mail.It's more believable to a child when a letter arrives in the mail. Just make sure it's not in your handwriting if the child might recognize it.

These letters can seem believable to a child because they are designed to respond to specifics in a letter the child wrote.
The letters often arrive in the regular mail, making the child convinced you didn’t send it (especially if it has a stamp or postmark from the North Pole).

, The letter will look fake if you just print it off the computer. So, you should use stationary instead of plain white paper, and let it look a little rumpled.

Don’t forget a North Pole return address. Make sure you sign the letter from Santa Claus.

Create a consistent brand for yourself.",How to Obtain eBook Resale Rights Inexpensively," When someone creates a product or writes some material, they have the right to control what happens to their creation. One of their options is to give or sell “resell rights.” (The words “resell” and “resale” are used interchangeably, but “resell” is the more commonly used word.) In this case, we are talking about ebooks. If you buy regular resell rights to an ebook, you then own the right to sell that ebook to someone else and receive money for it. In a sense, you are becoming like a publisher. You will offer the ebook for sale on your website, people will buy it from you, and you make money.With regular resell rights, you have the right to sell the ebook to a consumer, and that consumer may enjoy it for personal use. The person who buys from you cannot resell the ebook or its contents.;
, If you purchase master resell rights (MRR), then you are buying the legal right to sell the book, just as with regular resell rights. In addition, you can sell resell rights to your customers. In this way, you can presumably charge more, and the customers who buy from you can, in turn, sell the ebook to additional customers and make money for themselves., With both regular resell rights and master resell rights, you may sell the ebook just as a regular publisher or bookstore might sell any book. But if you purchase private label rights (PLR), you then own the right to revise the ebook to suit your own needs before you resell it. You can edit the work, make revisions to the content in any way, and even claim authorship before reselling it.When you purchase PLR, you may receive them with or without limitations. The person selling the PLR to you may limit what you can do with the work. In this case, you would have “restricted PLR.” If you buy PLR without any limitations, then you have “unrestricted PLR.”

, Rebranding rights go beyond PLR. If you purchase rebranding rights, you will have the right to insert your own online links into the ebook, to redirect readers to your website, to encourage them to buy additional products from you., All forms of resell rights apply only to material that is protected by current copyright law. However, certain works are in the public domain, which means that they are not controlled by copyright law. If a book is in the public domain, that means that it is available for anyone to use, revise, control or even sell.For a better understanding of public domain law and whether a particular work is in the public domain, visit the official site of the U.S. Copyright Office at www.copyright.gov., You should begin by selecting a topic that interests you. Then conduct an online search for that topic, using the phrase “resell rights.” You will receive a list of links to sites that offer ebook material for sale. You can review those links and the items they are offering. As you review those listings, pay attention to the type of rights that you are purchasing along with the ebooks.


For example, you may be purchasing access to the ebook, the right to resell it and to sell resell rights to your own customers (MRR), the right to change the graphics, and the right to add it to paid membership sites.
Check to see what you may not do as well. For example, you may not be able to edit the content of a book or add it to free membership sites.

, If you search for resell packs or packets, you will find offers for groups of ebooks on a common theme. Basically, someone else has done the research of finding a group of ebooks on one topic, with similar resell rights, and is now offering them as a collection. Buying an ebook pack will generally cost more than buying an individual ebook, but you will have more materials to choose from, and the work of finding them has been done for you.

, With a quick Internet search, you can find links to a variety of groups, clubs or companies that offer memberships. For a flat fee payment, you can join the club. In exchange, you gain access to a library of ebook material that the membership has resell rights to, and then you obtain the rights to those materials as well. These clubs often also offer to provide you with training or other information to start your reselling business.

, Most of the ebook resellers offer some level of support or training. This is particularly true if you join one of the membership clubs. You should take advantage of these offers and use the training that they provide. The training will explain how to advertise and market your products and reach the most potential customers., To make the most of reselling ebooks, you will need to be adept at creating websites and marketing your products. You need to generate the most visibility possible, and find ways to catch the eye of possible consumers. With rebranding rights and PLR, you can insert your own links into the content of the product, which can help draw even more customers to your site.For example, you may be able to build a mailing list, create a blog, or initiate a newsletter that you can regularly send out to your prospective customers.

, Branding is important with any product. You can increase the attention that your ebooks receive if you create your own brand or style. Be consistent and use this on your website. If you have rebranding rights or PLR, you should revise the ebooks themselves so they all have the same look or style. This will create a consistency that will draw more customers to additional products that you offer.You should adopt a logo and type style and then use them consistently to build customer confidence.Develop a consistent theme for any slides or webinar materials you may put out.
Use document templates consistently.
Select a consistent topic or theme in the products you offer. When you are just starting out, work with one consistent topic, such as fitness or business growth. Then, after building some customer loyalty, branch out to other fields.

, The first art you choose will be your books cover page. The cover page illustration should be relevant to the story such as if you were doing a story on horses you'd pick an illustration with horses in it.

You can also buy the art work so no one else can use it. If you choose not to buy it, it's still available for others to use as their cover page too. If you like the art work you can also heart it.

, You have the choice of writing a poem (single page), a picture book (multi page, no chapters), or a long form book (multi chapters).

For now you might want to choose the first chapter of a new book which means that you want to write a long form book.


Create a chapter note. Notes should be different and unique for each individual chapter and should be a note from you the author yourself. You can thank the viewers for reading your book or say how good this chapter is going to be.
Change the chapter title if you wish. If you already named the title of the chapter then it should automatically come up, if not then create one now. The chapter title should be what the paragraphs are about such as How it all started.
Change the book cover if you wish. If you're tired of the art work or you find it doesn't fit, you can always change the book cover. The same applies to the title.
Create your summary. The summary applies to all chapters and basically sums up the book and should describe the book.
Add tags. Tags are like categories but are smaller words such as 'horses', 'girls', 'city' or 'diary'. You can add as many as you like but make sure to space them apart.
Add a category. You can choose two categories for one book. If the book is about animals, put it in the animal category. If the book is told about or in a diary, put it in the diary category. It's very simple.
Choose a suitable age group. This is what kind of audience your book is aimed at such as for little toddlers, kids, teenagers or adults. You can choose more than one age group, and it can be all of the age groups too.

, Moderation is where your book has to get checked over by an admin to see whether the age group is correct, whether the book has swearing in it, etc. Submitting to moderation can take months so be patient! Meanwhile you can create more chapters or more books.

Make your own art.",How to Be a Muse1," Not every artist needs a muse, but throughout time many painters, photographers, writers, filmmakers and choreographers have attributed their best work to inspiration from someone special, often a fellow artist. Whether or not you make art yourself, if your social circle is full of creative types, you may end up becoming someone’s muse. Find out where the writers, artists and musicians in your town spend time and start becoming a regular there.


For example, the actress Edie Sedgwick hung around with Andy Warhol at his studio, The Factory, and they became very close friends. He was so struck by her beauty and presence that he created a series of films for her to star in and dubbed her his ""superstar."" ;
, Although there are examples of muses whose beauty alone served as inspiration (Vermeer’s anonymous Girl with the Pearl Earring, for example), muses are often just as creative as the artists they inspire. A muse is someone who engages the artist on an intellectual level, spurring him or her to run with creative ideas that someone else wouldn’t really understand. To be a muse, encourage the artist to explore more deeply, rather than pulling back. No discussion should be off-limits.


John Lennon and Yoko Ono were each other's muses in part because they were intellectually in sync. They had the same political goals and they believed the best way to reach people and change the world was through art. Thanks in part to their relationship, they gave the world some of the most innovative music, performance and visual art it had ever seen., Rules, restrictions, and social norms can put a damper on creativity. It's impossible to think outside the box when you're constantly reminded of its perimeters. A muse helps the artist think beyond the confines of everyday life. When an artist is with his or her muse, things like financial constraints and social obligations go out the window, because what matters is creating something new. If you want to be a muse, help the artist let go of the baggage that weighs us down as humans and explore a different plane.


Many muses throughout history have had a carefree, wild spirit that captivates those around them. This was the case with Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe, another pair of mutual muses who lived together in the East Village during the tumultuous 1970s. Smith's music and performance art and Mapplethorpe's photography changed the cultural landscape.

, Though anyone can be a muse, the classic muse archetype is a beauty, a flirtatious, feminine spirit with an insatiable sex drive. Sexual arousal can help spur creativity, since it lowers inhibitions and charges the body and brain with erotic energy. From Gala Dali to Georgia O’Keefe, countless muses have used the power of their sexuality to drive artists wild and inspire some of their most beautiful work. In many cases, the muse is years younger than the artist she inspires.

, You can be a muse without having a perfectly-proportioned body and a pretty face. Whatever it is that makes you different, play it up. An artist’s quest is to create something the world has never seen, something truly original. An artist’s muse is not just a model or mannequin, but a source of original energy and life. For example, Pablo Picasso's series of muses, including Dora Maar and Marie-Therese Walter, helped him see the human body in a new way and inspired him to share his insights with the world.

, If you create your own art, you know what it means to harness an idea or feeling and express it through painting, words, dance, and so on. You understand the emptiness that comes with having a creative block, and the release when it’s lifted and you can finally create again with the help of outside inspiration. When you’re intimately familiar with how creativity ebbs and flows you can help someone else who is struggling.


August Rodin's muse was a fellow sculptor, Camille Claudel. He made some of his best and most famous works in her presence, feeling inspired by their shared passion. Unfortunately, Claudel didn't achieve the same fame and success as Rodin.

Let your imagination run wild.,
Pursue your original ideas.,
Explore your emotions more deeply.,
Have a liberated lifestyle.,
Interpret your dreams.,
Use your experiences as material.",How to Be a Muse2," While having a muse can give you a new creative perspective, one's art shouldn't be dependent on someone else's influence. You can be your own inspiration if you set your imagination free. What creative ideas can you come up with by simply exploring the depths of your own mind? Do exercises that help release your creativity.


If you're feeling uninspired, shake things up in your life and try something completely new. Take a dance class or switch from painting to photography for awhile. Sometimes expressing yourself in a different way can open up new wells of creativity.

, Instead of going along with others’ way of thinking, or judging your thoughts and casting them aside, model your art around your original ideas. Don’t let yourself be bound by constructs imposed by society or the institutions you were born into. Pursue all of your ideas, even the seemingly bad ones, to see where they lead. Be your own muse by letting yourself run with even the strangest concepts you come up with.

, It's easy to stunt our own creative drives by refusing to let our emotions get the best of us. But some of the best art puts emotion on full display. Baring your soul's deepest feelings helps you connect with your audience in new and creative ways. Instead of trying to regulate your emotions to make them more manageable, let yourself feel them completely. Try making art when you're having a strong emotion, and see how your despair, anger or joy influences your work.

, Thinking out of the box will help you feel more creative. If you stick to a strict schedule and your days are mostly predictable, when do you have time to be creative and free? Give yourself more opportunities to feel uninhibited creative energy instead of following the rules all the time.


If you could live on a little less money, consider giving up your nine to five job for something that gives you more flexibility.
Spend time with other people who value creativity as much as you do, so you don't feel you're doing something wrong by having a lifestyle outside of the social norm.

, Do you pay attention to your dream life? You can’t control your dreams (unless you’re adept at lucid dreaming), but paying more attention to them is a good way to tap into the side of your brain that’s free to be strange and unique.


Try writing down your dreams as soon as you wake up. That way you'll remember them better and you'll be able to use them as source material for your art.
Connect what happens in your dreams to waking life experiences and emotions, and see what you can learn from your dreams.

, Your relationships, routines, encounters, reactions and observations can all feature into your artwork. Find original material in your daily existence. Explore your memories and history, your personality and preferences, and get inspired by your own way of seeing the world. There's no one else in the world quite like you. Tap into what makes you unique and be your own muse."

When you look at a piece of poetry for the first time, you should read through it and then ask yourself three question:


What is the theme of the poem?,
The theme of the poem refers to the subject the poem is based on.,
The tone of the poem refers to the atmosphere, mood and feelings that are conveyed throughout the poem.

,
The techniques used in the poem help to convey the theme and tone.",How to Interpret Poetry,"
What is the tone of the poem?
What techniques are used in the poem?;
, This could be anything at all, from nature, to death, to love to childhood memories. Look at how the theme is developed.

,, All the following techniques should be looked out for as they convey the theme and the tone.


Imagery refers to the pictures the poet creates using words. Sensual imagery is imagery that appeals to the senses. Visual images appeal to your sense of sight, auditory images appeal to your sense of hearing, olfactory images appeal to your sense of smell and tactile images appeal to your sense of touch.
Alliteration is when two words beginning with the same letter come one after the other, for example, ""looked like.""
A simile is a comparison between two things with the use of ""like"" or ""as,"" for example ""as white as snow.""
A metaphor is a direct comparison between two things without the use of ""like or ""as,"" for example ""needle-points of sound.""
Repetition is when a word or phrase is repeated for emphasis.
Onomatopoeia is when a word sounds like what it describes, for example ""crack"" or ""boom.""
Rhyme is when a word sounds similar to another word, for example ""glass"" and ""class.""

Enjoy your completed poem!",How to Write a Cinquain Poem," The Crapsey cinquain’s structure is more restrictive than an American cinquain.


While an American cinquain requires a specific number of syllables per line, the Crapsey cinquain takes it a step further and requires a certain number of stressed syllables per line.The Crapsey structure goes like this: Line 1 = 2 syllables (1 stressed); Line 2 = 4 syllables (2 stressed); Line 3 = 6 syllables (3 stressed); Line 4 = 8 syllables (4 stressed); Line 5 = 2 syllables (1 stressed).
The American cinquain’s structure goes like this: Line 1 = 2 syllables; Line 2 = 4 syllables; Line 3 = 6 syllables; Line 4 = 8 syllables; Line 5 = 2 syllables.

, Syllables are units of pronunciation having one vowel sound. Each word is made up one or more syllables.The word “it” is only 1 syllable. The word “hello” is 2 syllables (hel-lo). The word “happily” is 3 syllables (hap-pi-ly).If you’re unsure of how many syllables are in a word, there are online services that can help you. The website How Many Syllables is useful. You just type in your word and it breaks it into syllables for you., Most poetry has a rhythm to it. This is called its “meter”, and can be measured by counting the number of stressed and unstressed syllables in each line.


William Shakespeare famously used iambic pentameter in his plays and sonnets.
Iambic pentameter comprises 10 syllables, with 5 of those syllables stressed. Here is a sample line from Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 73”, with the stressed syllables capitalized: “That TIME of YEAR thou MAYST in ME beHOLD.”Notice how in iambic pentameter the syllables alternate between unstressed and stressed. You do not have two stressed syllables together in iambic pentameter, although this is possible with other types of meter (for example, spondaic meter)., To count the stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of poetry, read it out loud. As you read, clap your hands together each time a syllable feels longer than the others.


As an example, think of the noun “rebel” versus the verb “rebel”. In the noun, the first syllable is stressed, like this: REbel. In the verb, the second syllable is stressed, like this: reBEL.As you pronounce the words you should be able to feel which are longer (stressed) and which are shorter (unstressed). If English is not your first language, you can look up the word in an online dictionary to hear the proper pronunciation.

, You don’t have to know how to count stresses or even syllables in order to write an American cinquain poem.


For instance, a “Word Cinquain” only requires you to count the words in each line.
You only need to know about syllables if you’re writing a classic American cinquain or a Crapsey cinquain.
You only need to know about stresses if you’re specifically interested in writing a Crapsey cinquain.

, This could be anything you want to write about. It could be playful, funny, serious, or sad — it’s up to you.


In this example, the topic will be an evil cat who has fallen asleep on you and just woken up from his nap.
Maybe this is a metaphor for someone who feels great anxiety when they wake up each day. Perhaps the cat is a metaphor for the sunlight shining in through the curtains in the morning as you lie in bed.

, Cinquain poems don’t need to be titled, but Crapsey always titled hers.If you’re writing a Crapsey Cinquain, you’ll need to title yours.


In this example, the title is “Lucifer Rises”.

, Your first line must have 2 syllables. One of those syllables must be stressed.


E.g. “You see”
Note that “see” is the stressed syllable here.

, This line must have 4 syllables. Two of those syllables must be stressed.


E.g. “His back arch up”
Note that “back” and “up” are the stressed syllables here.

, This line must have 6 syllables. Three of those syllables must be stressed.


E.g. “His claws, they dig so deep”
Note that “claws”, “dig” and “deep” are the stressed syllables here.

, This line must have 8 syllables. Four of those syllables must be stressed.


E.g. “You tense, he yawns, your stomach tears”
Note that “tense”, “yawns”, “stom” (as in STOMach), and “tears” are the stressed syllables here.

, This line is like the first line. It has only 2 syllables. Of those syllables, only 1 syllable should be stressed.


E.g. “He grins”
Note that “grins” is the stressed syllable here.

, Give your poem a read and make sure it meets the metric requirements of a Crapsey cinquain. Here is a breakdown of the syllables and stresses (capitalized) of each line of our sample poem:Line 1: You SEE - 2 syllables, 1 stress
Line 2: His BACK arch UP - 4 syllables, 2 stresses
Line 3: His CLAWS, they DIG so DEEP - 6 syllables, 3 stresses
Line 4: You TENSE, he YAWNS, your STOMach TEARS - 8 syllables, 4 stresses
Line 5: He GRINS - 2 syllables, 1 stress

,


”Lucifer Rises”
You see
His back arch up
His claws, they dig so deep
You tense, he yawns, your stomach tears
He grins

, American cinquains are much more flexible than Crapsey ones. Generally an American cinquain will follow a 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 2 syllabic count, but there are variations on this.For example, the “Word Cinquain” follows this structure: Line 1 = 1 word; Line 2 = 2 words; Line 3 = 3 words; Line 4 = 4 words; Line 5 = 1 word.For the purposes of this example, we’ll follow the more common style that focuses on syllables.

, This could be anything that interests you. It can be funny, sad, serious, satirical — whatever you want.


In our example, we’ll compare school to a giant monster who wants to eat us.
A title isn’t necessary, but we’ll add one in our example. The title will be “Schoolhouse”.

, Your first line must have 2 syllables. It can be one or two words.


Line 1 e.g., ”Gaping”

, Your second line can have as many words as you want in it, but they have to add up to 4 syllables. This means you’ll have 1 to 4 words max in this line, depending on how many syllables each word contains.


Line 2 e.g., “Its mouth awaits”

, Your third line can have as many words as you want in it, but they need to add up to 6 syllables. This could be anywhere from 1 to 6 words.


Curious about what words might contain 6 syllables? Capitalization and encyclopedia are two examples.Line 3 e.g., “Hungry, slowly chomping”

, Again, the amount of words isn’t as important as the amount of syllables in this line. You need to have 8 syllables in line 4. This can be anywhere from 1 to 8 words.


Most 8-syllable words might be difficult to fit into a poem, but it can still be fun trying. Here are a couple of examples of 8-syllable words: heteronormativity and indecipherability.Line 4 e.g., “Stumble in, consumed, digesting”

, This is your final line, and it will mirror your first line. It can be either 1 or 2 words, but it needs to be 2 syllables.


Line 5 e.g., “Learning”

, Give your poem a read and make sure it meets criteria of whatever cinquain you’re writing, whether it be a syllable-based one or a word-based one. Here’s how our example breaks down (note the hyphens to mark syllables):


Line 1: Gap-ing (2 syllables)
Line 2: Its mouth a-waits (4 syllables)
Line 3: Hun-gry, slow-ly chomp-ing (6 syllables)
Line 4: Stum-ble in, con-sumed, di-gest-ing (8 syllables)
Line 5: Learn-ing (2 syllables)

,


“Schoolhouse”
Gaping
Its mouth awaits
Hungry, slowly chomping
Stumble in, consumed, digesting
Learning

Think about what you want your poem to be about, or the topic chosen for you by your teacher.,
Get ready to count syllables.,
Don't be afraid to get creative.,
Don't be intimidated by poetry.",How to Use Iambic Pentameter While Writing," Make a list of words including adjectives, nouns, and verbs that remind you of the topic and any specific images related to the topic that come to mind. With that list, write at least two synonyms for each word containing more or less syllables. This way, you have a word bank to come back to if a word doesn't quite fit.;
, The phrase ""iambic pentameter"" simply means that each line of poetry contains ten syllables, or five ""iambs."" An iamb consists of two syllables: unstressed and stressed. This means the second word has more emphasis when read aloud, or is more stressed than the first. Let's look at an example of a sonnet, taken from Sonnet CXXX (130) by William Shakespeare: Now, let's take a look at the first line.


To help you hear the beat, tap your fingers on each syllable as you read aloud, tapping harder the second time. Do you hear it?

My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red, than her lips red:
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.


Did you notice how it naturally sounded like music? ""My Mistress' EYES are nothing LIKE the SUN."" It's like a dance, elegant yet simple. Apply that to your own poem. Does it flow well? If not, did you see another word in your list that would work better?

, Use words with double meanings if you'd like to. If you are still unsure of yourself, it's best to keep it simple.

, Anyone can write it if they put their hearts into it. Try not to get frustrated if something doesn't quite work, and don't be afraid to ask your friends or family for help. The more time you put into it, the better it will be. Good luck!

Try to sum up the figurative meaning of the poem in a few sentences.",How to Understand a Poem," Poetry is often written for the ear, so you should start by reading the poem out loud as it will help you listen to the poem more closely. Listen to the poem line by line, word by word. Notice the sounds the words make in your mouth. You may start to notice that the poem is using certain effects, like rhyming, word patterns, or line breaks, to create a certain mood or tone. Try to listen to what might be going on in the poem, especially the first time you read the poem out loud.You may need to read the poem out loud more than once to really listen to each word on the page. If you are uncomfortable with reading poetry out loud, you may ask a friend or peer to read it for you so you can listen more closely without being distracted by your voice.;
, To fully understand the poem as a whole, you should make sure you read the poem from beginning to end. Read the title of the poem as well as the author, if noted. You should also read any endnotes or footnotes at the bottom of the poem, if any. The poem was written to form a whole piece, or work of art, so you should ensure that you read and digest all of it., You should have a pencil or pen ready as you read the poem out loud and in your head several times. Underline any words that have a strong meaning or an interesting sound to your ear. Circle any words that you find confusing or that jump out at you as important.You can also write notes to yourself in the margins of the poem. You may put a question mark next to a passage or line that strikes you as strange or unique. You may also write a note about the sound of certain lines or drawn arrows connecting certain lines to each other.

, You should always start with the title of the poem, as the title can tell you a lot as a reader. Determine what the title is telling you and what expectations the title creates for you as a reader. You can use the title as a jumping off point for analyzing the rest of the poem.Maybe the title tells you about the subject of the poem, such as “Love and Friendship”, or the title labels the poem as a specific literary genre or type, such as “Ode to Melancholy” or “Sonnet 14.” Use the title as the first clue to what the poem might be about as well as certain themes or ideas in the poem.

, Once you have read the poem several times, out loud and to yourself, you should try to identify the main subject of the poem. Try to answer the question, What is the poem about? or Who is the poem about? Try to be as detailed and precise as possible when you answer this question. Avoid a general statement or a vague impression of the subject of the poem.


For example, perhaps you are trying to understand the poem, “I Hear America Singing” by Walt Whitman.#*You may determine that the poem is about America, both as a larger idea and as individual people part of a nation, such as “the boatman, the mason, the carpenter, the mother.” You may also think the poem is trying to look at the uniqueness of each individual American, where “Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else” as well as how this uniqueness contributes to the idea of America as one nation, united., You should consider the premise or situation of the poem. Determining the situation of the poem will help you get some grounding in the piece and situate yourself as a reader.


Ask yourself several questions, such as, What appears to be going on in the poem? Who is talking and to whom? Where is the poem taking place? Why is the poem being told?
For example, perhaps you are analyzing Langston Hughes’ poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers.”You may note that the speaker of the poem is “the negro” of the title and the poem is being told to help share the negro’s story and his history. You may realize that the poem is acting as a testament to the life of the negro, literally and figuratively.

, You should look for any references to literary events or historical events in the poem, as well as known historical or literary figures. Often, these events or figures are in the poem for a reason. They may help to provide context for the poem and help you better understand the poem as a reader.For example, you may notice that in Langston Hughes’ poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers”, there are references to “the Euphrates”, “the Congo”, “the Nile”, “the Mississippi”, and “New Orleans.” The poem also references the historical figure “Abraham Lincoln.”These references are important because they tell the reader about the history of “the negro”, placing the subject in the context of world history and American history.

, To get further context on the poem, you should also gather information about the author of the poem, or the poet. You may look up the poet online or at your local library. You can then use this context to help you determine the themes of the poem.Read up on biographical information about the poet, such as where they are from, the time period they were writing within, and their other poems or publications. You should also read general thoughts on the poet’s writing concerns and common themes that arise in their other poems.

, You should focus on analyzing the poem on a deeper level by looking at the word choice in the poem. There may be words you understand and words that are unfamiliar to you. Look up any words that you do not recognize using a good dictionary. Consider how the meaning of the words fit within the rest of the poem.For example, in “I Hear America Singing” by Walt Whitman, you may notice the words “varied” and “blithe”.You may then look up these words and notice how they add meaning to a line in poem or how they add meaning to the poem overall.

, You should also look at the verbs used in the poem. Verbs imply action and they can often tell you what is going on in the poem on a deeper level. Underline the verbs in the poem and consider how they function in each line of the poem.For example, if you analyzing Langston Hughes’ poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers”, you may notice that Hughes uses the verbs “known”, “bathed”, “built”, “looked”, and “heard”. These verbs are a mix of active and passive verbs, where the speaker is doing something actively, like bathing or building, and then becomes more passive, such as looking or hearing., You should read the poem out loud and consider how certain lines sound. Is there a rhythm or a rhyme to the lines? Are certain words emphasized in the poem? You should consider how these elements relate to the poem’s meaning. You should also think about the effect created by the sound and rhythm in the poem.You should try to identify the metrical pattern of the poem. Does every other line rhyme or every third line? Is there alliteration, where words start with the same letter in a row in the same line?
For example, you may be analyzing the poem “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. You may notice that the poem follows a certain rhyming pattern, where the second and fourth lines of every stanza rhyme.In contrast, you may look at “I Hear America Singing” by Walt Whitman, where there appears to be no rhyming in the poem. But you may notice that the poem still has a certain rhythm when read out loud., You should pay close attention to how the poem’s lines are divided or sectioned off. The lines may be broken into stanzas, where there is the same number of lines in each stanza. Or the lines may be separated using line breaks, where the line seems to shift right or left across the page. The sectioning of the lines was done on purpose by the poet so you should consider how it adds to the meaning of the poem.For example, in Langston Hughes’ poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers”, you may notice that the third line of the poem is indented so there is a line break. This creates a certain rhythm when the poem is read out loud or in your head, putting a stress on the word “flow”, and making you pause on the last line of the stanza.You may also notice that the fourth line of the poem stands on its own as a single line. Hughes seems to be trying to emphasize the importance of this line, forcing the reader to slow down and take in the line as a whole.

, The mood of the poem can be creepy or unsettling, or it can be matter of fact and friendly. The mood is often evoked using word choice, rhythm, imagery, and description. Determining the mood of the poem can help you access a deeper meaning. Ask yourself, what is the sense I get of the poem when I read it? How do I feel when I read it?For example, “I Hear America Singing” by Walt Whitman, you may feel the mood of the poem is celebratory and joyous, particularly with the use of the words “delicious”, “robust”, “friendly”, and “melodious”.The tone in the poem is based on how the speaker sounds or appears to view her subject. The speaker’s tone could be happy, sad, angry, critical, or distant. The tone of the speaker in “I Hear America Singing” by Walt Whitman appears to be thoughtful, observant, and appreciative of the songs America sings.

, You should identify the form of the poem to deepen your understanding of its meaning and intent. You can use elements like rhyme scheme, section breaks, and word choice in the poem to help you identify the form.For example, if you were analyzing “I Hear America Singing” by Walt Whitman, you may notice that none of the lines rhyme and the lines seem to organized in a free flowing way, with no stanzas and short line breaks. You may then determine that the poem is written in the free verse form.
If you were analyzing “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, you may notice that it follows a certain rhyming scheme and has stanzas that are four or six lines long. You may determine that the poem follows the ballad form, though loosely and with some exceptions.

, To get more into the figurative meaning of the poem, you should look at how the poet uses literary devices like metaphor, simile, and imagery. These devices are often used to add deeper meaning to a line or word, as well as meaning to the poem as a whole.A metaphor is when meaning or identity is given to one subject using another subject or object. For example, if you were analyzing Emily Dickinson’s poem “Fame is a Fickle Food”, you may notice the poem uses the metaphor: “Fame is a fickle food/Upon a shifting plate.”A simile compares two subjects or objects to each other using “as” or “like”. For example, in Langston Hughes’ poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers”, the speaker uses a simile to describe themselves: “My soul has grown deep like the rivers.”Imagery is used to create mental images or pictures in the reader’s mind. The poet may use metaphor, simile, and other literary devices to create strong imagery in the poem. For example, in “I Hear America Singing” by Walt Whitman, Whitman ends the poem with striking imagery about the songs of America that uses description, strong word choice, and action: “Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.”, You can access the figurative meaning of the poem by considering how the poet uses figurative language. Figurative language could be words that are repeated often in the poem or words that rhyme in each stanza. Figurative language could also be a metaphor or simile that is repeated more than once or that is used to begin or end the poem.For example, in “I Hear America Singing” by Walt Whitman, the word “singing” appears ten times in the poem. This is a good indication that it is a figurative term in the poem that is important and holds meaning.In Emily Dickinson’s poem “Fame is a Fickle Food”, the word “fame” appears only once in the poem in the first line. But it is explored through the use of food imagery, indicating that food is a key figurative element in the poem, especially in relation to fame., You should also pay attention to how the poet opens and closes the poem, as these lines are often important. The poet may begin with a specific question in the first line that is then answered or addressed in the last line. The poet may also use the first line as a jumping off point, or a point of exploration that is then summed up in the last line of the poem.For example, in Emily Dickinson’s poem “Fame is a Fickle Food”, the first line “Fame is a fickle food” acts as a sort of prompt or proposition. Dickinson then explores this first line in the rest of the poem and ends with a striking line, “Men eat of it and die.”The last line in the poem sums up the first line of the poem by indicating what happens when you try to eat the fickle food of fame and try to enjoy fame. Dickinson suggests that eating fame leads to death, or a very unhappy end.

, Once you have considered the language use, the imagery, and specific key lines in the poem, you should try to write down the meaning of the poem from your point of view. You can paraphrase the poem in your own words or create a few sentences that sum up the figurative meaning of the poem. Answer the question, What is the poem trying to say? or What was my experience of reading and analyzing the poem?For example, you may paraphrase or sum up Langston Hughes’ poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers”by focusing on how “the negro” speaker uses rivers to communicate and exist. You may paraphrase the poem as being about how the figure of the negro is connected to the natural world and to the history of man through rivers. You may note that Hughes seems to indicate that the negro has a soul that is deep, wide, and bountiful, an essential part of nature that cannot be segregated based on skin tone or race.
Keep in mind there is no one right way to interpret a poem or understand it more deeply. If you have your own specific take on the poem, you should use evidence in the poem to support your interpretation and explore it more fully.

Give your boyfriend the poem once it is done.",How to Write a Poem for a Boyfriend," To get a better sense of how you can approach your poem for your boyfriend, you may want to read a few examples, such as:


“I Loved You First: But Afterwards Your Love...” by Christina Rossetti.“Flirtation” by Rita Dove.“I Love You” by Ella Wheeler Wilcox.""Having a Coke with You"" by Frank O'Hara., Look at how each example addresses a romantic relationship and love. Compare and contrast the examples to determine which ones you may prefer or feel will fit best with your subject matter.


Ask yourself, How does the author approach love and what being in love means to them? Do they use imagery, description, and detail to illuminate their sense of love and romance? What type of form does the writer chose for the poem and how does this contribute to the poem overall?

, One of the more popular forms in poetry is free verse. This form is easy to learn and can be freeing, especially if you are new to writing poetry. Free verse has no set meter, structure, or rhyme scheme. But a free verse poem should still feel cohesive and express its ideas clearly. In the free verse form, you can play around with the length of each line and the descriptions and images you insert in the poem.For example, the poem “Flirtation” by Rita Dove uses two line stanzas and breaks up the text so one stanza flows into another. She uses the free verse form to show how flirtation happens in small, short bursts, much like blocks of text broken up on the page.

, Another popular form for romance poetry is to use rhyming or a rhyming form. Many traditional and modern love poems are written with rhyme. There are several popular rhyming forms you may want to try for your poem, including:An alternate rhyme: Often, this rhyme follows the pattern ABAB, where the first and third line rhyme (A) and the second and fourth line rhyme (B). This rhyming pattern may then be repeated in each stanza or section of the poem.
Rhyming couplet: This form has two line stanzas that rhyme and may be placed in pairs or added at the end of a stanza. The rhyme scheme could be “A,A,B,B,C,C,...”
Ballade: This form has three stanzas with a rhyme scheme of “ABABBBCBC”, followed by “BCBC”.

, You may want to make the poem feel more personal by using images of you and your boyfriend in the text of the poem or at the beginning or end of the poem. You could also break up the text so it looks visually interesting on the page, similar to Rita Dove’s approach in “Flirtation”.


Another simple visual form is to make an acrostic poem, where a row of vertical letters going down the page spell out a word, phrase, or maybe your boyfriend’s name. You would then use each letter as the first letter of a line or phrase in the poem., You may want to go back to the beginning of your relationship and discuss how you met your boyfriend. Was it love at first sight or was your first meeting disappointing? Did you meet each other through friends or through funny circumstances? What kind of emotions did you feel when you met your boyfriend? Write down as much as you can remember about your first meeting.Maybe you can more easily recall your first date with him or your first kiss. You may decide to focus on the details of these other firsts. Using a first meeting or first kiss memory in the poem will make it feel more personal and specific to the two of you.

, You can also come up with themes and ideas for the poem by writing down the ways in which your boyfriend is important to you. Doing this will help you create a poem that feels like a tribute to your boyfriend and your love for each other.You may focus on his excellent personal qualities and traits, such as “good listener”, “kind heart”, “supportive”, or “generous”. You may also consider why you value these traits about him. Maybe you appreciate his ability to listen because you find it difficult to listen to others and you admire his genuine interest in people. Or, maybe you valued his support at a particular time because you needed him and he was there for you.

, This could be the first time you traveled together to a foreign country or a blissful day on vacation together. You may also focus on a memory that is positive because of something your boyfriend did, such as helping you deal with the death of a parent or supporting you as you prepared for a difficult exam or test.Be specific when you describe this memory. Focus on sensory detail, such as what you both were wearing in this memory, where the memory occurred, and any smells or sounds in the setting of the memory. You should also try to describe facial expressions and body language, such as your boyfriend’s smile or your laugh.

, Another way to generate ideas for your poem is to think about any hard or challenging times you experienced with your boyfriend. No relationship is perfect and you both have likely had ups and downs during your time together. You can spotlight any challenges and use them as examples of how your love persevered and got stronger due to these challenges.You may focus on one specific memory where you made a mistake or your boyfriend made a mistake and you both worked through it together. Or, you may talk about having to maintain love from a distance or away from your boyfriend and how you made it work. The idea is to highlight a memory that shows how strong and powerful your love is, and how much stronger it is going to be in the future.

, Because this is a personal poem for your boyfriend, you should focus on writing from your voice and your perspective. This means using “I” or first person, to discuss your feelings and emotions towards your boyfriend. The poem should reflect your personality and your personal thoughts on your boyfriend. Using your natural voice and style will help it feel unique to you., If you have a selected a specific form for your poem, such as free verse or a rhyming form, you should commit to it and follow the structure of the form. Read other examples of the form and try to follow their lead. Following a consistent pattern can make your poem feel cohesive and like a real piece of art.If you want to use a rhyming scheme, try to choose one that does not use a lot of rhyming. Too much rhyming can sound sing-songy and make your poem sound a little cheesy or silly. Ella Wheeler Wilcox’s poem “I Love You” is a good example of using rhyme to create a romantic poem that does not feel cheesy or overdone., You should include literary devices like simile and metaphor in the poem to describe your thoughts and emotions more effectively.Simile uses “like” or ""as"" to describe something, such as, “My love for you is like a big red rose"" or ""My love for you is as beautiful as a big red rose.”
Metaphor uses direct comparison to describe something, with no ""like"" or ""as"" such as “My love for you is a slice of cake."" In general, metaphors as used more often in poetry than similes.
Try to come up with unique similes and metaphors, as this will make your poem sound more unique and specific to you. Rather than say, “your love is like the wind”, for example, you may choose a more specific metaphor like, “your love is like my favorite food”.

, If you decide to include specific memories in the poem, you should include details that use the five senses (sound, sight, taste, touch, and smell). Using sensory details will make your memories come alive and give your reader a better sense of the memory.


For example, rather than describe being away from your boyfriend during a hard time as “full of loneliness and sadness”, you could delve into a specific memory of loneliness or sadness during that time. You may say, “I remember long nights of listening to you on the phone and missing the smell of your hair, I remember waking up to an empty room and aching for your body, warm and sleeping beside me.”

, To make your poem that much stronger, you should avoid using cliches and familiar terms or phrases. Instead, push yourself to come up with unfamiliar or unique descriptions. A good rule of thumb with cliches is that if the phrase sounds familiar to you and you think you have heard it before, it is likely a cliche.There are many cliches around the theme of love and relationships, from “roses are red” to “dreaming of you” to “you make my heart swoon”. Try to replace these familiar descriptions with ones that are specific to you and your boyfriend. For example, if you and your boyfriend love pizza, maybe you could try to use as many pizza related descriptions as possible, from “your love is as essential as my favorite pepperoni pizza” to “I love you more than Ranch dipping sauce”.

, After you have created your poem, you should read it out loud to yourself to hear how the words sound together in each line. Check for any lines that sound awkward or not quite right. Mark any words that seem too vague or unclear. Make sure your poem includes specific detail and sensory descriptions so it feels descriptive and engaging.


As you read, you may want to mark up the poem and note any awkward lines or words. You can then edit the poem for clarity and tone, focusing on the sections you have marked.

, Surprise your boyfriend by writing the poem in a nice card or printing it out and leaving it for him on his pillow to find in the morning. Make the poem feel like a special gift for him to discover and make the decorations personal so he knows how much you care for him.

Read examples of free verse poetry.,
Use the examples as guides for your poetry.,
List keywords and images that describe your subject or topic.,
Create a first draft.,
Edit the draft.",How to Write Freeform Poetry2," Free verse poetry does not have a structure and there are no rules around meter or rhyme scheme. As the poet, you have the freedom to express yourself any way you would like, while bearing in mind that free verse poetry is still a form of artistic expression. You can use the freedom of the free verse to create striking images and explore a range of emotions. To get yourself in the mindset of a free verse poet, you should read several examples, including:“After the Sea-Ship” by Walt Whitman“Little Father” by Li-Young Lee“Winter Poem” by Nikki Giovanni“in Just” by e.e. cummings, Once you review the examples, you should look at how the examples address their subject matter and how they use keywords to discuss their subject in the poem. Though the form of the poem is open, the poet likely still uses key terms and images to create meaning in the poem.


For example in Li-Young Lee’s poem “Little Father”, Lee uses the topic of his father and flips the idea on its head by calling his father “my strange son”, and “my little root”. He then imagines his father as a “little pale foot” and a “little clock”. These strange and vivid images allow Lee to explore the idea of fathers from an interesting perspective.Another good example is Walt Whitman’s “After the Sea-Ship”, where Whitman describes the scene after a ship has passed through a stretch of ocean. He uses strong images like “white-gray sails” and “myriad waves” to create a strong impression in the reader’s mind. The poem also builds on image after to image until it follows the movement of waves. Though the poem is technically not structured, it does have an arc and build up to an ending., In free verse poetry, you have the freedom to play with meter, structure, and language. To generate content for your poem, you can write down a list of keywords and images that relate to your subject or theme. You can then string these words and images together to form lines for the poem.For example, if you want your poem to focus on the theme of sadness, you may write down words and images that communicate “sadness” to you. You may focus on specific moments in your life when you felt sadness and use these images to create the poem.
If you are not sure how to describe a certain event or feeling, use the five senses (sight, touch, taste, smell, and sound). Rather than write, “I felt sad when my mother died” you may note where you were when you found out she passed away or your last conversation with her before she died. You may also include sensory details about the feeling of your mother’s hugs or the smells of her baking or cooking.

, Once you have a list of words and images, you should start to string them together to form a first draft. Describe one particular scene or a series of moments that connect to the theme of your poem. You should use devices like metaphor, simile, alliteration, and personification.Your first draft does not need to be perfect, as you will edit and revise it.
You may start by stringing together keywords and then looking at how they play off each other. You may have keywords around sadness such as ""mother"" ""death"" ""childhood"" ""lost"" ""poor"" and then string them together, ""I see my mother on her deathbed, I see my childhood, lost and poor.""
You may then integrate metaphor, simile, or personification into the poem. For example, ""My mother sits like a broken bowl on her deathbed"", or ""My only toy is a doll I shared with sister, as torn up as we were poor.""

, Look over your first draft and edit it. You can read it out loud and mark down any lines or sections that are working well as well as any lines where a word or phrase sounds off or not as strong as other lines in the poem.You should also identify lines that you could improve or expand. Avoid using generalizations and cliches. Get creative and try to think of a description that sounds different and unique. For example, rather than tell the reader “I was sad when my mother died”, you could use a more interesting description, like “A big bright flame in my life was blown out.”
You should consider how the breaks between words or lines can add to the meaning of the poem. If you are describing a roller coaster ride, for example, you may want to have the line spacing look like a roller coaster on the page, with the words moving up and down. Or if your poem is about feeling trapped or claustrophobic, you could condense the lines so they appear as one solid block of text.

Be aware of the guidelines around chance poetry.,
Look at examples of chance poetry.,
Select your chance operation.,
Create a first draft of a chance poem.,
Avoid adjusting the poem too much.",How to Write Freeform Poetry3," Chance poetry is a way of generating poetry independent of the will of the writer. It originated during the Dada movement in Western Europe. In this type of freeform poetry, you use activities based around chance to generate content for your poem and arrange the content randomly or at will. These activities are called “chance operations”.Most chance poetry will use an original text as their source, such as a newspaper, an encyclopedia, or a known work of literature. You will then use a chance operation, such as throwing darts or rolling dice, to rearrange the original text or play off the original text to create your poem.
The purpose of chance poetry is to take the writer’s ego and intentions out of the process of creating the poem. You leave the arrangement and content of the poem mostly up to chance. This method also allows you to create unusual images and syntax you may not have come up with on your own. It can also create more space for the reader to interpret the results of your chance operation, where the reader has to actively participate in the poem by interpreting, dissecting, and musing on the results of the chance operation.

, To get a better sense of the possibilities inherent in chance poetry, you should read several known examples of chance poetry. Several examples include:


“Stein 100: A Feather Likeness of the Justice Chair” by Jackson McLow.“Three Centos” by Kate Fagan.“Head Citations” by Kenneth Goldsmith., To write a chance poem, you will first need to determine which chance operation you are going to use to generate content for the poem. You should use an original text written by you or by someone else and manipulate it in some way to generate a new text or poem.You may use one of the most common chance operations, which involves taking a text and cutting out words from the text. Then, place the text in a bag and shake the bag up. Take out a cut out word and record it. Then, take another cut out word and write it down next to the first cut out word. Continue to do this until you have a poem of a certain length.
Other chance operations involve rolling dice to determine how many words you skip over or move in the text. For example, you may roll six on the dice, which means you only include every sixth word from the original text in your chance poem. You can follow a similar procedure with throwing darts.
Some chance poets use randomizing computer programs to create chance poems. You can plug in the original text and then hit randomize in the program. You will then have a chance poem that has been randomly rearranged by the program.

, No matter what type of chance operation you choose, often the fun part is doing the chance operation on the original text. The only real rule in chance poetry is to commit to the chance operation, even if it creates a text that may not make sense or be clear on first read. Following the chance operation can also allow you to create unique images and lines that you may not have thought of on your own.You may want to limit how long the poem is going to be so you can determine when the chance operation can come to an end and you can finish the poem.
For example, you may have chosen to cut out words from an original text and putting them together to form lines of a poem. If you choose a newspaper article, you may have terms like ""tragic"" ""accident"" ""news"" ""I"" ""reported"" ""street"" ""woman"" ""alone"". You may then arrange these words so they form a new image, such as: ""Tragic news of a street woman alone"" or ""I reported a woman alone"".

, Once you have completed the chance operation on the original text and have generated a poem, you should read it over. Read it out loud and consider how the words sound together on each line. Note any interesting images or phrases that appear in the poem.


Though it may be tempting to edit the poem so it fits a certain idea or theme, you may want to consider not adjusting it too much. A big part of chance poetry is allowing the words to exist on the page as they appear, by chance. Adjusting them too much would conflict with the chance aspect of the poem and potentially ruin your chance operation.

Look at the common themes and ideas in surrealist poetry.,
Read examples of surrealist poetry.,
Select your surrealist approach to the poem.,
Make the surrealist poem.,
Read over your poem but resist editing it.",How to Write Freeform Poetry4," Surrealist poetry originated out of a manifesto written by poet and painter Andre Breton in 1924. Surrealist poetry uses surreal techniques, like automatic writing and word games, to try to tap into the subconscious. Surrealist poets are interested in creating surreal states, such as a dream state, for the reader and play with language to understand their psyche a bit better.Because surrealist poetry is more about observing the psyche and the mind than it is about creating realistic or grounded images, surrealist poetry can often be unsettling and strange to read. The goal of this type of poetry is to create a surreal experience for the reader and allow the reader to interpret the content of the text on their own, or based on their own experience of the text.

, To get a better sense of surrealist poetry, it may help to read examples. There is a wide range of surrealist poetry, with some texts appearing more non-traditional and strange while other texts appear more traditional and easier to read. Some texts may use images, drawings, and photographs, as well as text. Several examples include:


“Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll.“Drift” by Caroline Bergvall.“Eunoia” by Christian Bok.“Me and My Pharaoh…” by Charles Bernstein., In surrealist poetry, a surrealist approach to a poem is also known as an experiment. To get started on your surrealist poem, you should first select the experiment you are going to use on an original text. Once you have the experiment, you can then apply it to the original text and see what ends up on the page.You could do a simple experiment, such as alliteration, where every line starts with the same letter, or an alphabet poem, where the poem is 26 lines long and each line begins with the next letter of the alphabet.
Another well known surrealist experiment is called “n+7”, where you take a text and substitute another word for every noun, adjective, adverb and verb using the dictionary. You will move 7 words up or down in the dictionary to find the replacement words.
You could do more complicated experiments, such as only using words that contain one of the vowels in the English language (a,e,i,o,u). Another option is to collaborate with other writers to create a poem, adding on one line to the poem and passing it or emailing it to the next person until you have a complete poem.
A list of surrealist experiments can be found online., Once you have selected your experiment, you will need to perform it to make the surrealist poem. This may mean using an original text and manipulating it in some way or creating original content based on the rules of an experiment. Depending on the experiment you select, you may end up “making” the poem by compiling existing text in a certain way or you may end up actually writing the poem using certain rules and guidelines.Try to stick to the rules and guidelines of your chosen experiment, as this could lead to some interesting results. You may be surprised by what happens to the original text when you apply the experiment to it. You may also be surprised by your own writing when you follow the rules of an experiment and avoid directing the results.
For example, maybe you decided to do the alliteration experiment, where each line or word starts with the same letter. You may write down a list of words that start with a certain letter, such as the letter ""a"" and then organize them according to your preference. A line in your poem may look like: ""An aardvark at an abandoned atrium ate all apples"".
Alternatively, you could choose a more challenging experiment like ""n+7"" and choose a word in the dictionary to act as your anchor word. You could then count seven up from the word to determine the next word in a line of the poem.

, Surrealist poetry is often not as interested in the final poem as it is in the process of making the poem. Though your poem may appear strange or confusing, it may actually succeed by surrealist standards. Read over the poem and note any unique descriptions, images, or lines. Look at how the experiment you chose affected the original text. Consider if it changed the text to reveal new or hidden meanings in the text. You should also look at how your writing changed as a result of the experiment.You may decide to edit the poem for spelling, grammar, and syntax. You can do this if you choose but try not to change major elements of the poem. Doing this may take away from your surrealist experiment and shift the poetry away from surrealism.

Compare found poems to the original source.,
Reread your selected writing piece.,
Determine the topic and theme of your poem.,
Narrow down your previously selected words and phrases.",How to Make a Found Poem2," Perhaps the greatest challenge of writing a found poem is determining which words and phrases to extract from the original writing to include in your found poem.


The Library of Congress has an online lesson plan for writing found poetry that provides both the original text along with a found poem exemplar. For example, they include a found poem based on a primary source titled “The Blizzard of 1888”. Here is an example of how a writer extracted words and phrases from an original source from a prose titled “Coming Home, Again” by Chang-rae Lee. The poet started with this original sentence from Lee’s writing: ""From that day, my mother prepared a certain meal to welcome me home."" Using this sentence, the writer of the found poem deleted the first three words in the sentence and rearranged the line to make up the first three lines of their poem: ""My mother prepared/A certain meal/To welcome me home""

Notice how the poet was able to change the sentence context. In the original sentence, a reader can conclude that the focus is on whatever significant event had occurred since “from that day” the mother took on the ritual of making a specific meal each time the speaker came home. However, in the poem, the emphasis is now on the mother celebrating the speaker’s return home by preparing a special meal. , While rereading, pay close attention to words and phrases that stand out and grab your attention. Make a list of these words and phrases.


Choose short phrases, and be sure to jot down enough words and phrases (approximately 50 to 100) so you have plenty to select from during the drafting of your poem. Keep in mind that found poems only contain words from other texts, so make sure you have gathered enough material. , Using the words and phrases that you selected from the text, determine what is the topic (subject) of the poem. Next, come up with a theme or message that your poem will express.


When you think of theme, ask yourself, “what is the overall message or idea about life that is being expressed throughout the work?” For example, let’s say you read a poem with “love” as the topic or subject. To determine the theme, you would have to think about what message is being conveyed about love based on the speaker’s tone or attitude toward the topic. A theme for a poem expressing a positive tone about love could be “love conquers all.”A theme for a poem with a negative tone about love might be “love is painful and not worth the risk.”
Once you have a theme in mind, write it down. This is will help you in determining how to arrange the words you selected from the original source.

, Now that you have decided on a theme for your poem, carefully select only the words and phrases that will help you convey the theme you want to express.


Be sure to also consider the tone (attitude) and mood (emotion) you want to convey in your poem. Make sure your selected words and phrases align with the feelings and emotions that you want to express throughout the poem.

For example, in John Manfield’s poem “Sea Fever,” the speaker’s repeated declaration that he or she “ must go down to the seas again” conveys the speaker’s passionate and yearning attitude towards returning to seafaring life. "
"
Determine the style of your found poem.,
Write a first draft.,
Provide credit.",How to Make a Found Poem3," There are a variety of techniques that can be used to craft a found poem. Choose a technique that you would most enjoy.


The erasure technique is created by choosing one or two pages of original text and deleting the majority of text, and the remaining words and phrases are used to create the found poem. Some examples of poets using this technique include Newspaper Blackouts by Austin Kleon and Nets by Jen Bervin. The free-form excerpting and remixing technique is created by selecting a snippet from an existing work and arrange the words and phrases in an order of their liking in order to create the poem. The cento technique involves bringing together lines of texts from numerous authors and determine the arrangement of lines to create the found poem.The cut up technique literally involves cutting up strips of paper that contains lines of texts and arranging them in an order of your choosing , Arrange the words from the original so it reads and flows like a poem. Creatively determine where to end and begin new lines, which words you want to emphasize, and how to effectively use punctuation.


Read your poem aloud to yourself. Listen to determine if the line breaks and punctuation effectively conveys the meaning and emotion as you intended. Rearrange the lines, punctuation, and word arrangement as necessary.

, At the bottom of your poem, give the author’s name and title of his or her work from where the lines of your poem came from.


It might be helpful to provide the reader with an overview or analysis of the original text. This would help the reader gain a better understanding of how the context of your poem was developed.

Revise your poem.",How to Write a Poem About Nature," Great writers read extensively. Reading nature poetry that's already been published by successful poets can give you ideas, inspiration, and can open your eyes to what's possible in a nature poem.


A good place to find nature poetry is the Academy of American Poets website. You can search for poets, or use the website's filter to find all works categorized as nature poems.Search for poems by poets known for their nature-based works. Gary Snyder, for example, is an American poet who's been writing about nature for much of his life.Romantic poets such as Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, and John Keats are also known to include nature in their poetry.Check your library for published books of nature poetry, anthologies, and nature-themed literary journals.

, If you're interested in writing a poem about nature, the best way to start is by going out into nature. Whether you go for a short walk, a long camping trip, or anything in between, getting outdoors will help you find inspiration and imagery.


In contemporary times, nature takes many forms. You don't have to go out to the countryside or deep in a forest to find inspiration - try visiting an urban park if you can't get into the wilderness.Consider seeking inspiration where the natural world meets the pavement. Even remote forests wouldn't be accessible without roads to lead you there - perhaps you can find something inspiring in that transitional zone.

, When you're out in nature (however you define it), you should begin to feel inspired or creative as you take in your surroundings. It's okay if it doesn't come to you right away - you can always analyze your thoughts/feelings later.


As you observe the natural world around you, begin by noticing what you see, hear, smell, and feel.
Next, try to draw associations from the things you're observing. What do your observations remind you of in your own life? Why do you notice the things you do in nature?
You can take another step back and consider where you first learned to interact with nature.
Don't worry about producing poetry yet. Just try to notice things in nature, write down your initial observations, and work out your own understanding of those observations.

, Poetry is, of course, often image-heavy. You may have a lot of image-based observations that you've written while spending time in nature, but how do you turn those into actual lines of poetry? One of the easiest ways to start is with your imagination and your initial observations.Read through the list of observations you compiled.
Try to visualize different images that come to mind when you reflect on each observation.
Your images don't have to be directly tied to what you've seen/heard in nature. It can be any association your mind makes.
Write down a description of those images/associations.

, Before you begin to actually compose a poem, you'll want to think about what your poem will actually be about. Obviously it will involve nature, but in what way? Why are you in nature, and what are you taking away from it? Perhaps your trip into nature allowed you to reflect on things going on in your life, or maybe you remembered going for long walks with a deceased relative when you were younger. Whatever you think your nature experience is ""about,"" write it down and try to elaborate on it as much as possible.Theme can be thought of as a combination of an idea and an opinion on that idea.
Revisit your observations, and read through the images/associations you expanded on. What about your experience stands out to you the most? What does all of it mean to you?
Does being in nature make you think about life? Death? Lost loved ones? Current events, either in your own life or in politics/society/culture?
Ultimately, the theme you decide on will influence not only what you write about, but how you write it as well.

, Once you have your theme in mind, it may be helpful to build off of it so you have some related ideas to expand on in your poem. If nothing else, building off of your chosen theme may at least give you a bank of words/phrases to draw from that can help enrich your final piece of writing.


Try making a list with three columns: sense, object, and thought.Think about what you observed in nature through the lens of your chosen theme. How do your other observations/thoughts/descriptions relate to your theme?
Choose the most descriptive, the most image-filled, or the most emotionally powerful words/phrases/lines you come up with, and set them aside as possible material.

, Poetry does not have to rhyme, but rhyming can add an almost musical quality to the words that you write. Rhyming can also help you to emphasize certain words and ideas in your poem. Think about whether or not you would like your poem to rhyme and where you might place rhyming words in your poem.


Keep in mind that it is possible to rhyme too much as well, which can make a poem start to sound a bit like a nursery-rhyme.Experiment with rhyming to see what you like and remember that you can always revise to include more or less rhyming words.
Rhyming can also narrow your choice of words as well. For example, it is much easier to find a rhyming word for “tree” or “flower” than to find a word that rhymes with “chlorophyll” or “chrysanthemum.”

, There are many different poetic forms. You can also choose to write in free-form, meaning there are no ""rules"" to follow for line length, structure, or arrangement. There is no single right or wrong way of writing a poem, and which form you choose will likely depend on your style as well as what you hope to accomplish with your poem. Some common poetic forms include:



Haiku - consists of three lines. The first line contains five syllables, the second line has seven syllables, and the third has five syllables.
Tanka - consists of five lines. The first three lines follow the structure of a haiku (five/seven/five), and the last two lines each have seven syllables.
Lantern - a loosely-written poem meant to imitate the visual shape of a Japanese lantern.
Couplet - consists of two lines that rhyme with one another. A couplet is not usually considered a poetic type, but it can be part of a poetic type.
Quatrain - consists of four lines with a specific rhyme pattern. The rhyme pattern is usually one of four possible patterns: AABB (first two lines rhyme, last two lines rhyme), ABAB (first and third lines rhyme, second and fourth lines rhyme), ABBA (first and fourth lines rhyme, second and third lines rhyme), or ABCB (first three lines are all unrhymed, fourth line rhymes with the second line).Quatrains are also not poetic types, but they are often used to create a specific type of poem.

, If you've chosen a form to work with, your draft should incorporate the images, descriptions, and memories you've compiled into the prescribed structure of that form. If you are writing a free-form poem, you do not have to worry about the structural ""rules"" of form and can experiment as you create.


Choose concrete words instead of abstract ones. This will make your poem stronger and more rooted in imagery, rather than in vague concepts or ideas.Don't worry about rhyming any lines unless you've chosen to work with a poetic form that requires a rhyme scheme. Rhyming in contemporary poetry is often seen as stuffy or old fashioned, and without proper understanding of stress/emphasis a rhymed poem could be sloppy.
If you're interested in working within poetic forms, try experimenting with different forms until you find one that works best for your theme and imagery.

, Simile and metaphor are often what makes a poem's verses poetic. They often use concrete words to describe abstract comparisons, like saying ""His eyes were an inferno"" to describe someone's expression of anger.Similes are comparisons that use ""like"" or ""as"". For example, the phrase, ""He's curious as a cat,"" uses the word ""as"" to compare a person's curiosity to that of a cat.
Metaphors are comparisons that do not use ""like"" or ""as"", effectively pretending (for literary effect) that one thing is actually something else. For example, ""Her love is a flower"" compares a person's love with a beautiful but delicate flower.

, Clichés can be thought of as dull or overused word choices and literary elements. They may have come easily as you wrote your first draft, but a cliché can quickly turn readers off to your work. Rather than saying something in a way that's tired and played out, try to come up with an original way to say what your cliché is supposed to convey. Even if it's a bit confusing or nonsensical, it will surprise and captivate a reader, rather than make readers roll their eyes.


Look for any instances of cliché.
Try to figure out what you were trying to say with your cliché.
Describe what your cliché is trying to describe in your own original words.
Re-write the cliché in a descriptive and original way., Every writer knows that revision is an important part of the writing process, and poetry is no different. Revision doesn't just mean correcting typos (although you should do that as well). Some useful strategies for revision include:


cutting away prepositions, adjectives, adverbs, and any lines that explain needlessly
playing with where you place line breaks (the end/beginning of a line) within your poem
reading your poem out loud and thinking about the way your poem sounds (not just rhymes, if you incorporated rhyme, but also the way words sound together)
rearranging lines for emphasis, sound placement, and image placement

"
"
Brainstorm a rough list.,
Describe common experiences.,
Make sure sound words match the mood.,
Be creative with color.,
Think outside the box.,
Look at examples.,
When finished, proofread and revise.",How to Utilize the Senses in Poetry," If you know what you are going to write about (or during the writing of the poem, either works), open a separate document or get a piece of paper and bullet or make columns for each sense. Then fill them in with descriptions of the item you've chosen. It does not have to be cohesive lines, even basic words will do (you can enhance them later). Then, incorporate these into your poem, editing and fitting into your lines.


Look at pictures if needed for a reminder, or if it helps you get more in depth. Looking at a picture rather than relying solely on memory may help you notice details you'd normally overlook.;
, It is much more difficult to conjure up all five senses for an experience you faintly remember or haven't experienced at all. If you frequently go through an event, whether it be riding the bus to school or going to the park, it is well ingrained into your memory and provides for a vivid description. Next time you do that specific thing, take a look around and pay attention to the sights, sounds, smells, etc. Jot them down if needed, and try to notice details you normally wouldn't.


Focus on the small things. You don't need to go for an all-out grand description of the landscape- write about the little, generally overlooked parts as well.

, Sound words may convey different events and emotions- for example, ""clash"" and ""clang"" imply something loud and sudden, versus ""lullaby"" and ""hushed"" imply something quiet and sleepy. So if a poem is about an exciting and thrilling event, use sound words that match that, otherwise it'll send mixed messages.


You can also use sound to break the mood, if a poem has the feel of something quiet and lulled, you can snap the reader awake by using sound words that disrupt that to show that the events going on are no longer peaceful.

, Color is one of the best visuals, and you can make it much easier to visualize what's going on by using it often. However, you don't want to stick the usual, boring colors- instead of red, say sangria, scarlet or ruby. The reader can now picture that the item is the color of a ruby instead of just saying ""red"", as that dulls the poetry and feels much less descriptive. Replace the name of a color with the name of an item in that color. Try using the names of gemstones, e.g. sapphire, ruby, emerald, amethyst, etc.


To find some good words, look up ""synonyms for ___"". Try going to images, as there are often lists of suggestions, along with what the colors actually look like.
You can view a color thesaurus here.

, There will be times, of course, where a sense is not applicable to the situation- in these cases, don't force it in or you will confuse the reader. But you can still be creative and look for ways to use the senses even in unconventional places. Though smell and taste may be more difficult to use (as they apply to food most of the time), look hard for places where they can be used. You'll often find that these senses can be used in smaller details usually overlooked. Doing this will really transport your reader to the scene (for example, a playground can smell like wood chips and taste like soil since children often gnaw on their dirty fingers).

, Good poetry displaying use of these senses not only offers a guide, but helps you understand how the senses should be used in poetry. Whether it be a great classic or a well-written poem shared on Wattpad, reading these can help you get an idea of how to utilize the senses. They can even be used as inspiration, or assist you with other aspects of poetry-writing. Just be sure not to copy off them, as this is considered plagiarism.


If you want to write a spinoff or something based off a poem you really like, give it credit. Cite it or simply write ""based on ____ by ____"" before or after your own poem.

, Scan your poem for any grammatical or spelling errors. Check for any words that stop the poem from flowing smoothly, and either remove them or replace them. See if there's any weak or basic words you can replace to create better imagery. Determine whether you need to add more sensory words or remove some. Read it out loud if you'd like. Lastly, if you'd like, ask a family member or friend to read and review your poem as well- they may catch something you didn't! Be sure to ask them specifically about your use of the senses, if needed.


Be sure to check your punctuation as well. Though punctuation use varies from poet to poet (some may only use one period their whole poem, and others will be full of commas), review to see if any punctuation should be added, or if some should be removed as it impedes the flow of the poem.

Use literary devices.,
Personify the emotion.,

Keep the poem for yourself.",How to Write Emotional Poetry," Start by making a list of emotions that resonate with you or that you have experienced first hand. You may have a short list of emotions or a long one. Let your thoughts flow and write down as many emotions as you can.You may end up with a list that has a wide range of emotions, which is fine. For example, you may write down: “anger, sadness, grief, anxiety, joy, happiness, confusion.”

, Look over your list of emotions and choose the one that speaks the most to you. Circle it and then use it as a prompt to brainstorm ideas for your poem.You may do a freewrite where you use the emotion as your prompt and write freely, without stopping, for a 10 to 15 minutes. Then, look over your freewrite and pick out lines or phrases that could go into your poem.
You could also write about a personal experience where you felt that emotion. For example, maybe you felt angry when you got into a fight with your mother or when you lost an important match or game. Or perhaps you felt grief when you lost a close friend or relative. You may then use this experience as a jumping off point for starting your poem.
You may try doing a brain cluster exercise around the emotion where you write down words or phrases that come to mind when you think of the emotion. Place them in clusters on the page around the emotion. You could then use these words or phrases in your poem.

, To get more inspiration for your poem, read published poems that discuss a specific emotion. Notice how the poet uses the poem to express their feelings about a specific emotion and to explore different ways to discuss emotion on the page. You may read:


“I measure every Grief I meet” by Emily Dickinson“Anger” by April Benard“Facing It” by Yusef Komunyakaa“What Are Years” by Marianne Moore, Rather than try to simply include the emotion in your poem, challenge yourself to avoid naming the emotion in your writing. Instead, try to describe the emotion using sensory detail, such as how the emotion might smell, taste, sound, feel, or look like. You can also use concrete images to describe the emotion so you can communicate your feelings about the emotion to your reader.Ask yourself, “If the emotion were a color, what color would it be?” and “What does the color smell like? Taste like? Sound like? Feel like? Look like?”
For example, if you were writing about anger, you may write: “Anger is red. It smells like burnt toast. It tastes like dry mouth. It sounds like a siren. It feels like a slap in the face. It looks like a cluster of red ants.”

, Focus on a specific experience or moment where you felt the emotion and write about it in your poem. Think about an experience where you were overcome by this particular moment or an event that caused you to feel the emotion.For example, if you are writing about grief, you may focus on the experience of sitting at the deathbed of a loved one. You may describe the experience with sensory detail and concrete images to communicate the emotion you felt during the experience.

, To make your poem stronger, you should use literary devices throughout. Literary devices like metaphor and simile will make your writing more succinct and unique. They also allow you to create images that linger in the reader’s mind and help to get the experience of the emotion across to your reader.A simile uses “like” or “as” to compare one thing to another. For example, “My anger is like a pot bubbling over on the stove.”
A metaphor compares one thing to another without using “like” or “as.” For example, “My anger is a hive of bees in the backyard.”

, You can also write an emotional poem by personifying the emotion on the page. To personify an emotion, ask yourself, “If this emotion were a person, what would it do?” This way, you can use strong active verbs to describe the emotion and give it life on the page.You may try making a list of verbs that you think relate to the emotion or speak to how the emotion might express itself. For example, if you were writing about anger, you may write down verbs like “screams, flumes, explodes, yells, shouts.”
You may personify anger by writing: “Anger flumes at other. Anger screams when it doesn’t get its way. Anger explodes at the first sign of weakness.”

, Once you have a draft of the poem, you should sit down and read it out loud. Listen to how each line sounds as well as each word in the poem. Notice if the poem flows well or sounds awkward or confusing in some places. Underline or highlight any areas that need to be revised. Then, go in and revise the poem until it is at its best.You can also revise the poem by reading it to someone else and getting feedback from them. Be open to constructive criticism as it will only strengthen your poem.

, If you feel your poem is polished and strong, you may want to share it with others. Submit the poem to publications online, such as poetry websites or magazines. You can also send the poem by mail to magazines and publications to see if it gets published.


You may search online for publications that have a call for poems on a specific emotion or are putting on a contests for the best poetry about an emotion. Your poem may be more likely to get published if it applies to a specific prompt or theme that a publication is looking for.

, If you feel the poem is too emotional and personal to share with others, you may keep it for yourself. Put the poem in a journal or a private folder on your computer so you can look at it when you want to. You may revise it over time and feel ready to share it with others at some point or decide to keep it to yourself.


Sometimes poetry can act as a form of therapy and help you process intense emotions you may be experiencing. You do not need to feel pressure to share your emotional poetry if you are writing it only for yourself and your own enjoyment.

Read the poem out loud to yourself.",How to Write Poetry for Yourself," You can find inspiration for your poem by focusing on a theme or idea that you feel may be risky to share with others. Because the poem is for yourself, you can focus on ideas you may think are too taboo or out-of-the-box for a mainstream audience. Creating poetry for yourself gives you the freedom to explore ideas you may not have written about otherwise for fear of judgement by others.You may write about an idea that you consider risky to address, such as abortion, racism, or same-sex marriage. You may feel free to write about this idea from your perspective without the pressure of knowing others are going to read it.
Or you may tackle a universal theme in a more unconventional way, such as the theme of love from the perspective of a queer woman or the theme of kindness from the perspective of a serial killer.

, You can also explore a moment that you found unsettling or an event that felt traumatizing in some way. Because you are not showing anyone else the poem, you may feel more comfortable writing about an event that personally affected you negatively or intensely. You may feel okay with addressing the moment in your poem and exploring how and why it unsettled you.


For example, perhaps you had an intense near death experience. You may then write about this experience in graphic detail in your poem, revealing feelings and emotions you may have never told anyone about before. Knowing the poem is for your eyes only may make it easier to do this.

, You may find inspiration for your poetry by putting yourself in a setting you find unique or interesting. You may also choose a setting that you find a little intimidating or scary and push yourself to write ideas down for the poem within the setting. Writing poetry just for yourself means you may want to tackle subject matter that is more taboo or unsettling, and putting yourself in a strange setting can help you get words down on the page.For example, the writer Chuck Palahniuk has been known to write stories in emergency rooms or other strange settings, like airport terminals.You may decide to choose an unconventional setting to write poetry, using the people and events around you as inspiration.

, You can get inspiration by using a writing prompt to do a freewrite. You may choose a writing prompt that you find interesting or intriguing. Or you may create your own writing prompt and do a timed freewrite to generate ideas.For example, you may use the writing prompt, “I am writing a poem for myself because…” or “I want to challenge myself to write about…”. You may then set a timer for 10 to 20 minutes and write about the prompt. Try not to lift your pen from the paper or read over what you have written.
Once you have finished the freewrite, you should read it over and look for any lines or sentences that feel inspiring or engaging to you.

, You can also find inspiration by reading the work of other poets. You may have a favorite poet that you enjoy reading and find inspiring. Or you may choose poets who tend to write about unconventional or taboo subject matter. Some examples may include:The poetry of Claudia Rankine.The poetry of Anne Sexton.The poetry of Adrienne Rich.The poetry of Edgar Allen Poe., Confessional poetry uses the first person “I” to discuss topics that are personal and considered taboo. The form emerged in the mid-twentieth century as a way for poets to address sensitive or private subject matter in their poetry. You can use the confessional poetry form in your poetry to address topics that you may not want to share with others and keep only to yourself.Confessional poets often draw on their own personal experiences and explore them in their poetry. You may try writing about a personal experience that you have kept private or secret and explore it in your poetry. Use the first person “I” to write about your experiences.

, You should consider if you are going to use rhyme in your poem, and if so, what type of rhyme. You may use end rhymes, where the end of each line rhymes, or you may follow a certain rhyme scheme, such as every other line rhyming or every third line rhyming in your poem.


You may opt for using no rhyme scheme at all in your poem, known as the free verse form. Using the free verse form can allow you to be creative in your poem and have the freedom to use whatever words and phrases you'd like.

, The surreal poetry form can also be ideal if you are looking for ways to experiment with a topic and address personal subject matter in a unique way. Surrealist poets will often approach a sensitive topic in a creative way. You can apply surrealist techniques to your poetry and play with the form to generate poems.For example, you may choose to do a surrealist word game to get inspiration for your poem. You may try the ""exquisite corpse"" word game, where you start with a poetry prompt and add to it by passing the paper around the room to different poets.
You may also use a surrealist poetry prompt to explore a topic that you find taboo or a personal experience that you would like to write about. You may do a substitution poem, where you replace words in an existing text with your own words or words from another text.

, You may decide to try a poetic form that is shorter to allow you to write a poem for yourself quickly or within a limited period of time. You can use a shorter poetic form to frame and organize your poem.


For example, you may try a haiku form. Haikus follow the 5-7-5 syllable count and are three lines long, with the first line having five syllables, the second line having seven syllables, and the last line having five syllables.
You can also try the cinquain form, which is a five line poem that contains twenty-two syllables total. This poem follows the syllable order: 2, 4, 6, 8, 2. This means first line of the poem contains two syllables, the second contains four syllables, the third contains six syllables, etc. These poems don't necessarily need to rhyme.
You may go for a shape poem, where you use the shape of the object or subject you are writing about as the container for the poem.

, You should always use sensory detail in your poetry to allow your words to jump off the page. Focus on how you can explore the five senses: smell, taste, touch, sight, and sound. You should use details that play on the senses in your poetry so your reader is immersed in your poem.For example, you may describe a moment by focusing on how it smelled or sounded. You may describe a storm as “earthy and smelling of rain” or “pounding the air like a drum.” You may also describe a moment based on how it tasted or felt, such as describing your first kiss as “sweaty and wet” or “sweet, like the ice cream she just licked.”

, You should also use literary devices to enhance your poetry and make it more engaging on the page. Literary devices are often used by poets to polish up their language and create imagery that lingers in the reader’s mind.You may use literary devices like metaphor and simile. Metaphors compare one object to another object in an interesting way, for example, “her smile is a jack-o-lantern in the window.” Similes use “like” or “as” to compare one object to another, for example, “she was like a witch on a broomstick” or “she is as red as a tomato.”You can also use literary devices like personification. Personification occurs when an inanimate object, an idea, or an animal is given human attributes, for example, “the wind sighed through the grass” or “the fire swallowed up the house.”, Because you are writing the poem for yourself you have the freedom to write with intention and honesty. You should strive to be honest and clear in your poems, especially if you plan to show them to only yourself. Be okay with writing about moments or events that may be uncomfortable, unsettling, or disturbing to you. The poetry you write may act as a form of therapy, allowing you to explore feelings you may never otherwise address if you were writing for an audience besides yourself.Focus on how you can infuse the poem with clear details and a sense of confession. You may pretend you are writing the poem to a younger version of yourself or to a person who would never judge you. Picture a forgiving audience and write for them, infusing your writing with honesty and sincerity.

, Once you have finished a draft of a poem, you should read it out loud to yourself. Listen to how the words sound on the page and revise the poem so it flows well. Note any awkward phrases or lines and adjust them. Add in sensory detail if a line sounds too vague or unclear.The poem is meant for your eyes only so you may decide not to revise it completely or polish it like you would if it were meant for publication. You have the freedom to revise the poem as you see fit and adjust it based on how you, the sole reader, respond to the poem.

Add color to the shape poem.",How to Write Shape Poems," To get a better sense of what you can do in a shape poem, you may want to read several examples of the form, such as:“O sweet spontaneous earth” by e.e. cummings.“Vision and Prayer” by Dylan Thomas.“Concrete Cat” by Dorthi Charles.“Butterfly” by David Schondelmeyer.;
, Review the examples and think about how the author uses the form of the shape poem. Consider several questions, including:


How does the author use the shape of the poem to heighten the meaning of the poem? How does the text and the shape interact in the poem? For example, Charles’ “Concrete Cat” uses the text to form the shape of a cat, with each word forming it’s shape on the cat’s body. “Whisker” forms a whisker on the cat, “eye” forms an eye. This creates an interesting visual representation for the reader.
How do the line breaks in the poem, created by the shape, add meaning and detail? For example, in Schondelmeyer’s “Butterfly”, the shape of the butterfly limits the number of words Schondelmeyer can use in the poem. But the shape also allows Schondelmeyer to create mirroring text and text that connects the two sides, or “wings” of the poem.

, To get inspiration for your shape poem, you may choose to focus on an activity you enjoy, like playing tennis or reading books. Or you may focus on a hobby, like woodworking or singing. You could then use this subject as the inspiration for your poem., Another area of inspiration could be the natural world. You may have a favorite tree in your backyard or a flower bush you like in your neighborhood park. You may be inspired by nature on a larger scale, such as a famous waterfall in your area or a river that runs through your city. Get specific and choose one aspect of nature or the natural world as the subject of your poem.You may also be inspired by a particular animal in the natural world, such as the fierceness of a lion or the grace of a gazelle. You may then pick an animal and use it as inspiration for your poem., You may decide to jump right away to an object that you value for sentimental reasons and use it as inspiration for your poem. Maybe you have a family heirloom that has been passed down to you from your mother or a lucky pen that you refuse to throw away. You could then write a poem in the shape of the object that focuses on why you love the object so much or why you value it.

, Once you have selected the subject of your poem, you should think about what shape best represents the subject. You may choose a more obvious shape to represent your subject, such as a tennis racket to represent a poem about tennis. Or, you may choose a more obscure shape, such the shape of your grandmother’s watch to represent a poem about your grandmother.


Keep in mind you will need to fit the text of the poem in the shape. So, you may want to select a shape that is wide or has a wide center. If you select a shape that is more challenging, such as the shape of a hand or the shape of a long, thin pen, you may need to be more creative with how you fit the text within the shape.

, One option for creating the shape template is to design it on your computer. You may use a drawing program to create the shape, making it big enough for you then type text in the shape.Alternatively, you can download shape templates online. You may use an existing template if you are using a common shape, such as the shape of a heart or the shape of a butterfly., If you would like to get more hands on, you can draw the shape on a piece of paper using your drawing skills and your imagination.You may use a stencil of the shape, depending on what it is, to ensure it is symmetrical and even. Make sure you draw the shape template so it is big enough to fit text.

, To get your creative juices flowing, sit down and write as many keywords and terms you can think of about the subject. Try to be specific as you make this list, as you can then use it to pull words for your poem later.For example, if you are writing about tennis, you may write down “strings”, “grass”, “sweat”, “armbands”, “two handed forearm”, “tingling hands”.
If you were writing about an object of sentimental value, like your grandmother’s watch, you may write down terms that relate to both your grandmother and the watch. For example, “ancient”, “ticking”, “light colored”, “delicate”, “wise”.

, Use sensory detail to really make your poem come alive. Consider how the subject of your poem might, smell, sound, look, taste, and feel. Include sensory details whenever possible to make your poem feel more descriptive.


For example, maybe in your poem about tennis, you write about the smell of the grass courts, the sound of the ball hitting your racket, or the taste of sweat on your lips as you play a match. You may focus more on short descriptions of these sensory details, as your shape may only allow you to include a few lines of text.

, Many shape poems use literary devices like rhyme, repetition, and metaphor. These devices can be a good way to inject energy and engagement into your poem.


Rhyme: This is a pattern of words that produce the same sound or similar sounds.Rhyme is often used in shape poems as a way to tie the lines together, especially if your shape creates breaks or gaps between the lines of text. For example, in Schondelmeyer’s “Butterfly”, the author has rhyming lines: “Oh what a beautiful creature, does it fly/ it floats by/and flutters high/I think it’s called a butterfly…”Repetition: This is a pattern of the same words that repeat in sequence. Many shape poems use the repetition of words to create the shape of the poem or to reinforce the shape. For example, Charles’ “Concrete Cat” repeats the word “stripe” to create the striped lines on the cat’s body and repeats the word “whiskers” to create the whiskers of the cat.Metaphor: Metaphors are used often in poetry. In metaphor, a meaning or identity is given to the subject by way of another subject.For example, if you are writing about tennis, you may use the metaphor: “The racket is my sword in battle, the court is my green battlefield.”

, Once you have created your poem, you are ready to place it in the shape. You may do this by writing the text directly into the shape, making sure the text stays within the lines of the shape. Or, you may cut out the words on the paper and arrange them so they form the shape of the text.Have fun with this part, as it is a critical step in making a shape poem. Focus on arranging the text so it forces the reader to look at the words within the shape or in a different way. For example, if you are writing about tennis and placing the text within the shape of a tennis racket, you may include details about the racket strings in the string section of the racket and details about swinging the racket in the handle section of the racket.

, With your text in place, step back from the poem and read it within the shape. Note if there are any words that do not quite fit within the shape. Edit them so they are shorter and more concise, or remove them. Check if there are ways you can make the text more engaging by placing it in a different section of the shape. Most shape poems use the shape to play with the meaning of the text.You may also decide to edit down certain lines so they create the shape of the subject or object more clearly. Similar to Charles’ “Concrete Cat”, think about how your poem can represent the shape in very few words. This may be a fun challenge if you are looking for a different approach to your shape poem.

, This is optional, but many shape poems have color. You may color the shape of the apple red if you are using an apple shape for your poem or you may color the handle of the tennis racket brown if you are using a tennis racket shape. Use colored pencils and/or markers to color in your shape. Be sure to use a lighter color so it does not obscure the text in the shape. You may want to go over the text with black pen or marker to ensure it stands out in the colored shape."

Start with a topic.,
Think of a title.,
With the hard part out of the way, outline the poem.,
Capitalization isn't a big part of Gothic poetry.,
Punctuation is important.,
Most people like rhyme.,
Modern Gothic poetry tends to be free verse.,
Shape & Length.",How to Write Serious Gothic Poetry," This expansive genre encompasses a huge range of topics. A Gothic poem can be about anything. It's just a dark twist. Stereotypically, Gothic poetry is about pain, death and tragic love. This isn't always true. So don't let yourself be fooled by stereotypes.;
, The title is one of the most important parts of Gothic poetry. It helps the reader gather the emotion of the poem before they read it, and to understand the poem while reading it. A good title will catch the person's eye. Just make sure you can keep their attention afterward. It's a good idea to keep the title short, either words or syllables.

, Anything goes in this step, as you'll soon revise it. Keep it consistent with the title. Then add some supporting verses after you know what your outline might look like. A short example: ""my twisted soul can no longer fly/darkness rips at my blinding eyes""

, Some poems actually come across stronger when words aren't capitalized except for the names of God, people, and places.

, Another stereotype is that punctuation is absent from Gothic poetry. But that's not true. Any poem, no matter the genre, would do well with punctuation.

, If you wish to rhyme then great! Don't TRY to make your poem rhyme though. The rhyming should always come by itself. Trying to rhyme is forcing it to rhyme, and the poem won't flow and it'll be... well not a good poem. If you want it to rhyme but have to force rhymes, then do so, but revise revise revise!

, Do what you wish with the design of the poem. But make sure it's comfortable to you and you can work with it. Remember: free verse has little or no rhyme!

, It doesn't matter how long a poem is, but it does matter how you shape it. A most preferred style is column. You can also make it the left or right side of your page.

Use the free verse form.,
Try the haiku form.,
Use the cinquain form.,
Do the limerick form.,
Try the epigraph poetry form.,
Make a short shape poem.,
Write about an event in your day.,
Focus on a current event or issue.,
Write about your favorite spot in nature.,
Compose a humorous poem about your best friend.,
Create a poem from the perspective of an animal.,
Avoid cliche by using unfamiliar descriptions and phrases.,
Use sensory details.,
Do quick first draft.,
Revise your poem.",How to Write Quick Poems," Perhaps the most freeing form in poetry is free verse, where you are not limited by line count, rhyming structure, or syllable count. However, if your aim is to write quick poems, you may put a limit on how many lines your free verse poem is going to be so it is on the shorter side.You may also decide to revise your free verse poem so it is cut down to the shortest possible lines. Doing this will force you to keep the poem quick and brief, but still meaningful and full of emotion.;
, Another way to compose a poem within a short timeframe is to choose a poetic form that is short. Haiku is a three line poem that uses the 5,7,5 syllable structure. It is a non-rhyming form, so you are not limited by rhyme when you write haiku. Often, haikus focus on nature and natural imagery.Keep in mind haiku is not a sentence broken up into three lines. Instead, each line of your haiku should stand on their own as individual thoughts, images, emotions, or responses.
Your haiku should act as a snapshot that shows your reader how the speaker in the poem is feeling or what she is experiencing. Avoid telling or explaining and focus on showing instead.
Examples of haiku include “Haiku Ambulance” by Richard Brautigan,“The Light of a Candle” by Yosa Buson,“5&7&5” by Anselm Hollo., This is a five line poem that contains twenty-two syllables total, following the pattern 2, 4, 6, 8, 2. So, the first line of the poem contains two syllables, the second line contains four syllables, the third line contains six syllables, and so on. Cinquains do not need to rhyme and they can focus on a variety of subjects.Cinquains are a great way to write about a specific topic or idea in very few lines. You also have the option of adding or removing one syllable from each line, giving you more freedom in this form.Examples of cinquains include “November Night” by Adelaide Crapsey,“To Helen” by Edgar Allen Poe,and “The World” by George Herbert., Limericks are great options if you have limited time to create a poem. These are five line poems that follow the rhyme scheme AABBA. Often, limericks are humorous and focus on a specific moment or situation. They are meant to act as poetic jokes or humorous asides.Limericks usually begin with the phrase “There was a…”. The line usually ends with a name, person, or place. Lines 1, 2, and 5 rhyme. Lines 3 and 4 rhyme.
Lines 1,2, and 5 contain 7-10 syllables and lines 3 and 4 contain 5-7 syllables. Often the last line of a limerick presents an unusual image or a strange, funny idea, similar to the punchline in a joke.
Examples of limericks include “There was an Old Man with a Beard” by Edward Lear,“There was a Small Boy of Quebec” by Rudyard Kipling,and “A Wonderful Bird is the Pelican” by Dixon Lanier Merritt., In Greek, epigraph means “upon a tomb”. Epigraphs need to be short enough to fit on a tombstone and are often only one to two lines long. Often, they are written as a couplet, or two rhyming lines, or one line of text. Many epigraph poems are meant to be funny, making them fun to write.Examples of epigraph poems include “Epigram” by Samuel Taylor Coleridgeand “Smoker’s Epitaph.”, Shape poems are also a fun way to write a poem quickly. You can choose pretty much any subject and write a poem in the shape or outline of the subject or object. Shape poems do not need to rhyme or follow a specific line count. Instead, you only need to write enough to fill the shape of the subject of the poem.


Examples of shape poetry include “Concrete Cat” by Dorthi Charles,“Butterfly” by David Schondelmeyer,and “Vision and Prayer” by Dylan Thomas., Get inspiration for your poem by writing about a major event that occurred in your day or a funny moment that left an impact on you. This could be a test you aced in second period or a comment made by a friend in the hallway after school. Try to pick an event or moment that occurred recently, as it will be fresh in your mind and easier to write about.For example, you may decide to write a free verse poem about a conversation you had with your teacher that day. You may put limits on yourself by having the poem be only ten lines total or five lines total. You will then need to focus on certain details to fit the conversation into ten lines.

, You may also be inspired by a current event or issue, such as women’s reproductive rights, drug abuse, or homelessness. You may then use this issue as a jumping off point for your poem. Try to focus on your personal relationship with the issue and consider why this issue is so important and emotional for you.For example, you may decide to write about the dangers of drug abuse or the dangers of smoking cigarettes. You may then envision what it might be like to be a smoker or a drug user and discuss the dangers and fears a smoker or drug user might experience.

, Maybe you have a favorite spot in a park or a hiking spot you go to on the weekends. Perhaps your favorite spot in nature is actually your own backyard or a cluster of indoor plants on your windowsill. Focus on a spot in nature and describe emotions and feelings you experience when you are in this spot.This subject matter would be ideal for the haiku form, which often focuses on nature and the natural world. You may also try writing about nature in the cinquain form.

, You may be inspired by a funny moment with a best friend or someone close to you. You may decide to use this funny moment to write a funny poem that is fun to write and enjoyable to read.You may decide to use the limerick form or the epigraph poetry form for your humorous poem. These forms are a good way to organize and write about funny content quickly and effectively.

, Another fun prompt is to write a poem from the perspective of an animal, such as tiger or an elephant. You may choose to explore how it might feel to inhabit the body and mind of an animal. You may also use the perspective of an animal to discuss a difficult moment in your life or a challenging event.You may decide to use the form of a shape poem for this content, using your poem about the animal to fill the shape of the animal. This could allow you to create limitations around the content, as you will need to write enough lines in the poem to fill the shape of the animal.

, Cliches are phrases or terms that have become so familiar and well known that they no longer hold meaning. Avoiding cliches will allow you to write poetry that is more engaging and nuanced. It will also force you to stretch your creativity and come up with descriptions that are unfamiliar and unique.For example, rather than describe a funny moment as “so funny I could die” or “I laughed so hard I cried”, you may try describing the moment with unfamiliar details, such as “I hooted and hollered until I ran out of breath” or “I let out a high-pitched squeal that bounced off the walls of the cafeteria.”

, Use all five senses to describe moments in your poem. Consider the sounds, smells, and tastes of an experience or moment, as well as how it felt and how it looked. Be specific when you use sensory detail so you can paint an engaging picture in your reader’s mind.For example, you may describe the feeling of standing in front of your favorite waterfall as “my face is covered in the briny thick smell of moss” or “I can taste the fresh water droplets that fall onto my face.”

, To speed up the writing time, you may want to sit down and write a first draft of the poem in one sitting. You may have examples of your chosen poetic form nearby as well as notes from your brainstorming. Using these materials, you may then try to get your thoughts down on the page without editing or reading over your writing as you write.This can be a good technique if you are feeling stuck or uncertain of how to start. Forcing yourself to just write, without editing as you go, can help you to generate content that you can then pare down in your revisions.

, Once you have your quick first draft done, you should read over your writing and revise it so it is sharp and concise. Note any awkward phrases or cliches and replace them with more nuanced phrases. Look for any spots that you can cut or pare down.If you are using a particular poetic form, you should make sure your poem conforms to the form. For example, if you are using haiku, you should make sure each line contains the right number of syllables and flows well as a whole.
You may also want to read your poem out loud to listen for any confusing language or unclear description. Read the poem to someone you trust to get their opinion and feedback. Getting a different perspective on the poem can make it that much stronger.

Share your work.",How to Write Poetry for Kids1," Young children tend to gravitate toward short poetry that rhymes. Funny and silly poems are usually popular, as are nursery rhymes. You don't have to write rhyming poetry, but rhymes actually develop valuable pre-reading skills for young children.Poems that are about everyday and ordinary experiences can be a good way for young children to learn to think about those things in different lights. Having familiar subject matter can also allow young children to focus on detail such as word sounds and syntax without being too distracted.
Mary Ann Hoberman writes wonderful poems for young children. Her book A House Is a House for Me is very popular with young readers because of its use of rhyme, song-like rhythms, and creative descriptions of familiar things: ""A hill is a house for an ant, an ant. / A hive is a house for a bee. / A hole is a house for a mole or a mouse. / And a house is a house for me!"" (Slash marks, /, indicate line breaks.);
, There are many collections of poetry and reading suggestions online, and you can check out books of poems at your local library. This will give you a sense of what is appropriate for the age range you want to write for. Reading poems aloud is particularly helpful to get a sense of how language works in poems for young children, as many children's poems are meant to be read aloud.Short narrative poems that tell a simple story are ideal for young children, who usually have short attention spans. The Cat in the Hat and other books by Dr. Seuss are good examples of how to tell a short, funny narrative story in rhyme.
Limericks are short, 5-line poems that have a particular rhyme scheme, where the first two lines and the last line rhyme, with a different rhyme sound for the middle two lines: AABBA. For example: ""A talkative man from Seattle / would spend his days speaking to cattle. / When asked what he said, / one old cow shook her head, / and replied, “Why it’s nothing but prattle!”Because of their strong beat and heavy use of rhyming sounds, limericks are a lot of fun for young children to read or recite aloud.""Mother Goose"" books are excellent collections of nursery rhymes. Many of these, such as ""Humpty Dumpty"" and ""Hickory, Dickory, Dock"" have been popular for several hundred years., There are a variety of brainstorming activities you can do to help generate ideas for poems. Try to keep your audience in mind when brainstorming; for example, very young children may not enjoy scary poems or poems that talk about unfamiliar things or experiences.


Find a particular word that sounds fun to you. It can be any word, but silly ones are often popular with young children. Write down all the words you can think of that rhyme with it. For example, you could try to rhyme something with ""banana"" or even ""hippopotamus."" (If you're stuck, there are many online rhyming dictionaries that can help.)Choose a word with a specific vowel sound. Then, write down all the words you can think of that share that vowel sound, even if they don't rhyme. For example, you could put together words like ""cat,"" ""crab,"" ""map,"" ""apple,"" and ""shaggy."" This shared vowel sound is called ""assonance,"" and understanding it will help young readers learn to read.Choose a word with a specific consonant sound at the beginning of the word. Then, write down all the words you can think of that share that sound. They don't have to rhyme, but they can. For example, you could put together words like ""shaggy"" and ""sharp"" and ""shark"" and ""shake."" This shared sound is called ""alliteration"", and it is another helpful literacy element for young readers.Pick a familiar object and describe it. Go into as much concrete, specific detail as you can, using all of your senses. Imagine you're describing your object to someone who's never seen one before. What will you tell them? This can be a great way to introduce young readers to thinking about familiar things in new ways.
Pick an adjective and write it down. Then, write down as many synonyms for that word as you can think of. Online dictionaries and thesauruses can help you. You may even discover words that are new to you! Expanding children's vocabularies is one of the best things about children's poetry.Think about a relationship that is important to you. This could be with anyone: a grandparent, a sibling, a child, a spouse, a teacher, a friend, a neighbor. Think about how you feel about that person, and write down as much as you can that describes your relationship. Poetry can help young children learn about relationships and empathy.Think about an experience you had as a child. It could be a very common experience, such as playing outside or meeting a new friend. It could even be an experience that might be intimidating for young readers, such as the first day of school or visiting the doctor. Try to remember how you felt when you experienced it. Write down all the feelings and thoughts you can remember. You could also try talking to children about what experiences they think about most often.

, Writing the poem is the hardest part! The key is to draft frequently and consistently. Don't worry about achieving perfection on your first draft. Instead, try to put down the bones of your poem. You can (and should) improve it with revision.


If you're stuck, you can use a formula to get you started. Children's author Hannah Lowe suggests a three-step process for coming up with poems: 1) pick a number between 1 and 20; 2) pick a (different) number between 1 and 100; 3) pick a color, a mood, a type of weather, a place, and an animal. The first number represents the number of lines your poem will have, while the second number should make an appearance somewhere within the poem's content. The keywords from step 3 will form the basis of your poem's story.Play a round of ""mad libs."" You can find collections of mad lib formulas in bookstores and online. They work by asking you to write down a list of words (nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.) without seeing the story template, and then having you fill in the words in blanks in the story. Doing this may help spark your imagination for a poem, but be careful not to plagiarize the actual story template.There are various online sources that can give you some ""building blocks"" if you're having trouble getting your poem started. Writers Digest and Scholastic Publishing online are good places to start, but you can also try searching the internet for ideas that appeal to you., Your poem will probably not be exactly the way you want it on your first draft. It may take many drafts to reach your goal, but don't give up! Some professional authors take months, even years, to revise their work.


If you don't know where to start revising, read your poem aloud. Mark any places that don't sound ""right"" to you. Then, think about what you found odd or didn't like. Consider ways to change those elements.
Revision works best if you take it piece by piece. Approaching your poem as though you have to revise the whole poem at once may feel overwhelming to you. Revise a little bit at a time, and your poem will gradually become what you want it to be.

, If you have children of your own, read your poems to them! You can also ask neighbors and friends with children if you can share your poems with them. While you can also get good writing advice from adults, seeing how children respond to your work will probably be the most helpful to you.

Share your poem.",How to Write Poetry for Kids2," Just like with young children, older children have particular interests and needs as readers of poetry. Think about what age range you want to write for. Find poems and collections for that age group and read extensively.


Lewis Carroll's poems are excellent for older child readers. Poems like ""Jabberwocky"" play with language, use made-up words, and employ puns and other wordplay. For example, the poem begins ""'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe."" Even though they're made-up words, their grammatical position helps readers imagine what they might mean (and fosters literacy skills in children). Read some of Carroll's poetry for inspiration on the many ways to use language in your poem., The brainstorming techniques in Method 1 will also work for poems geared toward a slightly older audience. The experiences or things you write about may be different depending on the age of the children you're writing for -- for example, older children won't respond to a poem about the first day of school the same way as young children -- but the brainstorming methods will still help you discover things to write about.

, The basic process for writing poems for older children is the same as writing for young children. However, you can get more elaborate and complicated with poetry for older children, as they are better equipped to handle complex and abstract ideas.


Older children may enjoy short but vivid poems such as haiku, a three-line poem of Japanese origin. The first and final lines have five syllables each, while the second line has seven. Often they describe a concrete object or image, such as this one about a cat: ""Tired cat sleeps all night. / He needs lots of rest for a / Long day of napping.""The very short format requires you to consider your word choices very carefully but can create a lot of impact.Concrete poems may also be enjoyable for older readers. These poems form a shape on the page that has something to do with the subject of the poem; for example, a poem about nighttime might take the shape of a crescent moon, or a poem about bravery might take the form of a lion. These poems often don't rhyme, but the connection between the topic and the shape will interest older children.You can find many examples of these online., Older children have the linguistic sophistication to better understand figures of speech like metaphors and similes. Try looking at an ordinary object, such as a hat or a toy, and thinking of other ways you could describe it using words such as ""like"": for example, ""The hat was like a mountain."" Metaphors and similes encourage creative exploration in young readers.


Naomi Shihab Nye's poem ""How to Paint a Donkey"" explores with metaphor the feelings of a child painting a donkey: ""I could clean my paintbrush / but I couldn't get rid of that voice. / While they watched / I crumpled him, / let his blue body / stain my hand."", Pick an object and describe it without using any of the words traditionally associated with that object. For example, try to describe a cat without using the words ""fur"" or ""whiskers."" This type of re-envisioning works quite well with older children.Carl Sandburg's poem ""Fog"" describes a common occurrence with uncommon language: ""The fog comes / on little cat feet. / It sits looking / over harbor and city / on silent haunches / and then moves on."", Writers often focus most heavily on sight, but your other senses also provide the type of vivid detail that young readers enjoy. Think about taste, smell, hearing, and touch as well.""April Rain Song"" by Langston Hughes is a good example. It begins: ""Let the rain kiss you / Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops / Let the rain sing you a lullaby."", Poetry that deals with emotions and feelings works very well with slightly older children, who are often curious about how to express themselves. Poetry can help older children explore their own feelings and learn about those of others.Gwendolyn Brooks' ""The Tiger Who Wore White Gloves, or What You Are You Are"" is a poem that deals with what it's like to be different from others in a funny, accessible way., If you have children, have them read the poem. Ask them questions about what they liked and didn't like. You can also share your poem with friends and family, but since your main audience is children, you'll want to know how they respond to your work.

Take a nature walk.",How to Write Poetry for Kids3," Reading poems together is an excellent way to build your child's literacy skills and develop their love of language. As you read poems, ask your child what interests him or her about what you've read, and explain any elements they have questions about.


Talking about rhyme and rhythm works well with young readers. Ask your child to think of another word that rhymes with one in the poem, or have them clap along with the beats of the words as you read.

, Nursery rhymes are excellent for this because they have very familiar melodies. Write down the lyrics, then help your child come up with a poem that they could sing to the same tune. You can use the original song lyrics as a template if you get stuck., If your child can write their name, have them spell it out on a piece of paper, leaving space between the letters. (If they can't write yet, write the letters for them.) Then, encourage your child to think of a poem where each line starts with one of the letters. This personalized poem will develop your child's language skills and make him or her feel special.You can also help your child write acrostic poems for other words. An acrostic poem for ""dog"" could look like this: ""Devoted furry buddy / On my bed is sleeping / Greatest of pets.""

, This game begins with the same line each time: ""I spy with my little eye / something beginning with..."" The rhyming sounds are a natural way to get your child thinking about rhyme. ""I Spy"" encourages your child to pay attention to details and learn how to describe them., This exercise works best with older children. Have your child go through a magazine, newspaper, or book and highlight several dozen words they find interesting or appealing. They don't have to have a particular reason for why they like those words. Once they've found between 20-50 words, help your child arrange the words into a poem. You can add in new words where needed., As you explore, ask your child to note things that interest them, such as the weather or scenery. If they can write, have them write down their ideas in a notebook; if not, you can take notes for them. When you get back home, help your child decide on what notes to use in the poem. The poem can tell a story or just describe a scene or a feeling.


Encourage your child to use specific, concrete words to describe what they see. For example, rather than saying ""the weather is nice outside,"" you could encourage your child to use specific sensory details such as ""the sun shining makes my skin feel warm"" or ""the blue of the sky looks just like my sweater.""

Produce a clean copy of the poem.",How to Write Poetry for Beginners," You can write a poem about anything. A tree, the moon, time, your eyes. Most people tend to write about love. However, in this case we will write a poem about the sea.;
, Your poem doesn't have to be among an already-set category. Poem structure is purely dependent on the poet and the poem itself. As a beginner, rhyming poems are basically the best starting point. Being arguably the easiest poem structure to master and execute, they give the kind of result that will boost you psych to continue writing poems..


Note that a poem doesn't have to make sense grammatically; what does matter is that your readers or audience get the message you want to communicate using your own ingenious formation of the words.

, Description of an element, object or emotion is a central part of evoking the feeling or depths of a poem. In fact, you could write a whole poem just describing something. To help you get started in this descriptive process, ask yourself questions. Taking the sea as the example, here are the types of questions you'd ask yourself:


What is a sea? Is is just a local sea, a defined area of sea or the ocean?
How does the sea look? Use descriptive terms relating to colors, motion, depth, temperature, and other standard features. The sea might be foaming, producing whirlpools, looking glassy, or turning grey at the advent or a storm; describe whatever comes to mind for you.
What are some of its aspects that are noticeable in your sea? The froth of the waves, the fish under the surface, the height of waves during a storm, the lull when the wind dies down, the mounting garbage greys, a school of dolphins passing through, sea level rise along coastlines, the Sea Shepherd chasing whale hunters, the mournful cries of the Pacific gulls––these are all things you might notice in relation to the sea of your poem.

, This is the most important line as it sets the rhythm of your poem, as well as being about making a first good impression. The first line determines whether your audience (if you're going to perform the poem) will listen attentively to the rest of the poem or be put off immediately. It has to be interesting or mysterious enough to make your reader want to read more. However, it should not so complex that your reader is caused confusion or considers the poem too hard to continue with. In other words, the top line has to be catchy.


For the example of The Sea, the first line might be:clothed in blue with ends unseen


, As mentioned earlier, you might find it best to start with rhyming poems first. This means looking at words that rhyme. For this example, the poem would use words that rhyme with the last syllable of 'seen', namely 'een'.


Note: This example only rhymes at the end sentence to make your work easier for now.

, This is to ensure that you clearly understand each word you place in your poem, understand its effect both in rhythm and meaning and are not swayed by introducing words that aren't truly sourced from your own way of perceiving the subject of your poem.


A list of words for this example could include: been, chin, lean, teen, keen, sin, and so forth. These will help form the second line of the poem and consequently the third, and so on.

, Try to think of what else you would like to say about your subject that deserves mention in your poem. Then try to make these words fit in to the words you came up with in step earlier. So in the poem The Sea, you could expound on its vastness, so the second line becomes:And realms unknown, no man has been
--and the rest flows:I wish to explore, I wish to sinAnd with my ears sharp and eyes keen,I face the unknown, as to life does a teen.

, Either in your mind or aloud. This allows you to get the right number of syllables needed to make the poem have a good flow.

, Your little poem is complete. There is no limit as to how long a poem is. Some are a mere sentence long, while others are paragraphs long or even the length of a tale. It all rests with the poet's creativity.

, You have now completed your draft. This is the initial version of your poem. More often than not, you will feel the need to edit the poem, replace a few words, or sometimes discard the whole poem. Whatever you do, just remember that you are the poet, expressing your feelings through your poems so intuition, above anything else, is key. Once you are done editing your draft, it's time to produce a clean copy of the poem. Here are some ideas:


Write out the poem on a clean sheet of paper in cursive
Type it out on a text editor and decorate it then print it out
Make a slide show presentation of the poem, perhaps a stanza on each slide

"
"
Brainstorm ideas and come up with 3 or 4 different topics to write about, such as sports, nature, society, or really anything that comes to mind.,
Narrow your options down and choose the subject you can most easily relate to.

Learn the common themes in dark poetry.,

Analyze the examples.,
Make a list of keywords that relate to darkness.,
Remember a moment when you felt sad, lonely, or depressed.,
Focus on a specific dark event.,
Describe a person or place that signifies darkness to you.,
Avoid cliches.,
Add sensory detail.,
Use literary devices.,
Read your poem out loud.",How to Write Dark Poems," Most dark poetry focuses on emotions that may be morbid or disturbing. This could be feelings of loss, loneliness, death, depression, or anxiety. Dark poetry can act as a way to release these feelings and process these emotions. Many poets find dark poetry cathartic, almost like a form of therapy.There is also a sense of longing in dark poetry, as many dark poems romanticize death or dying. Often, poets see death existing right next to life. Death may be given sexual undertones or be portrayed as a figure of romance, but in a dark way.;
, There are many examples of dark poetry, as this genre of poetry is popular among many different poets throughout literature. You may read several examples to get a better sense of the style and tone found in dark poems, including:“Song” by Christina Rossetti.
“Minstrel Man” by Langston Hughes.
""The Pond Museum"" by Brandon Shimoda.""The morning after/my death"" by Etel Adnan.""Romance Sonambulo"" by Federico Garcia Lorca., Once you have read over the examples, you should think about how each poet discusses darkness or dark themes in their work. Some poets may view darkness in terms of love and loss or darkness as more of a concept, where the speaker sees darkness in everyday moments or events.


Ask yourself several questions about the poems, such as: How does the poet explore darkness in the poem? Does the poet focus on a specific moment of darkness? How does the poet use sensory detail and descriptive language to describe darkness?
For example, in Rossetti’s “Song”, Rossetti asks her lover not to mourn her death, but instead to move on with their life. Rossetti romanticizes death by arguing it has no domain over her once she is gone. She also uses rhyme and rhythm to give the poem a light quality, even when it is addressing heavy themes.
In comparison, Hughes’ “Minstrel Man” looks at how minstrel shows in America hide a lot of darkness in plain sight. His speaker is a minstrel man who performs racist shows for American audiences. Hughes contrasts the apparent joy and happiness the minstrel man performs for his audience with the pain and suffering he experiences internally. This gives the poem a disturbing quality that is finalized with the last line of the poem, “I die”.

, To get your creative juices flowing, it may help to list keywords that relate to darkness and dark themes. Write darkness in the center of a piece of paper and then list words around the center that relate to darkness. Do not try to edit to your list or think too much as you write. The idea is to generate terms and words that conjure up darkness for you, which you can then use later when you sit down to write your poem.For example, around “darkness”, you may write “black”, “grey”, “death” “alone”, “anger”, “powerful”, and “hidden”. You could then try to integrate these terms into your poem or use a specific feeling, such as “anger”, as the inspiration for your poem.

, One way to brainstorm ideas for your poem is to think about a specific moment when you experienced dark emotions, such as sadness, loneliness, or depression. Focusing on one specific moment and writing down words that relate to that moment can help you get ideas for the voice and tone of your poem.


For example, maybe you recall a moment in the girl’s bathroom at school where you felt lonely or sad. You may then try to describe the scene and how it felt to be standing in the girl’s bathroom with these feelings.

, You may also decide to write about an event in your life that was particularly dark or difficult. Try to rely on your memories of the event and write about this event from your perspective. Doing this will make the poem feel intimate and honest.For example, maybe you relate a lot of dark emotions to the death of your grandfather. You may then try describing how it felt to attend his funeral and see him in his casket. You may also contrast memories of his death with memories of his life to give the poem levity.

, You may also focus on a specific person or place that represents darkness to you. Maybe a person pops into your head as soon as you think of darkness or a specific location that you have visited in the past. Describing a tangible thing, such as a person or place, can help you hone in on specific images for your poem.For example, maybe there is a next door neighbor who seems to represent darkness or dark emotions for you. Or, maybe there is a family relative that scared you as a kid. You may also remember a dark experience in a house you once lived in or associate dark feelings with a house in your neighborhood. Maybe there was a family vacation that you went on to a specific place in the States that you associate with dark or disturbing emotions.

, When you are writing about subjects like darkness, sadness, loneliness, and death, it can be hard not to fall into cliches and familiar language. A cliche is a description that has been so overused it has lost its meaning.Many readers will gloss over a cliche and/or question the poet’s creativity when they come across a cliche. Avoid leaning on cliches in your writing and focus on creating more unique and unfamiliar ways of approaching darkness.Try to stay away from cliches like “dark as night”, “lost and alone” or “so lonesome I could cry”. Come up with more original descriptions and images in your poem, especially when you are addressing dark themes and elements.
One way you can address cliches in your writing is to go over your poem and look for any familiar terms or phrases. You should then underline them and focus on replacing certain words or replacing the phrase so it is less familiar and feels more original.

, Make sure you are using sensory detail in your poem, as this will make the poem come alive and contain descriptions that are memorable. Think about how a moment looks, sounds, tastes, smells, or feels. Use all five senses to create detailed moments in your poem.For example, maybe you are writing a poem about your grandfather’s death. You may focus on the smell of the white lilies at his grave or the gray, thin appearance of your grandfather in his casket. You may also describe the food you ate at his wake and the feeling of holding your grandmother’s hand at the funeral.

, Literary devices like metaphor, simile, and rhyme can help to strengthen the language in your poem and add depth to your writing. Try to use literary devices strategically, especially in a shorter poem. Every line should not be full of metaphors or similes only. You should vary up how you use these literary devices so your poem still flows well and does not seem wordy or long-winded.For example, you may use a metaphor to describe the loneliness of standing in the girl’s bathroom at school. You may write, “The stalls are blank eyes in the face of this room”. Or, you may use a simile to describe the look and smell of the bathroom. You may write, “The floor is as slick as the surface of a lake” and “The sinks smell like rotten eggs”.
Some poets, such as Rossetti in “Song”, also use rhyme in their dark poetry. Rhyme can be useful for adding some levity and lightness to a poem about heavy, dark subject matter. But it can also make your poem sound too sing-songy and silly. Use rhyme sparingly.

, Once you have written your first draft, you should read your poem out loud to yourself or to a sympathetic audience. Listen for any awkward phrases or words and highlight them. Ask the listener for feedback on your writing.


You should also pay attention to any images that are confusing or lines that are not as strong as they could be. Make sure you are not using cliches in your writing. Your poem should use unfamiliar and interesting images and descriptions that are true to your style and voice.
You should go back and edit the poem for clarity once you have read it out loud. Adjust any problem phrases or words you identified and make sure you are using strong, interesting language throughout the poem.

Fill in the lines of your poem.You might be tempted to start with the first line, but you don’t have to.,
Focus on sensory imagery.Sensory imagery is language that draws on the five senses: sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell.,
Try using similes and metaphors.,
Use inventive language.,
Revise your poem.,
Edit your acrostic for grammar and spelling.",How to Write an Acrostic Poem," Some people like to write on a computer, whereas others work better with pencil and paper. There are pros and cons to each, so think about which way will work better for you. If you’re not sure, you can try each method and see which feels more comfortable to you.


A computer will let you erase and edit more easily, and also let you undo mistakes and save alternate drafts with ease.
Pencil and paper makes you slow down and really think about what you’re writing on the page. Studies have also shown that writing by hand strengthens the brain.;
, Acrostics may sound complicated, but they’re really not! All you need to remember is that the first letter of each line, when read vertically, must spell out the topic of the poem. The topic is often a single word, but can be more than that if you’d like. Consider this example of an acrostic poem about the sun.


Keep in mind that the word you choose to serve as the first letter of each line will determine the length of your acrostic. Choose a word that corresponds with the length you want to write.
If the word you want to write about is too long or too short, consult a thesaurus for synonyms. For example, if “love” is too short, you might try “friendship,” “adoration,” “devotion,” “tenderness,” etc.
Remember that you can also use multiple words for your subject if you’d like. This is an easy way to add length.

, Choose a subject that you have a lot to say about, and hopefully one that gives you the opportunity to use your writing chops with sensory imagery and inventive language. Some helpful brainstorming activities might include:


Keeping an ongoing notebook where you keep track of things you want to write about
Making lists of the characteristics of the thing you want to write aboutFor example: your mother’s personality, her appearance, your favorite memory of her, how her voice sounds, what her perfume smells like, etc.
Taking a walk and making notes about what you see in your notebook
Taking inspiration from a piece of art. How does your favorite song or painting make you feel?
Write about yourself! Who do you know better than yourself?

, Since each line must begin with a letter from your subject word, you should always start by writing out the word. This way, you can visualize the poem and start anticipating how your lines are going to come together.


Usually, the first letter of each line is capitalized, so it’s easier to see the word that’s spelled out., Look at all the letters you have to work with. What’s the most interesting line you can think of that starts with one of those letters? Begin there, so you know you have at least one line that you absolutely love!


You can write end-stopped lines, meaning each line ends with punctuation or at a logical grammatical break.You can also write enjambed lines, meaning the lines can be broken wherever you need them to be broken, regardless of punctuation or grammar., Your reader will be able to understand abstract concepts like “love” or “hope” better if they can imagine specific details through their bodies.For example, instead of saying you love your mother, you can say you love the way she smells like onions when she’s done cooking dinner.

, A simile is a comparison that uses the words “like” or “as”: as red as a rose.A metaphor makes a comparison, too, but instead of saying that one thing is “like” another, it goes a step further and says that the two things being compared are the same thing: the clouds were cotton balls in the sky., Avoid cliches (sayings that have become so common that everybody knows them).Examples include calling something “red as a rose” or comparing clouds to cotton balls. Instead, be as creative as possible! Try to come up with descriptions, images, and comparisons that you’ve never heard before.

, Just because you finished filling out the lines of your acrostic doesn’t mean you’re done yet! Once you’ve finished your first draft, read it back to yourself and think about how you can make it even better.


Make abstract language more concrete.Abstract language like “hope” and “love” might sound pretty, but it doesn’t say as much as language that we can feel in the body through sensory imagery.
Strengthen your word choice. Circle all the words that look like they could be more interesting. Look up synonyms in the thesaurus to make your language pop, but don't choose a word just because it's long.
Stay on topic. Make sure every line of the poem goes toward saying something about your subject.

, After you’ve made the poem as interesting and creative as possible, you need to go back and edit for mechanical errors. Make sure your reader can understand your poem by clearing up any confusing, awkward language. This should always be the very last thing you do.

Read some epic poetry.,
Begin with a hero.,
Plot out your epic journey.,
Invoke the muses.,
Write!,
Name your work.,
Publish your work.",How to Write an Epic Poem," After all, you're doing this to be a part of the tradition! An epic poet should at least have read Homer. Reading epics will give you a good sense of what the epic is all about. It will also inspire you to write your own epic, read more epics, and become a sea-faring hero.;
, Epic poetry always follows the adventures of a hero. Take, for instance, Homer's Odysseus, Virgil's Aeneas, Gilgamesh, or Beowulf. You are probably quite familiar with heroic traits, like bravery, justice, and virtue. In Classical epics, heroes also tend to be futuristic and callous. Those kinds of flaws make your hero interesting.

, What challenges will your hero face, and why? Your hero might be on a quest to find something, a quest to save someone, a long voyage home from a distant war, or s/he might even be in the thick of the war itself. Think of twists and turns and complications that thicken this journey. You'll find, in the Classics, that jealous and quick-tempered gods play just as large a part in screwing up the plot as the hero's own flaws.

, Now you're ready to start writing your epic! This part is optional (as it is a feature of Greek-Roman epic poetry), but if you want your epic to have that Classical form, you should begin with an invocation to the muse. ""Sing to me, o muse, of..."" is an archetypical invocation. The muses were goddesses, in Classical mythology, who inspired writers. There was a patron muse of every poetic style; the muse who inspired the epics was Calliope. John Milton also made use of this convention when he wrote his Christian epic, ""Paradise Lost."" Interestingly, Milton invokes the ""Heavenly Muse,"" a device by which he substitutes the Judeao-Christian God for the ancient Greek goddesses of inspiration.

, This is the fun part. You can write your poem in any form, with or without metre. Nobody should tell you what form your writing should take. If you wish to write in the style of Homer, Virgil, Hesiod, and the other Classical poets, the metre they used was dactylic hexameter, or lines comprised of six dactyls (another article here should be able to help you with metre). Ancient Greek and Latin poetry did not rhyme, and yours doesn't have to either.

, Epics are almost always named after the hero. The Odyssey is named after Odysseus, the Aeneid after Aeneas, the Epic of Gilgamesh after Gilgamesh. Sometimes, it is named after a whole crew of people, like the Argonautica (named for the sailors of the Argos), but heroic epics mostly take their name from the hero. The English language does not have a suffix that you can add to a name to indicate topicality, so it might make less sense for you to call your work 'the Captain Jimmy-iad,"" but you could take a leaf out of Medieval poetry and call it 'the Song of X,' or 'The Tale of X.' Your title has to invoke the grandeur of your poem. Invoke away.

, This is crucial if you want to become a household name. If you are even half as successful as Ovid, you will likely inspire writers for at least a few centuries. You might have trouble getting published by a mainstream house, as they are usually after novels, but there are many resources online for you, including print-on-demand self-publishing that can be anywhere from cheap to free.

Take a moment and scan your memories for one of your life's truly memorable moments.,
Write in a vertical column in the middle of the page all the words that come to mind when you think of this memory.,

Find an audience and bask in your ability to express yourself.

",How to Write an Emotionally Charged Poem," What constitutes ""memorable"" is simply any experience from your past that you still think about and that you can still envision as if it were yesterday. Keep in mind it doesn't have to be a big event per se — it could be the memory of how you got a particular scar on your body, or even as simple as the view from your bedroom window when you were a child. Memorable is just that — something you can't get out of your mind — even if you're not sure why you remember that particular moment.

, Keep going till every last word that is important to the memory is listed on the page.

, But the words don't make any sense yet. For each word in the list, surround the word, before and after it, with words to complete a sentence. For example, one of your listed words might be ""chicken"". To round out the memory and make it all start making sense you complete the thought. So using the chicken example, your sentence might read: The burnt chicken you made for us. By adding these ""surround"" words you force yourself to build a sentence, not only in a way you wouldn't normally, but also with the exact words that make up your memory. (You'd be surprised how you can edit out the most important words or never even think of including them.)

, Make any small adjustments to the poem that will help the overall flow and rhythm. But don't edit out any of your original words on your list. The only words you should be editing are your surround words.

Acid eating away my nerves, blackening them like ash. Death upon my face, as humanity takes it's place. Chaotic words screaming through my bones...

,,, It should be set up so that you have two verses before every hook. Make sure you start on a double verse and end on a double chorus, and you have a chorus between each verse.

, Write how you would love to want it back. It could also be about feelings - are you feeling lonely, sad, misunderstood, happy, etc? Show your emotions in the poem and use words that reflect this.

Explore a wide range of works, from poems that are widely regarded as classics to popular song lyrics. As you interact with more poetry, you'll find your aesthetic becoming more shaped and refined.


To train your ear and meet like-minded people, attend poetry readings. (Check your local college or bookstore's calendar for these, or look for events you can stream online.)
Find some of your favorite song lyrics and read them like poetry. You might be surprised at how it reads on the page, instead of being spoken or sung aloud.;
, Perhaps you want to write a poem to express your love for your boyfriend or girlfriend; perhaps you want to commemorate a tragic event; or perhaps you just want to get an ""A"" in your poetry or English class. Think about why you are writing your poem and who your intended audience is, and then proceed with your writing accordingly.

, For example, if you want to write about nature, try to visit a park or a small forest nearby. The natural scenery may inspire a few lines, even if they're not perfect.

, It's been said that if a novel is ""words in the best order,"" then a poem is ""the best words in the best order.""


Think of the words you use as building blocks of different sizes and shapes. Some words will fit together perfectly, and some won't. You want to keep working with your poem until you have built a strong structure of words.
Use only those words that are necessary, and those that enhance the meaning of the poem. Choose your words carefully. The differences between similar sounding words or synonyms can create interesting word play.
A computer spreadsheet such as OpenOffice.org Calc, is very efficient for rearranging words in columns and checking the rhythm through the alignment. Put one syllable in each cell. You can then transfer the text to a word processor for fancier printing when you're done.

, Most poetry appeals to the senses (yes, plural) in some way so as to help the reader become more fully immersed in the text. Here are some things to consider when you're constructing descriptions:


Love, hate, happiness: these are all abstract concepts. Many (perhaps all) poems are, deep down, about emotions and other abstractions. Nevertheless, it's hard to build a strong poem using only abstractions — it's just not that interesting. The key, then, is to replace or enhance abstractions with concrete images, things that you can appreciate with your senses: a rose, a shark, or a crackling fire, for example. The concept of the objective correlative may be useful. An objective correlative is an object, several objects, or a series of events (all concrete things) that evoke the emotion or idea of the poem.
Really powerful poetry not only uses concrete images; it also describes them vividly. Show your readers and listeners what you're talking about. — Help them to experience the imagery of the poem. Put in some ""sensory"" handles. These are words that describe the things that you hear, see, taste, touch, and smell, so that the reader can identify with their own experience.
Give some examples rather than purely mental/intellectual descriptions. As a silly example, consider ""He made a loud sound"", versus ""He made a loud sound like a hippo eating 100 stale pecan pies with metal teeth.""

, Poetry that doesn't rhyme doesn't need to be free verse, though. Many poets keep a structured meter pattern but do not rhyme the lines. This is usually called blank verse. The fixed meter usually means a set number of syllables per line and/or a consistent pattern of stressed syllables. If you are looking to make your poetry flow well and sound consistent, using meter is often a great way to do this.

,, While many people today have been exposed to poetry only in written form, poetry was predominantly an oral art form for thousands of years, and the sound of a poem is still important. As you write and edit your poem, read it aloud and listen to how it sounds.


A poem's internal structure commonly focuses on rhythm, rhyme, or both. Consider classic styles like sonnets and Greek epics for inspiration.
A lot of spoken English is based on iambic pentameter, in which speech follows an alternating pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables for a total of 10 syllables. A lot of poetry written in iambic pentameter, such as that of Shakespeare, begins with an unstressed, one-syllable word such as ""an"" or ""the"" to start the alternating pattern.
This is where poems can become songs. It is easier to find a tune for regular meter, so maybe you want to cut words out or put some in to get the same number of syllables in each line. Memorize it. If you believe it, then maybe someone else will learn it and love it before it is a song.

, When the basic poem is written, set it aside for awhile and then read the poem out loud to yourself. Go through it and balance the word choices with the rhythm. Take out unnecessary words and replace imagery that isn't working.


Some people edit a poem all at once, while others come back to it again and again over time.
Don't be afraid to rewrite if some part of the poem is not working. Some poems have lines that simply don't convey an element well, and those can an should be replaced.

, It can be hard to critique your own work, so after you've done an initial edit, try to get some friends or a poetry group (there are plenty online) to look at your poem for you. You may not like all their suggestions, and you don't have to incorporate any suggestions, but you might find some insight that will make your poem better.


Feedback is good. Pass your poem around, and ask your friends to critique your work. Tell them to be honest, even if it's painful.
Never apologize for your work as it's being critiqued; just focus on listening to the opinions of your readers. Filter their responses, heeding and ignoring, then edit as you see fit.
Offer to critique the work of others, as well. Offering someone else feedback on their work can help you develop a critical eye, which you can apply to your own work.

Read the villanelle out loud.",How to Write a Villanelle," The villanelle has 19 lines, split into 5 tercets (three-line stanzas) and 1 quatrain (a stanza of 4 lines). There are two repeating rhymes and two ""refrains,"" or repeated lines.The 1st and 3rd lines alternate as the last lines of stanzas 2, 3, and 4. The last stanza uses the 1st and 3rd lines as a rhymed couplet.If we use capitals for the refrains and lowercase letters for the rhymes, the form could be expressed as: A1 b A2 / a b A1 / a b A2 / a b A1 / a b A2 / a b A1 A2.There is no set meter in a villanelle but there is a set rhyme scheme. There is no fixed number of syllables for each line in a villanelle.The villanelle is broken into three parts: the introduction, the development, and the conclusion. Most villanelles build up intensity and tone until they reach the conclusion., The easiest way to do this is to break down a villanelle line by line, such as ""Villanelle of Change"" by Edward Arlington Robinson.Let's look at the first stanza of the poem:



line A1- first refrain - Since Persia fell at Marathon

line b - The yellow years have gathered fast

line A2 - second refrain - Long centuries have come and gone.

, The second stanza will use the same first refrain, but line ""b"" line will be different. The line ""a"" will rhyme with the first refrain, ""A1"". The line ""b"" will rhyme with line ""b"" in the first stanza.



line a - And yet (they say) the place will don

line b - A phantom fury of the past,

line A1 - Since Persia fell at Marathon;

, The third stanza will use the same second refrain. Line ""a"" will rhyme with the second refrain, ""A2"". Line ""b"" will rhyme with line ""b"" in the previous stanza.



line a - And as of old when Helicon

line b - Trembled and swayed with rapture vast

line A2 - (Long centuries have come and gone),

, The fourth stanza will use the same first refrain, “A1”. Line “a” will rhyme with the first refrain. Line “b” will rhyme with the line “b” in the previous stanza.



line 10 - a - The ancient plain, when night comes on,

line 11 - b - Shakes to a ghostly battle-blast,

line 12 - A1 - Since Persia fell at Marathon.

, The fifth stanza will use the same second refrain. Line ""a"" will rhyme with the second refrain, ""A2"". Line ""b"" will rhyme with line ""b"" in the previous stanza.



line 13 - a - But into soundless Acheron

line 14 - b - The glory of Greek shame was cast:

line 15 - A2 - Long centuries have come and gone,

, Line “a” will rhyme with the first refrain, “A1”. Line “b” will rhyme with the line “b” in the previous stanza. The poem then ends with the first refrain, “A1” and the second refrain, “A2”.



line 16 - a - The suns of Hellas have all shone,

line 17 - b - The first has fallen to the last;--

line 18 - A1 - Since Persia fell at Marathon,

line 19 - A2 - Long centuries have come and gone.

, There are several well known examples of the form, where the use of the refrain becomes a powerful way to underscore or undercut the previous lines in the stanza. For example:


Dylan Thomas' ""Do Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night""is one of the most famous examples of the villanelle form. Thomas’ poem uses the villanelle structure to deepen the meaning of each stanza.
Elizabeth Bishop's ""One Art""includes text in parenthesis and dashes. Bishop also does a variation on the refrain lines that deviates from the form and from the traditional rhyme scheme of the villanelle.
Sylvia Plath’s ""Mad Girl’s Love Song""puts a more contemporary spin on the form.

, Look critically at two villanelle examples. Use the examples to decide how to structure your villanelle.


What will the tone of your villanelle be? More song-like and lyrical? Or more casual and direct? For example, Thomas’ ""Do Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night"" uses verbs like “burn,” “rave,” and “rage” and has a rhyming quality that flows when read out loud. In contrast, Plath’s ""Mad Girl’s Love Song"" uses plainer language like “shut,” “lift,” “and “made up”.
Will your villanelle use a direct address? Plath’s poem has an “I” speaker throughout the poem that addresses the reader. Thomas’ poem does not have an “I” speaker. Instead, the poem uses a “you” to suggest the poem is being told to another person, such as the speaker’s father.
How will you use the refrain in each stanza of your villanelle? Will the refrains deepen the meaning of the previous lines? Contradict the meaning? In Thomas’ poem, the refrains reinforce the overall theme of the villanelle, urging the speaker’s father to “rage, rage against the dying of the light.” In Bishop’s ""One Art,"" Bishop rephrases the refrain lines. Rather than have freestanding phrases as refrain lines, Bishop uses line breaks to create refrains. “...to be lost that their loss is no disaster” in the first stanza is then rephrased as “None of these will bring disaster” in the third stanza, and then is rephrased again in the fifth stanza as: “I miss them but it wasn’t a disaster.”

, This is the general pattern of the villanelle.Bishop’s poem is a good example of an effective structure, as it begins with a claim: “The art of losing isn’t hard to master” as its introduction.


The poem then develops this claim or idea in the middle section, “Lose something every day,” “I lost my mother’s watch.” The poem builds up to a conclusion by discussing bigger and bigger things the speaker loses, from her mother’s watch to “three loved houses” to “two cities” to “a continent.”
The conclusion in the last stanza then reveals the speaker also lost a “you,” a lover perhaps or a friend, and the speaker has to admit (“Write it!"") that it is a disaster.

, An association diagram is also known as a clustering technique. You will create a cluster or group of words around a theme or idea.Take out a sheet of paper. Write your main topic or subject in the middle of the paper. For example, “a leopard.”
Moving out from the center, write down other words that pop into your mind that relate back to “a leopard.” You can also draw a circle or box around the main topic and use little lines to connect the other words to the main topic.
For example, for “a leopard,” you might write “predator,” “wild,” “jaws,” “spotted”. Don’t worry about organizing the words as you write. Simply let the words flow around the main topic.
Once you feel you have written enough words around the main topic, start to cluster the words. Draw a circle around words that relate to each other and draw a line between the circled words to connect them. Continue doing this with the other words. Some of the terms may end up uncircled, but these lone words can still be useful.Focus on how the words relate back to the main topic. If you have clustered together several words that relate to “predator,” for example, maybe this may be a good approach for the poem. Or if there are a lot of clustered words that focus on “teeth”, this may be another way to approach “a leopard.”
Answer questions like: “I was surprised by…” or “I discovered…” For example, you may look over the clustered words and note “I was surprised by how often I mention my brother in relation to a leopard.” Or, “I discovered I may want to write about how a leopard means a wild or strong personality or character, like my brother.”, A freewrite is a chance for you to let your thoughts flow on a piece of paper. Write whatever comes into your mind and don’t judge or worry about what you are writing.


Take out a piece of paper, or open a new document on your computer. Write the main topic at the top of the paper. Then, set a time limit of 10 minutes and start the freewrite.A good rule of thumb for the freewrite is to not lift your pen from the paper, or your fingers from the keyboard. This means not re-reading the sentences you just wrote or going back over a line for spelling, grammar, or punctuation. If you feel you have run out of things to write down, write about your frustrations about not having anything else to say about the main topic.
Stop writing once the timer is up. Read over the text. Though there may be some confusing or convoluted thoughts, there will also be sentences you may like or an insight that may be useful.
Highlight or underline sentences or phrases you think may work in the villanelle.

, Take out a sheet of paper or open a new document. Write the main topic of the vignette on the top of the document. Then, write down six headings: Who? What? When? Where? Why? and How?Respond to each question with a phrase or sentence. For example, if your topic is “a leopard,” you may answer Who? with “my brother and I.” You may answer When? with “A hot summer day in July when I was six years old.” You may answer Where? with “the San Diego Zoo.” You may answer Why? with “Because my brother loved watching the leopard at the zoo and later became a strong personality as an adult.” And you may answer How? with “He grew up to be an angry man who is misunderstood by many people, including me.”
Look over your responses. Do you have more than one or two phrases for a certain question? Is there one question you had no answer for? If your answers reveal you know more about “where” and “why,” maybe this is where the strongest ideas for the villanelle are.

, A key element of a villanelle is the rhyme scheme. Using the words and phrases you have written down in your brainstorm, create two lists of words that correspond with each other and rhyme. If you can think of phrases that end in rhyming words, write those down as well.


Think about creating refrains that will help you build intensity in the poem. Avoid closed sentences that simply state the obvious, like “We were at the zoo” or “I was six.”
For example, you may write down “leopard” and “shepherd,” or “cage” and “age” and “rage.”
Or you may write down phrases like: “the leopard paced around the cage” and “my brother and I didn’t understand at that age.”
Think about creating detailed descriptions and detailed internal reflections or thoughts with the rhyming words in your list. Go for words that are easy to rhyme with, such as “son,” “zoo,” or “age,” rather than words that are very difficult to use in a rhyme, like “orange.”
You can use a rhyming dictionary to help you. You can purchase them from bookstores or find free ones online.

, Once you’ve brainstormed and compiled a list of rhyming words or phrases, create the first and second refrains. These refrains should be meaningful to the poem, and should allow you to give them more meaning with each repetition.To do this, you could place several rhyming words you like on two different lines and try to write sentences that work around these words. Remember that the refrains need to end with the rhyming words.You could also rearrange phrases you have written down to incorporate rhyming words at the end of the phrases. For example: “In the cage, the leopard paced” could be rephrased as: “The leopard paced around the metal cage” to then rhyme with “My brother and I didn’t understand at that age.”

, One of the easiest ways to work within the structure of the villanelle is to establish the refraining lines first and then work around them. On a piece of paper or a word-processing document, place the refrains within the form of the villanelle.


They should appear as A1 and A2 in the order: A1 b A2 / a b A1 / a b A2 / a b A1 / a b A2 / a b A1 A2.
So, if your first refrain is “The leopard paced around the metal cage,” and your second refrain is “My brother and I didn’t understand at that age,” place them in the A1 and A2 lines of your villanelle.

, Now that you have the refrains down, start filling in the first stanza. This is the introduction segment of the poem, so decide how you want to introduce your subject, theme, or idea to the reader.


If you are describing a certain memory or moment, start by setting the scene. Such as: “I was six when my brother and I saw a leopard at the San Diego Zoo.”
If you are writing the poem as a direct address to someone else, such as your brother, you could begin by discussing the last time you saw or spoke to this person. For example: “You were dressed in black at the funeral.” Or, you can use a line that doesn’t use a “you,” similar to Dylan Thomas’ poem, such as: “Don’t become like the leopard, don’t end up in a cage.”

, The middle section should develop the subject, theme, or idea in the introduction. You have four stanzas to develop the poem and push the intensity of the poem.


One way of building intensity is to have each stanza contain larger and larger moments. For example, in Bishop’s ""One Art,"" she goes from seemingly minor losses, like her mother’s glasses, to the loss of houses, cities, and a continent. Think about the bigger or more absurd versions of your subject or theme. For a poem about a trip to the zoo, you could describe the other animals you saw at the zoo and then build intensity by describing the leopard in the fourth stanza. Or you could describe memories of your brother, moving from smaller moments of anger to larger moments of anger.Another way of building intensity is to have each stanza contain different descriptions of the subject or theme. In Thomas’ poem, the speaker discusses different descriptions of “men” in the middle stanzas, the “Good men”, the “Wild men”, and the “Grave men”. In each stanza, Thomas describes each type of man’s approach to death or the “dying of the light”., Maybe the most difficult section of a villanelle is the concluding section, or stanza. You will need to compose a meaningful ending that ties in the two refraining lines in a powerful way. Consider how you have built intensity in your villanelle so far. Don’t be afraid to address the reader or a “you” in the last stanza. You can also home in on a specific phrase or image you feel is strong and meaningful.


Is there a way you can complicate the beginning and middle section of the poem in the ending stanza? In Thomas’ villanelle, for example, the last stanza introduces the father character, as the speaker addresses a “you”. “And you, my father, there on the sad height, / Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.”
The poem gives the reader different images of “men” in the middle section and the speaker is now considering what type of man his father is in the last stanza. By bringing in the “you” in the last stanza, Thomas makes the poem very personal and specific. It also makes the last stanza very powerful.
The best last stanzas in a poem will leave the reader with more questions than answers. In Thomas’ poem, it is not clear if his father is a man who will “go gentle into that good night.” But the speaker in the poem asks the question and argues against his father succumbing to death. In a larger sense, the last stanza could also be seen as a plea to all fathers or “men” in the world to “rage, rage against the dying of the light.”
The last stanza in Plath’s villanelle takes a different approach than Thomas’ poem or Bishop’s poem. Rather than introduce a “you”, the speaker notes how the “I” was abandoned by a lover who did not return.
But the refrain has a double meaning at the end of the poem, as the reader is not sure if in fact the speaker did make up the lover in her head or if the speaker just thinks she made up the lover in her head. The question of how mad the “mad girl” of the speaker is in the poem is left for the reader to decide., Traditionally, villanelles were written to be read out loud.Continue this tradition by reading the villanelle in your own voice to yourself or to a friend.


This will help you note if your rhyme scheme is off or if the rhythm of the lines of the poem flow well together.
Revise and edit the villanelle as necessary until it almost has a song-like quality.

Create a final draft of the poem.",How to Write a Tyburn Poem," The structure of a Tyburn poem is deceptively simple and requires a good ear for rhyming and syllable count. The six line poem consists of the first four lines that rhyme and are descriptive words. The last two lines of the poem also rhyme and incorporate the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th lines as the 5th to 8th syllables. The structure of the poem in terms of syllable count is:Line 1 - two syllables, descriptive word.
Line 2 - two syllables, descriptive word.
Line 3 - two syllables, descriptive word.
Line 4 - two syllables, descriptive word.
Line 5 - nine syllables, incorporating the 1st and 2nd lines.
Line 6 - nine syllables, incorporating the 3rd and 4th lines.;
, There are several example Tyburn poems that you can use as models for your poem, including:


“Death” by Mike McCann.“A Girl” by Julia Ward.“Art Work” by Russell Sivey., Take one of the example poems and examine how the poet used the Tyburn structure to create an effective poem. For example, if you analyze “A Girl” by Julia Ward:Line 1 - “Pretty”
Line 2 - “Skippy”
Line 3 - “Dippy”
Line 4 - “Lippy”
Line 5 - “Was the charming, pretty, skippy girl”
Line 6 - “Caught up in a dippy, lippy whirl?”
The poet has incorporated the 1st and 2nd lines in the fifth line of the poem, tying the descriptive words to the subject of the poem, the “girl”. The poet then finishes the poem by incorporating the 3rd and 4th lines in the sixth line of the poem, ending on a question about the girl that leaves the reader in a state of wonder about the “girl” of the poem.
The poet is also able to fulfill the syllable count required for a Tyburn poem and the rhyme scheme for a Tyburn poem, while still creating an effective portrait of the poem’s subject.

, Start by thinking about who or what you would like to write about in your Tyburn poem. This could be a best friend, your childhood pet, or a more abstract concept like death, life, grief, or pain. Choose a subject that you feel you can write about in a descriptive and concise way, as the Tyburn poem structure is mostly about precision and strong description.


You may also be assigned a Tyburn poem as part of an English literature class, where you are given a prompt for the poem. If the prompt is to write about someone important in your life, you may choose a family member, a friend, or a mentor. If the prompt is to write about an emotion or feeling, you may choose an emotion you are currently experiencing, like anxiety, joy, boredom, or fear.

, A key element of the Tyburn poem is the four descriptive words that will act as the first to fourth lines of the poem and be integrated into the final two lines of the poem. Once you have chosen the subject of your poem, you should brainstorm strong descriptive words that are two syllables long.


You may want to do this by writing down as many two syllable descriptive words that you can think of in relation to your subject and then highlighting or circling the strongest words. You can then use the strongest word to find words that rhyme with the strongest words, creating your four rhyming two syllable words.
For example, if your subject is your best friend, you may choose descriptive words like “willful”, “playful”, “wistful”, and “gleeful”.
If your subject is an emotion like fear, you may choose descriptive words like “blackest”, “darkest”, “saddest”, and “baddest”.

, Now that you have your four descriptive rhyming words, you should brainstorm how you are going to use them in the last two lines of your Tyburn poem. You may change up the order of the four descriptive words in your poem based on how you arrange them in the final two lines.


For example, in your Tyburn poem about your best friend, you may create a fifth line: “She is my best wilful playful friend”. You may then follow this line with the sixth line: “She is my best wistful, gleeful friend”. This means the order of the descriptive words in the poem will need to be: “Wilful, playful, wistful, gleeful”.
In your Tyburn poem about fear, you may create a fifth line: “Alive like the blackest, darkest night”, followed by a sixth line: “Me, I dread the saddest, baddest sight”. This means the order of the descriptive words in the poem will need to be: “Blackest, darkest, saddest, baddest”.

, Once you drafted all six lines of the Tyburn poem, you should arrange them in order to create a first draft. Using the poem on “Fear” as an example, the rough draft would look like this:


“Blackest”
“Darkest”
“Saddest”
“Baddest”
“Alive like the blackest, darkest night”
“Me, I dread the saddest, baddest sight”

, You may also decide to write several poems of several different subjects or using different sets of descriptive words for the same subject. Writing about fear, for example, you could use several sets of descriptive words to create one to three different poems about fear. You could then evaluate each poem to determine which poem is the strongest one.


For example, you may have one poem about fear that uses the following descriptive words: ""blackest"", ""darkest"", ""saddest"" and ""baddest"". You may also have a second poem that uses the following descriptive words: ""longest"", ""strongest"", ""fondest"", and ""calmest"". You may write a final, third poem using the following descriptive words: ""gleeful"", ""blissful"", ""careful"", and ""dreadful"".
You can then analyze each poem, with its respective set of descriptive words, and choose the best one of the three. Consider the type of emotions and feelings associated with your subject and then think about which poem best personifies those feelings or associations. In a poem about fear, for example, you may expect to see descriptive words like ""darkest"" and ""blackest"", rather than ""fondest"" or ""calmest"". You may choose the poem that uses descriptive words that best fit the subject and communicate the subject well to the reader.
You may also consider the last two lines of each poem and how effective they are. One poem about fear may end with the two lines:“Alive like the blackest, darkest night/Me, I dread the saddest, baddest sight”. A second version may end with the two lines: ""Ready for the longest, strongest night/Me, I dread the fondest, calmest sight"". While the structure of the two sets of end lines are very similar, the first set of lines contain descriptive words that better fit the subject of fear and leave the reader with a sense of fear and dread.

, The Tyburn poem can be very appealing when read out loud so ask a friend or partner to be your audience and read your rough draft to them. Ask them to give you any notes on flow and rhyme, ensuring that you are using the correct number of syllables for every line and each line follows the rhyme scheme.


For example, you may read your poem about your best friend out loud and find that some of the lines do not flow well or sound awkward out loud. You may then edit it to make it sound more musical. Your revised poem may look like:
“Wilful”
“Wistful”
“Playful”
“Gleeful”
“Always my dear wilful, wistful friend”
“With me til the playful, gleeful end”

, Another reader can also help to improve your poem, especially a classmate who is also writing a Tyburn poem for class or a mentor who is familiar with this poetic style.


Offer to trade poems with a classmate or someone who is also working on a Tyburn poem, offering notes and suggestions on how to make it better. You can also submit a draft of your poem to your teacher or mentor for review before you create a final draft of the poem.

, Once you receive feedback on your poem and have revised your rough draft, you are ready to create a final draft of your Tyburn poem.


It can be helpful to read your final draft out loud as well to ensure the poem rhymes properly and flows well.

For starters, let's assume you already know how to write a haiku poem.,
Now taking the third line, think of how to change the scene from the cloud in the mountains to somewhere else.,
Notice the shift in mood.",How to Write a Tanka Poem," If so, you may already have the first three lines done! Let's say your haiku is:






ever ascending
the mountain road disappears
into pallid clouds





, For our example, note that in many cultures, especially Asian cultures, white can symbolise death (already hinted at by the word ""pallid""). Let's work with that and add the closing couplet:






I think of you as blossoms
too soon tossed on winding roads





, The poem has gone from a picture of mountain roads (note how the road links the first and second parts, though in your poem the link can certainly be a subtle one) to an expression of loss for which there is no exact word. However, the shift may not always be so obvious.

, As cold as ice, like the brownest of mud pools...

, Every ideal poem should have at least one metaphor and one simile. It was a raging army of water and foam...for this it is a good idea to look at a river yourself. What does the water remind you of? Does it seem to have a mood of its own?

, Is each verse going to be four lines, or two, or...?

, You can add any more metaphors and similes.

, You can rhyme every other line, or all lines or any other way you see fit. Begin with one verse, and that only.

,, Key words for you: fast, water, rushing, foam, tide, river, bank, mud, weed, slope, ripple. Feel free to take any of those.

, You want to make it unique but something that tells the reader what it is about. Here is a technique I use to help find a title. If there is an action in your poem, such as circling the river, allowing the mud to ooze onto your feet...you can use the verb in your title. The subject is obviously the river, but did you use another word more? Instead of Pacing the River, it could be Circling the River Water or something similar. So the noun you use most frequently, any verb you may have. Now if you have a particular adjective in your poem you would like to use (for instance, if you described the water as grimy, foamy ect) you can add that instead of a verb. So you could have something like The Grimy River's Water. Try not to include verb, noun AND adjective since then it will be very long-winded.

Play with words.",How to Write a Rhyming Poem," Words are said to rhyme when the endings and sounds of the words match. There are many different types of rhyme, but full rhymes or ""perfect"" rhymes are words like ""dog"" and ""bog,"" with identical vowel and consonant combinations. If you want to write out a rhyming poem, a good way to get started is to practice rhyming. Start with a word and come up with a good list of words that rhyme with it. Some will be easier than others.


Dog, for example, rhymes perfectly with bog, cog, log, nog, agog, frog, grog, hog, and lots of others. Come up with your own list for practice.
If you have a theme in mind, try to start coming up with a few different vocab words that might make for a good poem, and match rhyming words with each.;
, While a few well-placed full rhymes might seem like the mark of a perfect poem, trying to make every rhyme perfect can force some poems to be awkward and clunky. A good poem shouldn't include rhymes just to complete the poem, it's better to let the rhymes give the content of the poem some added color and inflection. This is where more flexible rhymes come in:



Semi-rhymes match up almost perfectly except for the fact that one of the words has an extra syllable (ex. “hate” and “grating”).

Slant rhymes match only the end consonants, disregarding the vowel sounds (ex. “meant” and stint”).

Forced rhymes match up sounds properly but throw off the natural rhythm by rhyming a stressed syllable with an unstressed syllable (ex. “stíng” and “sharing”).

Visual rhymes match up words that look the same but sound different (ex. “dove” and “drove”).

, Rhyming poems do more than include words that rhyme. Most poems that rhyme also pay attention to the meter of the lines, which refers to the number of stressed and unstressed syllables in the line. It can get quite complex, but the principles are pretty simple, and are good to be aware of when you're first getting started.


Count up the number of syllables in a line of poetry, like ""To be or not to be, that is the question."" In that line, there are ten. Now, read the line out loud and try to listen to the stressed and the unstressed syllables. Read it emphasizing those stresses.
Shakespeare's famous line is an example of what's called iambic pentameter, which means that the line includes five beats (pentameter), made up of an unstressed syllable, followed by a stressed syllable: ""To BE or NOT to BE, that IS the question.
It's not super-critical to understand iambs and metrical feet when you're starting out, but it is good to try to keep the syllable-count of each line roughly the same. Count up your syllables when you get started, so your poem's lines don't get too long.

, When you rhyme, it can sometimes be tempting to start writing like a Victorian. It's not necessary to stilt your language into an awkward formal version of itself. If you want to write rhyming poetry in the 21st century, it should sound like it was written by someone who shops for cereal in the cereal aisle, not someone who slays dragons. Check out contemporary poets who rhyme without sounding old-fashioned:


Joshua Mehigan's ""The Professor""
Hailey Leithauser's ""Triolet with Pachyderm""
Michael Robbins' ""Not Fade Away""
Georgia Douglas Johnson's ""Your World""

, Rhyming poems are composed in lots of different ways, and there's no one right way to get started. You can start with a traditional poetic form and write a poem that fits it, or you can just start writing and see if what you write would benefit from a stricter form.


It's common to pick the form first and craft your content to fit the form of the poem. If you select this method of composing, pick a form and go from there. Check out this article for a primer on poetic forms.
Alternatively, you can start to write about a particular subject, without paying attention to the rhyme scheme or the meter of what you're writing. Yeats, the great Irish poet, started all his poems by writing prose.
Another alternative is to forego rhyme entirely. Not all poems will require rhyme to do what you want to with them. If you're writing poetry for a school assignment, starting with prose is still a fine way of doing it.

, Don’t be too strict with your rhyming words in list form, just try to get as many as possible to give yourself a cheat-sheet to work from. Keep this list of rhyming words going as you write and revise your poem.


Be sure to choose words that are thematically related, are similar in tone when necessary, and relate back to the subject of your poem.
It's also a good idea to try to come up with some off-beat words to force yourself to fit in if you want to, as well as rhyming phrases that you might incorporate into the poem. Rhyming ""Buju Banton"" with ""the great wonton of Scranton""? Could be great.

, It doesn’t have to be the first line of the poem, and it doesn't have to be great. Just focus on committing one line to paper that will help anchor your poem and give yourself something from which you can build. You can always change it later.


This is going to be your ""guide"" line. Count up the beats in the line and figure out what you're working with in terms of the meter. Then use that meter to guide the rest of your lines. If you want to change it later, you can.

, Write a few lines around your first line, and look for good connections that might spark the poem. As you write, try integrating words from your rhyming list to give yourself some options, and keep building lines one on the next, using the images as the ideas from one to generate the next.


If you write something like ""The feeble words of fate,"" it's hard to find anything to hold on to or to see in the line, which makes the poem harder to write. It's like a closed door. You could always rhyme ""Lead us all to hate,"" but that likewise doesn't give us much to work with. You're just rhyming. What could come next?
Write ""open door"" lines full of imagery and without any big abstract words. What do ""feeble words of fate"" look like? What words? Who said them? Try something like, ""My mother was tired and told us dinner was cold,"" which gives us something to see, something to work with: ""My mother was tired and told us dinner was cold. / Her words have always been a cold stone to hold.""

, If you've got a loose-ish collection of rhyming words, or something that's starting to resemble a poem, a good way of revising and finishing a poem is to select a rhyme scheme and make it fit. A poem’s rhyme scheme is the pattern that determines how the ends of the lines rhyme with one another. If an interesting rhyme scheme has already begun to form in your poem, keep using it. If not, use some traditional patterns:



ABAB is one of the most common rhyme schemes. It means that the first and third line rhyme (A with A), as do the second and fourth (B with B). Ex.A – Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?B – Thou art more lovely and more temperate:A – Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,B – And summer’s lease hath all too short a dateABCB is another common rhyme scheme, offering more flexibility. Ex.A – Roses are redB – Violets are blueC – Sugar is sweetB – And so are you.


, Though traditional rhyme schemes are useful and fun to work with, feel free to forgo them for something looser, if it suits your needs. A ""good"" poem isn't one that's perfectly constructed to fit the template of rhymes. A good poem is one that communicates a strange, unique idea that would have been impossible to write out in prose.



A – And indeed there will be timeB – For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,C – Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;A – There will be time, there will be timeB – To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;D – There will be time to murder and create,E – And time for all the works and days of handsD – That lift and drop a question on your plate;F – Time for you and time for me,G – And time yet for a hundred indecisionsG – And for a hundred visions and revisionsF – Before the taking of a toast and tea., There are lots of different traditional forms, which are always written according to a certain semi-complicated pattern. If you're curious about trying to write a poem that rhymes in a pre-determined pattern, you can try out any of the following:



Couplets are a deceptively simple pair of lines that rhyme together, and poems can be made up of lots of couplets to create what is called ""heroic couplets."" Milton, Alexander Pope, and lots of canonical poets made great use of the couplet.

Sonnets are 14-line rhyming poems that can follow one of two rhyming patterns. Shakespearean sonnets always follow an alternating rhyme scheme, then end with a couplet: a-b-a-b, c-d-c-d, e-f-e-f, g-g. Petrarchan sonnets have somewhat more variance, but are generally some variation of a-b-b-a, a-b-b-a, c-d-c-d-c-d.

Villanelles are very complex poems forms that require you to repeat whole lines of the poem. Villanelles are written in three line stanzas, all of which must rhyme a-b-a. The catch is that the A lines must repeat as the final line of each subsequent stanza. These poems take some serious work.

, Don’t get so caught up with how the ends of the lines match up that you forget to have fun with the middles.


Assonance refers to the repetition and rhyme of vowel sounds – ex. “far” and “start”)
Consonance refers to the repetition and rhyme of consonants – ex. “freak” and “fork”)
Alliteration refers to the repetition and rhyming of the first sounds of words – ex. “lazy lovers’ longing”)

You may write down keywords associated with your first meeting with your friend or thoughts you had when you first met your friend.You may also remember the distinct moment when you realized this person was going to be a good friend of yours and an important person in your life. Try to describe this moment, focusing on specific details. What you were wearing when you met your friend for the first time? Where did the meeting take place? What were your first thoughts or impressions of her?;
, You can also brainstorm ideas for your poem by listing your friend’s personal traits. Is she known for being friendly, welcoming, and optimistic? Maybe she is known for having a great sense of style and an eye for fashion or a generous heart and an instinct for recognizing the good in people. Write down as many traits that pop into your head when you think of your friend.You can include some negative traits if you’d like but because you are planning to create the poem for your friend as a tribute, you may want to focus on the positive traits. The poem will then reflect the aspects of your friend that you admire and appreciate.

, Focus on your friend's voice, hair color, eye color, and general sense of style. You can also write down distinct details about her physique and demeanor, such as any physical ticks or habits she has, her syntax or way of speaking, any catchphrases she uses or any funny things she often says.

, Try to remember moments or scenes that illustrate a good time you had with your friend. This could be the time she comforted you after a bad breakup or the time you both did something mildly reckless and got away with it. Think about times when you had fun with your friend or had a positive experience.Write down the details of the memory, from where you both were to what you were wearing to what you were doing. You should consider why the memory stands out to you and what emotions you associate with the memory.

, You may also want to examine any struggles or hard times you experienced with your friend by your side. Even the best of friendships go through rough patches. You may want to consider any times where you and your friend had a difficult time and how you both got through it together.For example, maybe you and your friend got into a big argument where hurtful things were said. You may want to describe the scene of the fight as well as the aftermath of the fight when you and your friend made up. This could help to show how strong your friendship is and how you both were able to put aside your differences and come together for the sake of your friendship.

, To get a better sense of how you can approach your friendship poem, you may want to read a few examples, such as:


“A Toast to Our Friendship” by Mia Pratt.""Toast to My Friend or Why Friendship is the Best Kind of Love"" by Dorothea Lasky.""The Friend"" by Matt Hart.""Dear Friend"" by Dean Young., Once you read the examples, you should look at how each example addresses friendship. You can also compare and contrast the examples to look at which ones you may prefer or feel will fit best with your subject matter.


Ask yourself, How does the writer discuss their ideas and feelings on friendship as well as how much their friend means to them? Do they use imagery, description, and detail to illuminate the friendship? What type of form does the writer chose for the poem and how does this contribute to the poem overall?

, It can be daunting to start your poem with a blank page in front of you. One way to help you get started is to consider what type of form you would like to use for the poem. You may decide to try the free verse form, as it is one of the more common forms and can be relatively easy to do if you are new to writing poetry.Free verse has no set meter, structure, or rhyme scheme. But when writing free verse, you should still try to create a cohesive piece that flows in some way and expresses your ideas clearly. You have lots of freedom in free verse to play around with the length of each line as well as the descriptions and images you use in the poem.
For example, the poem “A Toast to Our Friendship” by Mia Pratt uses the free verse form to discuss a close friendship. The author uses strong adjectives, verbs, and description to create an interesting portrayal of the relationship between friends. Though the verse is free-form, the poem still feels cohesive and focused.

, You can also try a rhyming form or rhyme scheme, where your poem has a pattern of rhyme that occurs at the end of each line of the poem. There are several popular rhyming forms you may want to try for your poem, including:An alternate rhyme: Often, this rhyme follows the pattern ABAB, where the first and third line rhyme (A) and the second and fourth line rhyme (B). This rhyming pattern may then be repeated in each stanza or section of the poem.
Rhyming couplet: This form has two line stanzas that rhyme and may be placed in pairs or added at the end of a stanza. The rhyme scheme could be “A,A,B,B,C,C,...”
Ballad: This form has three stanzas with a rhyme scheme of “ABABBBCBC”, followed by “BCBC”.
Limerick: This form is five lines with a rhyme scheme of “AABBA”.

, If you are looking a different approach to your poem on friendship, you may try a more visual form that appears visually interesting on the page. This could be an acrostic form, where each letter of the friend’s name spells out a phrase, word, or image that represents the friend.You could also break up the text into columns or sections on the page and group them under different ideas or thoughts about your friend.
Another visually interesting element could be integrating photographs of your friend into the text, placing the images at the beginning or end of the text.

, Once you have brainstormed your poem, you should sit down and create a first draft. You may decide to focus on certain scenes with your friend that illustrate your friendship. You should use sensory details to describe the scene, such as any smells in the room with you and your friend, any colors or eye catching details, any sounds, and any items that you held or touched. Using sensory details will help the poem feel vibrant and engaging.You may decide to focus on a scene of when you first met your friend or a where your friend did something brave and wonderful for you recently. You should try to describe the scene from your perspective and then discuss why you think what your friend did was so great or so interesting.
For example, rather than just write “I met you when I was in high school”, you might say, “There I was, my hair in braids and my braces flashing in the light, when I ran into you with your dyed black hair and platform shoes in the hallway and thought, who’s that girl?”

, Make the poem personal to you and your friend by including personal traits about your friend that you admire or find distinct. You may also include personal traits that you both share and discuss how these traits make your friendship stronger.For example, in Mia Pratt’s “A Toast to Our Friendship”, the author notes personal traits that she shares with the friend she is writing about, comparing them to “a female Jordan and Scottie Pippen”, who “both share identical shoe sizes, body weight, and consumption of iron pills” as well as “identical patterns of speech”.These details make the poem feel personal and unique to the friendship the author shares with her friend.

, Though you can decide if the first person or the third person is a good fit for your poem, the first person perspective will help the poem to feel more personal and intimate. The first person “I” perspective will allow you to discuss your friendship from your point of view and address your friend directly by referring to “you” as well as “we” when you are talking about the two of you together.

, After you have created your poem, you should read it out loud to yourself to hear how the words sound together in each line. Notice if any lines should awkward or not quite right. Check for any words that seem too vague or unclear. You should also make sure you are using specific detail and sensory descriptions to make the poem feel engaging.


You may want to mark up the poem to note any awkward lines or words. You can then edit the poem for clarity and tone, focusing on the sections you have marked.

, Once you are satisfied with your poem, you should share it with your friend as a surprise gift or casually hand it to her the next time you see her. Showing your poem to your friend will allow her to read about how much you value her and appreciate her friendship. She may even be inspired to write a poem about you and share her perspective on your friendship."

You might be feeling sad or angry, or you might recall happy memories and feel grateful.
Write whatever comes to mind without filtering or revising your words.
There's no right or wrong way to write out what you'd like to say. You can be totally honest since you don't have to show this part to anyone else.;
, Read through your notes, whether it's a list, a formal letter, or something else entirely. This is the raw material of your poem, and you'll need to mine these notes for the pieces that will make up your poem.


Circle, underline, or highlight the words and phrases you choose.
You may want to choose words based on the associations you've made in your mind, the relevance of those words to the deceased's life, or the poetic nature of those words.

, As you review your favorite words and phrases, you should begin to visualize some strong images. Consider the sights, smells, sounds, tastes, and physical sensations that come to mind as you read through your favorite words and phrases.Choose concrete words and phrases (which describe things using the senses) instead of abstract ones (which refer to feelings or concepts). Concrete words help the images take shape in the reader's mind.
An example of an abstract description would be ""the grass was tired."" A concrete description would be something like ""the blades of grass bent over, leaning for a lifetime against the prairie wind.""
Try to paint an image with your words. Think about abstract/original ways of phrasing things and vivid, descriptive phrases that capture the words you identified as your favorites from the earlier notes.
One way to paint a picture with words is to try to describe the most striking images you see. For example, you might describe the deceased person's hands, then zoom out to what they're holding, then describe the way the deceased used to perform that action.

, The ultimate shape you want your poem to take will influence how you organize your thoughts and begin drafting your poem. Now that you've put all your raw thoughts and feelings on paper and made imagistic phrases from your favorite words, you'll need to figure out how you envision your poem taking shape.Do you want your poem to capture a particular moment between you and the deceased? Or perhaps a general moment in the life of the deceased?
Your poem could also capture a conversation you and the deceased had, or it could be a response to something the deceased said to you.
You could use your poem to simply describe the characteristics of the deceased.

, Before you begin actually writing your poem, you may want to consider what form you'd like the poem to take. There are many poetic forms, and no one form is necessarily better or worse than any other form. Which form you choose will depend on the aesthetic style that most appeals to you.Common forms of poetry include, but are not limited to:


abstract poetry - plays with different sounds and rhythms to evoke different emotions
elegy - poem of mourning/sorrow
haiku - Japanese poetic form that is restricted to three lines containing five syllables in the first line, seven syllables in the second line, and five syllables in the third line
sonnet - 14 line poem written in iambic pentameter
sestina - poetic form that plays with using six words rotated as the ending word of each line throughout the poem

, Opening the poem with a vivid image will grab the attention of your audience and set the tone for the rest of your poem.Think about which image or images are most important to you or most accurately capture the overall feeling or mode you hope to capture in the poem.You can get a pretty good idea of your strongest image by identifying the one that always comes to mind when you reflect on your list.
If you're not sure which image is your strongest, try asking a friend or relative which image stands out the most in your poem.

, Many strong poems have one line that encapsulates the rest of the poem. This key line may capture the feeling of the poem, or it could be a line that explicitly states what the poem is all about.Consider what it is you're hoping to say about or to the deceased with this poem.
Be creative. Obviously you miss the deceased, but how can you make your poem an interesting and unique tribute to that person?
The main idea should involve the deceased, but it can be about any aspect of their life or even a realization you've had because of their passing.

, A cliche is a phrase that is highly overused and comes across as unoriginal or uncreative. Cliches can easily ruin an otherwise exquisite poem. As you read through your poem, try to identify any phrases that sound like a stereotypical poetic phrase (anything you feel like you've heard before a million times), then rewrite them.


An example of a cliche would be, ""The sun sets on his life.""
Identify what the cliched phrase is trying to say.
Brainstorm original ways to convey that information. Try using metaphors (comparisons that don't use like or as) to strengthen the poetic nature of your writing.Choose your favorite non-cliche description and see how it fits with the rest of the poem.
A less-cliched version of the above line might be, ""He could no longer keep up with the orbit of the hours.""

, While you are obviously dealing with a range of highly-sentimental thoughts and feelings, you want your poem to remain approachable to readers who may not share your memories of the deceased. Look back over your poem and try to identify places where you let your emotions take control of the poem, then try rewriting those sections with a more even tone.An example of a sentimental line might be, ""I miss him so much.""
Look for any sections of the poem in which sadness, grief, or anguish completely dominate the poem.
Ask yourself whether a reader who does not share your memories could understand or relate to those parts of the poem.
Try rewriting those sections in a more controlled, less-emotional tone.
A less-sentimental way of saying the above line might be, ""I carry a million memories and all of them are his.""

, If you're sharing your poem with someone for the first time, it may be easiest to choose someone with whom you feel comfortable. A friend or family member may be ideal, though you may also want to consider whether the individual you choose knew the deceased and can relate to how you're feeling.Make sure the person you choose will not be judgmental or rude when you share your poem. Consider choosing someone close to you who will be understanding and supportive.

, Some people feel more comfortable reading out loud, while others may prefer showing a printed form of the poem to someone. There is no right or wrong choice regarding how you share your poem; it's simply a matter of what you're more comfortable with.


Reading the poem out loud gives you the opportunity to voice the poem as you imagine it. You can use inflections and pauses to emphasize certain parts, which can't be done if someone is just reading the written words.
Having someone else read the poem takes some of the pressure off of you to perform. You don't have to worry about tearing up or getting emotional while you read, but you lose the chance to voice the poem.

, If you were close to the individual who passed away, you may be asked to speak at his or her service (if a service is held). If you do decide to speak at the service, reading your poem could be a moving tribute to the person you've lost. However, your poem may be intensely personal, and you may not feel comfortable sharing it at the service. It's perfectly acceptable if you want to read your poem, but there's nothing wrong with preferring to keep it private - it's strictly a matter of personal preference and comfort.

The haiku should act as a snapshot of a moment in time, giving the reader a tiny picture in three lines.Often, haikus focus on nature and use specific details to describe how the speaker is feeling or what the speaker is experiencing. The speaker will use details from nature to express an emotion, such as sadness, or an experience, such as a joyful moment in their life.
Haikus will often begin by focusing one moment or object and then shift into a description of another moment or object. The relationship between these two moments or objects will cause the reader to be surprised or intrigued, leading to a deeper meaning in the haiku.;
, To get a better sense of the tone and style of nature haikus, you may spend some time reading well known examples of the form. Many Japanese poets from the 9th century were skilled at the nature haiku form, as well as contemporary poets who are exploring the form today. You can read several examples, including:


The haikus of Basho Matsuo.The haikus of Yosa Buson.The haikus of Natsume Soseki.The haikus of Richard Wright., You can find inspiration for your nature haiku by immersing yourself in a natural setting with a pen and paper. Brainstorm ideas for the haiku at your favorite nearby park or in your backyard. You may also walk down to a beach or a local garden to be surrounded by nature and get inspiration for your poem.Once you have found a natural setting, you may look around and focus on a particular flower or tree that catches your eye. You may describe the flower or tree by writing down any descriptions and words that come to mind.
Try also write down how the flower or tree makes you feel as a viewer. You could then explore these emotions in your haiku using the natural setting as inspiration.

, You can also get started on your nature haiku by focusing on a particular animal found in nature. You could then describe the animal in your haiku, noting how it acts in nature.You may take a trip to your local zoo to observe animals in their habitat. Or you may go to a nature park or forest that has small animals you can observe in the wild. Bring your pen and paper with you so you can brainstorm ideas, emotions, and phrases as you observe the animal.

, Many haikus focus on a particular season or time of year and will include a “season word”, where a particular season is mentioned to clue the reader in. You may have an affinity for a particular season or look out your window and observe the current season outside. Choose from the four seasons (fall, winter, spring, and summer) or choose a planetary shift to focus on, such as a full moon, a half moon, or an eclipse.You may try to focus on specific details you observe during a particular season, such as the icicles on your roof during winter or the fat bees in the flower beds during the spring. You should write down several specific details of the season as a way to generate ideas for your haiku.

, You only have 17 syllables total for your haiku, so you want to make sure each one counts and is memorable for your reader. Including details that play on the five senses (smell, sight, touch, taste, and sound) will help to immerse your reader in your natural setting. Sensory detail can also help you imbue the poem with a certain tone or mood.For example, the haiku by Natsume Soseki has strong sensory details: “Over the wintry/forest, winds howl in rage/with no leaves to blow.”Natsume includes details on how the forest appears and how the wind sounds. He also uses these details to give the reader a sense of the emptiness and quiet present during winter.

, Though haikus do not have to follow a certain rhyme scheme or pattern, many haikus will repeat certain words or phrases. The words or phrases may reinforce a certain image for the reader. They may also demonstrate the main subject of the haiku.For example, the haiku by Basho Matsuo uses repetition to great effect: “An old silent pond/A frog jumps into the pond, splash!/Silence again.”Basho includes “silent” and “silence” in the haiku, once at the beginning and once at the end. This silence is contrasted by the “splash!” in the second line, creating a break between the haiku’s beginning and it’s end. Basho creates a mood of silence, interrupts it, and then re establishes it again in the final line. This allows the reader to actually experiences the moment, first hand.

, You do not have space for a lot of words in your haiku so you should try to use words that are interesting and unique. Avoid cliches, which are phrases that have become so familiar they have lost their meaning. Aim for words that emote a certain mood or tone. Look for words that will create a certain image or sound in the reader’s mind.For example, the poet Richard Wright uses strong word choice in his haiku: “Whitecaps on the bay/A broken signboard banging/In the April wind.”This haiku is effective because Wright uses specific descriptions to create a strong mental image for the reader. Rather than simply saying “waves”, Wright uses “whitecaps” and describes the “broken signboard banging.” These details make the poem come alive for the reader, a combination of strong word choice and good sensory detail.

, Many poets will use the third and final line of the haiku to create a contrast in the reader’s mind. This contrast will create a shift in the poem, surprising or intriguing the reader. It can also add a deeper meaning to the haiku.For example, the haiku by Natsume does this well: “The crow has flown away/swaying in the evening sun,/a leafless tree.”Natsume introduces the image of a crow that has flown away, then the image of the something swaying in the sun, a contrast to the crow. The final line tells the reader it was the tree, not the crow, that was swaying in the evening sun. The tree was still moving even after the crow flew away, leaving the reader with a contrasting image at the end of the poem.

, Haikus are often written to be read out loud in one breath. You should read your nature haiku out loud to yourself and listen to how it sounds. Does it flow smoothly when you read it out loud, in one long breath? Does the haiku create interesting sounds and tones when you read it out loud? Do you get a good sense of a natural setting or of a moment in nature?You should also check that the haiku follows the required syllable count for each line. You may count out the syllables so they follow the 5-7-5 syllable count or look up words in a dictionary to determine their syllable count.

, You can also read the haiku out loud to a sympathetic audience and ask them for feedback. You may ask your audience if they get a good sense of a natural setting or a specific moment in nature. You may also ask them if they get a sense of contrast with the third line and if the haiku leaves them intrigued or surprised.

, You should take any feedback from others as well as your own notes and revise the haiku. Adjust any words that sound awkward or any phrases that sound long-winded. Replace familiar words with more creative or interesting words.


Try to make the haiku concise but also powerful and emotive. Make sure you are painting a picture of nature, with strong sensory detail and a last line that lingers in the reader’s or listener’s mind.

Focus on themes or ideas that resonate with you.,
Try more challenging forms.,
Play with meter.",How to Write Your Best Poetry2," Many of the most successful poems will center on a specific theme or idea, rather than a general theme or idea. Though there are no limits on the theme or idea, it should be specific to you and present challenging, difficult, disturbing, compelling, and meaningful subject matter. Tackling a big idea, such as death or mortality, from a unique, honest perspective will often allow you to create a better poem.When you sit down to write a poem, you should ask yourself, “Why am I compelled to write about this subject or topic?” “What am I trying to convey to the reader?” “How can I present a unique perspective on a familiar theme or idea?”
One option is to use one theme or idea to create a series of linked poems, where you use a different formal approach in each poem to explore the theme. This could allow you to generate interesting content and play around with the theme using different forms or approaches.

, Selecting a form for your poem, such as free verse, rhyming couplets, a sonnet, or a chance poem, can help to focus your writing. Trying new and challenging forms can push you to create better poetry.Sometimes a certain form can act as a frame from your poem and serve as an organizing principle for your random thoughts. The restrictions of a certain form can also force you to create descriptions that fit the structure, and perhaps come up with ideas you may not have created on your own.
You can try your hand at several challenging forms, such as the sestina, the pantoum or the Spenserian sonnet.You can also challenge yourself by doing writing experiments, where you try to write poetry within guidelines or limitations. You can find writing experiments by the great Bernadette Mayer online: http://www.writing.upenn.edu/library/Mayer-Bernadette_Experiments.html.
Some poets will deviate from their chosen form, usually at the very end of the poem, as a way to flex their abilities as a poet. Often, this is done only once and to the maximum effect.
You can review a list of poetic structures to find forms that could make your poetry more engaging and unique.

, The use of meter, a pattern of stressed and unstressed words, can actually be useful in poetry as a way to create rhythm. Often, the use of meter can be an alternative way to create interesting sounds in your poetry instead of rhyme. Meter can be broken into four types based on where the stressed and unstressed words are in a line: iamb meter, trochee meter, dactyl meter, and anapest meter.A famous example of iamb meter is Shakespeare’s ""Sonnet 18”, “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” The first syllable, “Shall I”, is unstressed, and the second syllable, “compare”, is stressed.
An example of trochee meter can be found in Longfellow’s “Song of Hiawatha”: “By the shores of Gitche Gumee/ By the shining Big-Sea-Water”. The first syllable, “By the”, is stressed, and the second syllable, “Shores of”, is unstressed.
An example of dactyl meter can be found in Browning’s “The Lost Leader”: “Just for a riband to stick in his coat”. The first syllable, “Just for” is stressed, and the second and third syllables are unstressed, “a riband to stick in his coat”.
An example of anapest meter can be found in “Peeve’s Song” from Harry Potter: “Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done”. The first two syllables are unstressed and the third syllable is stressed.

"
"
Use metaphors and similes.,
Include assonance.,
Create strong imagery.,
Use personification.,
Put internal rhyme in your poetry.,
Use juxtaposition in your poetry.",How to Write Your Best Poetry3," One way to strengthen your poetry is to focus on your use of language and make sure you are using literary devices like metaphor and simile to full effect. These two devices are commonly used in poetry and can help you present a theme or idea in a more nuanced way.A metaphor ascribes a meaning or identity to one subject by way of another. In a metaphor, an abstract characteristic is projected onto a subject as a way to describe the subject. For example: “My father is a snake.” This does not mean the speaker’s subject is an actual snake, but that he has the characteristics of a snake.
A simile places one object or subject as similar to another object using “like” or “as”. For example, “My father is as sneaky as a snake” or “He is sneaky, like a snake.”
Many poets prefer using metaphors over similes, as metaphors do not require the use of “like” or “as” in a line and often sound more natural when read out loud.

, This literary device refers to the repetition of sounds made by vowels in a line or phrase of your poetry. Assonance is a kind of alliteration but is often considered more sophisticated than alliteration. This device allows you to create a certain sound pattern without having to use rhyming.An example of assonance is “A bling ring” or “The gritty slit”.
You can use alliteration in your poetry, where words start with the same word in sequence, but try to use it sparingly, as it can start to sound amateur if it is used too often. An example of alliteration could be: “The big bad baby went boo hoo in her buggy” or “The wicked women wheeled past the winding hill.”, A key element of poetry is strong images. You can use imagery as a device in your writing, where you use words and phrases to create mental images for the reader. You can use other devices, like metaphor, simile, and description to form these images as well as sensory details. Strong imagery often plays off visual, tactile, auditory, and textural sensations.For example, rather than state, “The hills are green” you can imbue the line with strong imagery, “The hills are lush and thick with trees, bursting with deep green, peppered with bark and leaves.”

, Personification is a very common literary device where you attach human traits and characteristics to inanimate objects, phenomena and animals. This device can make your descriptions more creative and engaging for the reader.Examples of personification include: “the raging winds”, “the comforting fire”, “the stately alligator”, “the wise hippo”.

, Internal rhyme is done by creating a rhyme in one line of a verse. It usually occurs in the middle of the line, with the middle word rhyming with the end word to create a pleasing rhyming line. Internal rhyme can be a good device for adding rhythm and texture to your poetry without having to rhyme every line of the poem.For example, one of the more famous internal rhymes can be found in Coleridge’s “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner”, “We were the first that ever burst.” The middle word “first” rhymes with the last word “burst” to create an internal rhyme.
You can also use half rhyme or slant rhyme in your poetry. Slant rhyme is an imperfect rhyme, where the stressed syllables of the consonants at the end of a line match but the preceding vowel sounds do not match. For example, in the poem by George Wolff ""To My Wife"", slant rhyme is used: ""If love is like a bridge/or maybe like a grudge,/and time is like a river/that kills us with a shiver..."". ""Bridge"" and ""grudge"" almost rhyme but they are slightly imperfect and do not match, while ""river"" and ""shiver"" are perfect rhymes.Often, rhyme can be tricky to do effectively in patterns that do not usually contain rhyming, such as free verse. Rhyming can end up making a poem sound sing-song and trivial, which can detract from the impact of your poem. Try to do it sparingly and only if it is an essential element of your chosen form, such as sonnet or rhyming couplet form., Juxtaposition occurs when you place a person, concept, place, idea, or theme parallel to another. This device can be useful for highlighting the contrast between the two subjects or objects and compare them. You can use this device to deepen your exploration of a certain theme or idea.For example, if you are discussing how a subject is like the devil or possibly evil, you may contrast this by discussing a subject that is typically considered saintly or good. This could highlight the differences between the two subjects and deepen your descriptions of both subjects.

"
Use concrete words, rather than abstract words.,
Go for action verbs and strong adjectives.,
Avoid cliches.,
Create unfamiliar descriptions.",How to Write Your Best Poetry4," Abstract words are concepts or feelings that are vague and general, such as “happy”, “love”, “liberty”, “freedom”, and “hate”. Though these are interesting words, they are often too general and universal to carry a lot of punch. Concrete words describe a subject with sensory details, using descriptions that can be seen or felt. Concrete words often have a stronger impact on a reader because they paint a more detailed picture of what the poem is about.For example, you may have a line in your poem that contains abstract words: “She feels happy in the morning.” Adjust the line so you are using an object or scene that creates feelings of happiness. “Her smile is as wide as a sunflower early in the morning.” The line now contains concrete words that paint a clearer picture in the reader’s mind.

, Avoid weak verbs in your poetry, as this will only make your poems feel generic and lacking in personality. Action verbs will add energy to your poetry and help you create more detailed descriptions of your subject. Action verbs like “reveal”, “illuminate”, “compose”, and “define” can be used to replace weak verbs like “show”, “realize”, “discover”, “write”, and “note”.You should also try to always use strong adjectives in your poetry. Strong adjectives can help your poetry stand out and show that you are paying close attention to your use of language. Strong adjectives are different from base adjectives, as they emphasize the idea of “very”. For example, a basic adjective would be “ugly” and a strong adjective would be “awful” or “hideous”.
Often, weak descriptions contain adjectives that do not call on the senses or have any sensory detail. For example, ""the dress was a light color"" is difficult to picture as it does not have any sensory descriptions or strong adjectives. In contrast, ""the dress was milky blue"" uses sensory detail and strong, interesting adjectives that create an image in the reader's mind.
Look at a list of strong adjectives and use adjectives on the list to replace any weak adjectives your find in your poetry.

, It can be tempting to fall into cliches or familiar phrases and descriptions, especially because we tend to use cliches all the time in common speech. But cliches are often a sign of weak writing and should be avoided at all costs. Using cliches like “happy as a clam” or “blind as a bat” in your poetry will likely cause the reader to call into question your engagement with your subject matter and gloss over your writing.You can read lists of cliches so you can recognize them when you see them in your poetry. A good rule to recognizing a cliche is, if you have heard the phrase before or it feels familiar to you, it is likely a cliche. Replace any cliches you find with more nuanced and unique descriptions, as this will likely strengthen your poetry.

, Counter cliche, sentimental descriptions by going for the unusual or the unfamiliar in your poetry. Don’t be afraid to insert strange descriptors and interesting language in your poems, as this will help you avoid boring your reader.


One way to do this is to try to replace any familiar images in your poetry with the strangest images you can think of. Rather than say, “My mother wakes me up in the morning”, you may say, “My mother tickles the bottoms of my feet until I squeal.” The second description is more vivid and injects the unfamiliar into the typical image of being woken up for school in the morning.

"
"
Group lines in pairs.,
Make the paired lines rhyme with end rhymes.,
Use iambs.,
Place five iambs in each line.,
Close your lines.",How to Write a Poem in Heroic Couplets1," Grouping lines in pairs is referred to as a couplet. Couplets are two successive lines that belong together. They usually share the same idea and complete a thought.As an example is, ""Good nature and good sense must ever join; // To err is human, to forgive, divine."";
, This is also referred to as a rhyming couplet. A rhyming couplet is defined as a literary device that has two rhyming lines in a verse that have the same meter to form a complete thought.Look to Dr. Seuss for examples of rhyming couplets, like, “Fox in socks, our game is done sir. // Thank you for a lot of fun sir.”

, Iambs refer to a weak (unstressed) syllable followed by a strong (stressed) syllable, and vice versa. For example, in the word present, i.e., a gift, the first syllable “pre” is stressed while the second syllable “sent” is unstressed.However, you can find iambs in two words, as well. For example, “the herd,” where “the” is unstressed and the word “herd” is stressed.

, What makes a couplet heroic is that each line contains five iambs, also known as an iambic pentameter. Therefore, a heroic couplet must contain five of these two-syllable unstressed and stressed syllables, i.e., iambs, in each line. Here are two examples of an iambic pentameter with the stressed syllables italicized:“The herd of hertes founden is anoon,”
“With hey! go bet! prick thou! lat goon, lat goon!”

, Generally, heroic couplets have closed lines. Closed lines are lines that are end-stopped, or lines that finish a complete thought and punctuation. This is in contrast to open lines, also known as enjambment. Open lines are lines that end without punctuation, and/or without completing a sentence or clause.An example of closed lines are, “Miss Susie had a steamboat, the steamboat had a bell.”
An example of open lines are, “Miss Susie went to heaven // and the steamboat went to Hell-// O, operator...”

Look for inspiration in literature.,
Think about the emotions you want to express.,
Pick some objects to personify.,
Write down some words that can personify.,
Describe the objects as though they were people.,
Try positive and negative uses of personification.,
Choose your theme.,
Write a short personification poem.,
Try a longer poem.,
Think more deeply about what your poem says.",How to Write a Personification Poem," If you need some inspiration before you get going on the poem, a great place to start is in literature and poetry. Find a poem you like and go through it to identify instances of personification. Looking for examples of personification in a poem will help you learn how exactly personification works and the different ways it can be used to express emotion.


For example, you could look at William Wordsworth’s poem ‘I Wondered Lonely as a Cloud’.
In this poem you will read daffodils ‘Tossing their heads in a sprightly dance’.There are lots of easy to read personification poems online that you can look at for inspiration.;
, Once you have found some good examples, think about the way the poems use personification to express emotion. Dancing daffodils in Wordsworth suggest happiness and joy, but how can you use personification to express more negative emotions?

, Before you get started on your personification poem, it’s a good idea to spend a little bit of time getting to grips with how personification works. This will help you to ensure that you are completely clear on what it is and how you do it. Start by just writing down a list of around ten objects that you might like to personify in a poem. Some examples might include:


An animal, such as a cat or a dog.
A natural phenomenon, such as a cloud or a storm.
A geographical or geological feature, such as a mountain or a volcano.

, Once you have written down a list of things that you can personify, now you can write down a list of the ways in which you could describe objects or nonhuman things as people. For this you will need to write down human qualities, actions and characteristics that you find powerful or evocative. This might include:


Human expressions, such as smiling or frowning.
Human feelings, such as embarrassment or anger.
Human actions, such as dancing or running.

, When you have your two lists you can try to match up the objects with the words that can personify them. Depending on your lists you may have some odd combinations, but the important thing is just to learn the process of personification. Some possibilities based on the examples above include:


The cat was smiling at me.
The angry cloud moved closer.
The peaks of the mountains danced on the horizon.

, As you get the hang of personification you can think about the different ways you can use it to create an imaginative image or provoke a feeling. Attributing human qualities to nonhuman things often represents a positive or a negative association.For example, a smiling cat would normally be a positive friendly image.
The angry cloud, however, is a more negative and threatening image.
In this example, the cloud and the description of it as angry, work together to produce an image in your mind.
Write down a few examples of positive and negative personifications.

, Before you begin writing your personification poem, you need to choose your theme or topic. This could be absolutely anything you like. To get started you could pick one of the images from the two lists you made earlier. For example, the smiling cat, or the angry cloud.

, When you have chosen something, try to write a short poem about it. Remember that poems come in all shapes and sizes, and don’t have to rhyme. Don’t be afraid of messing it up, write down what comes into your head and then you can revise and edit it afterwards.


If you chose the angry cloud, you could write a few lines about watching an approaching storm.
It could start with a line describing seeing angry clouds rushing towards you.
Try to write at least four lines about watching a storm that personifies the weather.Then pick another of the images you wrote down earlier and write a short poem about that.

, After you have written a few shorter poems, you’ll be confident enough about personification to write a longer and more complex poem. This could have a longer narrative and involve more developed imaginative imagery. For example, you could extend the poem about the storm to include a section in which the storm passes on and the weather becomes calm again.


Remember to keep using words that personify nonhuman things.
In this example you might say that the angry clouds passed, and a bright blue sky grinned down at you.
You can use words that personify the weather after the storm in a positive way, which contrasts with the negative personifications of the weather during the storm.

, You can continue to develop your writing and your poetry by thinking more deeply about the emotions and experiences you are trying to express. Personification is such as major part of poetry and literature, because we find it easier to relate to something that has human traits.


Personification can also give deeper meaning to things that appear less meaningful from the outside.
Remember that we all look at the world through a human perspective, and personification works to creatively bring nonhuman things into that perspective."
"
Know your goal.,
Choose the right words.,
Be specific versus abstract.",How to Write a Poem in Heroic Couplets2," Before you start writing, ask yourself what you want your poem to do. Do you want your poem to protest a political injustice, describe an event in the world or in your life, or describe how beautiful or ugly something is? Once you know your goal, you can tailor your writing to that goal.Do not feel as if you have to choose profound material in order to write a poem. Instead, write about something you know well, that you have experienced first hand, or that is nearby. Remember that what makes a poem profound are hidden details and a unique perspective.
For example, ""Whilst doing a degree at Houston University, // In marine biology, Ken started to do archery, // Along with shooting which he took to more, // Until the world stage was an open door."", Choose words that accurately express a feeling, a texture, a smell, or a sound. You do not need to choose impressive or poetic words, but words that describe your subject matter.For example, if you are explaining light, there is a difference between “glowing” light and “glittering” light.
Be as descriptive as possible, but do not state the obvious. For example, if you mention fire, you do not need to say the hot fire because everyone knows fire is hot.

, Abstract words refer to concepts and feelings like liberty, happiness, love, and hate. On the other hand, specific or concrete words describe things that people experience with their senses like red, warm, and eerie.Use concrete words to help the reader get a “picture” of what the poem is talking about, for example, “The red, dusk sky mirrored the anger I felt.”
For example, ""The club is an athletics fields event, // But Emma did previously loudly tent, // Discus and shot put, and in Sochi 2008, // She came in 8th discus, shot put 7th gate."""
"
Use stanzas.,
Avoid clichés.,
Revise.",How to Write a Poem in Heroic Couplets3," In free writing, paragraphs are used to group ideas together. However, in poems, stanzas are used to group or organize ideas. Therefore, whenever you have a new idea, create a new stanza to express this idea., Clichés are phrases and ideas that have been repeated and used so many times that they lose all originality and freshness. Clichés can also refer to overused literary elements like overused plots, themes, and character types.Examples of clichés are, “crystal clear,” “busy as a bee,” “beet red,” and “sparkles like a diamond,” to name a few.
Instead, think of an original way to describe what the cliché is describing. For the “busy as a bee” cliché, think of other things that can describe or relate being busy, for example, a college student balancing school and a job.

, Once you have put all of your ideas down on paper, you will need to revise. When revising, look for common spelling and grammatical errors, as well sentence structure errors. Also, look for words that do not create an accurate description, and extra words that do not serve a purpose.Remove “poetic” words that are used just to impress the reader. These types of words create a sense of artificiality and insincerity in writing.

Poems can be about a variety of topics: love, loss, grief, excitement, joy. It can help to sit down and do a 10 to 15 minute free write. Think about what's meaningful to you, and just start writing.


You may start with a list. For example, you may ask yourself, ""What things are most meaningful to me?"" You may start writing, ""my family, my friends, my pet dog, sports, etc., etc.""
As you list topics, one may stand out to you as particularly meaningful. You may want to start talking about why that subjects means so much to you, what moments or images capture that meaning. For example, maybe grief is a major issue for you. You may want to jot down your experiences grieving, what you think it means to grieve, why the process is necessary, and so on.;
, If you want to write anything of meaning, reading is invaluable. Almost all poets speak in some kind of simile or metaphor, and most poems have some meaning under the surface. Before trying to write your own poem, read works by a variety of poets to help inspire you.


Read the kind of poems you want to write. If you're interested in free verse poetry, you can read the works of writers like TS Eliot, William Carlos Williams, and Ezra Pound.If you want more structured poems, look into sonnets like those written by Robert Lowell and John Berryman.Also, consider topic. If you're interested in nature poems, poets like Gary Snyder and Mary Oliver frequently write about nature.As you read, search for meaning. Try to see how the writers made their meaning apparent. Look for simile and metaphor. You may want to look online for analyses of poems you like. Reading literary analysis can help show you how poets create meaning with their words.

, Poetry is a vast art form. There are many different types of poems. Some, like the haiku or the sonnet, are more structured. Some, like free verse, tend to allow for less structure. Think about the type of poem you want to write before you begin.Some forms of poetry have strict requirements. Sonnets, for example, must have 14 lines of 10 syllables each. Other forms of poetry, like haikus and limericks, also come with strict structures.A strict structure can help you organize your thoughts, but also may constrict them.
Other structures, namely free verse, allow you to write poetry without a specific structure in mind. There is no set meter or rhyming patterns in a free verse poem.A free verse lyric poem could be helpful for writing something meaningful. Lyric poems are rhythmic, expressive poems in which a speaker expresses personal feelings.Even if you're not using a strict structure, poetry should have a musical flow. It's a good idea to track syllables and read the poem out loud as you go, making sure the rhythm you've established does not feel clunky., Poetry, like prose, is written from a specific point of view. The point of view is the lens through which a poem is told. The point of view you choose for your poem can help you convey your specific meaning.First person point of view uses words like ""I,"" ""me,"" and ""we."" It gives the sense the poet's narrator is speaking from direct experience. If you see yourself as the narrator of your poem, you may want to use first person. This can be especially helpful if your poem's meaning is very personal.
Second person point of view uses words like ""you."" It gives the reader the sense they're being addressed, or what's happening in the poem is happening to them. If you're trying to address readers in your poem, second person can be helpful. You can also use it to try to put readers in the moment, encouraging them to imagine the action is happening to them.
Third person uses pronouns like ""he/she"" and ""him/her."" You may be writing a meaningful poem about something you have not directly experienced, like a historical event for example. In this case, it may be appropriate to use third person to show the reader the narrator is an outside observer.

, Once you're ready to write your poem, you can start by establishing your theme. This will be an important tool to you as you write. From prewriting, you should have a sense of what you want to write about. Try to, in a single sentence, explain your message regarding that subject.Returning to an earlier example, say your topic is grief. You lost your mother when you were young, and you would like to write about what you learned from this experience. Your topic is grief, and your theme will be what you learned in the grieving process.
In a single sentence, try to write down what you're trying to say. This may take several attempts. It's okay to write a long paragraph at first, and then figure out how to boil down that meaning in a single sentence. Using the above example, you may end up with a sentence like, ""Grief can change over time, and even lessen, but it's something that never truly leaves someone.""

, You can bring out meaning in a poem by using simile and metaphor. Similes and metaphors are comparisons, in which one thing is compared to another. ""Your love is a red dress"" is a metaphor. A simile is a metaphor that uses ""like"" or ""as."" ""Your love is like a red dress"" is a simile.Comparison can help fuel the meaning of your poem. Returning to the example, think about what you're saying about grief. What metaphors or similes can you use to convey grief never ends?
You may be able to convey this by using a running metaphor in your poem. You can describe a long, winding road that becomes less harsh with time, but still remains. You can also use a simile. You can write a line that says something like, ""Grief is like a river that freezes each winter. Water changes form, but remains.""

, Images are a wonderful tool in poetry. A lot of feeling, emotion, and meaning is best conveyed through images. Sometimes, it's better to show your reader meaning through symbolic imagery than say it overtly. There are many different ways you can use images to convey feeling.Focus on a single moment. Maybe, returning to our grief example, you once watched a baby foal stand up for the first time. This can be used to show the difficulty to stand metaphorically after grief.
Describe something or someone. The more you describe certain images, the more meaningful they become. Think back to the grief example. If you're using a metaphor involving a long road, spend a lot of time focusing in on descriptions of that road. You can describe some parts of the road as light and easy, while others are dark and frightening. This helps show how grief changes, but still remains, and the fact the road is described in such detail will alert your readers to its importance.

, Writers borrow a lot from real life and use it to convey meaning. Some poems contain a bit of dialogue, and certain conversations can convey your meaning. If it helps, you can include snippets of conversation into your poem.You can include real life snippets of conversation. Using the example, you may want to include bits and pieces of conversations you had during your mother's funeral that were personally meaningful.
You can also use overheard bits of conversation. Maybe you were once at an airport and sat next to a couple going home for a funeral. You may remember their conversation, and may want to include this scene or conversation in your poem.

, Where you choose to break up lines in your poem can have a big impact on the poem's sound. This is particularly important for poems that do not rhyme, as the rhythm and musical nature of the poem is largely determined by line breaks. Line breaks can also help convey meaning.There are many ways you can use line breaks to emphasize meaning. A line break can indicate a change in thought. Each new line can be a new insight. In the above example, you can have each line break indicate a slight change in grief's form, introducing new images.
You should also pay attention to the sound produced by line breaks. The sound of a word that ends a line will stick out in a reader's mind. If you're trying to convey pain, choose hard words with hard consonants to end the line. If you're meaning to convey something tender, using soft consonants. Sounds like ""sh"", and words with vowels can help. This can mean words with many vowels, words that start with vowels, or words that end in vowels.

, Enjambment is continuing a sentence beyond the end of a line without pausing. You could break up a single sentence into two or more lines. Enjambment creates a kind of tension in the poem. As the readers move their eyes down the page, they must keep reading in order to understand what is being said. This keeps readers curious, but also creates a certain tension. You should use enjambment for lines that are particularly meaningful or important in your poem, as this will call attention to them.Let's return to the example. Your thesis is about how grief changes form, but remains. You could use enjambment when writing the line about the river, as this calls attention to this line. It creates a certain tension by spreading it out, making readers notice its importance.

, When writing a meaningful poem, you have a wide variety of literary techniques from which to choose. It can get overwhelming to manage. If you're feeling overwhelmed by a poem, try returning to your theme. Remember what you're trying to convey. This can help you if you feel lost, as you can take a minute and ask yourself what you can include to make your theme apparent.

, Cliche phrases are phrases that are overused to the point they lose meaning. You should avoid cliches in your poem, such as common comparisons. As you re-read the draft of your poem, watch for phrases like ""eats like a bird"" or ""tired as a dog.""When you spot a cliche, consider what it means. The phrase ""tired as a dog,"" for example, conveys a sense of exhaustion. Try to figure out a way to represent exhaustion that's more personally meaningful to you.

, It's okay to be sentimental in writing. In fact, it may even be necessary in a meaningful poem. However, excessive emotion may come off as dishonest to readers. You have to make sure the moments and images in your poem stand out on their own. Gong overboard with hyperbolic language can turn a reader off.Read through your poem and watch for areas where language seems over the top. If you're using very dramatic adjectives, like ""glorious"" or ""heart-wrenching,"" this may read as too sentimental.
Try to tone down sentimentality. It's good for a poem to be sentimental, and to have emotion. However, you want to lead readers to those emotions instead of forcing emotions on them. If you feel like some phrases are too overwrought, try rewriting them with less adjectives or hyperbole. You can also try conveying an emotion through an image instead.

, You should read through your poem and pause at each line. Ask yourself, ""Am I conveying what I want to convey here?"" Look for any words or images that do not match with your meaning. Even if you love certain lines, you should cut or alter them if they take away from your meaning.


Using the grief example, maybe you're trying to show the difficulty of the beginning of grief. You realize you talk a bit about sunshine and flowers, which are happier images. You may want to move those images to a later part of the poem, or omit them altogether.

, No poem is every complete after a single draft. If you want to write meaningful poetry, revision is necessary. Set your poem aside for a few days and let yourself get some space. Then, reread it and revise as necessary. You should also consider showing your poem to others and asking for criticism and feedback."

Find inspiration.,
Brainstorm around a particular theme or idea.,
Do a freewrite.,
Read poems written about angst.",How to Write Teen Angst Poetry1," You should start by finding inspiration for your poetry by drawing on your own experiences and feelings. Ask yourself, “What makes me angry in my life?” or “What moment or event triggered my confusion or frustration?” You could then focus on the moment or event in your poetry. Using your own experiences as inspiration will help you translate raw emotion and feelings down on the page.You may start by simply jotting down notes about your answers to those two questions. You may end up focusing on one particular event or moment in your life that you feel is significant. Or you may write about a series of events that lead to a pivotal, emotional moment in your life.;
, You may also get started on your poetry by brainstorming around a theme or idea that appeals to you. You may decide to write a poem about “angst” or be more specific and focus on “angst as a teenager girl” or “angst as a queer person of color.” You may then explore this idea and what it means to you in your poem.You can brainstorm by writing the main theme or idea of your poem on a piece of paper. You could then write words or phrases that come to mind around the theme or idea. Draw circles around the words and connect them to each other or list them in clusters around the main theme.
For example, if your main theme was “angst as a queer person of color” you may write phrases or words like “fear in a crowd of white, straight people”, “loneliness”, “otherness”, or “being proud and afraid at the same time.”

, You can also try doing a freewrite using a writing prompt. You may use a writing prompt that already exists or create your own prompt. Often, writing prompts will be in the form of a line or phrase that gets you thinking. You can then do a timed freewrite using the prompt as a starting point.For example, you may use the prompt, “I am feeling this angst because…” or “My most angst filled moment was…”. You may then set a timer for 10 to 20 minutes and write everything you can think of in relation to the prompt. Try not to lift your pen from the paper or read over what you have written.
Once the time is up, you may read over what you have written. Highlight or underline any words, phrases, or lines that inspire you. You may then use them in your poem.

, You may get started on your poem by first reading poems written about angst, sadness, anger, and loneliness. You can look for poems written by teens online or by poets who write about these themes. Several examples include:Ariel by Sylvia Plath.Howl by Allen Ginsberg.The Seven Stages of Being Lonely by Warsan Shire.Poetry on TeenInk.com.

Pick a certain time of day to write.,
Find a quiet, private space.,
Remove any distractions.",How to Write a New Poem Every Day1," You can motivate yourself to write a new poem a day by selecting a certain time of day for writing. You may set aside time early in the morning before you head to work or time at night after dinner, before bed. Try to pick a certain time and stick to it so you have enough time and focus to complete one new poem a day.For example, you may decide to write the poem early in the morning, from 7 am to 8 am. Giving yourself an hour time limit may help you get your words down on paper. Sticking to a consistent writing time every day will allow you to get into a routine and make it easier to get the poem done.;
, You should try to create a space that is suitable for writing so you are motivated to write one new poem a day.

Be honest and detailed.,
Include sensory descriptions.,
Add literary devices.,
Write for the ear.",How to Write Teen Angst Poetry2," When you sit down to write the poem or a series of poems in full, you should try to be as honest and detailed as possible. Though you may feel shame, fear, guilt, or anger about what you are writing about, know that poetry is a healthy outlet for these feelings. Let your creativity take over and try to be as honest about your feelings as you can on the page.You may be afraid of being too honest or raw in your poetry. But being honest and detailed will infuse your poem with energy and intent, drawing your reader into what you have to say.
Try to be graphic and detailed about what you are describing in your poem. For example, if you are describing a fight you had with your mother recently, be sure to include how you felt about the fight from your perspective and why the fight started. You may also include details about what it felt like to yell or scream at your mother.

, You should also have descriptions that focus on the five senses: sight, touch, taste, smell, and sound. Using sensory descriptions will help make your poem that much stronger and vivid for your reader.For example, if you are writing about a fight between you and your mother, you may focus on how it sounded to fight with her or how it felt. You may describe her screams as “vibrating in your ears” or her words as “painful daggers on my skin.”

, You should lean on literary devices like metaphor and simile to add more depth to your poem. Using literary devices will allow you to describe a moment or event in more detail. Try to use literary devices throughout your poem so it flows well and feels engaging on the page. You may use several literary devices, including:Metaphor: This device compares one object or subject to another object or subject in a surprising way. For example, “My mother’s screams were a tornado that swept up the house.”
Simile: This device compares one object or subject to another using “like” or “as”. For example, “I am as solitary as a bird on a wire” or “She was like a sudden storm on a sunny day.”
Personification: This device describes an object or idea using human qualities or attributes. For example, “The car was a real beauty” or “The pen leaped across the page.”

, Good poetry is written for the page and for the ear. You should write poems that appeal to the reader and the listener, as poetry is often read out loud. Focus on how you can create an interesting rhythm or flow to your poetry, especially when you are describing intense emotions. Writing for the ear can allow you to play with word choice, word order, and stanza breaks in the poem.For example, you may decide to put alliteration in one line of your poem, where consonant sounds are repeated in order. You may have the line, “She is a swift sight on the scene,” where the same consonant sounds are repeated in a row.
You may also try using assonance in your poem, where certain sounds are repeated in the vowels on a line or phrase. For example, you may have the phrase “a long song” or “a sudden sea.”
You can also play with stanza breaks, where you indent one line of the poem so there is a break or gap between two lines. This can force the reader to pause or take a breath when they are reading the poem. It can also help to highlight a certain phrase or word on the page.

Do an alliteration and assonance exercise.,
Play around with metaphors and similes.,
Use the poetry of others.,
Write a poem based on a song or a movie.,
Try a different poetic form.",How to Write a New Poem Every Day2," You can use this exercise to help you generate content for your new poem. This exercise is ideal for the challenge of writing a new poem a day as it is quick to do and can yield some interesting results.Alliteration is a literary device where words in close proximity to each other start with or contain the same consonant sound. For example, “a pretty picture” or “a scary scene.”
Assonance is a literary device where words in close proximity to each other have a similar vowel sound. For example, “a bent pen” or “a wise guise”.
Make a list of word pairs and phrases that include alliteration or assonance. For example, you may have one word pair that includes alliteration, such as “a pig pen”, and one word pair that includes assonance, such as “a wise guise.” Come up with ten word pairs that contain alliteration and ten word pairs that contain assonance.
Use these word pairs to create a poem. Play with the ordering of the word pairs and try to place them in an order that create an interesting image or an interesting series of sounds when read out loud.

, Choose a theme or idea that interests you, such as “birth”, “grief” or “friendship.” You can then do a writing exercise where you take two common literary devices, metaphors and similes, and center them around the theme or idea. Make a list of metaphors and similes that focus on the theme or idea. Then, order them to form a poem.Metaphors compare one object or subject with another object or subject. For example, “My love is an empty field.”
Similes use “like” or “as” to compare on object or subject to another. For example, “She was as fierce as a tiger on the hunt.”
For example, you may decide to do this writing exercise around the theme of “grief.” You will them make a list of metaphors and similes that focus on “grief.” Write a poem using this list and avoid naming the theme in the poem. The resulting poem should be ambiguous and intriguing for your reader.

, Look to the writing of others to motivate yourself to write a new poem once a day. You may find inspiration in the poems of your favorite poet or you may read published poems written about a certain theme or idea that you find fascinating. Try to expose yourself to the writing of others and use their work as a model for your own writing.For example, you may look up poems written in a certain poetic form, such as the sonnets of Shakespeare or the free verse poetry of Walt Whitman. You could then use their approach in your writing exercises as a model for your own sonnets or free verse poetry.

, As a fun writing exercise, you may also try writing a poem about a song or a movie. You may select your favorite song as inspiration for a new poem or a movie you saw recently. Consider how the song or movie touched you as a viewer and channel these emotions in your poems.For example, you may be inspired by a contemporary movie and write a poem from the perspective of one of the characters in the movie. You may use dialogue from the movie in your poem and describe a scene in the movie.

, You can also come up with new poems by playing around with different poetic forms. You may do a writing exercise where you tackle a new poetic form each day, resulting in a new poem. This may help you feel inspired and challenged as a poet.For example, perhaps you want to try writing a short poem once a day. You may try the haiku form, the cinquain form, or make a short shape poem.
You may also challenge yourself by writing a poem using a more complex poetic form, such as the sonnet form or the villanelle form.

Revise and edit the draft.,
Read your final draft to someone else before you hand it in.,
Feel free to express yourself, but don’t forget you are still writing a poem.,
Look at several examples of effective free verse poetry.,
Analyze the examples.",How to Write a Free Verse Poem," Maybe you’d like to write a poem about your new baby brother or your favorite pet rock. You can also focus on a specific event like your last birthday party, or a theme like love, anger, or sadness.


If you're having trouble choosing a subject, try closing your eyes and visualizing events, people, or objects that are meaningful to you. Select one that stands out, particularly if it is one that you have an emotional connection to.

, Are you going to write from a certain point of view, like first person or third person? Are you focusing on the specific scene or are you going to write more generally about a certain theme?


It can be helpful to decide ahead of time what you want to say about the topic; if writing about a beloved deceased pet, your goal may be to recapture the pet's personality and character in your poem.
You may also want to consider how you can choose certain wording or phrasing to describe the subject, situation, or theme you are trying to portray. If you are trying to describe a fight scene, for example, you may want to use short words with sharp consonants like cut, bash, hit, kick, punch, jab, jump. Keep in mind longer words with soft sounds, as well as breaks between lines or words, will cause the reader to slow down.

, Because you don’t need to be too worried about rhyming, meter, or structure, feel free to explore your topic and write down as many images and descriptions as you can think of.


For example, if you are describing your last birthday party, you may start by describing who was at the party, the gifts you received, and how you felt during the party. Or you may decide to write a poem about your pet rock and imagine how the rock would see the world.
If you’re stuck on how to describe a certain event or feeling, use sensory descriptions that explore sight, touch, taste, smell, and sound. So instead of simply writing, “I blew out the candles,” you may want to include sensory details like the heat of the candles on the cake, the smell of burning wax, and the way the candles on the cake looked right before you blew them out., Use the list of keywords to help you describe a scene or explore a theme. Focus on using devices like metaphor, simile, alliteration, and personification. These devices will help you to create a stronger, more effective free verse poem.Don’t worry too much about creating a perfect first draft, as you will edit and revise it in your next draft.

, Read your first draft out loud and take note of any lines or sections that have a certain rhythm or tone, as well as any lines where a word or phrase sounds off or flat.Look at places where you could expand or improve on a description. For example, instead of telling the reader, “they were happy” you could use a more visual description, such as “they were wearing big smiles.”
Also remember that poetry does not necessitate the use of complete sentences, so ""they were wearing big smiles"" might be shortened to ""wearing big smiles."" A poem can have logic without using complete sentences.
Think about how the breaks between words or lines affects the meaning of the poem. If you’re describing a roller coaster ride, maybe you want to play around with the line structure and have words move up or down the page. Or if you’re describing a moment where you felt trapped or claustrophobic, perhaps you want to condense the lines so they appear as one block of text., It can be difficult to view your poem with a careful eye, especially if you have been working hard on it and have created several drafts. So don’t be afraid to read it aloud to a willing audience and listen to their feedback.


The goal is to create a free verse poem that explores your subject or theme in a unique way that sounds good and has emotion or feeling. Be sure to ask your audience if they think your poem has all of these elements.

, Technically, there is no set structure to a free verse poem, as there are no rules around meter or rhyme scheme. So, you have the freedom to express yourself in almost any way you can imagine. But, some poets argue that the lack of rules can actually be more difficult and challenging, or as the poet Robert Frost describes the difficulty of composing a free verse poem, it’s like “playing tennis without a net.”Though there are no rules for a free verse poem, it is still a form of artistic expression, so its important to create striking images and emotions that your reader can see and feel and to express yourself clearly.

, Though free verse may not have been Robert Frost’s preference, many other poets have used the openness of the form to their advantage and have approached free verse poetry in their own unique ways. It may be useful for you look at several examples more closely, including:


""After the Sea"" by Walt Whitman""Little Father"" by Li-Young Lee""Winter Poem"" by Nikki Giovanni""Fog"" by Carl Sandberg""in Just-"" by e.e. cummings, Read the examples out loud and consider how they are effective. Do they have a certain rhythm or meter, despite appearing free verse and not using rhyme? Do they create strong images through description, word choice, or a certain mood or tone?


Identify any metaphorsor similes. Think about how they work effectively to reveal details or create images associated with the subject of the poem.
Make note of any examples of alliteration, which is a literary device where the first sound in a series of words is the same. Alliteration is one way the poet can create a particular mood, feeling, or sound to the poem.For example, in Whitman’s poem ""After the Storm"", there are two instances of alliteration in the first line of the poem, “sea-ship” and “whistling winds”, which then set the tone for the rest of the poem.
Identify any personification. Personification is a device that takes an inanimate object and describes it as though it were animate or alive.For example, in Sandberg’s ""Fog"", the fog is personified as having “little cat feet”, and in Giovanni’s ""Winter Poem"", the snowflake is personified as “happy” and the other snowflakes are addressed as “its cousins and brothers.”
Consider if the poem breaks with the traditional form of a line poem, and how the poem’s form adds to the overall meaning or theme of the poem. For example, in e.e. cumming’s poem ""in Just-"", the breaking up of the lines so there is more space between certain words and the arrangement of certain words so they move down the page suggest a certain choppiness or shift downward in the poem.

Select the person you’re composing the haiku for.,
Keep a goal in mind as you’re writing.,
Make a word cloud about your subject.,
Make word associations to build on your poetic theme.,
Use words from your word cloud to form sentences.,
Distill the information.,
Tinker with your lines to adhere to the 5-7-5 syllable structure.,
Reread your work to ensure it conveys the message you were hoping for.,
Print your Haiku out on nice paper.,
Find a good time to meet with your subject.,
Relay your message verbally when gifting your haiku.",How to Write a Haiku to Someone," Is this a poem for your mom for Mother’s Day? Or are you confessing your love to your best friend? Take a moment to identify the person who will be the subject of your writing, presumably also the person who will also receive the finished haiku.If you’re having trouble picking a subject, it can be helpful to pick someone close to you like a member of your family or a best friend.

, What is the objective of composing your haiku? Are you aiming to show overall affection or ask someone to go on a date? Keep your end goal in mind as you embark upon the writing process to ensure that your poem addresses what you hope to convey.


Haiku are often inspired by a particularly poignant moment or experience. Effective haiku condense a lot of sentiment and information in very few words.

, Before you actually start writing the haiku, you’ll need to get your feelings and ideas flowing. Try making a word cloud to begin accessing your deeper thoughts. You can write down ways the person makes you feel, important things you’ve done together or hobbies you share. For example, “swimming,” “eating fudge at the beach,” “love of outdoors,” or “our sense of humor.”


Some websites online can form a digital word cloud for you, if you’re having trouble doing it on your own. You can input text from some of your favorite correspondence into the word-cloud engine to see what words crop up frequently. , What words come to mind when you consider the theme of the poem? These words can be things you associate with the theme because of a memory or just ideas that echo one another. Make a short list to flesh out your poetic idea more fully.


If you want to write about why your sister is so courageous, for example, make a list of words and ideas around the theme of courage. So for your sister you might write down, “Joan of Arc,” “strength,” “facing her fears,” and “leap of faith.”, Once you’ve made a word cloud that encompasses some of your thoughts and memories surrounding your recipient, it’s time to begin writing. Compose some basic sentences based on the feelings you’ve brought forward. For example, “Your eyes are blue like a swimming pool,” or “I love laughing with you in the woods.”


Don’t be too critical of yourself at this point in the process. Your ideas aren’t fully formed just yet. It won’t all sound like poetry yet!
If you’re searching for some central point around which to focus your poem, look at all your sentences. Are they all about hiking together or playing at the beach? It can help to group similarly themed ideas together.
There’s no need to count syllables yet. You will work on that later in the process.

, Now that you’ve crafted a few sentences about your subject, it’s time to make them less prosaic and more poetic. To make your sentences more poetic, see if there is, at once, both a more simple and descriptive way to say something.For example, think about the sentiment behind your sentences. Behind, “your eyes are blue like a swimming pool,” you’re really trying to say that your recipient’s eyes remind you of water. A more poetic and succinct way to say that would be, “Your eyes, a vast sea.”
Use this technique to create three thematically related lines of poetry; don’t worry about the syllables just yet.

, The hallmark of the haiku form is the syllable structure. The first line has five syllables. The second line has seven syllables. And the last line has five syllables again.


If you have trouble counting syllables, place your hand under your chin. Read a given line. Your mouth will generally drop with every syllable. So every time your mouth drops and hits your hand, count that as one syllable.It may be helpful to write the number of syllables you currently have in each line at the end of the line.
If you need to trim words to get to the right syllables count, try cutting articles and adverbs, which can weigh down poetry. If you need to inflate the number of syllables, adding a descriptive adjective can help.For example, “Your eyes, a vast sea,” could become “Your eyes, a vast turquoise sea.” The adjective turquoise helps the line reach seven syllables and adds meaning.
For example, “Swimming quickly is a joy,” can be cut down to five syllables easily by removing the adverb quickly, which is not adding much meaning.

, When you’ve completed your work, review the entire haiku to ensure it matches up with what you set out to do. If you’re using the haiku to ask someone to prom, for example, does it actually ask the question and accomplish that goal? If you’re using the haiku to tell your mother how much you love her, does some version of mom or mother appear, so she knows it’s about her?


If your haiku doesn’t accomplish your objective yet, don’t panic! Just go back to tinkering with your syllables. Perhaps you can swap out a word or two to make your message clearer. Haiku are short, so even changing one word can have a big impact on the final poem.

, Haiku are a timeless art. You can of course send your finished haiku over email, but for more impact, consider printing your haiku on nice paper so it can be saved as a keepsake. Your recipient will be more likely to cherish it for years to come.

, It’s hard for someone to appreciate a gift as thoughtful and time-filled as a haiku if you catch them at an inopportune moment. Ask your recipient to lunch or find a quiet time where they are not distracted for your poem to have the most impact., Haiku are very personal gifts one doesn’t receive every day. To ensure the message behind your haiku comes through, you could say, “I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you this Mother’s Day,” or “I wanted to ask you to prom on Saturday.”"

Do a substitution poem.,
Create a collage poem.,
Make a “misheard” poem.,
Do a “translation” of someone else’s poem.,
Make an alphabet poem.,
Read examples of surrealist poetry.",How to Write Surrealist Poetry1," You can try a popular surrealist poetry prompt called “substitution” to get create your poem. This prompt requires you to use a source text, such as a poem that has already been published, your own poem, or another text that is at least one page long. You may use a source text like a medical text or an advertisement page as long as there is enough text on the page.Start by taking the source text and putting blanks in place of three to four words in each line. Note the part of speech of each word under each blank, such as “present tense verb” or “present tense adjective.” Then, fill in the blanks without trying to recall the original content. You can also use a dictionary to randomly flip to words for the blanks or a random parts of speech generator online.
Another way you can do a substitution is to do a “7 up or 7 down”. You would count 7 up or 7 down from the first word of the sentence and substitute that word. You may follow the same 7 up or 7 down pattern in the poem to create a system of substitution or do both options at the same time in the source text.
You can also approach a substitution prompt by replacing words in the source text with words that exist in the text already. You may increase the number of words you replace in each line as you go through the text or decrease the number of words you replace.;
, A collage poem, also called a cento poem, is made of phrases that have been lifted or sourced from other texts. You may use one source text or multiple source texts, such as magazines, advertisements, manuals, dictionaries, blogs, or newspapers. You could then pull one line from each source to create a collage poem.Another way you can make a collage poem is to actually cut out the words in the source texts and paste them on to another page. You may choose a specific order for the cut out words or position them on the page at random., This prompt is ideal if you are looking for ways to pull source material from things you hear. The idea is to write down things you mishear throughout the day, such as song lyrics, conversations, news headlines, menu items, and public service announcements.You may sit in a public place, such as a busy park or a shopping plaza, and write down things you hear around you. Don’t worry about getting the details right, as you want to try to include things you mishear or words you hear incorrectly around you.
You may then compile a list of misheard words and phrases from the day and position them in the form of a poem. You may repeat certain misheard words throughout the poem to create a pattern or organize them by the misheard words from the beginning of the day to misheard words at the end of the day.

, Another popular surrealist poetry prompt is doing playful “translations” of an existing text. You may take a published poem or a poem by a friend and translate it. You could also use a poem of your own, though you may find it challenging to distance yourself enough from the material to translate it.Start by translating the poem from “English to English” by substituting a word for a word, a phrase for a phrase, and a line for a line. Create your own substitutions or use a dictionary to find synonyms for the existing words.
You can also try translating the poem into another literary form, such as translating a sonnet into a free verse poem or a rhyming poem into a shape poem. You could also translate the poem into a different language, introducing slang or vernacular into the poem.

, You can try using the English alphabet as a prompt for a surrealist poem. This is a fun prompt that seems simple but can lead to some interesting results, especially if you want to write a long form poem.You can start by writing down all 26 letters of the alphabet. Then, write a poem where each words begins with the letters of the alphabet, in sequence. For example, “A Baby Cow Died Every Friday…” You can also try starting each line of the poem with the letters of the alphabet, in sequence.
Once you have written the alphabet poem following the alphabet in sequence, you can try going backwards or scrambling the letter order and writing a new poem with the new order.

, You can find inspiration for your surrealist poetry by reading well known examples of the genre. Some of these surrealist poets use poetry prompts and some use word games. Several examples include:


“Three Centos” by Kate Fagan.Jack Sweeney’s translation of Donne’s “Love's Deity.”Soliloquy by Kenneth Goldsmith.“Alphabet Poem” by Edward Lear."

Play surrealist word games to create poems.,
Do the “exquisite corpse” word game.,
Try the “opposites” word game.,
Do the “definitions” word game.,
Perform the “tactile” word game.",How to Write Surrealist Poetry2," You can generate content for your surrealist poems by playing word games that are popular among surrealist poets. These games can act as prompts for your writing and also allow you to create content in a surrealist way.


You may play several word games with other poets as part of a brainstorming session or play the games with a writing partner. You can also do one of these games as a warm up before a writing session on surrealist poetry to get your creative juices flowing.

, This word game is a fun, popular way to create surrealist poetry. It is best done with at least one other person or two to four people. You can start the word game by choosing a word at random in a dictionary or by coming up with a word or phrase on your own.You would then write the line, phrase, or sentence on the top of a sheet of paper. Then, fold down the paper so the text is hidden. Pass the paper to the player on the left.
The next player is not allowed to view the first line. They will add a line inspired by the prompt and then fold down the paper to hide the first two lines. Then, they will pass the paper to the next player on the left.
This continues until the paper has been passed to each player or until you all feel the poem is complete. Then, the starting person unfolds the poem and reads the finished work out loud.

, This word game can be done using postcards with printed images on them. Try to choose images that can be open to interpretation. Place each image a folder or envelope and hand them out to the players.Have the first player write a statement about their image on a piece of paper. Then, have the player pass the paper to their right. The next player will then write a statement that is the opposite of the first statement and fold over the paper to hide the first statement.
The next player will then pass the paper to their right again and write a statement that contradicts the previous statement. Then, they will fold the paper so only the most recently written statement is visible.
The starting player then adds a final line to the paper and reads out the finished opposites poem.

, This word game is fun to play on your own or with several participants. You can create a deck of prompt words pulled from a source text or a dictionary. Try to use words that represent objects that might be strange or unfamiliar to the players.Begin the game by selecting an “object word” from the deck of prompt words. Then, have all the players spend about five minutes compiling a list of possible words that could be found within the object word. Try to have 15 words per player for the object word.
Share the “discovered” words with the players. Then, have the players create new definitions for the “object word” using the “discovered” words.

, This game will require you to hide different objects in boxes. Look for objects that have interesting textures and patterns. Set up five boxes with one object per box on a table. Make a small hole in the boxes so the players can place their hand in the box.Allow each player to touch each object in the box. Then, give the players five minutes to create a list of descriptive words about each object. Make sure the players focus on describing the size, color, texture, and density of the objects.
You can then have all players do a freewrite of one object for 10-15 minutes using the list of descriptive words. You can then have each player read out their freewrite. Each player has to guess what the object described is based on the freewrites.

Sit in a dark, quiet room.,
Choose a letter of the alphabet to focus on.,
Focus on the act of writing, rather than what you are writing down.,
Read over your automatic writing.",How to Write Surrealist Poetry3," You should create a dark, quiet environment for the automatic writing session, free of distractions. Automatic writing is a popular surrealist technique that allows the writer to create text spontaneously, without overthinking or analyzing the text. This technique is supposed to help the writer access the subconscious mind.You can also put on music in the darkened room to help inspire your writing. You may choose classical music that could trigger certain emotions or feelings. Often choosing music without words can be less distracting during the writing sessions.

, You may then choose a letter to begin the first line of the text or limit yourself to using a certain letter to start each sentence. If you are writing with others, you may all agree to use the same letter for the automatic writing session.You can also use a writing prompt to get you started on the automatic writing session. You may set a timer for 10 to 15 minutes so you do not have to keep an eye on the time and can pay attention to just writing.

, Unlike traditional free-writing, automatic writing is all about trying to focus on the act of writing rather than what you are writing down on the page. Try to give yourself up to your subconscious and avoid reading back what you have written down or analyzing the words as you write.It may help to focus on the music playing the background to help distract your mind from trying to control your writing. Think about how the music sounds as you write and let the words simply flow on the page.

, Once your timer goes off, you should finish your last sentence. Then, read over your automatic writing. It may come across as gibberish or one long, strange sentence. Think about certain word combinations you made in a certain sentence or the sound of several lines when they are read together. Try to look for patterns, moments of strong description, and elements of a story or a character in the automatic writing.Do not be too disappointed if you do not notice any clear images or a cohesive story in the writing. Automatic writing is more about letting your subconscious run free on the page and often you may be surprised or amused by the results.

Put your fears aside, and get ready to pour out your heart.,
Sit somewhere quiet, where you can be alone with your loving thoughts.,
Put pen to paper and let the words come to you.,
Keep it simple.,
Give it as a gift, and wrap it up nicely.",How to Write a Good Love Poem to Your Loved One," There should be no reason to fret about how eloquent your love poem is, because your emotions are all that count to the person you love.

, As you write a love poem, it is important to stay on track and avoid distractions. Once your words begin to flow, you don't want to be interrupted with mundane tasks.

, It is not necessary to write a love poem that rhymes, so if you have a free verse in your heart, then write it down that way. Think of how the person makes you feel, and write about it. Ask yourself questions about who they are, how they view the world and how they change your world for the better.

, Don't try to make your love poem sound smarter than it should. Don't look for large vocabulary words or use a thesaurus. Just write your feelings out in an uncomplicated manner when you write a love poem. Your succinct feelings pack the most punch. Simply tell him how you feel when you are away from him, and how you feel when you are together. Tell him all the things you would say in person if you had the time to put the words together in the right way.Read it out loud as your write your love poem. This is important, because more important than a rhyming poem, is a poem that has good strong rhythm throughout. This means that as you read you should feel a rhythm in your voice that stays through the entire reading.

, When you write a love poem for Valentine's Day or a birthday, you should make it look pretty on nice paper, and wrapped in a nice little box. The presentation is not vital, but it adds something special to your words and present.

Let the first line in the poem be a single word.,
Follow with two adjectives in the second line of the poem.,
Put three participles (verbs) in the third line of the poem.,
Fit in four nouns, or a larger phrase, in the fourth line.,
Choose three more participles.,
Choose two more adjectives.,
Finish your diamante with a final noun.",How to Write a Diamante," Start off with either a noun or a pronoun, like ""Home"" and let the first word describe what you want to talk about for the next two or three lines.

, If your diamante started off with ""Home,"" you might choose two adjectives like ""safe"" and ""warm."" These adjectives describe feelings associated with home.

, Participles are verbs that end in -ing, like ""relaxing,"" ""sleeping,"" and ""playing.""

, You can do the fourth line of a diamante in two different ways:


Four nouns: ""security,"" ""food,"" ""comfort,"" and ""repairs.""
A phrase or two that's longer than the next biggest line: ""There's no place like home.""

, Choose whether you want your diamante to be a synonym or an antonym poem. A ""synonym"" means another word meaning the same thing. An ""antonym"" means another word meaning the opposite of the word.


Synonym participles: ""living,"" ""breathing,"" ""being.""
Antonym participles: ""bustling,"" ""grating,"" ""tiring.""

, Again, if your diamante is going to be an antonym poem, you want to choose adjectives that describe the opposite of the first word. Adjectives like ""stressful"" and ""sleepless"" might work.

, If you were writing an antonym diamante and started off with ""home,"" your last word might be ""city.""

Type your poem into the word processing software.,
Change the font size and spacing to fit your image.,
Select a font, font size, and color for your poem.",How to Write a Concrete Poem," Pick an object to be the subject you write about. The object needs to be something you can draw a picture of. Many different objects will work for creating a concrete poem.Choose your favorite animal.
Pick a mode of transportation.
Use a common object like a star, heart, rainbow, or sun.
Choose a holiday object.;
, When you’ve decided on the object to write about, you need to choose a shape to represent this object. For example if you’ve decided to write about a dog, you can choose the shape of a dog or a dog bone. If you’ve chosen to write about a common object like a star, then your shape would be a star. You can use several shapes if it helps you depict your object. For example, if you write about an airplane taking off, you can have several airplane shapes that get higher on the page to show an airplane taking off.


Your shape can also contrast the meaning of your poem; a poem about life might be in the shape of a tombstone. A poem about hate could be in the shape of a heart.
Be creative to allow the shape and the words of your poem to create a whole picture that has more meaning than either would individually.

, Use a pencil to draw the shape or shapes onto two pieces of paper. One will be a rough draft, and the other will be a final draft. Try to center your shape on the paper. The shape should be large so you can fit your entire poem inside of it. Just draw an outline of the shape, don’t color it in., Think about the subject of your poem and make a list of any word that comes to mind when you consider your topic. Include words that are opposites of your topic to create contrast and paint a full picture of all the things that you imagine related to your topic, both good and bad.Don't worry about composing lines yet; just create a list of anything that comes to mind.
Include phrases that may become lines of the poem when you are brainstorming.

, Poetry is an art form; let your words paint a picture for the reader. Try to use descriptive language and words with meanings that can be interpreted in multiple ways.Similes and metaphors often help poets describe feelings or events.
Use words that can have multiple meanings to allow your reader to question the purpose of the poem.

, Don't be afraid to rearrange your thoughts as you are composing your poem. Often times the first line you think of may become the last line in the poem.


Consider the feeling each line evokes as you create your poem.
Think about the setting or mood you are trying to create with your poem. Try to take the reader on a journey of the mind to fully develop the idea of your poem.

, Most poems contain a rhythm or cadence in the lines. Speak the lines out loud to hear how they sound. Adjust the number of syllables and where the line breaks occur to create a flow that is pleasing to the ear.Consider using rhyming words to end each line.
The emphasis of certain syllables in words helps to create the rhythm of the poem; listen to how each word sounds with the words around it.

, Start by writing the poem down on paper without trying to make it into a shape. Write your poem down, and then read it back to yourself. If you don’t like it, keep changing it until you get the poem you like. It may take several revisions before you have your final copy., Use one of your drawn shapes to create a rough draft of your poem. You can use the words in your poem to fill your shape to create the picture, or you can write the words around the outline of your shape to create the picture.If you fill the shape with words, make sure the words on the ends of each line line up with the outline of your shape. This will make the lines of the poem create the outline of your shape.
If you write the words around the outline of the shape, make sure your poem extends around the entire outline of your shape. If your poem is too short to make it all the way around, you can either make your shape smaller or make more space between each word.

, When you have a rough draft that you’re happy with, it’s time to make the final copy. Use the other shape you’ve already drawn to make the final copy. Make sure to match your rough draft exactly to end up with the final copy like you want it. Use a pencil to write the poem onto the paper so you can erase any mistakes. When you have the entire poem written in the shape, you can go over the pencil with a pen or permanent marker. Then, use an eraser to erase any stray pencil marks.

, Insert an image on your document file using clip art. An outline image that is in the shape you want to use works best.


Set the image fill to your desired color. A white background works well to type over.
Make sure your font color is set to a contrasting color for your shape’s background. If you fill in the shape with a dark color, consider using a white font color so your words pop.

, When an image is inserted into a word processing document you can select different ways that the text is incorporated around or into the image.When using Microsoft Word select the Page Layout Tab.
Highlight the image or shape your poem will be in.
Set the image to appear behind the text you are typing.

, Type your poem over the image you have inserted into the document.


Use the Tab key, spacebar, and enter key to separate lines of the poem according to your desired shape.

, Use different sizes of fonts to fill your image appropriately. You may want to make certain words larger than others to help make your poem take on its final shape.

, Once you have the words and the image in place, you can experiment with different fonts, colors, and sizes to achieve the desired look.


Use different colors to highlight the final words of each line and accentuate the shape of your poem.
Try using bold type face or different sizes to create the shape of the poem.

Identify the prose you want to use.,

Select a sentence of prose about the subject matter.,
Revise the sentence so it highlights the powerful idea.,
Continue selecting and revising sentences from your prose.,
Rearrange statements as required.,
Present the universal truth in one line.,
Keep tinkering with your poem.",How to Turn Prose Into Poetry1," Before you can turn prose into poetry, you need the prose. It can be something you’ve written personally (e.g. stories, essays, articles, etc.) or it can be a selection from another author. However, regardless of who wrote the prose, it should have the following criteria:The prose should have a clear topic, theme, or subject.
The prose should present a strong emotion, insight, or analysis.;
, You may not be able to keep the title used for the prose, or the selection you’ve chosen may not have a specific title. Either way, you need to create a title for the poem that foreshadows the subject of your prose (and eventually your poem)., Start by selecting the first sentence of the prose that relates to the subject, topic, or theme. While you do not have to go in the same order as the prose is written, you may find it easier to do so, especially if it tells a specific story.For example, the following sentence from Michael J. Bugeja’s article “Writing through Littleton” — Pundits tell us to lose the guns and hire more armed guards, blaming or pardoning parents in interactive debates. — could be used as a starting point.

, The next step is to take the prose sentence and change it around so the subject, theme, or topic is more powerful and pronounced. This revision should also include breaking the sentence into multiple pieces (if needed). Whether you keep one sentence, or break it into multiple sentences, each sentence needs to begin and end with a noun, adjective, or verb.As a refresher: A noun is something that is a person, place, thing, animal, or idea. An adjective is a describing word used to qualify a noun (e.g. great, deep, little, bad, etc.). A verb is a word that describes an action (e.g. talk, advise, hire, lose, etc.).
For example, Michael J. Bugeja’s revised one sentence from his article “Writing through Littleton” to read as follows for his poem titled “Littleton"":

The cable aftermath of talking heads
Advising us to hire more armed guards
To lose illegal guns. Bulletins bombard



, After you’ve revised the first sentence of your prose into one or more lines of poetry, keep going. Select the next sentence you want to revise and so on. Don’t stop until you feel your poem is complete.There’s no rule as to how short or how long the poem has to be, but the end should produce some sort of universal truth.

, Simply translating your prose sentences into poetry statements may not be enough. You may now need to go back through your poem and rearrange where the statements appear. You may also have to add statements that help move the poem forward, but may not have been in the original prose.Again, there’s no rule as to when the poem is done, only that all the statements lead to an end that presents a universal truth.

, To end the poem, express the universal truth you’ve been working towards as one sentence. Imagine it like a punch line at the end of a joke — it has to make sense and put the whole poem into perspective.For example, in Michael J. Bugeja’s poem “Littleton,” his last sentence and universal truth was simply When news was truth and not reality. This one sentence sums up the truth of the poem which focused on the media coverage of the Columbine tragedy.

, If you aren’t satisfied with the initial outcome of your poem, continue to work with it. Add, remove, and revise statements until they have a continuous rhythm and tell the ‘story’ you’re looking to tell.The end result of your poem doesn’t have to be exactly like your prose. The prose was simply a starting point.

Propose your analysis.",How to Understand Poetry," If you are a student trying to pull out literary devices to gain an understanding of the mechanics of a poem, your definition will be very different from someone who is simply reading for enjoyment.


Generally speaking, the ""meaning"" of a poem isn't a singular thing, but is instead an interpretation formed by the reader and supported by the text.;
, If you are a student in a class on poetry, or studying a unit on poetry in your literature class, your goal will likely be outlined by your teacher or professor. If you are reading the poetry of a favorite author for fun, your goal might be to understand that author's point of view.


Speaking broadly, the goal of the academic study of poetry is to understand the poem critically through the use of literary devices (sometimes called literary terms). By using these established tropes, or patterns, you can support your opinions and interpretations.Musicians' goal may be to gain a better understanding of prosody, which is the rhythm and patters of stress in language. Many kinds of poetry fall into specific stress patterns, also called prosodic patterns. By understanding how systems of sounds work together, a musician can more intentionally craft lyrics to fit sound.

, While you probably won't need to be armed to the teeth with an understanding of literary devices to enjoy reading poetry, a little knowledge can shed considerable light on the poem you are reading. The following terms and descriptions are commonly occurring literary devices that might be useful to you:


Allusion - a figure of speech the author uses to refer to a specific thing, event, place in a passing reference.
Diction - the choice of wording or particular expressions that an author chooses in his work.
Foreshadowing - clues that hint at future events in the author's writing.
Form: the distribution of elements in a poem, sometimes regulated by rules of structure, sometimes free and irregular.
Imagery - the use of words and phrases, as chosen by an author, to evoke a mental picture in the mind of the reader.
Metaphor - the comparison of two distinct subjects, as in: the world is a stage.
Personification - the attachment of human traits to something not human.
Point-of-view - the angle of perception through which the writing unfolds, in many cases, completely separate and different from considerations of the author.
Rhyme - the repetition of the same or similar sounds in two or more words.
Simile - the comparison of two distinct subjects using the words like or as, as in: she was built like a refrigerator., Each literary device that you notice will give you an opportunity to apply a question to the poem. Why has the author chosen this particular technique? Why did he decide on this choice of words? Why did he use this particular metaphor in this particular place?

, You don't need to read an Emily Dickinson biography to understand and enjoy her poetry. But by knowing the time period she lived in and the highlights of her career, you will be able to think about things from her perspective better. This improves your chances of understanding., A pencil or pen and paper will allow you to record your impressions, jot down unfamiliar words, and mark passages that might be difficult for you to understand. This can also be helpful for highlighting and remembering literary devices while reading.

, You may be the type that can focus best in well lit, public areas, like a park or coffee shop. Or maybe you need absolute silence, dim lighting, and the privacy of your home. In either case, a prime location will help you do your best at puzzling out the meaning of a poem.

, Titles can be very misleading, and what you might have suspected the title to indicate before you read the poem might change considerably afterwards. Note any impressions you have, potential double or hidden meanings, and potential inferences.

The title of William Blake's The Book of Urizen is, at first glance, perhaps a book belonged to someone or thing called ""Urizen."" However, thinking about that name with regard to pronunciation, the title could be conceived as a book of ""Your Reason"" or ""You're risen.""

, That's right - don't allow anything to distract you. Don't stop to look up a word, don't distract yourself by stopping to figure out the rhyme scheme. Read the poem start to finish without a pause in between.

This is for many reasons:

Poetry, even poetry that doesn't rhyme, is usually written with a certain rhythm in mind. Stopping mid-read to look something up can disturb your sense of the poem's rhythm.
Poetry is a highly inventive medium, with some poems like Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky being almost completely constructed out of ""nonsense"" words.Stopping to look up a word no only interrupts, it might also be fruitless.
Imagery is often in sequence, the language of a poem leads the reader through images from start to finish. You may miss something important if you distract yourself.The context of a poem will frequently reveal the meaning of even obscure words. Have faith in your mind's ability to use context clues; this is good intellectual exercise.

, Now that you've read the poem all the way through, writing any intuitions you might have can be very helpful in guiding your poetic investigations. Does anything seem strange or out of the ordinary? Is there a place where the rhythm seems unnatural? These may all be indications from the writer of something significant.Take inventory of the obvious literary devices you noticed. Now that you've read the poem all the way through, why do you think these were used over other choices?
With relation to the choices of the author, also ask yourself, ""Why here? Why in this particular place did the author use this technique?""

, At this point you can crack open your dictionary (or power on your computer) and start digging for meaning. Try to use a dictionary that includes information supplemental to the mere definition; etymology (the origin of the word) and the first known usage of that word can provide you clues for your investigations.

, Likely, during your reading, a particular part or parts will have struck you as being more important than the rest. What supports this inkling of yours? What literary devices surround these parts? Do they attract or detract focus from these? Any unsubstantiated feeling you have, especially in an academic setting, will likely result in a poor grade. You must build an argument to support your position if your peers or instructor are going to take you seriously., Think of all the literary devices you've discovered on your first reading and think about these in terms of the entire work. How do these move the poem forward from beginning to conclusion?


As an example: ""Earth was not, nor globes of attraction. / The will of the Immortal expanded / Or contracted his all flexible senses. / Death was not, but eternal life sprung."" ~ Book of Urizen, 36 - 39.
This stanza represents an idyllic state, alludes to the biblical story of Genesis and paradise before the fall, and the ""Immortal"" might be symbolic of man, or man before gaining the faculty of reason. With this information, you can conclude that Blake was likely hinting at this being a book about ""Your Reason"" in the title.

, Now that you've thought of things in terms of the ""big picture,"" look at the parts you've deemed significant and the elements surrounding these. How do the tiny building blocks of words work together to form a grand metaphor? This, too, can be illuminating.

As an example: ""Earth was not, nor globes of attraction. / The will of the Immortal expanded / Or contracted his all flexible senses. / Death was not, but eternal life sprung."" ~ Book of Urizen, 36 - 39.
Reading this section closely, it is strange that the ""Immortal"" is given god-like powers by existing when ""Earth was not, nor globes of attraction,"" in addition to being a capitalized term. It is notable that the later pronoun (his) is not capitalized, as one might expect from the god-figure of text imitating Genesis (biblically, God and God-referring pronouns are capitalized). You might surmise this contradiction of terms was intended for a purpose, possibly because the ""Immortal"" is not really God, but man, who has qualities like God, as man was made in God's image in Genesis. However, man, trapped in his body and five physical senses, cannot expand or ""his all flexible senses,"" like he might have been able to before birth.

, You've got a big picture. You've got a basic understanding of the flow of the writing. You know the uncommon words and you've started thinking about the mechanics of the poem - it's time to read it again!Search actively while you read for missed signs, literary devices, or quirks that might indicate the author is trying to get your attention.

, At this time you should have a great deal of material to work with. You'll likely have several literary devices you've identified, each with varying degrees of frequency and intensity within the text. From among the list of literary devices, choose the strongest candidates.In Blake's The Book of Urizen, you can find allusion, free rhythm, metaphor, symbolism, foreshadowing, paradox, enjambment, anastrophe, etc. Of these, you might decide the most productive are: allusion, metaphor, and symbolism.

, By looking at the big picture, identifying literary devices and how these are used in the poem, and reading the poem start to finish, you should have some idea of the purpose the author had in writing the poem. It's time for you to put this in words.In some cases, this might be something as simple as ""He was trying to show off his abilities as a rhymester."" But you will need to use the information in the poem, the words and mechanics, to back up your opinion.
Whatever the purpose may be, you are looking for a unifying principle throughout all aspects of the poem, like: the worth of fidelity, love conquers all, the evil of war, the good of man.

, If the author's choice of words didn't flow, or if his choice of words were truly meaningless, the poem probably wouldn't have been published. How do the words in the poem drive and substantiate the purpose you've uncovered? This will give significant support to your analysis.Blake's choice of the name ""Urizen"" in The Book of Urizen seems to indicate strongly that the purpose of the poem is to critique human reason and its limitations. His choice of strongly religious diction (""Seven deadly Sins of the Soul"" 74, ""... and on / This rock..."" 75 - 76, ""One King, one God, one Law,"" 84) colors the poem with religious overtones. These factors call into question man's reason, which is generally accepted as a good thing, and illustrates reason as a limitation of the soul in a story that parallels man's fall from grace (or fall into the trap of reason).

, Now it's time for you to add the few, strong literary devices you choose from the poem to the conversation. How do these specific characteristics add to the purpose of the piece? Can you find any inconsistencies?The symbolism and metaphors, existent throughout The Book of Urizen, serve as a way of talking about ""your reason"" indirectly. The ""Immortal,"" if it is man before becoming limited by his senses, is a metaphorical judgement of reason, showing that free of it human powers might be almost god-like. The symbolism of Genesis, in particular man's fall from grace, paint the concept of reason in a negative light, which supports the idea that Blake is criticizing it.

, If the language in the poem and the strong literary devices you've found in the piece don't consistently substantiate the purpose of the poem, you have two options:


Revise your proposed purpose of the poem so that it meets and unifies the elements in it.
Devise a reasonable explanation, including a counterargument, as to why the inconsistency or inconsistencies exist.

, This will form the basis of your understanding of the poem. Now that you've discerned the poem on a minute and overarching level and used its own structure and internal elements to support your reasoning, you have accomplished a well reasoned understanding of the poem.


If you are reading poetry for pleasure, you needn't propose anything to anyone. After you've come to your conclusion, rest easy knowing that you've applied sound logic to the poem in a way that has expanded your understanding.

Pick 50 to 100 words of prose that you really like.,
Write the 50 to 100 words down on a piece of paper.,
Remove all the dull, boring, bad, unnecessary, or offensive stuff.,
Do not add your own words.,
Read your found poem out loud.,
Add a title to your found poem.,
Rewrite or retype your poem with embellishments.",How to Turn Prose Into Poetry2," These 50 to 100 words can come from one items or multiple items. They can come from prose you wrote, or prose you’ve read written by someone else. The only criteria is that they be 50 to 100 words that you like and interest you.Some ideas for where to get the words: excerpt from a book, something you’ve heard someone say, a few sentences from a newspaper article, quotes from famous people, bulletin boards, menus, maps, obituaries, junk mail, etc.

, Start by writing down all the prose you’ve found. Write it out so there’s lots of space in-between lines for editing and writing notes.It might help to use pencil at this stage so you can easily erase and rewrite items if you want.

, Go through the prose you’ve written down and remove anything you don’t like. Your goal at this stage is to remove about half of the words you’ve written down. If you wrote down 50 words, reduce it to 25 words. If you wrote down 100 words, reduce it to 50 words.If it helps, feel free to change the punctuation.

, Unlike other methods for turning prose into poetry, found poems should not contain any of your own words. They should only contain words you “found” in the first step.Having said this, if you need to alter a word to change whether it is singular or plural, or whether it is capitalized or not, that’s okay. Just keep these types of changes to a minimum.

, The best way to determine if a poem works is to read it out loud, the way you intend it to be read. This may also help you determine where certain punctuation needs to be, or where you need to include line breaks.Use this editing phase to rearrange the words and lines so you create a rhythm.
Try different line breaks to determine which words work best at the beginning and end of each line.
When reading your poem out loud, remember to pause slightly at the end of each ‘line.’ If the pause seems to be in the wrong spot, change the line break.

, Once you’ve had a chance to review the poem several times, try to come up with an appropriate title that describes the poem or the poem’s theme.Your title could simply be a description of where you got the words, for example, “Overheard at Starbucks.” Or “From Chapter 5 of Lord of the Rings.""

, If you want to get even more creative, you can rewrite or retype your final poem with different fonts or font styles. Maybe there’s a font that matches the theme of the poem really well, or maybe you want to bold all the keywords in the poem. There are no rules."

Cut out at least 50 words from one issue of a magazine or newspaper.,
Clear a large workspace.,
Spread all you cut out words on your workspace.,
Add a title to your poem.,
Attach the words to a piece of paper.",How to Turn Prose Into Poetry3," While this may seem like the instructions for writing a ransom note, they’re not! Instead you’re going to use the words you cut out to create a poem.Try to find single words to use, not entire headlines.
You can even cut out parts of a word if that works for you.
Keep the magazine or newspaper from which you cut your words in case you need to go back.

, Now that you have your words cut out, you’ll need a good, large and clear space to work on. A large table, or even the floor, will work well., Once you’ve cleared your workspace, lay out all the words on the surface. Like a puzzle, move the pieces around into different arrangements looking for something that is interesting, fun, unusual, witty, whatever.Read the words out loud to see if they make sense in whatever order you’ve placed them.
Create new words by combining two or more of the cut out words.
Don’t worry about the statements making sense.
Look for good spots to include a line break, or a certain type of punctuation.

, Once you have a pretty good idea of what your poem is going to look like, add a title. If needed, cut out duplicate words from the magazine or newspaper to use in the title., Now it’s time to break out the glue! Use plain pieces of paper and either glue, staples, tape, or whatever you want, to attach the words to the paper. Trim words if necessary to make them fit.If you need a specific word, and the one you cut out is too large, find the same word in smaller font in the magazine or newspaper and use that instead.
Cut out additional punctuation from the magazine or newspaper if you need to.

Don't freak out.,
Congratulations!",How to Write a Concrete Slam Poem," Unless you're a professional poet or writer, you probably won't accidentally spit out a masterpiece. It takes work. Think of a topic you care about, and know well enough to write about; also think about a wide enough and deep enough topic that you have something meaningful to say about it. You can write a poem about baseball if you really want to, but try to come up with something relevant to say about the topic. The best poems, and the poems best-liked by audiences, are ones they can relation to, and that seem applicable to their lives.
, Whether you prefer country or instrumentals, listening to some good, emotional music can do a lot to get you in the writing mood. If you find you tend to be influenced by lyrics you hear when writing, or if you just don't like writing while music is playing, listen to some beforehand. Or if you don't like music at all, try looking up artwork or cool photography online for something to inspire you., This is optional, and may be superseded later but is a good springboard. Write down any phrases that come to mind when thinking about your topic, or any morals you hope your poem will convey. Then branch off of those - try to think of metaphors for your main point, or a simile to help bring some imagery to your poem., This doesn't have to be perfect - it's only a first draft. Try to include poetic devices and imagery but mainly focus on getting your point across., This is the stage where you can focus on making the words flow better, making the poem longer, and bring more ""poetry"" to your writing., The basic length of a slam poem is three minutes, but depending on your audience (is it a school project, for a shorter slam, etc.) a different length may be acceptable. Read your poem out loud to your self, trying to approximate the speed you will read it at the slam. Don't just read it in your head - you think a lot faster than you speak, and you'll be shocked when a page or two of writing only lasts you forty or fifty seconds., You may not want to do this, but remember, you will be sharing this poem with an audience full of people soon: a dress rehearsal of a single person isn't a bad idea. Plus, they can give you feedback, or critique your readings when you practice those., When performing a poem its good to move around a bit  - don't fidget  or shift on your feet, but make some nice, strong hand gestures that add to your piece. For most slams, memorization is necessary, so make sure you keep that in mind, too., Right before your slam, you're probably going to be extremely nervous - don't be. Everything will be fine. Be confident when you go up to perform - shoulders back, chin up. Read in a loud but slow voice, skimming the room and making eye contact with as many people as possible., You're done. You did great. Now move on to making your next poem."

Identify the speaker.,

Ask a professor or teacher for guidance.",How to Study Poetry," Start by reading the poem to yourself. Keep a pencil or pen nearby so you can underline, star, or mark any lines that you like or that stand out to you. You may also underline or circle any words or phrases that you find confusing or unclear. You can then return to these notes later to help you analyze the poem.Your first reading should be treated as an introduction to the poem. Instead of trying to understand the full meaning and form of the poem, you only need to briefly familiarize yourself with it.;
, On your second reading of the poem, read it aloud. Read slowly in your normal voice and take your time to read each word. You may read a line over again that you find unclear or confusing. Listen to how the language sounds when read out loud. Consider if it sounds different when read out loud versus when read in your head.If there are any commas or periods in the poem, you should view them as pauses. Pause after each comma or period when you read the poem out loud. Punctuation is important and put in the poem intentionally by the poet for a reason.
If there are any line breaks in the poem, where there are spaces or gaps between lines or words, take the breaks as a pause. Slow down when you read the line breaks and leave pauses when required.
Depending on the popularity of the poem, you might be able to find an audio recording of the poet or another individual reading the poem aloud. You can listen to such recordings, but read along silently as you do instead of listening passively.

, Most poems will have a certain rhythm and meter, where they are written in a specific pattern. Reading the poem aloud will help you listen for the rhythm and meter of the poem. The only type of poetry that does not have a clear rhythm and meter is free verse poetry. All other types will have some kind of pattern you can follow.Consider if the poet uses rhyme in the poem. Does the poem rhyme at the end of each line? Every other line? You may try noting the rhyme scheme of the poem to help you determine the form.
The rhyme scheme can help you determine the form of the poem. For example, a blank verse poem will have unrhymed lines. A couplet will have two lines with or without a rhyme, and a tercet will have three line stanzas with or without a rhyme.

, You should also note how the poet has organized the content of the poem to create a certain form. Check if there are divisions in the poem. There may be stanzas in the poem, such as four lines grouped together to form a stanza. Or there may be no stanzas and simply lines of the poem that rhyme or form a pattern.For example, the poem “Digging” by Seamus Heaney begins with two lines together, a couplet, followed by a three line stanza and then a four line stanza. The two line couplet comes in again later in the poem as part of a pattern., As part of the form of the poem, the poet may use certain literary devices to add a deeper meaning or to create a more detailed image for the reader. Common literary devices include rhyme, onomatopoeia, alliteration, assonance, and consonance. Check to see if the poem contains any literary devices and consider how they add meaning to the poem overall.Rhyme refers to the repetition of end sounds between words, for example, ""house"" and ""mouse"". It can occur within lines or at the end of two separate lines.
Onomatopoeia refers to a word that sounds like the noise it mimics, for example, “a bee that buzzes.”
Alliteration is the repetition of a beginning consonant sound, for example, “a scrap heap.”
Assonance is the repetition of a vowel sound anywhere within a word, for example, “picnic.”
Consonance is the repetition of a vowel sound at the end of multiple words, for example, “flip-flop.”
Metaphor is the comparing of one thing to another, for example, “I am a sad bird.”
Simile is comparing one thing to another using “like” or “as”, for example, “I am like a lonely bird on a wire.”

, Once you have analyzed the poem’s shape, organization, and rhyme scheme, you can determine the form. There are many different poetic forms, such as sonnets, ballads, acrostics, blank verse, haiku, cinquain, epics, elegies, limericks, sestinas, and villanelles. Determining the form of the poem can help you get a deeper understanding of the piece and consider the intent of the poet.You may read examples of a certain poetic form to confirm that the poem is of that form. Or you may look up the characteristics of a certain form to make sure you are correct.

, The title can contain significant clues about the nature of the poem, so you really shouldn't ignore it. Read the title and think about it in the context of the rest of the poem. Ask yourself, What does the poem mean in the context of the rest of the poem? How does the title deepen the meaning of the poem overall?Sometimes the title will describe who the speaker or intended audience of the poem is, for example, a poem with the title “For Mother” or “To My Lover.” Other times, the title may describe the subject, genre, or tone of the poem, for example, the title “Sonnet 18” or “Digging.”

, The poet and the speaker are not always the same person. A poem's speaker might be a character within the broader context of the poem. Note if the poet uses a first person speaker (“I”), a second person speaker (“you”), or a third person speaker (“she, he, they”).You can usually identify the speaker without careful analysis, but if you aren't sure, don't worry about it for now. Just make sure you understand what type of speaker is in the poem when you start analyzing the meaning of the poem.

, When you run across a word you don't understand, stop where you're at and look up the meaning of that word in a dictionary. You may circle these words or underline them so you can remember to look them up later. Defining unfamiliar words can help to deepen your understanding of the poem.


You may also want to look up possible synonyms for that word using a thesaurus.
After defining that word, plug the definition or synonym into the poem and re-read the line with that meaning.
You can apply this same practice to phrases or proper nouns you don't know, but defining the meaning of these elements may require additional research in other texts or online.

, The tone and mood of the poem are often created by the word choice and the language used in the poem. You may also get a sense of the mood and tone of the poem by listening to the rhythms of the poem when you read it out loud.For example, you may have a poem that has a humorous tone and a light mood, such as the poem “Dirty Face” by Shel Silverstein.Or you may read a poem that has a more sinister or ominous tone, such as “The Raven” by Edgar Allan Poe., You should get a sense of when the poem was written and why the poem was written, or the context of the poem. Maybe an historical event occurred around the time the poem was written or perhaps a certain style of poetry was popular when the poem was published. Maybe the poet was influenced by a certain painting or art performance when they wrote the poem. Learning about the context of the poem can help to deepen your understanding of the poem and provide a more thorough reading of the piece.You may do research on the context of the poem using other texts, scholarly journals, or online sources. You can also consider when the poem was published and use this date to help situate it within the history of poetry and writing.

, Patterns and repetition in the poem are often used to reinforce a certain theme or idea. The poet may use a line more than once throughout the poem like a refrain to remind the reader of a certain idea. Or they may use a pattern of words or a pattern of organization to create a certain meaning in the poem. Ask yourself if the poet consistently relies on certain images, topics, or other similar words. Groups of similar words to indicate a pattern.For example, you may notice that the poem repeats the same line over and over again throughout the poem, such as “only this and nothing more.” You may then consider why the poet repeats this phrase throughout the poem. Often, the phrase will relate back to a specific theme or idea in the poem.

, Another pattern you could look for is how the ideas in the poem are ordered. Are they placed in a chronological order, moving from present to future? Or do the ideas jump around in time, moving from past to present to future and then back to past?You may also notice if the poem does not have any time based ordering and instead seems ordered by another organizing idea, such as scraps of conversation in the poem or the use of another theme.
For example, maybe the poem has a water-based theme, with the poet describing an ocean in one line and shallow pond in the next. Or maybe the poem has a theme of lost love, and each stanza explores a moment of lost love for the speaker.

, Once you have considered all the elements of form and content in the poem, you should try to summarize the poem in one to two sentences. Write down what you believe to be the overall meaning or theme of the poem. Try to rely on the content and form of the poem as well as your impressions and thoughts. Ask yourself, What is this poem about?For example, you may sum up the poem “The Raven” by Edgar Allan Poe with the sentence: This poem is about the speaker’s fear and terror of death, personified in the raven at the door.
Do not be too concerned about having the right reading of the poem. Poetry is meant to be subjective and your interpretation of the poem could be just as right as someone else’s interpretation. You have the freedom to read the poem as you see fit, as long as you use evidence in the poem to support your reading.

, You may find it helpful to get some outside perspective on the poem. You may show the poem to a close friend or a peer at school and ask them how they would approach the poem. You may ask the person, What do you think the poem is about? What is your experience of reading the poem?You may also ask a colleague at work or at your university for some perspective on the poem. You may approach a colleague in a class on poetry and ask them for their opinion, as they may be more familiar with reading and interpreting poetry.

, You can also try showing the poem to a poetry group to get their impression of the poem. You may join a poetry group so you can get better at studying poetry or start your own poetry group with friends. Discussing a poem with others in a group can help you realize certain aspects of the poem that you may have missed and allow you to listen to the interpretation of others in the group.When you bring the poem into your poetry group, you may start the discussion by talking about your interpretation of the poem as well as your thoughts and impressions of the piece. Then, you may ask the group to share their own ideas about the poem as part of a discussion.

, You may find it useful to approach a professor or a teacher who studies poetry to get some guidance. Bring a copy of the poem with you and ask the teacher what they think about the poem as well as your interpretation of the poem. You may have a discussion with the teacher about how to study the poem and the genre of poetry in general."

Perhaps you're sitting on a hill of grass? Whether you're near the sea, feeling a warm wind over your skin or watching the sky as the clouds roll by, there is bound to be plenty of material to inspire your poem.;
, For example, if you chose to write about the hot weather you're experiencing, you'd maybe list out such descriptive words as ""smoltering"" ""sizzling"" ""heated"" ""extreme"" ""invisible fire"" and the like, describe the topic of your poem.


Make a web for all the descriptive words that branch from your poem's topic.

, What do you see first in your poem's topic? For example, if you are writing about the frequent heat, perhaps first write something like: ""smoltering the atmosphere into invisible flame,"" or ""melting away the air."" Write this down to begin with.

, Add an ending to the first line, for example, ""sizzling as it cooks the ground."" It'd end up like: ""smoltering the atmosphere into invisible flame, sizzling as it cooks the ground.""

, For example, add onto the two lines, ""smoltering the atmosphere into invisible flame, sizzling as it cooks the ground."" Does your topic affect your emotions? Does it affect the land? What about the emotions of the people who live around it? For example, you could write, ""this heat fires up the hearts of our citizens, burning our anger and sweat.""

, Write about how you've overcome the heat effects perhaps, or the efforts you must go through to overcome them. For example, you could write about the heat as, ""I must chill my house to freeze the burning fire, chilling it of it's capabilities to burn.""

, This is not how it affects them. For example, you could write, ""the people smolder the heat with their freezing hearts, glazing the glaring sun with our own layers of ice.""

, This explains how it all adds up. For example, you could write, ""the fire sizzles and burns through our hearts, yet we overcome it for the chill that is waiting beyond it's heat.""

, Fix any descriptive errors. If anything seems too descriptive, fix it. Even it out.

, If so, explain it. You need to metaphorically understand your poem as well! Examine the poem for metaphors.


Metaphors can come anywhere. ""The heat burns our dignity,"" can be a metaphor for being put down by the heat emotion-wise.
Other people may take the metaphors as they see it. Don't be offended if other people read your metaphors ""incorrectly"" from your perspective. Once you release that poem into the world, it becomes what others wish to make of it. That's the beauty of art, creativity and not insisting on technical accuracy. A poem is organic, it lives on in its own way.

, Some of the ideas that come to you may seem corny, even to yourself, but that is the way love is, sometimes.

, Then, see if the big things are combinations of little things, and can be broken down that way. Here are some examples of ""she is beautiful"" (other qualities may be broken down the same way.


Her hair is soft and smells sweet.
Her lips are full and sensuous.
She has a full, womanly figure. (Which may be broken down even further.)
She has lovely, iridescent blue eyes.
Her smile can light up a room.

, If you are making your list secretly, take mental notes to write down later.

, They may notice things or qualities that you really love, but are not even aware of.

, You may appreciate the absence of criticism, complaining, or other negative qualities. These characteristics, being absent, do not lend themselves to obvious recognition.

, This may clue you in to things about them you never think about, but miss when they are not present. This could be the scent of their hair or perfume, or the sound of their voice.

, This may be adrift from the ""romantic"" ideas, but these are qualities you may value greatly, when you consider them. Things like cleanliness, punctuality, or moderation.

, Often, you may find you associate other things only when you remind yourself deliberately.

Think of all the rhyming possibilities before settling on one.,
Bury rhymes in longer words.,
Only choose appropriate words.,
Use slant rhymes.,
Consult a rhyming dictionary.,
Always use rhymes to move the piece forward.",How to Rhyme1," Change the prefix of that word to every letter in the alphabet. For example, if you needed to find a word that rhymes with, ""fog,"" start at A and go ""aog, bog, cog, dog, eog, ... zog,"" until you reach Z. Write down every word that is real, such as ""bog,"" ""cog,"" and ""dog"" and only select the most interesting choices. If one doesn't work, alter the first line to serve the poem or song.


When going through the alphabet, inserting an R or an L into short words will often make another word. So if you were looking for a rhyme with cat, you could find bat as well as brat; fat, as well as flat and frat. It's a trick of the trade.;
, Use other multi letter prefixes you know to build more complicated words with which to rhyme. First letters won't always cut it. For example, ""frog"" and ""clog"" are real words that rhyme with bog. Try multi syllabic words like ""bullfrog"" or ""epilogue.""

, If no word works, consider changing the key word to a synonym of that word, or abandoning your rhyme scheme for a line or two. For example, you could substitute ""mist"" for ""fog,"" but only use rhymes to improve the poem or song, never to rhyme for the sake of rhyming.

, Hard rhymes, sometimes called true rhymes, ""sound"" right to our ear because of identical vowel and consonant combinations. ""Moon"" and ""spoon"" are hard rhymes because of the long ""o"" sound and the ""n."" Slant rhymes are rhymes in which either the vowel or the consonant in similar, creating a kind of echo of the rhyme, and giving you all kinds of possibilities.


""Moon"" could be slant rhymed with ""on"" or ""schooner"" or ""groom"" or even ""gong"". Slant rhymes offer complexity and surprise to a regular series of hard rhymes.

, It's worth it to invest in a good rhyming dictionary to consult. It's not cheating to use a dictionary for rhyming just as it isn't cheating to use a thesaurus while writing. Studying up on good rhymes will also build your vocabulary, giving you a larger collection of words to use in future songs, poems, or freestyles.

, Rhyming is a technique that writers and musicians can use in their compositions to emphasize words and images and unspool surprising and complicated poetry. Use it to add little bits of color and texture to your work, but not as the reason for creating it. If something needs rhymes, use them well. If no, leave them out.

"
"
Write freely.,
Find a guiding line.,
Consider an appropriate form for the poem.,
Use rhymes to create surprise and add complexity to the poem.,
Read contemporary poetry for inspiration.",How to Rhyme2," When you're faced with a blank sheet of paper and want to fill it with poetry, it's best to avoid rhymes entirely in the earliest draft. Trying to start with rhyme is a good way to end up with cat-hat-bat rhymes and bad poetry. Instead, write free verse or journal freely and see what comes up. What are you trying to say? Start with a line or an image that strikes you and start producing the raw material from which you might build a more structured formal rhyming poem.

, After you've written for a while, turn your piece of paper over, or open a new word processing document. Take your favorite line from your free write and write it at the top of the page. What struck you about this? What's good about it? Use that as a guide for a possible poem. Explore the premise or image that the line contains.


Often, a free write will end on a particularly good line you might want to use as a starting place. Look to the last few sentences for a guide line.

, If you want to write a formal poem, familiarize yourself with common rhyming forms and the uses of those forms to pick one that will work best for the theme of your poem.



Couplets, or heroic couplets, refer to any poem in which the poem rhymes every two lines. Used by poets from Milton to Frederick Seidel, couplets can create a sense of gravity and the epic.
A poem featuring quatrains, or four-line stanzas, may rhyme in a basic alternating rhyme scheme (ABAB) or other schemes. Ballads and songs are traditionally written in quatrains, making it a good form for telling stories or spinning musical tales.
In a villanelle, whole lines from the first stanza are repeated from one three-line stanza to the next, with the first and last line in the stanza rhyming, giving the poem a sense of inevitability, as if the poem were something you cannot escape from.

Sonnets are poems of 14 lines with a semi-complicated and pre-set rhyme scheme, with about 10 syllables or five beats per line. Most sonnets written in English are generally either Petrarchan (ABBA) or Shakespearean (ABAB, with a rhyming couplet for the last two lines). Sonnets often deal with rhetorical themes or ""arguments,"" featuring a turn in the poem somewhere after the eighth line.

, Your rhymes should serve the poem, your poem should not serve the rhymes. Never rhyme for the sake of rhyming, or start a poem hoping to rhyme. This will result in forced ""cat-hat-bat"" types of rhymes that will undercut the poem, rather than add to it.


Paul Muldoon, an Irish poet, has a surprising rhyming style. His poem ""The Old Country""is a crown of sonnets that features deft and surprising rhymes:

Every runnel was a Rubicon / and every annual a hardy annual / applying itself like linen to a lawn. / Every glove compartment held a manual.



, It can be difficult to write contemporary poems that rhyme well if you're only familiar with Shakespeare, Wordsworth, and Dr. Seuss. There's no reason to keep Twitter, Frosted Flakes, and Lil Wayne out of your poems because your verses are choked with ""thous"". Find some contemporary poets who employ rhymes in fresh but traditional ways:


Check out Michael Robbins, who in his great poem ""Alien vs. Predator,"" creates a long string of wacky and associative musical rhymes from the cereal isle:


He's a space tree / making a ski and a little foam chiropractor. / I set the controls, I pioneer / the seeding of the ionosphere. / I translate the Bible into velociraptor.Read Ange Mlinko, a contemporary poet skilled enough to pull of rhyming potatoes with tattoos to end her poem ""The Grind"":spooning up Aphrodite / to Greek porticoes, and our potatoes, / and plain living which might be / shaken by infinitesimal tattoos.


""Casualty""by Seamus Heaney manages to be colloquial, narrative, musical, and incredibly easy to read. He's a great poet makes it seem effortless:

And raise a weathered thumb / Towards the high shelf, / Calling another rum / And blackcurrant, without / Having to raise his voice


David Trinidad--a poet who often writes about the pop culture of the 1960s--shows mastery of the villanelle form with his hilarious and poignant ""Chatty Cathy Villanelle"":


Our flag is red, white and blue. / Let’s make believe you’re Mommy. / When you grow up, what will you do?"
"
Write the melody first.,
Learn to ""turn"" a phrase.,
Use as few words as possible.,
Try automatic forms.",How to Rhyme3," It's very difficult to set pre-existing rhymes and words to a melody after the fact. Most songwriters find it much easier to compose the melody and then go about composing a set of lyrics that fit in with the tone and the structure of the song.


Many songwriters find it helpful to sing nonsense syllables or whistle to figure out the melody and establish a base form for you to fill with words.
Go with whatever technique works best for your process. Bob Dylan, considered by some to be one of the greatest songwriters ever, often wrote words first. Give it a shot.

, A popular and important technique in country music especially, a good song will often ""turn"" a phrase, or use a line to mean more than one thing throughout the course of a song, when used at different times.


In Kacey Musgraves' ""Blowing Smoke,"" the phrase ""blowing smoke"" is used at different times to refer specifically to waitresses on break smoking cigarettes, and also to boasting of quitting someday, referring to both the job and the habit. It's an effective technique that changes the meaning but not the words.

, Avoid overloading your lines with too many words, making your song a tongue-twister that can be difficult to sing. As you compose, use words judiciously, leaving out more than you put in. A simple and quick rhyme that's simple can be much more effective in a song than a lot of ""poetic"" words.


In ""The Butcher,"" Leonard Cohen makes a brief and devastating rhyme out of drug use:

I found a silver needle. I put it into my arm. / It did some good, did some harm.



, Novelist and Beat writer William Burroughs pioneered a method of writing that involved cutting up rhyming words and phrases and throwing them into a bag. Try doing the same and removing phrases at random to collage together a tapestry of weirdness for your song. Music is amenable to that kind of writing.


The Rolling Stones employed this technique for their song ""Casino Boogie"":


One last cycle, thrill freak Uncle Sam / Pause for business, so you'll understand."

Listen to the beat and find your flow.,
Freestyle.,
Learn and use enjambment to your advantage.,
Listen to expert hip-hop rhymers for inspiration.",How to Rhyme4," Spend a lot of time with the beat you're trying to rap over, internalizing the sound and the rhythm of it, to find your flow before you start coming up with lyrics. Like you write the melody in a traditional song first, you have to find the flow first in a rap song.


Some rappers will do a similar ""nonsense word"" technique, just spitting rhythmically without saying actual words. Try to record yourself doing this, even if it sounds silly, because something good might leap out.
Good rapping is as much about flow as good rhymes. If you stay on beat, it's better than if you lose the beat and Try to force awkward or overly complicated rhymes into the structure of the song.

, Like you might do a freewrite to start getting poetry out, trying some freestyles is a good way to get started and find a starting line to use for a song. Or, if you're Riff Raff, just record your free-style and call it a song.

, There's no rule that rhymes need to come at the end of each line, especially in hip-hop, or that the rhyming word needs to be the end of the sentence. Vary the placement of the rhymes. Embed rhymes internally and skip rhymes entirely to add variation to your flow. You don't have to rhyme at the end of each line to rap well.


In ""Duel of the Iron Mic,"" GZA creates a particularly strong break in the lines, using a well placed and surprising break in the beat to surprise us:

I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular / homicides, on July 4th in Bed-Stuy



, Familiarize yourself with the greats, listening to a wide variety of rhymers to begin learning the craft. Listen to:


Nas, who jumped on the scene as a teenager with his classic album Illmatic, which featured these lines:


It drops deep as it does in my breath / I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death.Eminem, whose intricate and well-crafted rhymes have made him a bona-fide king of the rap game:


I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias / to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens.Rakim, one of the most influential MCs in hip-hop:


Even if it’s jazz or the quiet storm / I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form."

Double space the poem.,
Have a physical copy of the poem.,
Find a quiet space to scan the poem.,
Read the poem out loud line by line.,
Mark stronger syllables with a “wand.” A wand symbol looks like this: /.,
Identify weaker syllables with a “cup.” A cup symbol looks like this: u.,
Use a “reversed wand” for syllables that are only partly stressed.,
Mark each pattern of syllables with a “foot boundary.” A foot boundary symbol looks like this: |.,
Note the syllable length in the poem.,
Identify the meter of the poem.",How to Scan a Poem," To scan a poem, you will need to use scanning symbols above each word in the poem. Make sure there is at least one line of space between each line of the poem so you can scan it properly.Keep in mind scanning symbols are always placed above each word, never below. This will make it easy for you to keep track of your scan of each line.;
, You will need to write directly above the words in the poem to do the scan properly. Print out the poem, double spaced, and use a pen or pencil to scan it directly on the page.If you are using a poem in a book, you may need to type it up and print it out or write it down on a piece of paper.

, Scanning a poem requires you to listen to each syllable in every word of the poem out loud. To do this successfully, you will need to be in a space that is very quiet and has no surrounding noise or distractions. Go to a quiet area like a study room or your bedroom.You may also tell others around you that you are not to be disturbed while you scan the poem so you can concentrate.

, Start by reading each line of the poem aloud to yourself. Listen to each word and how each word flows into another. Pay attention to where the words sound the most stressed and the least stressed. Often, you will open your mouth wider for stressed sounds and make your mouth smaller for less stressed sounds.You can also try putting your hand under your chin while you read the poem. Notice when your chin drops into your hand and when it does not touch your hand. Stressed sounds usually cause your chin to drop into your hand.

, It is used when part of a word or an entire word contains stronger syllables. You should notice that the word or part of the word sounds louder when you read it aloud. Use your ear and listen carefully to find the stronger syllables in each word.For example, in the line, “My girlfriend hit me in the head,” you would use a “/” over “girl,” “hit,” and “head.” These are the stronger syllables in the line.
Keep in mind one word can have a stronger syllable and a weaker syllable. For example, “girlfriend,” has a stronger syllable in “girl” and a weaker syllable in ‘“friend.”

, Place “u” over any syllables that are not as loud as others when you say them aloud. They will be the less stressed or weaker syllables in the words of the poem.Usually any words that are not marked stronger syllables, or with a wand, can be marked weaker syllables, with a cup.
For example, in the line, “This sunlight shames November where he grieves,” you would place a “u” over “This,” the “light” in “sunlight,” the “No” and “ber” in “November,” and “he.” These are the weaker syllables in the line.
Remember that you can have a stronger syllable and a weaker syllable in the same word. For example, “November” has a stronger syllable in “vem” and weaker syllables in “No” and “ber.”

, The reverse wand symbol looks like this: \. It is used rarely when scanning a poem for syllables that are hard to identify and appear only partly stressed. It is often used when there is a disagreement as to whether a word is stressed or not.For example, you may have a hard to scan line like, “Full of passionate intensity, grappling and free.” A word like “grappling” may be difficult for you to scan as it has three syllables that may sound only partly stressed.

, Do the foot boundaries last. Go through the poem and place a foot boundary anywhere there is the repeating pattern of the same wands and cups, known as a “foot.” In poetry, a “foot” is a group of syllables that make the same pattern in the poem.An easy way to do this is to count the wands, or “u” symbols in a line. For example, the line “This sunlight shames November where he grieves” has five “u” symbols (over “This,” “light,” “No,” “ber,” and “he”) so it has five feet. You would place the foot boundary after “he” to note the foot boundary is five feet in the poem.
You would then place a foot boundary at every five “u” symbols in the poem. This means the poem has a five foot pattern.

, Count the wands, or “/” symbols, in each section marked by a foot boundary. This will tell you the syllable length of the poem. You can then see if the poem has a set pattern for syllable length by counting the wands marked by each foot boundary.

For example, for the line “This sunlight shames November where he grieves”” there are five “/” symbols (over “sun,"" ""shames,"" ""vem,"" ""where,"" and ""grieves""). This means it has a five syllable length per each line, or a ten syllable length for every two lines.
You can then check to see if all the feet in the poem have a five syllable length by counting the “/” symbols in each foot boundary.

, Use your scan of the poem to determine the meter, which is a unit of beats. A meter is also called a foot in poetry. Look at the pattern of syllables in the poem to identify the meter.For example, a common meter in poetry is iambic pentameter. This means there is five stronger syllables, or wands, per a line and the syllable count is 10/10/10. The pattern is one less stressed syllable, followed by a strongly stressed syllable. Each line has a five syllable length, following a 10 syllable count for every two lines.

"
Understand the usage of lines, stanzas (basically paragraphs for poems), and punctuation.,
Understand that poets use of words is more restricted than the casual writer.,
Know that just because a line might end, doesn't mean that the sentence did, and that you should pause.,
Look at the sentences.,
Look again how you read it.This time, you probably paused at 'Ida,' and made 'lovelier' flow together with 'than' without pause.,
Go back and read the poem with the correct pauses, keeping in mind the feeling of reading it like a paragraph.,
Don't be afraid to look up the words you don't know.",How to Read Poetry," Poetry is not merely fancy words that rhyme. Think on how you might say a sentence in many different ways, depending on what you want to imply to the person you are speaking to.


For example, you might say ""Come here,"" to a friend. If you were going to write this as in a novel, you might write: ' ""Come here,"" I demanded.' Or you might say: ' ""Come here,"" I said insidiously.' You could also say: ' ""Come here!"" By themselves, the two words have dramatically different connotations than when put together. The same applies to poetry.;
, A poet will work within established rhyme and meter to use words in surprising and unexpected ways... ways that will bring enjoyment to you, the reader.

, The pause you take for breath comes at the punctuation, regardless of where it occurs in the line. Take, for example, the first paragraph of the poem ""The Death of Cenone"" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson:


There lies a vale in Ida, lovelier

Than all the valleys of Ionian hills.

The swimming vapour slopes athwart the glen,

Puts forth an arm, and creeps from pine to pine,

And loiters, slowly drawn. On either hand

The lawns and meadow-hedges midway down

Hang rich in flowers, and far below them roars

The long brook fallen thro' the clov'n ravine

In cataract after cataract to the sea.

Behind the valley topmost Gargarus

Stands up and takes the morning: but in front

The gorges, opening wide apart, reveal

Troas and Ilion's column'd citadel,

The crown of Troas.

, Notice that sometimes a line ends with a comma, and sometimes it doesn't. If you read it like this: ""There lies a vale in Ida, lovelier (pause, pause) Than all the valleys of Ionian hills. (pause, pause)"" . You might be a little puzzled as to why the poet would write a poem that doesn't flow. The reason is because you are reading it 'sing-song' like. Try reading it again without the formatting.


""There lies a vale in Ida, lovelier than all the valleys of Ionian hills.""
You should notice this time that the emphasis has been placed on 'Ida' rather than on the pauses and 'Ionian' from the former reading. It sounds like a conversation. Now try it again:
""There lies a vale in Ida, lovelier
Than all the valleys of Ionian hills.""

, Notice that the emphasis was still placed on 'Ida,' but the word 'lovelier' and 'all' had a stronger feeling to it- it was said with a greater accent, giving it an arrested and smitten sound. This poem was written rather like a paragraph in a story, or a monologue in a play. Notice how different it sounds when read like a story and not a ballad!

, Note: This takes practice! You might have to read it aloud several times before getting it right. When you are finished, did you see that you were actually able to follow along with the story being relayed? Oftentimes when reading a poem like a ballad (with breaks at the end of each line) you can get caught up in maintaining the rhythm, and find it difficult to concentrate on the actual poem.

, This should be obvious, but oftentimes you can simply skip over a word, and chalk up its meaning to ""context clues"" or ""implied meaning"" like they taught in 2nd grade. Look up the words you don't know, and even the words you think you know but are maybe a little unsure on. You may be surprised as to how the poem changes colors in your head.

Read the poem aloud several times.,
Look up words you don’t understand.,
Learn and internalize the “story” in the poem.,
Look for connections between stanzas or sections.,
Figure out the poem’s meter.,
Memorize the poem’s formal structure.,
Read the poem aloud again several times.",How to Memorize a Poem Quickly1," It’s important to remember that all poetry — whether it rhymes or not — comes from an oral and aural tradition, meaning that it’s meant to be spoken and heard.Before television, poetry was how people entertained themselves with storytelling. And in a time when literacy was not widespread, poetry took on certain characteristics — from rhyme schemes to metrical form — that helped people who couldn’t simply read the poem off a page to remember how the poem and story progressed.


Before you even begin trying to memorize the poem, read it out loud to yourself several times. TRY WRITING IT DOWN OR TYPING IT DOWN ON A SPREADSHEET.
Don’t simply read the words off the page; try to perform the poem as though you were telling the story to a crowd of people. Lower your voice in the quiet moments, and get loud in the emphatic moments. Use hand gestures to highlight key passages. Be theatrical.
It’s important that you read the poem out loud, rather than to yourself in your head. Hearing the poem with your ears will help you pick up on rhymes and rhythms that will help you memorize the poem.;
, Poets are great lovers of words, so they often use words that we’re not familiar with. If you’re asked to memorize an older poem, you will likely run across archaic words or grammatical structures that you don’t understand. Figuring out what those words and sentences mean will help you memorize the poem later. Take John Donne’s “A Valediction: Forbidden Mourning” as an example.In the second stanza, you might have to look up the words “tempest” (a storm), “profanation” (disrespecting something spiritual by making it secular and earthly), and “laity” (common people who don’t belong to the clergy or spiritual elite) to understand what the poet is trying to say.
This stanza says, “Let’s be quiet instead of crying a lot and sighing all the time. If we told these petty commoners about our love, we’d be doing a disservice to how sacred it is.”
Sometimes, it’s not the definitions of the words themselves that cause a problem, but the metaphoric use of the words. Look at stanza 3 of “A Valediction: Forbidden Mourning.” You may know what all of those words mean individually, but have trouble understanding what that stanza is about.
The “Moving of th’ earth” in this case in an earthquake. An earthquake causes harm and frightens people, and people do their best to make sense of it in the aftermath.
The “trepidation of the spheres” is the movement of the stars and planets in the sky. Those movements are far greater in scale, more violent, and, in popular mythology, have a far greater impact on the fate of people on earth. However, though those movements and their consequences are far greater than that of an earthquake, we lack “trepidation” of them, and fear silly little earthquakes instead. We are “innocent” or ignorant of the far greater movements that affect our lives, choosing to focus on unimportant details.
This stanza builds the idea that the speaker’s love is unearthly — grander and more important than that of the “dull sublunary (under the moon, on the earth) lovers” in the next stanza.
If you have trouble understanding the meaning of a poem, consult a study guide either from the library or online to help you along., Once you’ve looked up all the unfamiliar words, wordings, and images, you need to learn the poem’s story. If you don’t understand what the poem’s about, you’ll have as much trouble memorizing it as you would have trying to memorize a string of completely unrelated words that have no meaning. Before you try to memorize the poem, you should be able to summarize its story easily and completely from memory. Don’t worry about the actual words in the poem at this point — just a summary of content.


Some poems are “narrative,” meaning that they tell an actual story. William Wordsworth’s “I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud” is a good example.In it, the narrator is wandering through nature when he comes across a field of daffodils. He then describes the daffodils: how they seem to dance in the breeze, how their numbers seemed to stretch like stars across the sky, how happy and joyful their dance seemed, and finally, how the memory of those flowers brings him joy in sad moments when he’s back at home, away from nature.

, Not all poems are narrative and tell a clear story with plot points: this happened, then that happened. However, all poems are about something, and the best poems — the ones teachers tend to assign in class —develop and progress in some way. Even if there is no plot, try to figure out the meaning or message of the poem by understanding the connections between stanzas or sections. Look at Richard Wilbur’s “Year’s End” as an example.This poem begins with a clear setting: It’s New Year’s Eve (“the dying of the year”), and the speaker is on a street in a neighborhood looking through the window of a house, where he can just see the moving shapes through the frost on the glass.
The majority of the poem progresses through associative imagery, in which one image leads to another purely by whatever association springs into the writer’s mind, rather than by logic or chronology, as it would in a story.So, in this poem, the frosted window from the first stanza makes the poet leap to the image of a frozen lake in the second; a frozen lake looks a little bit like a frosted window, after all. Frozen in the lake’s surface are the leaves which fell during the freezing process, which are now stuck to its surface, fluttering in the wind like perfect monuments.
That perfection at the end of the second stanza is drawn into the third as “the perfection in the death of ferns.” Also drawn down is the idea of being frozen: just as the leaves were frozen in the lake as monuments in the second stanza, ferns are frozen as fossils in the third. Also frozen as fossils were mammoths, who lay preserved in ice.
The preservation at the end of the third stanza is brought down to the fourth: the preservation of a dog in the ruins of Pompeii, a city that was obliterated by a volcanic eruption, but whose shapes were preserved by the volcanic ash.
The final stanza draws from the idea of a sudden end at Pompeii, where people were frozen in place unexpectedly, never anticipating their sudden death. The final stanza brings us back to the scene from the first: it’s New Year’s Eve, the end of another year. As we “fray into the future,” the poem argues, we should consider all the “sudden ends” the poem has presented to us: the leaf caught in ice, the fossilized ferns and mammoths, the sudden, unexpected deaths at Pompeii.
This poem might be difficult to memorize because it doesn’t have a chronological plot development. However, by understanding the associative way in which the stanzas are related to one another, you’ll be able to remember: looking through frosted windows on New Year’s Eve → leaf in a frozen lake as perfect monument → perfection of fossilized ferns and mammoths preserved in ice → the bodies preserved in volcanic ash at Pompeii → these sudden ends should be remembered now, at the end of the year, as we look forward to the next.

, Meter is the rhythm of a line of poetry; it is composed of metrical feet, or units of syllables with their own distinct accentual patterns.For example, iambs are the most common metrical foot in English poetry. They have two syllables — the first unstressed, and the second stressed, resulting in a ta-TUM rhythm, as in the word “hel-LO.”Other common metrical feet include: the trochee (TUM-ti; MORN-ing), the dactyl (TUM-ti-ti; PO-et-ry), the anapest (ta-ta-TUM; ev-er-MORE), and the spondee (TUM-TUM; PRAISE HIM).In English, most poems rely on a largely iambic rhythm, though there can be a great deal of metrical variation. This variation is often found at important moments in the poem; look for variation at key moments in the story you memorized.
The meter of a poem is often constrained by the number of feet in a line. For example, iambic pentameter means that the lines are composed of five (pent) iambs each: ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM. An example of an iambic pentameter line from Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 18” is “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?”
Dimeter means there are two feet per line; trimeter has three feet; tetrameter has four; hexameter has six; and heptameter has seven. Very, very rarely will you see lines extend further than heptameter.
Count out the syllables and rhythms in each line and determine what the meter of the poem is. This will help you learn the musical cadence of the poem.
For example, there’s a big difference between a poem written in iambic tetrameter, like Tennyson’s “In Memoriam A.H.H.,” and one written in dactylic dimeter, like Tennyson’s “The Charge of the Light Brigade.”As you did in the very first step, read the poem out loud several times, but pay special attention to the music and rhythm of the lines now. Read the poem several times until the music, including the metrical variations, feel as natural and predictable to you as that of your favorite song.

, A formal poem, also known as metrical verse, is a poem that follows a pattern of some combination of rhyme, stanza length, and meter.You’ve already figured out the meter, but now you need to look at the rhyme scheme, which will in turn tell you how many lines are in each stanza. Look in an online study guide to see if your poem is an example of a particular form of poetry — a Petrarchan sonnet, for example, or a villanelle or sestina. It may be a nonce form, or a poem whose formal structure does not belong to an entire category of poems, but was instead invented by the poet for the purpose of this poem alone.


There are many reliable online resources where you can learn more about the formal structure of the poem you are trying to memorize.By memorizing the formal structure of the poem, you will be able to jog your memory about what comes next if you get stuck while trying to recite a poem.
For example, if you are trying to recite Edna St. Vincent Millay’s “Time does not bring relief; you all have lied,” but get stuck after the second line, you can remember that it’s a Petrarchan sonnet, which begins with a rhyme scheme of ABBA.Since the first line ends with “lied” and the second with “pain,” you know that the third line will end with a word that rhymes with “pain” and the fourth with a word that rhymes with “lied.”
You can then recall the rhythmic music of the poem (iambic pentameter) to help you hum out the rhythm until the lines come back to you: “I miss him in the weeping of the rain; / I want him at the shrinking of the tide.”

, This experience should be very different from the initial readings you did, because now you’ll have a much deeper understanding of the poem’s story, message, and meaning, its rhythm and musicality, and its formal structure.


Read the poem slowly and theatrically, bringing all your new knowledge of the poem to bear in your performance. The more you commit to the theatrical performance of the piece, the more easily it will plant itself in your brain.
As lines of the poem begin to come naturally to you without your having to look at the page, recite more and more of it from memory.
Don’t be afraid to look down at the page if you need to. Use it as a guide to jog your memory for as long as you need.
As you continue reading the poem aloud over and over again, you’ll find that more and more lines are coming to you from your memory.
Allow a natural transition from reading off the page to reciting the poem from memory.
After you have successfully recited the poem from memory completely, continue doing so at least five or six more times to make sure you have it down perfectly.

Accept that it’s harder to memorize a free verse poem than a formal one.,
Read the poem aloud several times.,
Look up words and references you don’t understand.,
Look for memorable moments in the poem.,
Work the memorable phrases into your summary of the poem.,
Read the poem aloud again several times.",How to Memorize a Poem Quickly2," Free verse poetry came into popularity after the modernist movement of the early twentieth century, when poets like Ezra Pound declared that the deliberate rhyme schemes, metrical patterns, and stanzaic structures that dominated poetry for most of its history were incapable of depicting anything approaching truth or reality.As a result, much the poetry written in the past hundred years has been without rhyme, predictable rhythm, or set stanzas, making it far more difficult to memorize.


Even if you’ve had success memorizing formal poems like sonnets in the past, don’t expect free verse poetry to be as easy.
Be prepared to put in more work.
If you have a choice as to which poem to memorize for a class and you’re on a strict time schedule, you might wish to choose a formal poem instead of a free verse one.

, Just as you did with the formal poems, you need to begin by getting a good sense of the rhythm in your free verse poem. Even though it lacks the formal characteristics that make other poems easier to remember, as T.S. put it, “no verse is free for the man who wants to do a good job”. What he meant by this is that all language, even casual conversational language, can be scanned for metrical rhythm and pattern produced on an unconscious level, and that a good poet will draw out the musicality of a line even without the parameters of a rigid structure: “What sort of a line that would be which would not scan at all I cannot say.”When reading the poem aloud, try to pick up on the poet’s distinctive voice. Do they use a good deal of commas that slow down the pace of the poem, or does the poem seem to go by in one great, unbroken rush?
Free verse poetry seeks to depict natural speech rhythms to the greatest extent possible, so the poem will likely rely heavily on iambic meter, which closely mimics natural English. Is that the case for this poem?
Or does the poem have a surprisingly different rhythm than iambic meter? For example, James Dickey is known for the pops of anapestic trimeter scattered throughout his free verse poems.An example is Dickey’s “The Lifeguard,” which is largely iambic, but punctuated with anapestic trimeter and dimeter throughout: “In a STAble of BOATS I lie STILL”; “the LEAP of a FISH from its SHAdow”; “with my FOOT on the WATer I FEEL.”Read the poem aloud repeatedly until you begin to internalize the musical rhythm of the poet’s voice.

, Because free verse poetry is far younger, it’s unlikely you’ll come across archaic words you don’t recognize. Some branches of free verse strive for poetry that closely mimics normal conversational English rather than fancy “poetic” English; Wordsworth, an influential precursor to free verse, wrote that a poet is merely “a man speaking to men.”However, as poets seek to push the boundaries of language, they sometimes turn to less commonly used vocabulary to elevate the work into more artistic terrain. Make good use of your dictionary.


Modern and contemporary poetry also has a tendency to be highly allusive, so be on the lookout for references you don’t understand. Classical references to Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology are fairly common, as are Biblical references. Look up any references to gain deeper insight into the line’s meaning.
For example, Eliot’s “The Waste Land” is so heavily allusive that it is almost incomprehensible without consulting the notes he provided to accompany the poem.(Even then, it’s hard!)
Again, the purpose here is to make sure you understand the poem before you try to memorize it. It’s easier to memorize a poem you “get.”

, Because you can’t rely on rhyme or rhythm to jog your memory, you need to find key points in the poem for your brain to latch onto. Comb through the poem looking for moments that you either like, or that surprise you. Try to space them out throughout the poem, so that you have one distinct, memorable line or phrase from each small section of the piece, however you choose to break it up. Even if the poem is written in one long stanza, you might choose one memorable image or phrase for every four lines, or perhaps for every sentence regardless of how many lines it spreads across.


Look at James Dickey’s “For the Last Wolverine” as an example.For this poem, we’ll simply list the startling, memorable images as they jump out at us:
the silence of whitening snarls; the last red meal; his gnarling head; a single spruce tree is dying higher and higher; snarling complete in the joy of a weasel with an elk’s horned heart in his stomach; hunched in mangy feathers; let them mate to the death; it has come back, this time on wings; but small, filthy, unwinged; the timid poem; the elk’s heart in the belly, sprouting wings; Lord, let me die but not die out.
Note how each of these phrases is both memorable and indicates a key movement in the plot of the poem.
By putting these key phrases to memory before attempting to recite the poem completely by rote, you will have landmarks to help guide you through the poem should you get stuck in a recitation.
Memorize the exact wording of these memorable phrases in the exact order in which they appear in the poem. This will give you a condensed outline of the poem that will help you summarize in the next step.

, Just as with the formal poem, you must fully grasp the story or meaning of the free verse poem before you should attempt to memorize it. That way, if you get caught up on a word when trying to recite it, you can think back to the summary to jog your memory as to what comes next. Focus on working those landmark memorable phrases from the previous step into your summary, making sure to flesh out the connective tissue that leads from one phrase to the next with your own language.


If the poem is narrative, try staging it out like a play to help you remember the chronology of progression. For example, Robert Frost’s “Home Burial” is so narrative, with its exposition and dialogue, that it has been staged and acted out.“Home Burial” is an otherwise difficult poem to remember, being written entirely in blank verse, or unrhymed iambic pentameter., You should have a head start on memorizing at this point because you’ve already put the list of key phrases to good use in your summary. Continue reading the poem aloud to yourself — but with each subsequent reading, try to travel between more and more landmark phrases without having to look down at the page.


Don’t get frustrated if you don’t perfect your recitation on the first try. If you get frustrated, relax for a moment and take a five minute break to let your brain reset.
Remember to make use of your landmark images and your summary to help you remember each line as it appears in the poem.

Know your message. If you aren't sure of the message you want to convey, you can bet that no one else will be, either.
Know the reader. Each book/compilation of works has a target audience, and your cover should appeal to this audience. If you attempt to appeal to everyone, chances are you'll end up appealing to no one.
Be smart in your layout. Size each element appropriately—Make your most important elements visible; remember that larger elements will carry more weight than smaller ones.
Choose colors that play well off each other.
Place elements so that the viewer's eye will flow well. Things to think about: If you use slanting lines, make sure they all slant the same way, don't break up important sentences or phrases with different fonts, and avoid ""trapped space.""

Proofread and revise.",How to Make Readers Emotional with Your Poetry," If you are trying to make a reader joyful, then writing a poem when you are upset isn't going to work. Your emotions rub off into your poetry, so make sure they match the mood of the poem. You can help yourself get in that mood by listening to music that matches it as well- if you are going to write a happy and inspiring poem, listen to uplifting and lively music beforehand, and so on.;
, Try reflecting upon a strong memory that makes you joyous or tearful every time you think of it, such as losing a best friend. If the poem doesn't make you emotional, it probably won't make the reader emotional either. You can keep the memory you're using as inspiration, or the main topic.


Refrain from writing about subjects you have little or no experience with or knowledge on. Chances are you'll be forcing yourself to come up with ideas and such, and this never ends well. It most likely will be evident in your writing that it isn't heartfelt.

, Without being able to ""see"" what's going on in your poem, your reader is more likely to become confused rather than be moved by your poem. Using metaphors is a great way to assist readers with this, especially with more abstract or complicated ideas in your poem. Be sure to make the metaphors compare to places or items that most people have already seen or used. For example: ""her eyes were a dreary winter day, full of hues of gray and overcast clouds turning sunlight into hazy glows"".

, This will truly make the reader feel like they are actually there, and when a reader feels immersed in the poem it makes it much easier for them to feel emotional. Be creative with some senses- for example, taste may seem inapplicable at a playground but young children can gnaw on their dirty fingers all the time. However, if a sense can't be used in the place you're describing, don't try to force it in, as it will only confuse the reader. An example of using sense is below:


Sunlight filters through emerald leaves and highlights grapes in deep shades of purple, (see)
Smooth grapes slide through fingers as do vines with little bumps (feel)
The fruity, tart taste of the plants exploding upon tongues (taste)
Leaves rustle as gentle wind whistles through them (hear)
And a fresh aroma of fresh soil, fruit and leaves swirls through the crisp air (smell)

, (e.g. differences between good childhood, sad present.) Many readers who are teens or adults can easily relate to this, especially if it's true in their lives. It could also be how the character in your poem has changed after some sort of traumatic or upsetting event, such as death of friend or family. It should have enough before examples to sadden the reader when the ""after"" change happens.


You can also focus this before-after change on some sort of item instead of the person. The character changes through unfortunate circumstances, but the item is the primary focus of the reader. For example: ""she used drag it wherever she went, wet soil and grass lodged in its fur/then she only hugged it when trying to fight off her demons at night/but now it lies abandoned in the attic, hugged by spiders and cobwebs/its only blanket made of powdery dust"". This a short example but gives a general outline.

, For a reader to be emotional, they have to feel with the character, relate with them, understand them, and sympathize with them. If the character is just some random figure, it's unlikely the reader will feel anything if something significant occurs in the poem. So tell the reader a little bit about the character's history (if it's important to the poem), and always include the character's emotions with each event.


Show, not tell, the character's emotions. Nobody's going to get emotional over your poem if you state ""they are feeling sad"". Show all the little signs of how the character is affected by the events in the poem.

, Clichés are overused literary elements, which can often make works seem boring and tire the reader. Since the reader has already seen the same cliché so many times, they most likely won't like the poem and will have read lots just like it. Clichés:


Work against original communication and people value creative talent. They want to see work that isn't the normal thing they see every day. When they see a work without clichés, they know the writer has worked hard doing whatever it takes to be original. When they see a work full to the brim with clichés, they feel that the writer is not showing them anything above the ordinary and didn't put that much effort into it.
Dull meaning. Because clichéd writing sounds so familiar, people can and often do skim through lines. If they don’t bother to read your poem all the way through, they certainly won’t stop to think about it. If they do not stop to think about your poem, they will never encounter deeper meanings and emotion.

, Concrete words describe things people feel with their sentences, such as ""orange, cat, warm"". Abstract words describe concepts or feelings, such as ""liberty, happy, love"". Concrete words help the reader get a picture of what the poem is talking about and helps them easily visualize. When the reader can visualize the poem, he/she can better understand what the poet is talking about, hence making it much easier for them to get emotional reading it.

, The poem has to come from you, and you alone. Poems aren't forced onto the paper- they happen. If you force yourself to write a poem it sounds strained and weak and it becomes clear it was a forced poem. Don't write about something just because it is popular and everyone likes it. Write it from you and people will connect. Nobody will get emotional over a forced poem; it's evident the poet didn't put any emotion into it, and the reader won't feel any emotion over it either.

, Sentimentality is false or excessive emotion, which is the exact opposite of what the reader needs to get emotional over your poem. It can make the reader feel like they're having emotions rammed down their throats, instead of letting them choose. Plus, having it in a poem can end up feeling whiny, self-pitying, insincere, or sickeningly sweet, depending on which emotions the poet is overdoing. To avoid this, let the readers decide their emotions for themselves. Instead of telling them that something is sad, show them what makes that thing sad (this also helps with show-not-tell, which increases chances of readers feeling emotion over your poem).

, Sometimes it takes a good ending to get the reader emotional. You can stun the reader by building a positive mood, then shattering it, such as recalling good memories as a person until a sad ending, such as death or illness. You want the reader to remember your poem, and a memorable ending is essential to that.


Try having the last line only consist of one word (as long as that word is meaningful), or don't add a period to the end. It'll feel like a stunned ending, almost like a cliffhanger but with no sequel.
Since periods end sentences, they are often associated with finality. Because of this, you can use a period after the last word to give the poem a sense of stunned closure. It makes a greater impact if you haven't used a single period throughout the whole poem.

, There's always a chance you had some sort of mistake in there, which can even ruin part of the poem, depending on the magnitude. Scan your poem for any grammatical or spelling errors. Check for any words that stop the poem from flowing smoothly, and either remove them or replace them. See if there's any weak or basic words you can replace to create better imagery. Read it out loud if you'd like. Lastly, if you'd like, ask a family member or friend to read and review your poem as well- they may catch something you didn't!


Be sure to check your punctuation as well. Though punctuation use varies from poet to poet (some may only use one period their whole poem, and others will be full of commas), review to see if any punctuation should be added, or if some should be removed as it impedes the flow of the poem.

Use analogies.",How to Start a Poem," Writing about things you have personally experienced makes you a credible author and this will allow your readers to relate to you more effectively through your poem.While it is possible to write about things that you have simply imagined rather than experienced, it is harder to recreate the scenario or translate the emotions into written word if it is not based on your lived experience, especially if you are new to writing poetry. It is possible that the message you end up conveying will be too shallow or transparent and this will make your reader less likely to trust your authority as an author.;
, Incorporating your actual memories into your writing will allow you to paint a much clearer picture for the reader because it is based on a reality that you can reflect on, rather than creating all new details.Think about significant moments in your life and try to remember specific details. Think about how things looked, smelled, and even how you felt at the moment.

, Writing about your feelings and your experiences can be very therapeutic.Writing about your past, especially about traumatic experiences, is an effective way to help you heal.


Try to share honestly about what you felt in your poetry. This will make your reader relate more strongly to your poems and it may also help you move forward through the emotions.

, Historically, many poems have been written about nature or the environment in which the author lives.


In his ""Ode on Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood,"" William Wordsworth begins with, There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream, / The earth, and every common sight, / To me did seem / Apparell'd in celestial light.In Wordsworth's poem, the natural world is the main topic. Wordsworth reflects on how nature made him feel as a child and it is a powerful experience to which the reader can relate.

, Take a walk outside or go observe people at your favorite coffee shop. Notice the details of the places you are familiar with and write them down.


Think about what characteristics make a particular place unique. How is this place different from others - is it the people, the architecture, or the regional food?
Writing about a place you already know will help you get to the heart of the place in your writing.

, Start carrying a notebook around with you everywhere and jot down details about things that you see in your everyday life. Pay particular attention to things that are beautiful or that make you feel something.


Try describing a particularly beautiful sunset or an interaction you observe between two children at the park.

, Every poem has a purpose. Maybe that purpose is to express a certain emotion or to sing the praises of a place or person. Focusing on your emotions can help you choose a topic because writing about something you are passionate about is always a good place to start.

, Some issues or situations are too broad to encompass the entire thing in one poem. Think about your topic and decide if it's narrow enough to write about.


For example, maybe you want to write about your experience being a parent. But it would be a very difficult feat to write about the entire experience of parenthood. Perhaps you could focus your energies on writing about one aspect of this situation such as becoming a parent for the first time, or your frustration with your child's sleeping pattern, or the pride you feel when your child learns something new. Narrowing your focus will help you get your point across more effectively.

, Once you have decided on your topic and narrowed it down, you can think about what you want your poem to express. Your message is the thing that a person who reads your poem will walk away remembering. Maybe you want to express the universality of a certain emotion or to tell your reader that they are not alone in their experiences. Whatever your message, make sure it's clear in your mind before you start writing so that it will be clear in your poem.

, The opening lines of a poem can be some of the most memorable and powerful of the entire poem. It is your readers' first interaction with you and your emotions.


Consider what you want to share with your readers and focus on that as you begin writing.

, An image can be a great way to start because it can set the scene for the rest of the poem.


If you want to write a love poem about your relationship, perhaps you could begin with the image of a delicate flower that grows with the nurturing of its environment (light from the sun, nutrients from the soil, etc.). In this way, you are setting up a comparison between your relationship and this beautiful flower that the reader can relate to and that will help your reader understand your point.

, Emotions can be the most powerful things a person will experience in their life. And everyone feels emotions, so expressing them is a great way to make a connection with your reader. Rage or joy, sorrow or elation: these are all emotions that other people have also experienced. So examining these emotions and describing how they impacted you will help draw your reader in to the poem.

, Events have the power to shape the course of our lives or change the way we think about the world. Big events certainly change us, but so do smaller encounters.


An exchange with a stranger can alter how you view a subject; watching two people who are clearly in love can make you want to reignite the fire in your own relationship.
Examining the importance of these events that make us think differently, even the small ones, can also impact your reader in the same way it affected you.

, Form can help establish meaning by drawing the reader's attention to particular parts or by simply making the poem more appealing/memorable through repetition, rhyme, and other poetic devices.

A few common poetic forms with a long history are:Haiku- a 3-line poem containing lines of 5, then 7, then 5 syllables
Sonnet- a 14-line poem made of an octave (8 lines) and a sestet (6 lines) or three quatrains (4 lines) and a couplet (2 lines)
Sestina- a poetic form involving 6 6-line stanzas followed by a 3-line stanza with a complex repetition of the final word of each line of poetry
Prose poem- a type of poem without traditional poetry line breaks which looks like prose but maintains other elements of poetry

, What we read influences how we write. If you want to write poetry in a classical Greek style, read classical Greek poetry. If you want to mimic Walt Whitman's flowing free-verse, read some of Walt Whitman's memorable poetry.


Reading other great writers is one of the best ways to improve your own writing skills.

, Rhyming poetry can be more memorable and can flow more enjoyably for the reader. However, this form can be more limiting in content (when you have to choose a word that rhymes with another word instead of being able to choose the word you actually mean.).


Here is an example of a rhyming poem. This is the beginning of Shakespeare's ""Sonnet 28."" Notice the standard ABAB rhyming scheme: Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? / Thou art more lovely and more temperate: / Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, / And summer's lease hath all too short a dateFree verse poems are not constricted by end rhymes and can flow however the author sees fit. As example, here is a portion of Walt Whitman's famous free-verse poem ""Song of Myself"": There was never any more inception than there is now, / Nor any more youth or age than there is now, / And will never be any more perfection than there is now, / Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.This section of the poem uses repetition of than there is now, but it does not adhere to any rhyme scheme.

, This is a good way to start getting some of your ideas on paper that you can draw from when writing your poem.


During the freewriting process, don't worry about grammar or punctuation. The most important thing is to just keep writing and never pull your pencil away from the page. You can freewrite for three minutes or twenty. It's up to you. Freewriting helps you get all of your ideas on the page and to make connections between these ideas that may have been previously buried under the surface.

, Start writing your poem and just keep going until you feel satisfied with it. You can start with just one verse or try to finish the whole thing. Take a break from writing and then go back to the poem and revise. Change the word order or rewrite entire lines. Make as many changes/drafts as you need to.

, More than in any other form of writing, diction and word choice matter in poetry. Try using descriptive words that paint a more elaborate picture.


For example, you could say that it was a dark, shadowy night instead of just that the night was dark. This is much more descriptive and gives the reader a more accurate picture of what you mean.

,


In his play As You Like It, William Shakespeare famously says, All the world's a stage, / And all the men and women merely players: / They have their exits and their entrances.This is a metaphor that compares the action of real life with the action of a theatrical play. Shakespeare says that world is a stage and all the people are actors, not merely that they are like actors.

, Analogies are comparisons between two things that intend to help the reader understand a situation or event. Usually, authors compare a known thing with a lesser known thing to help the reader understand the lesser known thing. Unlike metaphors that compare a thing by saying it is another thing, analogies say that something is like something else.


For example, saying she was as quiet as a mouse is an analogy that lets the reader know something about the subject, she, by relating a fact about her to a fact everyone knows (that mice are quiet).

Look for lines that have been grouped or sectioned together.,
Listen for sections that have the same melody but different words.,
Determine the difference between the verse and the chorus of the song.,
Identify the pattern of the song.",How to Identify the Verse in a Song or Poem1," In a song, the verses will be grouped or sectioned into four or more lines, with a blank space between each grouping. If you are looking at a song that has been written down, notice groupings of at least four to five lines in sections. These are often the verses in the song.The verses will have different content from verse to verse but they are often the same length throughout the song. For example, you may have one verse that talks about love and one verse that talks about sadness, but both verses will be five to six lines long.;
, Listen to the song to help you identify the verses. Verses will have the same melody but contain different words. The verses may also follow the same rhythm or pattern, though the lyrics or words are different from verse to verse.You may notice the same musical patterns are playing for each verse, or the same beat, but the lyrics changes from verse to verse. Listen closely to the song as it plays to identify the verses.
For example, in the song “Everybody” by the Backstreet Boys, the first verse starts as “Oh my God we’re back again/brother, sister’s everybody sing.”The second verse starts as, “Now throw your hands up in the air/And wave ‘em around like you just don’t care.” Both verses have the same melody but different lyrics.

, Another way you can identify the verse is a song is to distinguish it from the chorus in the song. The chorus is often shorter than the verse and has the same melody every time it is played. The chorus also contains the same lyrics every time. Often, the title of the song is based on the chorus of the song. This is very different than the structure of a verse.For example, you may have a chorus in a song called “Quit Playing Games With My Heart” that goes, “Quit playing games with my heart/Before you tear us apart (my heart).”The chorus will repeat three to four times in the song with the same melody and lyrics. The verses will have the same melody but different lyrics each time they appear in the song.

, Most popular songs follow a standard pattern: verse, chorus, verse, bridge, and chorus. Listen to the song and identify each section of the pattern in the song. Notice if the song follows the most common pattern, with the verse appearing first and then between the chorus and the bridge. This can help you identify the verses in the song.For example, the song ""I Want It That Way"" by the Backstreet Boys follows the pattern: verse, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, verse, chorus.If the song does not adhere to the most common pattern, you can still plot out the pattern based on your knowledge of what a verse is and what a chorus is. For example, you may have a song that has an introductory section, followed by the verse, then the chorus, then a bridge, a final verse, and the chorus.

Purchase a yardstick and a pencil.",How to Make a Wedding Aisle Runner with Poetry1," Depending on the length of your aisle you may want to choose several poets and works to include on the runner.


Select poets both you and your fiancé love. Make sure the works are enjoyed by you as a couple.
Keep context/language in mind. Remember--if there’s something in a poem that would make grandma blush or inspire your sister to cover her children’s eyes; reconsider using it.
Choose enough poems to cover the entire aisle runner. You could rank the poems from your favorite to your least favorite so when you start writing, you can begin with the ones you love initially and keep going until you are finished.;
, Craft stores have plenty of aisle runner choices, however you need a runner that will accept writing on it.


Make sure the runner conforms to the ceremony location aisle. You not only one a runner that's long enough but wide enough to balance the aisle.
Examine the runner for ways to anchor it to the ground and the end of the aisle. You don’t want to be tripping down the aisle on the runner so make sure there is a way you can have it secured.

, Even if you cover the entire runner in black ink you want to make sure the pen you choose doesn’t bleed or run, presents in bold color and is easy to use.


Consider using a pen color that compliments your wedding colors. The color could tie together décor and brides maid’s dresses in an understated way.
Add some “sparkle” to your notes by choosing a glittery paint pen (in silver, black or gold).
Make sure you can read the poems. While writing the entire poem(s) in silver pen may sound lovely, you may not be able to easily read the words (unless this is the look you hope to achieve).

, In order to keep lines straight when writing you may want to draw light guidelines on the runner that can be later erased.

Subscribe to some literary journals.,
Start small.,
Follow submissions guidelines carefully.,
Write a good cover letter when sending your poems out.,
Try submitting to contests.,

Be tenacious.",How to Get Your Poetry Published," The majority of major poets began by publishing through small journals. Small journals are usually operated independently or through a university press. They often do not pay you for your work, and the payment you do get may be small, but you can gain recognition and prestige by regularly publishing in smaller presses.Resources like Poets and Writers and The Poetry Foundation can provide you with a list of smaller journals. Usually, these databases contain information about submission fees, acceptance rates, and the reading periods.
Journals range in terms of prestige. Smaller start up journals may accept more work. Publication in slightly larger journals, that are well-known in the literary community, may reflect highly on you as a writer. Journals, like Gulf Coast for example, have been around for a long time and have published a range of well-known authors. You may want to try submitting to better known journals to help with your reputation as a writer.
However, do not disregard start up journals or smaller presses. Even if a journal is not widely known, a lot of publishing comes down to networking. If you publish with a startup journal, the editor from that journal may go on to work on a bigger, better known press. You would have a connection with a prestigious journal, giving you a better chance of having your work read.;
, With the rise of the internet, there are many literary journals cropping up online. Many writers who are now established in the literary community, such as Roxanne  Gay, began publishing through outlets like The Rumpus, Buzzfeed, and other online magazines. Look into a variety of online outlets that accept poetry. Read through these magazines to see if your work matches the tone and style of these presses.


Keep in mind, online publication is not necessarily easier. Major online outlets, like The Rumpus, may get as many submissions, if not more submissions, than some print journals.

, The best way to increase your chances of becoming a published writer is to read. Reading a variety of poetry will help you shape your voice as a writer. It will also give you a sense of what types of poetry are currently popular and relevant. You may not get anywhere writing Shakespeare-inspired sonnets, for example, but may find inspiration and success by emulating the styles of 21st century poets.Poetry anthologies are very frequently published through smaller presses. Major publishing houses do not usually publish poetry anthologies, even by well-known poets. Look into independent presses and university presses. Browse their poetry selections online and order a few anthologies there.
Attend literary readings in your community. Many poets gain exposure primarily though reading their work at coffee houses and open mic nights. Oftentimes, poets will be selling copies of their books after such events. If you live by a university, or are currently a student, there may be many poetry readings sponsored through the English or creative writing department.

, It's a good idea to subscribe to a few literary journals, especially those that regularly publish poetry. Smaller journals usually don't charge high subscription fees. Getting a copy of a literary journal a few times a year provides you with an invaluable opportunity to peruse modern poetry. It will also give a sense of when you should submit. Literary journals will advertise things like their reading periods and any poetry contests somewhere in the back of the journal.


It's best to submit to journals that match your style. Even if a poem is high quality, it's unlikely to be accepted to a journal with a style that does not mesh with your poetry. If you subscribe to a variety of journals, you'll begin to get a sense of where your work will best fit., When you start to submit your work, begin small. Go for smaller presses over large journals. The bigger journals in the literary community (e.g., Tin House, Ploughshares) get many more submissions that can be read closely and carefully. A lot of more popular journals have a submission rate between 6 or 7%.When you're first starting out, look into startup journals or mid-level journals. Resources like Poetry Foundation or Poets and Writers will give you a sense of how well-established a journal is, and it's rough number of readers and subscribers.
If you're published in a range of small journals, your voice may become increasingly recognizable. You'll also be able to draft a much better cover letter, as you'll be able to boast of a handful of existing publications. This will bolster your chance of acceptance at a bigger journal, as this increases the likelihood a reader will give your work careful consideration when working through piles of submissions.

, Every literary journal has different submissions guidelines. Remember, even small journals get many, many submissions. Readers are often looking for any excuse to toss out a submission, and if you fail to follow guidelines, your work may not be read. Read submissions guidelines carefully before sending out your poetry.Journals vary in terms of how many poems they expect you to submit. Some prefer 3 to 5 poems, while others prefer less. How you send your poems often varies. A specific font may be required. If you're submitting poetry online, you may need to send the file in a particular format. For example, a journal may prefer PDF files for poetry as this keeps the poem's original formatting and spacing intact.
If you're submitting your poems through regular mail, the majority of publishers request you include a self addressed stamped envelope with your poetry. This is so the journals can easily send you a rejection or acceptance letter.
Make sure to proofread your poems several times before sending them out. You do not want to send anything containing typos to a literary journal.

, Most publishers require you submit a brief cover letter with your work. Your cover letter is a brief tool you use to introduce your work and yourself. A quality cover letter may increase the likelihood your work will be read closely.Figure out the poetry editor of the magazine you're submitting to. You want to use the name of the poetry editor rather than ""To Whom it May Concern"" or ""Dear Editors.""
Mention something specific about the journal. This shows you read the journal and understand its style. Your more likely to be submitting work that matches that style. Mention how long you've admired the journal, and include the name of a specific poem you liked.
Include a very brief bio, including relevant details. If you have an MFA, mention where it's from and when you graduated. Briefly list any previous publications or honors. If won a contest for your poetry through another journal, for example, mention that here.
Some journals accept simultaneous submissions, but usually require you to inform readers if this is a simultaneous submission. If you've sent this poem anywhere else, mention this in the cover letter.

, Magazines, universities, and literary organizations often hold contests to help find emerging poets. Contests can help you gain name recognition in the poetry world. They often come with prizes, like a cash prize and/or publication in a journal.Keep in mind your chance of winning a contest is generally very slim. Apply to a minimal number of contests, and look for contests with small entry fees or no entry fees at all.
Some contests publish finalists and/or high quality entries in anthologies (available for purchase). So you do not necessarily have to win to be published and gain recognition. However, be sure to be careful when giving permission to be published if you are selected so you retain all rights to your works. Keep in mind that you do not have to buy the anthology you are published in, if a contest says you have to pay to be put in their collection then it is most likely a scam and/or not worth it.

, Rejection is part of the writing process. The vast majority of poets, even well-established poets, were rejected many times throughout their career. If you receive a rejection, try not to ruminate over it.


Send out a lot of poems. Publication is, in many ways, a numbers game. While you may only get a small percentage of what you send out published, you'll gain a lot of publications if you're submitting frequently.
On the day you receive a rejection, try doing something to distract yourself. Read a book, go for a bike ride, take a walk, or take a warm bath. Engage in some self care to help you mourn the loss.

, An agent can be great for a literary career. However, very few agents are willing to take on poets. Only the absolute best-known poets receive representation from an agent. Even some well-known poets operate independently. While you may dream of having an agent of your own, accept that an agent is not a reasonable option, especially early on in your career., Sometimes, it comes down to who you know. Even in the literary worlds, knowing an editor can help you gain an edge over the competition. Read the editorial board of various journals. If you recognize a colleague from graduate school, undergrad, or from anywhere else, get in touch. Knowing someone on the inside can help your work get read. For larger journals especially, a lot of work is read hastily or not at all.

, Tenacity is important if you want to be a poet. There will be many setbacks along the route to publication. Do not be discouraged. Keep submitting your poetry, despite rejection, and you will eventually find success.


Tenacity takes practice. It may take quite a few rejections before you're able to bounce back with ease. See rejections as a chance to practice become strong and tenacious rather than seeing them as setbacks.

Determine the different types of stanzas in poetry.,
Notice how the lines are grouped together in the poem.,
Check if there are no sections in the poem.,
Listen for pauses in the poem.",How to Identify the Verse in a Song or Poem2," In poetry, verses are called stanzas. Stanzas typically have four or more lines with a fixed length, meter, or rhyme scheme. Stanzas are similar to a paragraph in an essay or in prose. Stanzas often appear as the first section in a poem. There are many different types of stanzas, including:Couplets, where there are stanzas of two rhyming lines.
Tercets, where there are stanzas of three lines that may or may not rhyme.
Quatrains, where there are stanzas of four lines that may or may not rhyme.
Cinquain, where there are stanzas of five lines that may or may not rhyme.
Sestet, where there are stanzas of six lines that may or may not rhyme.
Septet, where there are stanzas of seven lines that may or may not rhyme.
Octave, where there are stanzas of eight lines that may or may not rhyme.

, Stanzas are often grouped together in a poem and set off by a space. Look over the poem and notice how the lines are grouped together. Count the number of lines in each grouping to identify each stanza and determine how many lines are in each stanza. This can help you identify the stanzas in the poem and the structure of the poem.If the lines are grouped together in sets of two, each grouping will be a stanza of two lines. A poem with stanzas of two lines that rhyme is called a couplet.
For example, a couplet would be “True wit is nature to advantage dress’d;/What oft was thought, but ne’er so well express’d,"" from ""Essay on Criticism"" by Alexander Pope.

, Some poems have no sections and appear as one long grouping of lines. In this case, the entire poem would be a stanza. This is a popular technique in modern and contemporary poetry.For example, the poem “America” by Walt Whitman consists of one stanza that is six lines long., The term “stanza” means “stopping place” in Italian. Each stanza will comprise of its own unit in a poem and when read out loud, there is often a paused placed between each stanza. If you know the poem has been grouped a certain way on the page, read it out loud and listen for pauses between each group of lines. Based on the pauses, you should be able to identify the stanzas in the poem.For example, if you were reading a quatrain poem, you would pause every four lines as the stanzas would consist of four lines each.

"
"
Slow down.,
Pay attention to punctuation.,
Watch the lines.,
Emphasize important words.,
Remember the emotion.,
Don't get too dramatic.",How to Read Poetry out Loud1," When you read out loud, particularly if you're reading in front of other people, you'll have a tendency to speed up. When you do, you'll run over the necessary stops and pauses, as well as running phrases and stanzas into each other. Slowing down will help you appreciate the feeling of the words in your mouth and each sound as it stands in relation to the rest of the poem., Punctuation is carefully chosen by poets. Dashes, commas, semi-colons, colons, periods, exclamation marks, and question marks all have different weight for poets. All punctuation tells you to do something. Usually, some kind of pause is appropriate, and you should take longer pauses with periods then, say, commas. In addition, though, it tells you about the tone.For instance, a dash often stops the poem in a way that a comma doesn't. Similarly, a sentence with a period shouldn't be read the same way as one with an exclamation mark or question mark.

, Line breaks mean something to a poet. When you're reading it aloud, consider why the poet might have chosen to break at that certain point. You don't always need to pause at the end of a line, but sometimes, pausing can increase the emphasis on the line.A very short pause is usually what's appropriate at the end of a line without punctuation.

, In a poem, certain words will have more punch than others. They may stand out because they seem out of place in context, but with more reflection, they add a layer of depth to the poem. Other words stand out because their connotation carries more weight than other words. Think about what stands out to you as you read the poem, and try to emphasize those words or phrases slightly with the tone and volume of your voice.For instance, in William Stafford's poem ""Traveling through the Dark,"" he writes about finding a deer dead on the side of the road at night. One line says, ""The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights.""
In the previous stanzas, he talks about feeling the warmth of a fawn inside the doe's body and hesitating in his next action (to push the deer into the canyon so it wouldn't cause accidents). The word ""aimed"" is a telling word, because it speaks of the car's indifference, as well as referencing the way the deer was likely killed, by another ""aimed"" car. Therefore, ""aimed"" is a word you might want to emphasize., If you read in a monotone, your listeners are not going to connect to the poem. Try to add some emotion by varying your tone. If part of the poem is sad, try using a somber, slow tone. If it's very exciting, speed up a little and add spark to your voice., While adding emphasis can make the poem more interesting, if you add too much, it's going to sound staged. Try to keep it more on the natural side of things. Many poems can be read in an easy, conversational tone."
"
Think of your main idea or point in the couplet.,
Think of the keywords surrounding your topic and end the first line with one of them.The last word in a line of poetry is always emphasized, and this is twice as true when the lines rhyme.,
Brainstorm several words that rhyme with the end of your first line.,
Place punctuation at the end of the line for complete thoughts, or leave it as an ""open couplet."",
Make sure that both lines have roughly the same amount of syllables.,
Follow your imagination and intuition to keep crafting couplets.",How to Write a Couplet1," It doesn't matter if the couplet will stand alone or as part of an 80-page epic -- the two lines should form a complete thought or idea. Poetry is about verbal economy -- using ""the right words in the right places"" -- so have a clear idea what you want to talk about in the couplet.This doesn't mean you need a grand idea or big philosophical point. A couplet could describe a flower, crack a joke, or explore your feelings on something.;
, Rhyming calls attention to the word, making it the center piece of the line. Furthermore, the last word of a line always stands out, capping off the line before it. In general, you want a unique, exciting word to end your line.


You don't necessarily want to end on a difficult-to-rhyme word like ""orange"" or ""knickerbocker,"" even if they are exciting words.
The best poets use language in fresh, exciting, and innovative ways. While you could find a lot of rhymes for ""you"" or ""me,"" ask yourself if there is a more unique word to choose.

, Once you've got a line you're comfortable and a good end word, start brainstorming potential rhymes. Write out every word that you can think of -- even seemingly unrelated words may fit in perfectly as part of a metaphor, simile, or image.


While most rhymes occur on the last word, they don't have to. Check out, for example, this couplet from Dr. Suess: ""Fox in socks, our game is done, sir. / Thank you for a lot of fun, sir.""
You may decide to rewrite your first line if you have no good rhymes -- this is just part of the process.

, Contrary to popular belief, most poetry is meant to be read normally, meaning you don't stop or pause at line breaks but instead read it out loud like you would read any other book. If you leave it open, the rhyme is subtle and feels less like a song, since you read right over the rhymed word but still get the musical quality. If you place a comma or period after the first line you generally get a more old-fashioned, song-like rhyme.


Talented poets will often mix and match open and closed couplets, such as in Sir Edmund Spenser's ""Mother Hubbard's Tale"".
For a master course in open couplets, read Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales., Say the couplet out loud to yourself. Does it flow off the tongue, or does it sound awkward? If you can't comfortably read your couplet, try cutting or adding words so that both lines are roughly the same length.


If you're comfortable with poetic meter, try and make the two lines as close as possible with stresses and syllables. If not, just focus on making them sound lovely.

, Some poets would rather write out the first line then brainstorm good words to rhyme. Others think of pairs of words they want to rhyme, then build lines around them. Still others work backward, crafting the second line as a punchline or surprise and then building the lead-in before it. Most poets do a bit of everything. Once you've got the structure down, the only way to get better is to practice.In general, couplets give a poem a light, playful, and sing-songy feel in modern poetry Appropriately, many modern song lyrics are written in couplets.

Make an explication chart.,
Choose a poem.,
Read the poem.,
Fill the right-hand column with figurative meanings.,
Try to understand the poem.",How to Explicate a Poem1," This tool is a two-columned T-chart with the left side labeled ""Literally"" and the right side labeled ""Figuratively."" In the ""Literally"" column, you will list the words, phrases, and descriptions that catch your eye from a given poem. In the ""Figuratively"" column, you will pair the literal meanings with connotations and impressions: the subtle allusions that exist behind the words.;
, If you already have a poem in mind, feel free to use it. If you aren't sure, do your research. Flip open a book of poetry and find something suitable; ask for a recommendation from a friend or teacher; or visit http://www.poetryfoundation.org/browse/ to look for poems online. This article will explicate Walt Whitman's work ""A Noiseless Patient Spider"" for the sake of example.Pick something short for your first explication. This is not to say that you can't work through a longer poem – but it will be much quicker if you choose a piece that spans just a few stanzas.
Look for a poem that captures your imagination. The process of explication may be more rewarding if you feel strongly about the poem.

, Read it aloud, three times through, for full effect.Put emotion into the lines, and try to tap into the natural cadence of the words. In the left-hand column of your explication chart, write down words or phrases that catch your eye.If you're reading Whitman's ""A Noiseless Patient Spider,"" you might notice the words: ""noiseless,"" ""patient,"" ""spider,"" ""promontory,"" ""isolated,"" ""vacant vast surrounding,"" ""filament,"" ""tirelessly,"" ""soul,"" ""surrounded,"" ""detached,"" ""measureless oceans of space,"" ""musing, venturing, throwing,"" ""seeking the spheres to connect,"" ""bridge you need,"" ""gossamer thread,"" ""fling catch somewhere.""
Your grand total of words and phrases may be more or less than the words from the example. There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer! It's all about what the poem means to you.

, Read over the list of words and phrases that you picked out, and look for the deeper meaning behind each of these things. Consider your own connotations and impressions, and try to imagine what the poet may have intended. Think about the emotions or sensations that a word triggers. Search for symbolism, metaphor, and allusion.


In ""A Noiseless Patient Spider,"" in order of when they occur in the poem, you might get: ""unheard,"" ""waiting,"" ""unwanted,"" ""dangerous place,"" ""bitter,"" ""alone,"" ""open space,"" ""string or fiber,"" ""ongoing,"" ""self,"" ""with someone,"" ""unable to connect,"" ""surrounded yet not alone,"" ""trying,"" ""trying to connect,"" ""in need of a way,"" ""breakable threads,"" ""connect with something.""

, Use your right-hand column as a figurative compass – as a guide to help you understand what the speaker of the poem is trying to say. Use your deductive reasoning, and proceed with empathy. Put yourself in the shoes of the poet, and try to decide what the speaker is trying to say. Search for a clear and identifiable theme: love, for example, or loss, fear, remorse.


In the case of ""The Noiseless Patient Spider,"" for instance, you might get the sense that Walt Whitman identifies with the spider. He portrays his soul as ""surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,"" flinging ""gossamer thread"" in the hopes that it will catch somewhere. Perhaps the ""gossamer thread"" is Whitman's poetry, or at least his words; perhaps he saw his words as his way of exploring the world and connecting with people.

Write down as many rhymes as you can in two minutes.,
Go through the whole alphabet.,
Stretch the rhyme.,
Refer to a rhyming dictionary.,
Find alternate words with more natural rhymes.,
Reword the line.",How to Find Rhyming Words for Poetry," When you need a rhyme for a particular word, stop thinking about the poem for a moment. Set a timer for a couple minutes and write down as many rhymes for that word as you can. Repeat this exercise often to sharpen your rhyming sense.;
, Take the sound you need a rhyme for and put a ""b"" at the beginning, then a ""c,"" and so on for all the consonants of the alphabet. This is another exercise that will help you become more familiar with rhymes, although this usually only leads to short words.


For example, the word ""scholar"" rhymes with ""baller,"" ""collar,"" ""dollar,"" etc.
Saying the new words aloud may help you find rhymes with different spellings.

, Most poets emphasize flow and tone more than perfect rhymes, if their poems rhyme at all. Explore ""near rhyme"" pairs that have similar but not identical sounds.


For example, pair mine/mind, green/fiend, or one/thumb. Each of these pairs uses the same vowel sound, and ends with similar consonants.

, Online or physical rhyming dictionaries provide lists of rhyming words to give you ideas. One of the most popular online English rhyming dictionaries is Rhyme Zone.


Flipping through a thesaurus or dictionary can give you ideas, but it's tougher to look up a specific rhyme.

, If the rhyme sounds forced, rewrite the first rhyming line with synonyms or related words. An easier rhyme lets you guide the poem based on feel and topic, instead of twisting it to fit the rhyme.


For example, let's say you're writing a poem about a parrot captured as a pet. Struggling with rhymes for ""parrot,"" you write a first draft all about ferrets and carrots, which doesn't strike the tone you're looking for. You could try again with ""bird,"" ""cockatoo,"" ""macaw,"" or — as Alice Hepple chose in the following poem — ""African Grey:""

, This is similar to the last tactic, but involves rearranging the sentence instead of changing the final word. For example, instead of trying to rhyme with ""purple,"" rewrite the line to end with ""a purple cast,"" ""purple-bright,"" or ""purple shade.""

Write a response to your favorite poem.,
Create a poem based on a piece of music.,
Channel your favorite movie or tv character in a poem.,
Compose a poem based on a photograph or an image.",How to Get Inspiration for Poetry1," One way to get some inspiration is to read poems that you love or admire and write a response poem. This could be a poem that you tend to read when you feel like you are in a creative rut or a piece that you recently discovered and cannot stop reading. You can then pretend that you are writing a poem that answers some of the questions presented in the poem or discusses questions you may have about the poem.For example, maybe you are inspired by the poem, “One art” by Elizabeth Bishop.You may then write a response poem that examines your own feelings around “failure” or how you have experienced failure in your life recently or in the past. You may also write a poem around a specific question or detail in the poem, such as “my mother’s watch” or how it would feel to “lose two cities.” This could then allow you to start writing a new poem.;
, Another way you can get inspired is to listen to a piece of music you enjoy and think about how you might describe the music in a poem. Use sensory details, such as taste, touch, smell, sight, and sound, to discuss the music.Consider selecting a piece of music no words or very few words so you can focus on words in your mind as you listen to it. You may start by listing keywords that come into your head as you listen to the music and then create a poem out of these words.

, Mix up your point of view by going into the mind of your favorite movie character and writing a poem based on what that character might think, see, feel, and touch in a space. Maybe this is your favorite bad boy movie character from a film, or your favorite sitcom mom on your favorite tv show. Embodying a different perspective could help you create surprising and engaging poetry.You can also try selecting a movie or tv character that you dislike or find unpleasant in some way. You may end up writing a poem that is full of humor and emotion, as you can channel all your dislike into the poem.

, Sometimes, you can be inspired by a strong visual, especially if you are a visual person. Pull out an old photograph from your childhood and write a poem based on how you felt in the photograph or how you feel now about the photograph. You may describe the scene depicted in the photograph as well as the circumstances around why the photograph was taken.You may also use found photography or images from magazines, newspapers, or the internet. You could then try to imagine how a person in the photograph might feel or think about the world.

Lay your poems out in order of use.,
Practice your penmanship.,
Create guidelines on the runner.,
Write the poems, using the guidelines as to keep words symmetrical.,
Allow ample dry time, especially if you are using actual paint pens.,
Roll loosely when dry and store until the big day.

",How to Make a Wedding Aisle Runner with Poetry2," Prioritize your poems to how you’d like to see them on the runner. You may want to photocopy the poems so you have easy access to them while you write (rather than having to flip back and forth through books).

, Determine how you’d like to see the poems written on the runner. Practice your writing/lettering on a separate sheet of paper, using your paint pens.

, Lay the runner out in a wide, open space. Make sure the area is clear of pets or small children.


Measure out guidelines with the yardstick. Make light markings with your pencil so they are only visible to you when you get close to the runner.
Determine where on the runner you will begin with the poems (toward the pulpit or the back of the room).

, Try to remain consistent with handwriting style and word size.

, Allow up to 24 hours to dry (so don’t do this the night before the wedding).

Stand up straight.,
Make eye contact.,
Add movement as appropriate.,
Project to the whole room.,
Speak distinctly.",How to Read Poetry out Loud2," When you're speaking in front of people, you need to project confidence. If you slouch or slump over, that shows a lack of confidence. Stand up straight with your shoulders back, so that you can exude confidence, even if you're not feeling confident.Using confident stances and body language can actually make you feel more confident, making your reading clearer.

, If you're reading, of course you can't make eye contact all the time. However, it's important to know your poem well enough that you can look up from time to time to make eye contact with the room. It both engages the audience and helps you project confidence., Movement can help enhance a poem, but only if you do it sparingly and appropriately. When considering how much movement is appropriate, think about the poem itself. If it's a very serious, natural poem, you may not want to use any movement at all. If it's a more playful poem, such as Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky, movement may be more appropriate.You can add hand gestures, head nodding, or turn your head or body slightly. Try to only use as much movement as you normally would in a conversation.
Don't act out every line of a poem, as that's definitely overkill.
Try not to make nervous movements, such as wringing your hands, twirling your hair, rocking back and forth, or shifting from leg to leg.

, When you're in front of a crowd, make sure you are speaking to the whole room. Those people in the far back need to hear, so you often will need to speak louder than you normally do. If you're not sure how loud you need to speak, you can always ask if the people in the back can hear you., When reading to a group, you need to make sure you emphasize consonants more, particularly end consonants. When you get nervous, you'll have a tendency to rush your words, which means things will get jumbled together. Try to pronounce each word and phrase as clearly as you can."

Figure out the poem.,
Mark your poem.,
Look up any words you don't know.,
Consider memorizing the poem.",How to Read Poetry out Loud3," Spend some time getting to know the poem. Read it through several times, and try to tease out its meaning. Some poems have clearer meanings than others, so in some cases, you may only be able to figure out a feeling or tone. Either way, you need to have some understanding of the poem before you are able to read it well.To help figure out the poem, break it down into pieces. Try ciphering out what certain similes mean in connection to the whole.
For example, one famous poem by Langston Hughes, ""Harlem,"" is composed of a series of similes. It starts out with ""What happens to a dream deferred?"" then goes through similes such as ""Does it dry up / like a raisin in the sun?"" The simile compares a dream deferred to a raisin, losing all life, becoming shriveled under the heat of the sun.

, Read through the poem, and figure out what needs to be loud or soft, what need to be punched or spoken softly. Look at where you need longer pauses for emphasis. Try to mark all of these instance in your poem, then practice reading with the marked-up poem. You can use different colors if that helps., If you don't know the word, you're not going to understand how it fits into the poem. In addition, you want to make sure you get the pronunciation right, as sound is very important to a poem. Mark the words you don't know, and then spend some time with your dictionary., While it's not necessary to memorize a poem to read it out loud, it can help you find a better rhythm if you memorize it. You'll be able to think about the natural flow of the poem, instead of being worried about what's coming next."

Use iambic pentameter to write heroic couplets.,
End classic sonnets with a couplet to ""turn"" the meaning of the poem.,
Craft an Arabic ghazal out of five or more couplets.,
Build a classic blues song out of couplets.",How to Write a Couplet2," The heroic couplet, like those used in old British Poetry and Shakespeare, are carefully constructed so that each line has only ten syllables. They are written in iambic pentameter, and the last syllable of the line must be stressed. If you're new to poetic meter, iambic sounds a bit like a heartbeat (daDUM, daDUM, daDUM), where the syllables alternate between unstressed and unstressed when you say them (for example, words like ""exIST,"" ""aWAY,"" or ""preDICT,"" where your voice goes up at the end). Iambic pentameter is all about rhythm, and while it is rarely used today, you should be aware of it for school.


Pentameter means five ""feet"" per line, since penta = ""five."" A foot is a specific combination of stressed and unstressed syllables.
Every sonnet Shakespeare wrote was written in iambic pentameter.
Eminem's ""Lose Yourself"" is modern example of iambic pentameter at high speed., Shakespeare might be known primarily as a playwright, but his sonnet's have become so famous their form is still mimicked to this day. A sonnet is made up of alternating couplets (line one rhymes with line three, line two with line four, etc.), but the ending is a classic couplet. The switch from alternating rhyme to a couplet highlights a change in perspective, tone, or theme as well as a change in form. Very often, this couplet surprises the reader, provides the moral or point of the poem, or otherwise makes the poem turn on its head.

, This ancient poetic form is usually concerned with loss and longing, but it can be built out of any subject material. However, ghazals aren't made up of your typical couplets. For starters, the first two lines must end in the same word, with the rhyme coming before this word, known as the refrain. From then on out, the second line of every couplet ends with this refrain word, but with a different rhyming word before it. The first line of each couplet does not have to rhyme, and the second to last line usually contains your own name. While it seems complicated, the ghazal is easiest learned through this example by Patricia Smith:
Gotta love us brown girls, munching on fat, swinging blue hips,
decked out in shells and splashes, Lawdie, bringing them woo hips.
As the jukebox teases, watch my sister's throat the heartbreak,
inhaling bassline, cracking backbone and singing thru hips.
Like something boneless, we glide silent, seeping ‘tween floorboards,
wrapping around the hims, and ooh wee, clinging like glue hips.
Engines grinding, rotating, smokin’, gotta pull back some.
Natural minds are lost at the mere sight of ringing true hips.
Gotta love us girls, just struttin’ down Manhattan streets
killing the menfolk with a dose of that stinging view. Hips.
Crying ’bout getting old—Patricia, you need to get up off
what God gave you. Say a prayer and start slinging. Cue hips., The blues, America's signature genre of music and the foundation of rock and roll, jazz, hip-hop, and much modern pop, was originally just a collection of rhyming couplets. In general, the first line is repeated twice (""Woke up this morning, to a knock upon my door.... I woke up this morning, with a knock upon my door), and then the second line comes in with a chord change (""And I said ""hello Satan, I believe it's time to go"" -- Robert Johnson).In general, the second line contains a turn. That is, after the first line is repeated, the second line surprises the listener by changing expectations or swiveling the focus.
Couplets are also common in many modern forms of music, and form the basis of many rock, rap, and pop lyrics.

First, consider the literal language of the poem.,
Study the structure and style of the poem.,
Determine the ""rhetorical situation"" that the piece describes.,
Identify figurative language.,
Notice the diction of the work.",How to Explicate a Poem2," All of the figurative meaning that you find will lie behind these seemingly-straightforward phrases. Break the lines down into sentences, and define the meaning of each of these sentences. Try to rewrite the poem in prose form: paraphrase the lines plainly and simply, without any semblance of poetic structure.

, Identify whether the piece is written in stanzas (grouped sets of lines) or loose free verse. Decide whether the work fits into a classic poetry structure, or whether it transcends structure. Determine whether there is a rhyming pattern.Look for ""turns""—often at the end of a stanza, or midway through a piece—when the poem flips upon itself and redefines its meaning.Identify the climax of the poem, where the action or pacing of the narrative reaches its most powerful point.
Study various poetry structures. Is the poem written in a classic and structured meter – perhaps an ABAB rhyming pattern? Is it written in loosely-jointed free verse, with little-to-no consistent structure? Is it a haiku, a sonnet, a villanelle, a limerick?

, Identify the ""speaker"" of the poem, and who he/she is speaking to. When and why is this ""speaker"" or narrator saying what he/she is saying? As the reader, consider your relation to the author: perhaps the speaker is addressing you directly, or speaking to someone else, or shouting indiscriminately into the void of existence., Look out for simile, metaphor, and personification. Train yourself to notice when phrases make connections between seemingly-disparate things. These connections can point to the deeper meaning of a poem: perhaps the poet is trying to shed light upon one thing by linking it to something else. Notice vivid imagery, allusion, and symbolism.A simile uses ""like"" or ""as"" to compare one thing with another thing: ""Your eyes are shining like starlight.""
A metaphor makes a comparison through direct comparison. It substitutes one thing for another: ""Your eyes are shining with starlight.""
Personification imbues an inanimate object or concept with human qualities: ""The stars are winking conspiratorially.""

, Think about the sort of language that the poet uses: formal or casual, abstract or concrete, vague or clear, nonsense or slang. Perhaps the poem plays with syntax (word order) to create vivid and memorable expressions; perhaps it experiments with the meaning, structure, and connotation of ""regular"" words."

Write out your analysis.,
Begin with the main idea of the poem.,
Delve into the details.",How to Explicate a Poem3," If you are explicating a poem for a class assignment, then you may have already been taught a particular explication structure. If not, never fear: the process is straightforward. The point here is to clearly and concisely explain the meaning of the poem in a way that enlightens the reader. This is not an essay, and you don't need to begin with a formal thesis or introductory paragraph.

, Explain the setting, the speaker, and the broad themes. Name the structure and the meter, if you can, try to place the poem in an academic context for your reader. Use the first paragraph of your explication to convey the big picture.


Try starting with the phrase, ""This poem dramatizes the conflict between..."", Use the next few paragraphs to explore various elements of language, syntax, and style. Talk about specific phrases and images; discuss any symbolism that permeates the work; and point out the major ""narrative devices"" that push the poem toward a powerful conclusion. Explain all of the specific figurative language that shapes the meaning of the poem.

Create a poem from the perspective of an animal.,
Write from the perspective of a historical figure.,
Compose a poem about a distinct smell from your childhood.,
Create a poem about being trapped in a confined space or area.,
Reinterpret a fairy tale.",How to Get Inspiration for Poetry2," This writing prompt may be useful if you are feeling tired of your regular writing voice and would like to try to embody a different voice or perspective. You may select an animal you find strange or intriguing, or an animal you find repulsive or disturbing. Try to use an animal that you have a strong emotional response to, as this can help to inject some intensity into the poem.To write from the perspective of an animal, you may want to start by writing down what the animal may hear, smell, feel, see, or taste. You may also want to describe humans or other animals from the animal’s perspective.
If you were writing from the perspective of a snake, for example, you may focus on how a snake may feel the grass or dirt on its belly as well as how a snake may see humans from its perspective on the ground.

, Another shift in perspective that could be useful might be taking on the voice of a historical figure. This could be a known political figure that you admire or a person that once existed in the past, such as a runaway slave or a street sweeper in the turn of the century. Think of a historical figure that may have a unique perspective on their time and write about how they might go about their day.If you were writing from the perspective of a runaway slave in the South, for example, you may consider how this person might feel about being on the run, in danger, and in fear for their life. You may use sensory details to describe the slave’s attempt to escape the plantation and gain their freedom.

, Many childhood memories can be triggered by certain smells, from your mother’s baking in the kitchen to your brother’s smelly socks. Think of a distinct smell that colors your childhood and pull out a memory associated with that smell. You could then write about how the smell fits into the memory and why it is such a powerful smell in your memory.For example, maybe you associate the smell of bread baking in the oven with spending time with your father as a child. You may then try to describe the smell of the bread and your perspective on your father making bread in the kitchen as a child.

, Another inspiring exercise might be to set limitations for your poem by trapping your perspective in a confined space. This could be your bedroom with the door locked, a treehouse in your backyard, or a classroom with no windows. You may then try to write a poem about how it feels to be trapped in the space. You may describe the space itself as well as your emotions when you realize you cannot get out., Sometimes, inspiration can come from a tale you have heard before, such as a classic fairy tale. You may have a favorite fairy tale or a fairy tale that you find particularly interesting. Set the fairy tale in modern times and compose a poem about the reframed fairy tale.Another option is to set the fairy tale in a new context by switching around the traditional roles in the classic tale. For example, may instead of a prince saving sleeping beauty, sleeping beauty saves the prince. Or, maybe Little Red Riding Hood ends up eating the wolf.

Write a poem in the form of a shopping list or a recipe.,
Create a poem in the form of a horoscope or a magic spell.,
Write a poem that consists solely of dialogue.,
Compose a poem using a literary forms, like sonnet, sestina, or haiku.,
Try a constraints based form.",How to Get Inspiration for Poetry3," Sometimes, approaching poetry in a new form can be a fun experiment and get you inspired. Take a familiar form, like a shopping list or a recipe, and write a poem in that form. You may be surprised by how placing content in a new form can shake up your writing practice and create images you may not have thought of with a more traditional form.You may want to find a shopping list or a recipe you have already written and replace the words with words from a poem. Placing an existing poem in a new form can also change up the meaning in the poem and make the poem more interesting visually.

, If you are looking for a less rigid form, you may decide to try writing a poem in the form of a daily horoscope or a magic spell. Play around with trying to write poetry in these forms and see what comes out of placing your writing a different structure., Another interesting structural device might be using dialogue that you have overheard in public places or among friends and using them as lines in a poem. You may also include dialogue that you have made up, overlapping real world conversations with fictional conversations. This could then create an interesting poem that uses different spoken slang and inflections., A literary form, like a sonnet or a sestina, can actually be a great way to get inspired, especially if you are struggling with how to start a poem. Choose a form you’ve never used before, such as a haiku or a rhyming couplets, and challenge yourself to write a poem or a series of poems in that form.


You can look up different literary forms and study the guidelines around the form., Another way to challenge yourself with limits in your poetry is to use constraint based forms. These forms have set rules or constraints that you must follow to create a piece. You can create your own constraints, such as writing a poem that only uses vowels, or use constraints that have been used by other poets."

Handwrite or type up your poetry.,
Organize the pages in a logical fashion.,
Gather your supplies.",How to Create a Book of Your Original Poetry1," The first step to making your own poetry book is getting your manuscript ready. To do so, you'll have to write out or type your poems up on individual pages. These pages will later be bound into a book.You can choose whatever size paper you would like, but it's a good idea to use nicer paper than conventional printer paper. Manuscript quality paper can be purchased online or at a print shop. You can also consider browsing paper supplies at a local craft shop. You may find a nice quality paper you feel would look great in your book.
If you intend to type and print your poetry, make sure you are able to print on the paper you choose. Some craft papers may not go through a printer, and you may have to go to a print shop to print on manuscript papers.
Once you've chosen your paper, type and print your poems or hand write them out on the pages.;
, Before binding your poems together, decide on an order. A poetry manuscript is a work of art, so poems should not simply be arranged randomly.Try to group poems by tone or theme. If you have a series of nature poems, group them together. You may have two poems that present opposite ideas, but are in conversation with one another. You can pair these poems side-by-side to make the connection apparent to the reader.
Go through your pages and watch out for any weak poems. If you're not in love with a certain poem, either revise it or leave it out of the manuscript altogether.

, Once your poems are assembled in a logical fashion, you can begin the process of binding your manuscript. Stop by a craft store and pick up the following supplies:2 sheets of sturdy cardboard, which you want to cut into the exact same size as your pages. This will serve as the cover.
Decorate paper to place over the cover
Ribbon
A heavy duty hole puncher
Glue stick
Ruler
Scissors
Bull clips

Figure out the subject of your poem or song.,
Write down a list of words and phrases.,
Pick out words with suffixes.,
Pick out words that are hard to rhyme.,
Speak the words you want to rhyme out loud.,
Change your pronunciation.,
Use sound effects.,
Try out unique rhyming devices.,
Consult a rhyming dictionary.,
Create a new document.,
Fill in the “Words to Rhyme” column.,
Add to the “Rhyming Words” column.,
Include some words in the “Imperfect Rhymes” column.,
Fill in the “Nonsense Words” column.",How to Create a List of Rhyming Words for a Poem or Song," The kinds of words you choose and rhymes you make will depend, in part, on what kind of poem or song you want to write. You’ll use different rhyming words if your poem is serious than you will if it’s funny.For example, if you’re writing a serious love poem, you probably won’t use words or phrases like “burp” or “butcher knife.”;
, Using the subject of your poem or song, come up with a list of words and phrases related to the subject matter. Write them all down on a piece of paper.For example, if the subject of your song is “global climate change,” write down words and phrases like “icecaps,” “sea level,” “ozone,” and “greenhouse.”
Include some general words that fit in most contexts too, like “this,” “for,” and “all.”

, A lot of the time you only need the last syllable in two words to rhyme. For example, the words “legislate” and “concentrate” rhyme, even though only the suffixes of the words, “-ate,” rhyme. These will be some of the easiest words to come up with rhymes for.Start by pulling out any words in your list that have suffixes. For example, if your list consists of the words “matchmaker,” “jazz,” “likeable,” and “stubborn,” you would pull out “matchmaker” and “likeable,” since they have the suffixes –er and –able, respectively.
Put these words in a separate row of your list. You can label the row “Suffix Words” if you’d like.

, For example, if your list consists of the words, “orange,” “lava,” “tank,” and “plankton,” you would pick out “orange” and “plankton” as words that are hard to rhyme. Put these words in a separate row on your list. You can label the row “Hard to Rhyme Words.”If you can’t think of a rhyme for a word right away, put it in the “Hard to Rhyme Words” row. You can always move it later if you think of a rhyme.

, Hearing the sounds of different words can help get your mind in tune to finding rhyming words. Speak the words you want to rhyme out loud and say any rhyming words or phrases that come to mind.Use this time to brainstorm freely. Don’t worry about whether the rhyming words you come up with are the perfect words. Just write down whatever comes to mind.
For example, if the word you want to rhyme is “egg,” say it out loud and then say words that come to mind, like “peg,” “leg,” “Meg,” and “beg.”

, For words in the “Hard to Rhyme” row, you might be able to come up with rhyming words if you change your pronunciation. For example, if the word you want to rhyme is “grotto,” you could use the word “potato” if you pronounce is “pahtahto.”If you get stuck, try using different accents. Sometimes an English word spoken with a Texas drawl can sound completely different than the same word spoken with an Irish brogue.

, With some words, you simply won’t be able to come up with a rhyme, even if one exists. To get past this stumbling block, let you imagination go wild and simply come up with sounds that rhyme with the word, even if those sounds aren’t words. The sounds you come up with might lead you to a rhyming word.For example, if the word you want to rhyme is “orange,” you might come up with the sounds “nornge,” “fornge,” and “slornge.” If you look at the sound “fornge,” you’ll see that it is close to the word “forage.” “Orange” and “forage” might not be perfect rhyming words, but sometimes an OK sounding rhyme is the best you can do.
Even nonsense sounds are OK. If the word is “lounge,” and all you can come up with for a rhyming word is “tounge,” write it down anyway. You never know when a nonsense word or sound will fit into a poem or song.

, Most of the rhymes we think of are either monosyllable or polysyllable rhymes. An example of a monosyllable rhyme pair is “legislate” and “pontificate.” An example of a polysyllable rhyme pair is “monocle” and “chronicle.” But there are other, less convention, rhymes out there.Eye rhymes are two words with similar spelling but different pronunciation. For example, “love” and “move” are eye rhymes. Eye rhymes work especially well in written poetry since the reader can see the patter than you are creating even if the words don’t rhyme in a traditional sense.
Slant rhymes are two words that share a vowel or consonant sound. For example, “far” and “heart” are vowel slant rhymes, while “shape” and “keep"" are consonant slant rhymes.
Rich rhymes are two words that are different but are pronounced the same. For example, “maze” and “maize” are rich rhymes.

, There many good rhyming dictionaries online. Try Rhyzome.com, Rhymer.com, and Writeexpress.com. All of these sites allow you to enter the word you want to rhyme and then search for words that rhyme with that word. With Rhymezone.com, you can choose whether to include phrases in your list of results..


This should be a last resort since your poem or song will benefit most from your own creativity. However, sometimes even the best writers need to turn to a dictionary or thesaurus, so don’t be ashamed to turn to a rhyming dictionary if you get stuck.
If you like the feel of a book in your hand, there are many rhyming dictionaries in print. Try the New Oxford Rhyming Dictionary or Merriam-Webster’s Rhyming Dictionary.

, You’ll want to have an organized document that you can refer to when you’re writing your poem or song. Get a new piece of paper or word document and make four columns.Label the columns “Words to Rhyme,” “Rhyming Words,” “Imperfect Rhymes,” and “Nonsense Words.”

, List the words you want to rhyme in this column. Leave a good amount of space between each word so you can fill in more than one rhyming word in the other columns., Take your brainstorm of rhyming words and pull out any words that are prefect rhymes. For example, if the word you want to rhyme is “skylight,” a perfect rhyming word would be “highlight.” If the word you want to rhyme is “token,” and perfect rhyming word would be “broken.”, Fill in this column with any words or phrases that are close to rhyming with your target word but aren’t perfect rhymes. For example, the word “forage” from above is an imperfect rhyme for “orange.”, Use this space to fill in any good nonsense words or sounds you came up with as rhymes for your target words. For example, you might have been brainstorming rhymes for the word “saga” and come up with “raw raw.”"

Read lots of different kinds of poems.,
If you don't like a poem, just put it aside.,
Keep reading the poems you like.",How to Enjoy Poetry1," If you want to find some poems that you like, there are a variety of ways you can go about finding them. If you have a particular subject in mind, you can find poems and writers who write about that theme, or writers who adhere to a particular school or style that you enjoy, but write about many subjects.Here are some common themes people enjoy:


Traditional religious poetry: George Herbert, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Christian Wiman
Funny poetry: Heather Cristle, Kenneth Koch, Daisy Fried, Ron Padgett
Love poetry: John Donne, Allen Ginsberg, Kiki Petrosino
Working class narratives: Philip Levine, Brenda Coultas, Bob Hicok, Karen Kovacik
Nature poetry: Wendell Berry, Robinson Jeffers, Mary Oliver
Confessional poetry: Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, Anne Sexton, David Trinidad
Experimental poetry: Jack Spicer, Cole Swensen, Ben Lerner, Rae Armantrout;
, Poetry anthologies are great ways to familiarize yourself with lots of new writers, both new and old. The Norton Anthology, or the Penguin Anthology are books full of poems in English from all sorts of eras. Read the ones you like and skip the ones you don't.


Spanish duende, French Surrealism, English romantics: there's a huge world of different poetry and traditions out there for you to explore. Get some anthologies in translation and start exploring to have fun in the world of poetry. It shouldn't be work. If you don't like it, ignore it.
Likewise, research different ""schools"" and eras of poetry that might be fun for you to explore. If you don't know the difference between William Shakespeare and John Ashbery, it's going to be hard to have fun with poetry. Check out beat poetry, New York School poetry, confessional poetry, formalist poetry, flarf, and language poetry.

, Online poetry magazines are one of the easiest way to have contemporary poetry right at your fingertips. The quality is high and the subscription is free. Here are a variety of online poetry publications in which you can read contemporary poems written by people writing today, and poetry written a long time ago:


Poetry Magazine
Interrupture
Sixth Finch
Octopus
Boston Review
Diagram

, Poetry doesn't have to be about Greek wars, flowers and trees, or religion, and it doesn't have to be written by dead guys. There's a whole weird world of contemporary poetry out there that's exciting and worth exploring. Find something that you're interested in.


Kenneth Goldsmith writes poems collaged from newspaper articles and disaster reports, while Matthea Harvey writes poems from the point-of-view of zombie marching bands. Matthew Rohrer has a whole sequence of poems based on the CIA's mind control LSD experiments called ""MK Ultra.""
Likewise, a lot of contemporary poetry is traditional, meditative, and exciting at the same time. Check out Carl Dennis's domestic songs, or Mary Jo Bang's dark elegies. These are the poets writing about life in the 21st century.

, Read the classics and read some limited-run chapbooks by contemporary poets. Read translated poetry in different editions and read poetry in your own language. Read poetry written for kids and read poetry written by dying Japanese monks. Read stuff that you don't like and decide what you don't like about it. Read stuff that speaks to you and decide what you enjoy. Read everything.


It's also good to specialize and stick to what you like. If you find a particular writer whose work inspires you or is just plain fun for you to read, research the poet a little. Get one of that writer's books and decide if you like it. You can find more works from them, and further your knowledge of the writer. You may even find more authors with the same form or style of writing.

, There's no sense in banging your head against the wall of some difficult poetry if it's doing nothing for you. While it may be tempting to only read difficult pieces that will seem impressive, it is better to start off with poetry that you can understand and enjoy. Don't dive right into ""The Wasteland,"" or you may get turned off of poetry forever.


Simpler poetry isn't ""bad"" poetry. Reading poems that you understand will foster your interest in poetry. The more interested you are the more you will read, and then eventually you can move onto far more complex works.
It is better to read poems that you can understand and internalize really well than to look at Shakespeare's sonnets and just read the words.

, Poems may only contain a few words, but you can wrestle with a few of them for a lifetime. Found something that really speaks to you? Make yourself a copy and keep it in your pocket. Read it over and over again. How does it make you feel? What imagery does the poem create inside your mind? If you take the time to develop a true opinion about the poem, it will better your judgement, and you might even learn life lessons from the poetry.

Look at the form of the poem.,
Read the poem silently to yourself.,
Read the poem aloud.,
Pay attention to punctuation when you’re reading.,
Look up words you don’t understand.,
Look at the title.,
Decide the who, what, when, where, and why of the poem.,
Think about the poem’s rhythm.,
Determine what imagery the poem conjures up.,
Look for similes and metaphors.,
State the poem’s meaning.,
Consider the author’s intent and their audience.,
Determine how the poem’s themes relate to other poems.,
Voice any confusion or concern.,
Include a list of things that contributed to the poem’s meaning.",How to Critique Poetry," Before you begin reading, you should first take a moment to examine how it looks. You can learn a lot about the poem’s organization before even beginning to read.


For example, you might see that the poem is broken into stanzas, groups of lines.The poem might have long, short, or even irregular lines that will help you understand its rhythm.
You can tell whether the poem takes the form of an established form, such as a sonnet, or whether it’s unique.;
, The first step in reading a poem is to sit down and read the entire poem from beginning to end. You may find you need to read it several times and that’s okay., To fully understand a poem, it helps to read it in different ways. Reading aloud will help you understand the sound of a poem, which is important because poetry, by nature, is related to music. You can discover the rhythm of the poem or other special effects of the words, such as rhyming., When reading the poem be aware of punctuation or lack thereof. Punctuation, such as a period, can tell you when to pause. Other times the poet will break lines off with no punctuation and so you should read on.


Sometimes poets want you to briefly pause at the end of a line without punctuation. If the poem has only a few words on each line, they’ve done this on purpose. You’ll notice this by looking at the poem before reading it., See a big, fancy word you don’t get? Underline it or jot it down to look up so you’ll be set to begin understanding what the poem is all about.


Throw caution to the wind when looking up words. Even if you think you understand a word, it may have had a different meaning if you’re reading a poem that’s centuries old., To understand a poem’s meaning and theme, you should begin with the title. Poets carefully choose their titles to set up their poem. Does the title provoke a certain feeling? Does it set up a certain expectation for the subject?, Thinking about this set of criteria will help you begin to discover the subject of the poem and what the poet is trying to communicate to you, the reader.


Who’s the speaker of the poem? You should remember that the poet is not always the narrative voice in the poem. Are there multiple characters in the poem? Who’s the speaker’s audience?What’s the basic plot of the poem? Are there conflicts present and are they resolved?
When does the poem take place? Present time? In the past? Over a long period of time or in a single night?
Where does the poem take place? Is there a physical location? In it an imaginary environment?
Why is the speaker of the poem speaking to you? What has compelled the speaker to share this poem?, Now that you’ve thought about the poem’s subject and intent, look more closely at how the poem’s meter (regulated or repetitive beats of words in a line) or rhythm contribute to its meaning.Read the poem aloud to get a sense of its rhythm or meter.
Words that are stressed through rhyme or repetition may be key to understanding the meaning of the poem.
Punctuation or words in the poem that force you to slow down may be the poet’s way of calling your attention to their importance., After reading the poem, think about what images have popped up in your mind. Understanding the imagery of a poem will help you get at its meaning. How did the poet put these images in your mind?Imagery isn’t limited to the visual. Imagery also relates to other senses, such as smell or taste, through words.The poet may have evoked imagery through symbolism, a physical object that represents an idea, value, or emotion. If a poet has used a particular object multiple times, this is a good clue that it may be a symbol. Ask yourself if that object could represent an idea instead.The poet might use allusions, a reference to something outside of the poem, to conjure up an image. Allusions are frequently references to other texts, such as the Bible., If the poet compares one thing to another using a simile or metaphor, the poet is evoking an image through words., Every poet writes his or her poem with an idea they want the reader to take away from it. Now that you’ve read and understood the poem, explicitly state the meaning you took away from it. Make sure you provide evidence from the poem for your understanding. Poetry can be very subjective and if you’ve come to a conclusion that the poet had not intended, it will be useful for the poet or reader of your essay to understand what signals in the poem brought you to this conclusion.The poem’s meaning could relate to the poet’s own life, could reflect societal norms, or could challenge an accepted idea.
Evidence from the poem can include things like meter, rhythm, organization, imagery, or punctuation.
To make it easier to follow your thoughts, reference evidence in the poem by line number.

, Different people might react to poems in different ways. Think about how this poem might resonate with someone who has a different viewpoint than you. Is there room for multiple interpretations? This will help both you and the poet understand potential different meanings in the poem., Are there other poems that have a similar theme? How is this one different? How is it the same? This will help you and the poet understand where their work fits in with other poems.


Be cautious when speaking about originality. Just because it may bear some similarities to other authors’ works does not mean it’s unoriginal., As a reader, you can provide a valuable response to the poem. If there are parts that are unclear or punctuation that you do not understand, voice this. This can be the start of a very constructive conversation.If you are dealing directly with the poet, use caution with your criticism since poetry is often an expression of the poet’s innermost feelings. Even if the poem is not dealing directly with the poet’s own feelings, creating any work of art can lead to heightened sensitivity., It is important to balance comments on what might not work in the poem with elements that do work. This will help either the reader of your interpretation or the poet understand what elements did contribute to understanding the meaning of the poem and what did not.An overabundance of praise is not useful for convincing the reader of your essay that you understood the poem. Excessive praise is also not useful criticism for a poet. Instead, be selective and explain why a part was a particularly strong.

Create a form using a poem you love.",How to Find a Form of Poetry That Suits You," To help you choose a poetic form, you should start by identifying the main themes in your poetry. Doing this will allow you to connect the themes to a form that will enhance and add something more to your poetry. This follows the “form fitting function” idea, where the form you choose for your poem fits the themes found in your poetry.If you already have a pile of poems that you have written, go through them and notice any themes or ideas that continue to pop up in your writing. For example, you may notice you often write about your personal relationship with your mother. If so, the confessional poetry form may be for you. Or you may notice you write a lot of shorter poems about love, so a shorter poetic form may be ideal for you.
If you are writing poetry for the first time, you may write down a list of themes and ideas that interest you as poet. Maybe you are interested in writing about love, friendship, or relationships in your poetry. Or you are more interested in writing about themes that are more specific to you, such as queer identity, feminism, or racial identity.;
, You should also consider your goals as a poet, such as what you are hoping to achieve through your poetry. Identifying the goal or purpose of your poetry can help you narrow down which poetic forms might be a good fit for your work.For example, if you are looking to entertain your audience, you may choose a poetic form that is known to be playful and engaging for readers. If you are looking to bare all in your poetry and discuss a pivotal moment in your life, you may go for a poetic form that focuses on the first-person and sharing personal moments with the reader.

, You can also narrow down your choices by listing poetic forms that you have always wanted to try out. Taking on a poetic form you have always wanted to use in your work can inspire you and push you to be more creative.For example, maybe you have always wanted to try writing a sonnet or a haiku. Or maybe you have always been fascinated by surrealist poetry and want to push yourself to try it yourself.
Make a list of all the forms of poetry you would like to try out, and write at least one poem for each., You can also focus on a specific poetic form by listing forms you have read in the past and enjoyed as a reader. You may glance at your bookshelf and notice poets that you read often or look at your notes in a writing class for poets whose work you enjoyed as a student. You may then decide to challenge yourself to emulate your favorite poets and try some of the same poetic forms they used in their work.


For example, perhaps you have always admired the love sonnets of Shakespeare. You may then challenge yourself to write a series of sonnets about love. Or perhaps you enjoy reading the nature haikus of the Japanese poet Basho Matsuo. You may then decide to write your own nature haikus.

, You may decide to try the rhyming poetic form if you are trying to write a poem that is lighthearted, fun, and entertaining. The rhyming form can be a fun way to create a cohesive poem that has a light, playful tone. There are several possible rhyming forms in poetry, including:The rhymed verse: This form is made of lines of poetry that rhyme. However, the poem does not need to follow a specific meter or rhyming scheme. For example, the poem “Everyone Tells Me Everything” by Ogden Nash.The sonnet: This is a fourteen line poem that follows the iambic pentameter and has a set rhyme scheme. Sonnets are often broken into two sections and the final lines of the poem are a couplet. For example, “Sonnet 18” by William Shakespeare.The limerick: This is a poetic form that is often used to tell a funny story. Limericks are five lines long with a set rhyme scheme and a consistent meter. The rhyme scheme is AABBA. For example, “Crowded Tub” by Shel Silverstein., If you are looking to write a poem in a short amount of time or a poem that is concise in length, a shorter poetic form may be for you. You may pick a shorter poetic form to make it easier to write a poem within a short time frame or as a challenge to write shorter poems. You may choose from several shorter poetic forms, including:



The haiku: This poetic form is three lines long and follows the syllable count 5-7-5, where line one is five syllables long, line two is seven syllables long, and line three is five syllables long. Haikus often focus on nature and short, postcard moments. For example, the haikus of Basho Matsuo.The cinquain: This poetic form is a five line poem with no rhyme scheme or meter. Each line has a set number of words and no words can be repeated in the poem. For example, the poem “November Night” by Adelaide Crapsey.The shape poem: This poetic form is created by using the shape of the object or subject in the poem to create the shape of the poem. For example, the poem “Concrete Cat” by Dorthi Charles., Narrative poetry are also called story poems, as they often tell a story from beginning to end. Older narrative poems have a set rhyme scheme and structure, but many modern narrative poems have a less rigid rhyme scheme. Narrative poems may be ideal for you if you would like to tell a story from beginning to end and take your reader on a journey.Your narrative poem must have at least one main character, who may also be the narrator or speaker in the poem. It should also have a beginning, middle, and end, telling a story that is dramatic and compelling.
For example, the poem “The Highwayman” by Alfred Noyes is a narrative poem that tells the reader about a journey by the highwayman on a stormy night in the country., You can try surrealist poetic forms if you are looking for ways to experiment and play around in your poems. Surrealist poetry often explores the subconscious and emphasizes the process of creating the poem over the end product. You may choose to use the surrealist poetic form if you find you are writing a lot about dreams, surreal moments, or strange encounters often in your poetry.You may decide to do surrealist poetry prompts to get you started. These prompts can help you form a poem that is surreal and bizarre.
You may also perform surrealist word games to generate content for your poems. These word games can be done on your own or with a group of poets to create writing that is surreal.

, You may decide to choose the free verse form if you are looking for a form that gives you a lot of freedom as a poet. Free verse poetry do not have a set number of lines, syllables, or a set rhyme scheme. You are allowed complete freedom as the poet and do not have any limitations or rules you must follow.Though there are no set rules with the free verse form, some poets find it challenging to narrow down their ideas and organize their thoughts without any rules or guidelines. You may want to focus on a specific theme or subject and choose a certain approach when you are writing so the poem feels cohesive and clear, even though it is still free verse.

, Confessional poetry, also called autobiographical poetry, is often written in the first person, using “I”. This genre is used by poets to explore their own personal experiences and feelings on the page. Confessional poetry may be ideal if you are trying to address a personal experience or moment in your poetry and want to share these experiences with your reader. In this genre, you do not need to follow any set rhyme scheme, meter, or syllable count. This means it is open to many forms.For example, you may be interested in exploring your relationship with your mother in your poetry. You would then write saying ""you"" to address your mother in your poem directly. You could use the free verse form or a rhyming form in your confessional poem to express your thoughts and feelings on the topic.
Try writing confessional poems in the form of letters. Start your poem ""Dear...""
You could also use a confessional tone in a shorter poetic form, such as the haiku or the cinquain. You may describe a deep dark secret in the form of a haiku or create a series of haikus that have a confessional tone.

, You can also use a poem you enjoy as a reader as a template or form your own poetry. You may take a rhyming poem you like and copy the rhyme scheme in your own poem. Or you may take words or phrases from a poem you enjoy and use them in your own poem, such as taking the last word of every line and using them in your own work.


You may also be inspired to use the literary devices found in a poem you like in your own poetry. For example, perhaps you like the metaphors and similes used in a poem and want to emulate the same devices in your work. Or you may appreciate how a poet uses assonance in their poetry and decide to also use assonance in your own poetry.

Create your cover.,
Draw a border on the backside of your cover.,
Finish your cover.,
Fold the nice paper over the front and back cover to secure.,
Create the inside cover.,
Punch holes through the pages, and front and back cover.,
Bind your book.",How to Create a Book of Your Original Poetry2," Use your ruler to draw one line an inch to the left edge of your cardboard. Draw another line a half inch to the left of the edge. Cut along these lines to slice out a centimeter inch thick strip from the cardboard and an one inch strip. Discard the small piece of cardboard and place the one inch strip a centimeter away from the edge of the cardboard. This strip will be wrapped up in decorative paper to form the cover. Repeat with the other piece of cardboard.Take the decorative paper you purchased at the craft store. Use your ruler to draw a rectangle on the backside of the decorative paper. The rectangle should be 1.5 inches longer and 1.5 inches wider than the pages of your manuscript.
Once you've drawn the rectangle, use your scissors to cut it out. You should be left with a cover page that's slightly bigger than the pages of your manuscript, as well as the two pieces of cardboard.
Go slowly as you cut. You want your rectangle to have fairly even ledges.

, You need this border to help you fold the cover over the cardboard later on. Draw a border that's 3/4 inch, and surrounds the entire cover.You can mark your border on the backside of the cover page using a ruler and pen.
Draw two horizontal lines 3/4 inch into the bottom and top edges of the cover.
Draw two vertical lines 3/4 inch to the left and right edges of the cover. This should create a 3/4 inch border surrounding the cover page.

, Cover the entire piece of cardboard with glue. Place the cardboard onto the backside of the cover page. Make sure to fit the cardboard within the border you just drew. Flip the cardboard over, so the front side of the cover page is facing up. Gently press the cover onto the cardboard, making sure to smooth out any ripples or air bubbles.Do not apply glue to the paper. Glue can cause the paper to wrinkle and swell up.
Repeat this same process with the back cover.

, Take the front cover and flip it upside down so the cardboard is facing up. Fold each corner of the cover inward. Glue the corners in place.Once the glue on the corners has dried, fold the sides of the cover over, so the cover is securely wrapped around the cardboard. Glue these sides in place as well.
Repeat the same process with the back cover.

, Take your decorative paper again. Draw two rectangles half an inch shorter and half an inch more narrow than your manuscript pages. Cut out these rectangles.Glue each rectangle to the backside of the front and back covers.
The rectangles should cover up the cardboard, giving your inside cover a pretty appearance.

, Make sure to use a heavy duty hole puncher, especially if you have a thicker book. Use your bull clips to sandwich your pages between the front and back cover. Make sure everything lines up evenly.Place your book face up on a flat surface.
Along the left side, punch one hole 1.5 inch from the top of the book. Punch another hole 1.5 inch from the bottom of the book. Both of these holes should be half an inch in from the book's spine.

, Cut out a piece of ribbon six times as long as your book is high. Feed your ribbon through the top hole along the spine of your book, feeding it through the top side of the book. Pull the ribbon underneath the book until there's only a length of ribbon slightly longer than the width of the book sticking out the top side of the book. Loop the ribbon stemming from the bottom of the book back around to the top of the book and pull the ribbon into a tight loop.Take the ribbon coming out of the bottom side of the book's top hole. Pass it over so it's on top of the book again and thread the ribbon through the the bottom hole. Loop the ribbon back to the top of the book. Feed it through the bottom hole again, and pull until tight.
Wrap the ribbon underneath the book. Loop it over the top of the book, and feed it through the bottom hole again. Feed the ribbon through the top hole once more. There should be a criss-cross pattern running along the spine of the book.
Wrap the ribbon over the top of the book. The ribbon you've been threading should be next to the other side of the ribbon you left when you began threading. Tie these two ends together in a tight knot, and tie the knot into a bow. Your book is now complete.

Review your poems and revise once more.,
Organize your poems for the manuscript.,
Consider dividing your manuscript into separate sections.,
Read through your manuscript.,
Follow all instructions when sending your manuscript in to a publisher.",How to Create a Book of Your Original Poetry3," Before sending your poetry off to a publisher, revise it carefully. You do not want to send in a manuscript that has typos or other errors. You should also revise poems for content. You want your poems as high quality as possible before sending into the world.


Comb over your manuscript and scrutinize each poem. Does it convey what you're trying to convey? Is the language effective? Does it help you adequately express your central theme or idea?
Watch out for typos and basic errors as well. You should only send out a manuscript that has been thoroughly proofread.

, From here, you'll want to organize your poems. A poetry anthology should function like a novel. It should progress naturally, moving between themes and ideas. You should not just assemble your poems haphazardly.Think of your book as the final poem in your manuscript. Just as a poem progresses logically based on theme and meter, your poetry book should have a flow to it. Figure out a rhythm that works for you. Should shorter poems come first, with longer ones in the middle, and finishing off with shorter ones? Or do you want a beat that varies, moving from a short poem to a long one?
See if you notice any relationships between poems. Do certain poems speak to one another? A poem about life, for example, may pair well with a poem about death and rebirth. You could try pairing these poems together in your manuscript.

, Many poetry books are organized by theme. Linda Pastan's The Five Stages of Grief, for example, is organized by themes like anger, denial, bargaining, and so forth.Do your poems seem to have different themes throughout? Are there certain poems that are all about nature and its decay? Are a handful of poems about rebirth?
If your poems seem to be easily divided based on theme, think about dividing your poetry book into different sections. Think of each section as a separate poem, and try to organize sections based on things like rhythm, meaning, poems that speak to each other, and so forth.

, Once you've assembled your manuscript, give it a read through. Make sure it flows together nicely. You should be able to feel a certain rhythm in your manuscript, and trace a logical trajectory of ideas and themes.It may be helpful to print your manuscript out for this process. If you dislike the organization in one section, you can easily switch a few poems around and reread. See if you like the new section better.
If you find any weak poems, simply remove them, especially if they are unnecessary to the thematic progression of your work. You want your manuscript to reflect the best version of yourself and your poetry. There is no room for weak work.

, Once your manuscript is ready, make sure to follow all instructions on how to send to your chosen publisher. Presses and publishing houses have a variety of guidelines when it comes to mailing in a manuscript. Less is generally more with poetry. Most publishers want a manuscript around 48 to 64 pages in length.Some publishing houses accept electronic submissions. If this is the case, make sure you send your files in the proper form. Many publishers will want a PDF file over a word document. If you're mailing your poems in, make sure you follow guidelines for binding. A publisher may also want a self addressed stamped envelope included with your manuscript.
You will probably have to write a cover letter explaining your credentials as an author, and giving a brief overview of your collection. Here, mention anything that would give you an edge over potential competition. For example, mention if you attended a prestigious MFA program or won any literary awards.

"
"
Make sure your manuscript is ready for publication.,
Find the right publishing route for you.,
Assemble your collection.,
Send in the materials.",How to Create a Book of Your Original Poetry4," A lot of famous poets, such as Walt Whitman, initially published themselves. This can be a great outlet for you if you're unsure you want to go a traditional publishing route. However, you do not want to waste time and money on self publishing if your work is not ready. Read over your poetry collection and try to be honest with yourself. Is this work ready for publication? Would you be happy putting this work out into the world?Seek input from others. Have trusted friends, or any colleagues you have from college or an MFA program, read through your collection. Ask them if they think it's polished and professional, and whether they would pay for a book like this. If you get lukewarm feedback, you may want to reconsider self publishing. Try to work on your poetry for a few more months before publishing your book.
It may also be worth your time to hire a proofreader. Self-published books do not go through as strict an editorial process, and many writers find it difficult to catch their own errors. Careful proofreading is important, as a work with grammatical errors can reflect poorly on you as a writer.

, If you think your work is ready, you'll need to find an outlet through which to self publish. There are a variety of publishers that allow writers to self publish their own works for a small fee. Assess what your budget is, and explore a variety of options.Self-publishing services will print however many copies of your book that you want, for a fee. Print-on-demand services will take a PDF copy of your manuscript, for a fee, and print copies of your book when a potential reader places an order. You are completely responsible for marketing and selling your book with these kinds of companies.
In addition to browsing the costs from various companies, consider other costs. Marketing your book may cost money. If you're unable to do graphic design on your own, you will need to pay a graphic designer to design your cover.

, Once you've selected a route for self-publishing, assemble your materials. The process of assembling a self-published manuscript is more or less the same as the process of assembling a manuscript that's being sent to a publisher. You want to make sure the poems work together in a cohesive manner, and that all the poems speak to the overall theme of the collection. However, there are some unique considerations when it comes to self-publishing.You need to have some kind of cover art for your collection. If you do not know how to design a cover on your own, you will either have to hire a graphic designer or have a friend help you.
You will have to figure out how to format the book properly for the publishing company you're sending it to. You can check guidelines online.
Self-published collections are usually not edited. You will want to make sure you edit all your content carefully to make sure your manuscript is free of spelling and grammatical errors.

, Once you've completed formatting, proofreading, and designing your collection, send it in to your chosen company. You will have to pay a fee. If you're printing multiple copies rather than doing print-by-demand, that fee will be higher.Once you send in your material, you should receive a copy of your book of poetry within a certain timeframe outlined by the company. Once you receive your book, you will have a book of poetry to share with your friends and loved ones.

Decide to have fun writing a poem.,
Show, don't tell.,
Let yourself free-associate.,
Try writing a poetry collage.,
Give yourself a title and make yourself write the poem.,
Write a poem by erasing the words of a text.",How to Enjoy Poetry2," Poetry exercises don't need to be dry attempts at rhyming in a complicated pattern. That's a good way to end up beating your head against the wall. Lots of poetry exercises can be fun, resulting in weird fragments of language and poetry that you might use as a starting point for other poems, or leave as a poem entire.


Remember, poetry isn't Sudoku. It's not a requirement that poetry rhyme, or that poems use stilted language from the 17th century. Write like you're alive in the world of MTV and you're shopping in the cereal aisle. That's honesty.

, Poems are made of images and little details, not grand proclamations and statements. Show us the little moments and give the reader something to see instead of telling us what to think.


Poetry involves statement as well as image, but it needs to be combined to give it more weight. For example, it's much stronger to write: ""My father's hard hat is clean, glistening with polish in the living room light. We buried him yesterday. It will always be clean"" than to write, ""My father died yesterday and I'm angry.""
This is one of the reasons it's important to read new poetry if you're going to try to write poetry. Just as humans don't speak the same language as Shakespeare in the 21st century, we don't write poetry the same way either.

, When you're writing a poem, a lot of the joy comes from leaping between images and utterances, freely associating between things in the lines. This helps you to avoid cliches and have fun at the same time.


The old comparison of lips to cherries might be a little dried out. Look for fresher, more exciting similes for your poetry. Maybe the lips of your love remind you more of nightcrawlers you used to pluck to put in coffee cans to go fishing. Don't be afraid to surprise yourself.
Be playful! Some of the best poems will surprise you by deliberately pointing out similarities in things that initially seem to have nothing in common. Look for the celestial universe in the Pop Tart, or find the romance inherent in UFC.

, Sit down with a bad magazine, like Cosmopolitan or Maxim and give each weird, over-sexualized advertisement for clothes or makeup a funny caption. On a piece of paper, write down all your captions in a column and read it out loud. Look for strange connections and moments of tension in the poem.


Use the best couplet to start a new poem, or use the column as a poem in itself if you like it.

, Poems require some kind of tension to make them move. If you want to have fun with a poem, give yourself the challenge of a ridiculous, over-the-top, or downright silly title and make yourself take it seriously in verse. Come up with the worst titles for poems you can think of. Try titles like, ""My Life is a Dead Dog,"" ""Elephant Warts,"" or ""Self-Portrait as Big Mac."" Write beautiful poems with a lot of heart, soul, and images, and make it work.


Try reversing the tone of the title to give it some import. If your title is sombre, make the first line humorous or light. If the title seems ridiculous, use something serious and shocking the beginning. That's how you make poetry.

, Erasures are poems that start out as a page from a novel, textbook, or magazine, and are written by striking through, whiting out, or erasing the words. The poem is everything you have left.

"
"
Forget about what it means.,
Read your poems out loud.,
See poetry performed.,
Take a literature course.",How to Enjoy Poetry3," The one thing that keeps most people from enjoying poetry is treating it like some kind of math problem. Reading a poem shouldn't be like reading Klingon. Poetry isn't a thing to be puzzled over and ""analyzed,"" it's a thing to be experienced in your guts. It's a thing to hear, and it's a thing to say. Experience poetry, don't worry about ""understanding poetry.""


This isn't to say poems shouldn't ""make sense."" Poetry isn't nonsense, but you need not be able to say what a poem ""means"" to understand it. More important is the effect of the poem, how it makes you feel. Find the music and you'll find the magic.

, What's the difference between poetry and prose? Poetry was written to be spoken. Read poems out loud and pay attention to how they feel, how they sound. It should be an experience that you hear in your body, and it should be something you feel. If you can't feel it, give it a voice.


Reading poetry out-loud will sometimes help you hear things that you might not necessarily see on the page.

, Poetry sometimes makes a whole lot more sense when you hear it out loud than when you read it on the page. Seek out a poetry reading in your area and listen to the poets read. Hear how the words sound and listen to the voices. How does it change the poem as it was written?


Spoken word and ""slam"" poetry is a variety of poetry in which poets speak their poetry out loud using theatrical skills. The world of poetry slams can be exciting and innovative. Scan local newspapers for these events, or check Brave New Voices for information on annual poetry slam competitions.
Look up videos of poets reading their work and pay attention to the choices the poet makes in reading the work. Is the poem the same? What does the poet emphasize that you might not have noticed.

, School? Fun? Yeah right. Learning about poetry from an experience poet or an experienced reader of poetry, however, can be a thrilling and engaging experience that will wear off on you and make the reading, writing, and study a lot more fun.

Consider your topic.,
Choose your setting.,
Think about what will happen in your poem.,
Consider the best images for your poem.,
Think of a title.,
Consider using madness as a theme.",How to Create a Gothic Poem1," Gothic poems are usually about death, night, suffering, and mystery. While these topics may be present to some extent in any poem, they are dominant in Gothic poetry.If you're planning to write a happy love poem, you might want to reconsider whether the Gothic poem is the best form for your topic. Gothic love poems are typically about unhappy love, whether it's unrequited, forbidden, taboo, or otherwise unfortunate.
Gothic poems are usually psychological as well.;
, Gothic poems typically have a strong sense of place. This place is your setting. Gothic poems may take place in a dungeon, a graveyard, or in a room that feels mysteriously haunted.There is almost always something supernatural about the setting, or the objects found in the setting.
Gothic poems are usually set in the past, often the distant past.
You'll rarely find a Gothic poem set in the future, or in a futuristic setting.

, Usually, a Gothic poems tells a story. It has a narrative, and a narrator (or, someone who tells the story.) Because the poem will be dark, usually someone dies mysteriously or tragically. This might happen in the poem, or the poem might be written referring to this tragedy that occurred in the past.The 3 main themes of Gothic poetry are love, death and temptation. Your story should include at least 1 of these, preferably 2 or even 3.
There is usually a religious (Christian) subtext to the Gothic poem, but not always.
Most Gothic poems will have both a hero and a villain in them, and employ both natural and supernatural elements.
The villain may characterize the ""Other"" in a psychological way.

, If you are writing a poem about the death of a young girl, for instance, you will want to include figurative images that enhance your text.You might want to include symbols of innocence and purity to represent the girl. For example, some images of purity might be: rose buds; fresh, white snow; a drop of dew.
Using images to strengthen the contrast between themes in your poem. For example, if you're using the figurative image of pure white snow to represent goodness, you could include a drop of blood on the snow to represent impurity.
There is often a contrast between images of light and dark in Gothic poetry.

, Some poets start their poem with a title, but many poets don't find their titles until the poem is nearly completed. A title can be used to enhance the meaning of your poem without giving away too much of the story.The best titles give a sense of mystery and intrigue.
Some good examples of evocative titles are: A Starless Night, Death of a Maiden, or The Twisted Cathedral.

, One element that adds unpredictability to a Gothic poem is the hint of insanity in a main character. This is not insanity as found in contemporary experience of mental illness, but a romantic kind of madness that leads to the loss of individual boundaries and borders.This kind of madness is considered more moral than medical.
Examples of madness in Gothic literature include Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart or Renfield in Stoker's Dracula.

Format your works cited.",How to Cite a Poem Using APA Style," If you want to quote fewer than 40 words of a poem in your essay, the quote should be enclosed in quotation marks. You do not need to start a new line to set off the quote.For example, introduce a short quote like this. Frost writes, ""Some say the world will end in fire."";
, If you quote more than one line of poetry within the main body of your essay, you must indicate where the line breaks are. Do this by including a forward slash (/) between each line.For example, cite two line of a poem like this: ""Some say the world will end end fire, / Some say in ice.""

, If you wish to quote more than 40 words of a poem, you should use block quotation formatting, which begins on a new line and is indented 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from your left margin.You should not use quotation marks with block quotes. It is not necessary because the indentation signifies that it is a quote.
Be sure to maintain the same double spacing that you have in the rest of your paper.

, Whenever you include a quote from a poem, you must accompany it with an in-text citation that refers the reader to the correct entry in your works cited. This citation should always include the author's last name, the year of publication, and the page number the quote can be found on preceded by ""p."".If you mention the author's name in the sentence that introduces the quote, include the year in parentheses after the author's name, and the page number in parentheses after the end of quote. For example: In his poem ""Fire and Ice,"" Robert Frost (1923) says, ""Some say the world will end in fire."" (p. 1)
If you don't include the author's name in the sentence that introduces the quote, provide all three pieces of information, separated by commas, in parentheses after the end of the quote. For example: ""Some say the world will end in fire."" (Frost, 1923, p. 1)
Parenthetical citations should always come after the punctuation of the preceding sentence.

, You need to cite a poem (or any other source) whenever you refer to it, even if you do not provide a quote. Follow the same guidelines for parenthetical citations whenever you refer to your source.If you are not referring to one specific page of the poem, you may omit the page number from your parenthetical citation, although you are encouraged to provide a page number whenever possible.

, Be sure to use proper capitalization and typeface when you mention the title of a poem or other source. Note that the formatting rules are different for the body of your essay and the works cited. In the body of your essay, follow these rules:Capitalize all major words in the title of any work.
Put quotation marks around the titles of shorter works (such as most poems).
Italicize or underline the title of longer works (such as anthologies).

, If you are citing a book-length poem, use citation guidelines provided for print books. Make sure your punctuation and capitalization match the example:


Author's last name, Author's first name (Year of publication). Title of work: Subtitle. Location: Publisher., Many times, shorter poems are found within larger collections or anthologies. If this is the case for your poem, use the APA's citation guidelines for articles and chapters within an edited book. Follow this example, making sure to include ""In"" before the editor's name and ""pp."" before the page numbers:Author's last name, Author's first name (Year of publication). Title of poem. In Editor's first and last name (Eds.), Title of book (pp. page #). Location: Publisher.

, All sources are slightly different, so you might have to make slight variations to each of your citations to accommodate them.If you are not sure how to handle a specific piece of information, ask your teacher for advice.


In general, if your source does not provide a specific piece of information, it is okay to omit it from the citation.
Note that when citing multiple pages you should notate it with ""pp."" instead of ""p.""

, If you need to cite a poem that you found online, cite it as you would a print source, including all of the information that the website's publisher makes available. In addition you should include information that will help your reader find your digital source.For a website, include the words ""Retrieved from"" followed by the full web address at the end of your citation.
For an e-book, include the e-book format in square brackets directly after the title of the book (for example, ). Then include the words ""Available from"" followed by the website from which you retrieved the e-book at the end of your citation.

, Once you have compiled all of the information you need for your citations, you need to make sure that your works cited page is formatted and organized correctly. Remember that the rules for capitalization are different than those that you must follow when writing in the body of your essay.Capitalize only the first word of the title of a book, not every word.
Do not surround the title of a poem with quotation marks.
Use the title References at the top of your page.Alphabetize your entries by the author's last name. If you have more than one source by the same author, use the date of publication to list them chronologically.
The first line of each citation should not be indented, but all additional lines should be indented 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) (two spaces) from the left margin.

Start to write your poem.,
Write a compelling first line.,
Describe something or someone.,
Avoid using cliches or stereotypes.,
Write a poetic response.",How to Create a Gothic Poem2," Your poem might rhyme, but it doesn't have to. A good Gothic poem is built on images, emotions and theme rather than formally structured rhymes.Don't worry if it doesn't come out perfectly the first time. The main thing is to write it down, and then go back and revise until it sounds like you want it to.
Allow your poem to be irrational and strange if you like. The Gothic tradition relies on the human unconscious to draw forth its best manifestation.

, Your first line should attract the reader's attention and invite her to read the rest of the poem. A good first line will usually include a powerful image, and introduce themes that will be continued through the rest of the poem.


For instance, your first line might be, ""Only a simple sheet of white could say/what the emptiness of her heart was like."" This introduces an image (a white sheet, either paper or shroud) and a theme (emptiness, heart - or emotions) and also a main character (a woman or girl).
There are no easy rules for making a first line compelling, so just do your best.

, Details make a poem more engaging and intimate. The more clearly you can describe the things found within your poem, the more the reader will be captured by your imagery.For example, writing that it was a cold morning is not as clear as writing that the ""streetlights were filtered with ice, and every living thing seemed to be shielded by a cloud of her breath.""
Try writing about something familiar as if you've never seen it before.

, There are many familiar phrases which should be avoided, not because they aren't true but because they're so familiar that the reader will be bored. For example, if you write about a heart, don't say the heart was weary or broken. Don't write, ""Absence makes the heart grow fonder."" If it sounds like a bumper sticker, you probably don't want it in your Gothic poem.A strong image reveals something new to the reader. For instance, if you really do want to write about a broken heart, you might say, ""her heart was shattered, and sharp splinters of it found their way to her words.""
One way to test your poem for cliches is to do an online search for your phrases. If you find a lot of results, you should probably reconsider your phrase.

, One way that poets write is by responding to other people's poetry. If there's a Gothic poet you admire, consider writing a poetic response to his poem. In your response, you can say what you feel about the original poem.Your response can contradict the initial poem. Or, your response can offer your own feelings on the same subject.
Your poetic response does not have to be in the same form as the original, though it might be.

Read other Gothic poets and writers.,
Take a course in Gothic literature.,
Share your Gothic poems with others.",How to Create a Gothic Poem3," Edgar Allen Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, or Mary Shelley are all examples of Gothic writers. Reading the work of other writers working in the Gothic tradition will strengthen your own writing.Gothic writing was the early form of what would now be known as the Horror genre.
Satirical forms of the Gothic can be found in television shows such as The Addams Family or Young Frankenstein.

, There are many English literature courses that include Gothic poetry. Even if it doesn't have the word Gothic in its title, a class in English or American literary from the 1800s will likely include some Gothic literature in its syllabus.Some course might offer more specialized Gothic Literature, such as Southern Gothic, The Romantic Poets, or others.
Look at online university courses as well.

, Joining a writing group is a great way to keep yourself writing. Join a writing group that meets in your town or share your poetry with others online.Before you join a group, take some time to find out what other members write. Some groups focus on certain kinds of writing, such as romance writing or memoir. The best group would be one which has other members who write Gothic poetry.
Most writing groups are free to attend. If a writing group is trying to charge you to attend, consider looking elsewhere.

Now that you've pulled the poem apart, it’s time to put it back together.",How to Annotate a Poem," While contemporary poems don’t always have a steady rhythm, most older poems do. One common rhyme scheme is iambic pentameter.


“Pentameter” refers to how many feet - i.e. groups of syllables - are in the line. There are 5 feet (1.5 m) in the poem, penned by Shakespeare, given below.
“Iambic” refers to how many beats are in each foot and how those the beats are given emphasis. An iamb is an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. That means it has two beats in each foot, giving the line 10 beats in total.;
, Let’s look at a stanza (one group of lines) in iambic pentameter.


This stanza is from ""Sonnet XII"" written by William Shakespeare:

“When I do count the clock that tells the time,
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
When I behold the violet past prime,
And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white; ”


Read the stanza aloud. Each line has 10 beats or syllables. Notice how it forms a natural rhythm. In the first line, “I,” “count,” “clock,” ""tells,"" and “time” are all stressed, while “When,” “do,” “the,” ""that,"" and “the” are not.
If you’re having trouble identifying the natural rhythm, try tapping a hand along as you read, tapping harder on every second beat; pa-PUM, pa-PUM, pa-PUM, pa-PUM, pa-PUM.

, When annotating a poem, an unstressed syllable is marked with a little curved line (curving upwards like a U, only wider) while a stressed symbol is marked with a forward slash. On the computer, it’s common to use an “x” for unstressed and a “/” for stressed, as follows:


x / x / x / x / x /
“When I do count the clock that tells the time,
x / x / x / x / x /
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
x / x / x / x / x /
When I behold the violet past prime,
x / x / x / x / x /
And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white; ”

, While iambic pentameter was used most notably by Shakespeare and other poets of old, it is not the only form and certainly not the most popular. Food for thought:


Some poems use a foot with three beats, which is called anapest (two unstressed beats and one stressed beat) or dactyl (one stress beat followed by two unstressed beats).
Trochee has two beats like iambic, but it is a stressed beat followed by an unstressed beat.
In addition, some poems have different line lengths: monometer (one foot), dimeter (two feet), trimeter (three feet), tetrameter (four feet), pentameter (five feet), hexameter (six feet), and so on.

, You can draw a line between syllables if it helps. A syllable is where the work naturally breaks. For instance, the word “pentameter” has four syllables:“pent,” “a,” “me,” and “ter.”


Most of the time, words will break into syllables in poems the same way they do when you speak them, but poets occasionally cheat to fit a line.
Once you have broken down each word of the poem into syllables, you can start labeling which syllables are stressed and which are unstressed. Read the poem aloud to hear its natural rhythm.

, Once you have your feet, count them. You can now see what type of scansion (rhythm and meter) the poem has. Shakespeare's sonnet has ten syllables, and therefore, five iambs.

, .


In order to identify that rhythm, it is helpful to read an example poem aloud. Poetry is meant to be heard as well as read.
In a contemporary poem, rhythm is usually created with line breaks, punctuation, and spaces. Use these cues when reading aloud to help establish the rhythm and feel of the poem.

, In contemporary poetry, lines sometimes end with periods, which causes the speaker to make a full pause. Lines also frequently continue the sentence on to the next line, which in turn can create a different meaning on each line. This continuation is called enjambment.


Take the first few lines of E. E. Cummings’ poem “”:

“in Just-
spring when the world is mud-
luscious the little
lame balloon man”



, If you are just reading the first and second line, you hear, “In Just- / spring when the world is mud-”, which can mean the world is grimy and primal, a negative connotation.


However, as you move to the next line, it continues the word, making it “mud-lucious,” which in turn can be interpreted into images of wet, beautiful flower beds filled with tiny new plants and the impending birth of flora and fauna in the coming months.
Also, note that Cummings creates his own rhythm in the poem with spaces, hyphens, and line breaks. Circle where you notice the natural rhythm of the poem breaking, as that can be important for the meaning.

, Most of us learned language as children through rhyming. It connects the poem and gives it a certain flow. Remember that words that end differently can still rhyme, and that if the poem is written in a different language or dialect, the different pronunciation can lead to rhymes you are unaware of. When marking a rhyme scheme, you place one letter by all the words that rhyme with each other, and another letter for each other set of rhyming words, as depicted below.


Let’s look again at Shakespeare's poem:

“When I do count the clock that tells the time, A
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night; B
When I behold the violet past prime, A
And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white; B
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves, C
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd, D
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves, C
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard, D
Then of thy beauty do I question make, E
That thou among the wastes of time must go, F
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake E
And die as fast as they see others grow; F
And nothing 'against Time's scythe can make defense G
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence. G



, .


Again, while looking at your poem, mark the words that rhyme with sets of letters. Note where the poem breaks rhyme, if it does at all.

, Contemporary poets are less likely to use end rhymes.

, Alliteration is the repetition of beginning consonant sounds, and assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds. Consonance is the repetition of end sounds.


For instance, the first stanza of Robert Frost’s poem, ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,"" has a number of “w” sounds:

“Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.”


The “w” sound is very soft, much like the scene; it mimics the softness of the falling snow. Summarily, listen for any repeated sounds. Think about how the sound feels in your mouth.

Is it hard? Does it want to stay in your mouth for a moment? Is it soft? Does it hiss from your throat? Overall, the collection of sounds a poet uses affects how the poem feels, and therefore how the poet wants you to feel while reading it.



, You are looking for anything that is not literal; for instance, a simile is a comparison between two things that uses “like” or “as,” while a metaphor is a similar comparison, but it doesn’t use “like” or “as.” Both of these literary devices are common in poetry, and further emphasize the imagery and emotions evoked by the poem.


Let’s look at ""Harlem,"" a poem written by Langston Hughes:

“What happens to a dream deferred?
Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore--
And then run?
Does it stink like rotten meat?
Or crust and sugar over--
like a syrupy sweet?
Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.
Or does it explode?”



, The deferred dream is compared to a series of things through the whole poem: “a raisin in the sun,” “a sore,” “rotten meat,” “a syrupy sweet,” and “a heavy load.”


Each of these comparisons is a simile because it uses “like.” Hughes uses these comparisons to describe the fate of an unfulfilled dream.

, Go through your poem. First look for the words “like” or “as,” and then underline the phrase after them. Look for what the phrase is being compared to, and underline that as well. Check for other comparisons that don’t use “like” or “as,” and underline them also.

, Look for analogies, onomatopoeia (words that replace a real-world sound, such as “meow” or “buzz”), personification (giving human characteristics to inanimate objects) - anything that isn't strictly literal. Look for symbolism, such as an eagle standing for patriotism. Underline these as you go.

, As you go through the poem, you’re bound to run into phrases or allusions you don’t understand. An allusion is a reference to something else, such as a poem referencing the biblical flood and Noah when describing a downpour. Circle any allusion you find.


Also, draw a squiggly line under any word or allusion that you don’t understand so you can look it up. It's useful to note the different meanings of these words to gain more insight into what the poet is speaking about.
Once you’ve looked up anything you don’t understand, write little notes in the margin about them to jog your memory.

, What kinds of words is the poet using? Do they make you feel angry? Content?


For instance, in Frost’s poem above, he uses a tone that makes you feel contemplative; his words are soft, quiet, and rhythmic, like snow drifts.
List the words from the poem that make you feel pensive and explain why they do so.

, Every poem has a speaker which may or may not be the poet. What does the poem tell you about the speaker? What is the speaker’s agenda?


Jot down notes, based on phrases from the poem, that give you clues about the speaker.
For instance, you can tell that the speaker in Harlem is a bit frustrated, as he or she talks about a dream rotting and exploding.

, Who is the poem intended for? Is everyone supposed to read it, or does it speak to a particular group? Pull out phrases that help support your argument.

, With all of your newfound insights, read the poem again as a whole. The poem will hold more depth and meaning.


Think about how all of these techniques work together to create the feeling of the poem— for example, how the rhythm in Frost’s poem works with the sound to create the feeling of a lullaby and how Shakespeare painted the passage of time through well-chosen phrases. Poets convey emotion through the use of rhythm, rhyme, and other literary devices. All of these elements work in tandem to create a unique experience.

""Love is no word, but a feeling too absurd to explain."",
Be in tune with your feelings and allow your emotions to stir within you.,
Sit somewhere that inspires you.,
Don't stop if you feel you are misspelling a word.,
Relax.,
Sit back and read what you have written, correcting only the spelling.,
Read what you wrote, and read it to others if it is not too personal.,
Write what you feel.,
Never try to force poetry out of yourself.",How to Become Inspired to Write Poetry," Think about something you feel strongly about. It can be a memory from your past, a very happy moment that you never expected, a moment when emotions were surging or anything else that triggers your emotions. Your poem is not only about that memory, but your feelings, as well, so try to capture them in writing.;
, You will need these emotions to inspire you. Taking a walk outside and surrounding yourself with nature helps you divert maximum attention to your inner self.

, Laying on grass and staring at the clouds, sitting on a swing, on a boat, or even at your desk will inspire you to let your emotions free themselves into poetic thoughts and feelings. Let the thoughts flow out of your mind, your heart and your fingers. Whatever comes to mind — just write it, even if it's not the final draft (and, in all likelihood, it won't be). It's not necessary that you write first the beginning, and then the end. If how you want to end your poem comes to your mind, write that first, in your rough draft. And remember, it doesn't need to rhyme.

, When your feelings have been released, your poem will, like magic, come to an end. Your poem should almost write itself.

, Do not look at your poem for a few minutes. Occupy your mind with other thoughts and tasks. Try going for a jog, washing the dishes, doodling in your journal — anything to take your mind off your poem for a bit. Doing this will ensure that you can evaluate the poem with a clear mind.

, Do not change the poem's meaning or content.

, Much great poetry is personal; part of the fun is finding the courage to read that to others.

, Poems with unnecessary, unoriginal, and untrue feelings are not poems to be proud of. No one will care for that poem then!

, Poetry is the expression of emotion, not the result of perspiration!

Start writing down words or even draw pictures that remind you of your sweetheart. Professional poets often use this technique to begin capturing words and concepts later used in verse., If you’re still having trouble, reading a Shakespearean sonnet might spark your creativity. Or, listening to audio recordings of famous love poems could help finally unleash your ardor on the page., A truly memorable poem is one that incorporates intimate details from real life. Writing about things such as your partner’s likes and dislikes, pet names and shared experiences adds an endearing touch to your verses.

, In keeping with the theme of love, look at the list of words you’ve already created. Now think of several rhyming words to match. For example: me|see, birds|words, sweet|treat.

, Will four verses be enough to broadcast your devotion? Six? Eight? Generally speaking, the newer your relationship the fewer lines your poem should have. Your new crush could be overwhelmed by a sixteen line sonnet, whereas your partner of a year might find it adorable.

, After you’ve determined the number of verses, you should decide how you want the rhymes arranged. Placing words that sound similar to each other at the end of each phrase is known as an end rhyme.This is the easiest and most popular option for a do-it-yourself love poem. If that form is too limited, however, there are many other variations you can experiment with over time., For a balanced poem pay attention to the number of syllables in each verse. They should be roughly the same so the poem will have a balanced, natural rhythm. For example: “You are beautiful/You are very bright/Hang out more with me/You’ll be outta sight.” Each verse contains exactly five syllables (5/5/5/5). You can choose to make alternating lines of verse different lengths, however. Just make sure to follow the same pattern throughout the poem. 5/3/5/3, for instance, or 7/4/7/4.


If you’re unsure how to count the number of syllables, there are several online tools to assist you., Laying out your emotions in verse can be tough task. But if you’ve taken the time to generate ideas and create a basic structure to convey your thoughts this part will happen naturally.

, If you're still wavering over your work, don't. Even writing out a few lines represents a great starting point. But be prepared to revise your poem substantially, adding or deleting words or phrases as needed. In fact, reworking your verses is a normal part of the process. According to many professional writers, practice will always help hone your lines to where you want them to be., Do you want to deliver your Valentine’s Day verses on simple notebook paper? Or, would you like to compose them on colored cardboard using glittery letters? Or would you prefer to read your verses aloud? How you choose to share your poem is another way in which you can personalize your message.

, After choosing a delivery medium, write out your words as neatly as possible. No matter how memorable your lines, if your sweetheart cannot read them then all your hard work will have come to naught. You could also type and print them out. But you lose the individual touch by doing so. At this stage you can also choose to decorate your poem with pictures or drawings to personalize it further.

, Before final delivery take the time to remove any poor grammar or misspellings. You want your beloved to be focused on your thoughts, not your mistakes. Your words should not only convey devotion and caring, but attention to detail.

""Read your poems to a construction worker on his lunch break.""",How to Become a Successful Poet," If you don't know Keats from Kerouac, you're not going to be a successful poet. Try to learn about the different periods and movements in poetry, from the Romantic era to the Beats, as well as contemporary poetry being written by people who are still alive. If you're going to write poetry in the 21st century, you need to read other poets living in the 21st century.


Poetry anthologies are good ways of learning about different poets you might want to read more of. Norton anthologies are full of historical poetry, while each year the ""Best American"" series publishes a selection of great poems published over the course of the last year. Getting a basic Norton and a recent ""Best American"" would be a great way to have literally hundreds of great poets at your fingertips.
Online, the Poetry Foundation is a great database of poetry both old and new, featuring the monthly magazine ""Poetry"" in full on the website. Brand new poetry for free? You gotta.;
, A successful poet is one who is constantly engaged with poetry, reading, writing, and revising their work. Successful poets don't wait until ""inspiration"" strikes to write a poem, they get to work at their desk, computer, or journal, treating the writing of a poem as the work that it is. Like a successful businessman heads to the store and a successful doctor heads to the office each day, the successful poet heads to the poem.


Many successful poets write early in the morning, while other night-owls find it more effective to stay up late and madly dash out their wild verses. Whatever works for you is appropriate, but it's important to develop a writing routine and stick to it. You don't need to write every day, necessarily, but learn what routine will allow you to produce the most good poetry.

, Carry it everywhere you go, so that if you come up with a poem or idea, you can jot it down. You don't have to write a full poem every time you sit down to write, as many successful poets build their poems like sculptures, by collaging together little fragments of lines, images, and found language from their image journals. Keep an ear out for weird turns of phrase and nice bits of language that might sneak into your poems.


May poets keep a portfolio or journal of all the poems they're currently working on, to have them in a convenient place for gradually editing and finalizing.

, A successful poet revises their work. Aggressively. A poem isn't finished just because you typed it up and printed it out, or because it rhymes, or because you like it. An effective poem moves a reader outside of yourself, and communicates. An effective poem is difficult to write, and will only come with great effort and careful revision. Invest in a good craft book and read lots of poetry, finding out what you like and learning from the tricks of the masters. Let poems sit in the drawer for a few weeks, or even months before you return to them with fresh eyes and reevaluate them. In the meantime, keep writing new poems, and keep reading poems you like.


Kim Addonizio's ""Ordinary Genius"" is a wonderful and practical craft book that makes the writing of poetry a daily exercise, and it's full of tips and tricks that'll help you write the poems you want to write.

, Some people will like your poetry, others won't. Don't dwell on what the haters say, but take advice graciously and continue writing and revising your work constantly. Learn everything you can from people who know more than you.

, A successful poet needs to learn about traditional poetic forms and be comfortable writing within strict guidelines as well as free-verse. Can you write a couple lines in iambic tetrameter if the poem calls for it? What about a villanelle? Studying traditional forms will make you a better reader and a better writer.

, Many schools, community centers, and libraries offer after-school poetry workshops as an extra-curricular activity for reasonable prices, where you can read others' work, study poetry, and participate in a poetry workshop. In a workshop, you'll all share new work and critique everyone's work in a welcoming environment. It can be a great way to improve drastically, both by getting an experienced teacher and other poets' feedback.


At the college level, studying poetry is a fundamental part of any creative writing program, and most English departments offer a wide variety of poetry courses that a successful poet would be foolish not to pursue.

, It's a sad truth: more poetry is published every successive year, and less of it is read by the average reader. There are literally hundreds of high-quality literary magazines publishing poets like you, people who engage with poems, love reading them, and want their voice to be heard.


Book prizes are also common, for a small reading fee. If you've got enough poems to put a book together, try entering your manuscript and seeing what happens. You might even win some money.

, Walt Whitman worked as an ambulance driver and a nurse while he wrote his classic American poems, while Frank O'Hara worked at an art museum and wrote poems on his lunch break. Many poets seek careers in academic fields, while others become musicians, truck drivers, or parents. Whatever you do, keep writing your poems, and take your art seriously.

, Amiri Baraka, mid-century American Poet and performer, famously offered the advice that poets should read their poems to construction workers on their lunch break, and that if they didn't get beaten over the head, they might actually have something. It's good advice. There's a lot of noise in the world, and your rhyming poem about a bird on your windowsill might have a hard time cutting through the noise. A successful poet finds some way to do just that.

Revise the sestina for rhythm, sound, and flow.,
Give the sestina a title.",How to Write a Sestina," Sestinas often explore a theme or idea in detail. Themes like love, death, war, loss, and nature are all good options. Try to interpret a theme or idea from your perspective. Ask yourself, What does love or war mean to me? How has loss and death affected my life? What can I say that is unique or new about nature?For example, you may write a sestina about love by focusing on your love for your older sister. You may compose the sestina with memories or feelings you associate with your sister.

, You can also focus on a memorable event or experience in your life as inspiration for the sestina. Think of any event that was life changing for you or that shifted your view on the world. Write about an experience that affected you in a big way as a person.

For example, you may write a sestina about your first kiss or your first time swimming in the ocean.

, The sestina follows a strict pattern where you use the six end words of the first stanza in the remaining five stanzas. Each stanza is six lines long. The poem ends with a three line envoi, also known as a tornada. If you label each word with a letter (e.g. A, B, C, D, E, F), the poem will follow this line pattern:Stanza 1: A, B, C, D, E, F
Stanza 2: F, A, E, B, D, C
Stanza 3: C, F, D, A, B, E
Stanza 4: E, C, B, F, A, D
Stanza 5: D, E, A, C, F, B
Stanza 6: B, D, F, E, C, A
Envoi: B, E
Envoi: D, C
Envoi: F, A
The envoi much include the remaining three end words in the poem. This way, the six recurring words appear in the final three lines of the poem.
A sestina does not have to rhyme.

, Study successful examples of the form so you get a better sense of how to write your own. 19th century poets as well as modern poets have used the sestina to express their emotions, including:“Sestina: Alforte” by Ezra Pound“Farm Implements and Rutabagas in a Landscape” by John Ashbery“A Miracle for Breakfast” by Elizabeth Bishop“O Light Red Light” by Cathy Park Hong, Choose six words that are versatile and evocative. You will need to reinterpret these six words throughout the poem, so go for words that are specific enough but also open to interpretation. You may choose a few words that are nouns or verbs. Avoid using adjectives, unless you feel you can interpret the adjective more than one way.For example, for a poem about your love for your older sister, you may choose: “sister, share, hold, learn, bright, blood.”

, Rather than try to write each stanza of the sestina in order, arrange the six repeating words in their set places using the pattern of the sestina. Then, write around them, focusing on describing your subject in detail. Try to interpret the chosen words in different ways each time they appear in the poem.For example, you may have one line refer to your sister as a “bright star” and another line later refer to the “bright look on her face.”

, Sestinas do not have to rhyme and many modern sestinas do away with rhyme completely. But you can integrate rhyme into the lines of your sestina to give it more rhythm. Try rhyming two words side by side in one line of the sestina to give the sestina an interesting sonic quality.For example, you may use a rhyme like “blood good” or “bright might.”

, Metaphors are when you compare one thing to another. For example, “My sister is a blood flower in winter.” Similes are when you compare one thing to another using “like” or “as.” For example, “My sister is like a bright star at night.” Using metaphors and similes in your sestina will make it stronger and more engaging.Often, metaphors are considered more effective than similes.
Try using a mix of metaphors and similes to add variety to your sestina.

, Integrate the five senses into the sestina, focusing on how your subject looks, sounds, feels, tastes, and smells. Describe the subject using rich imagery that is particular and unique. Avoid cliche or familiar imagery, as this will weaken the poem.For example, for a poem about your older sister, you may focus on how she smells when she’s angry or upset, or how she sounds when she being affectionate towards you.

, A good sestina will use the last three lines of the poem to wrap things up in a dramatic way. You may choose to flip around the meanings of the six recurring words for a dramatic finish. Or you may wrap up a narrative with a strong ending in the last three lines of the poem.For example, in Ezra Pound’s “Sestina: Alforte,” he uses exclamation marks and a reinterpretation of the word “peace” to end the poem: “And let the music of the swords make them crimson!/Hell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!/Hell blot black for always the thought “Peace!””

, Once you have a draft of the sestina, read it aloud to yourself. Listen to how the words sound in each stanza. Notice if each stanza flows well into one another. Underline or circle any awkward lines so you can revise them later.You can also read the sestina aloud to others to get their feedback. Ask them to tell you how it sounds as you read it aloud to them.

, Get constructive criticism about the sestina from peers, friends, teachers, and family members. Ask them if they feel the sestina flows well and explores a certain theme or idea clearly. Have them give you suggestions on ways you can improve the poem and make it better., Go through the sestina and make sure it has a certain rhythm to it. Confirm it follows the strict pattern for a sestina. Look for interesting sounds made by pairing certain words or lines together. Make sure all the words in the sestina are spelled correctly and that the punctuation and grammar is correct., You can use a line that you like from the sestina as the title or title the sestina with the theme or idea explored in it. You may also title it simply “Sestina,” though this may not be the most exciting way to get a reader’s attention.

For example, a title for a sestina about your older sister might be, “Sestina: My Sister,” or “Bright, Blood, Sister.”

In the hustle and bustle of life, it can be easy to forget that there are special moments and beautiful places all around us. By being fully present and engaging with your surroundings, you can begin to see meaning where you may have missed it before.Poets find ways to make the ordinary extraordinary. When you see the beauty in everyday mundane things, you begin to tease out the hidden significance of everything around you.
Start out by appreciating the things your body does everyday without thought, like breathing or coordinating your movements.
Expand outward to think about how every individual interacts with his or her environment, and consider how amazing it is that you can be a part of that person's world (and vice versa).

, It can be very easy to end up spending a lot of time waiting without realizing that you've lost that time. If you're at work and it's almost time to go home, you probably count down the minutes and seconds instead of finishing up your day's assignments. The same is true of how we wait for future events: the weekend, an exciting vacation, retirement, and so on. Try to stop living for the future and start appreciating the fact that you have a chance to live a meaningful life right here and now., This may be difficult if you're not used to being creative. However, everyone is an artist in some capacity. Even if you are just feeding and walking your dog, there is still a deliberate method to what you do. And ultimately your actions in caring for that dog contribute towards something larger than yourself and your own life.No matter what you do, in work or in your personal life, there is a way to live your life creatively and artistically.
If you work as an accountant, for example, you can think of yourself as someone who brings balance and a sense of order to the world.
Let your creativity touch and inspire others around you. People will recognize that you see yourself as an artist, and they in turn may begin to see themselves as being a part of something poetic.

, If you are committed to being more poetic in your life, you may want to try speaking poetically. Though there are no firm guidelines for poetic speech, poets typically use figurative language - that is, language that relies heavily on figurative (instead of literal) speech.The most commonly-used forms of figurative language include:


Simile - a comparison between two unrelated things using ""like"" or ""as."" For example, ""Her eyes are like diamonds"" is a simile.Metaphor - a comparison between two unrelated things that illustrates shared qualities of each thing without using ""like"" or ""as."" For example, ""His heart is a broken piñata"" would be a metaphor.Hyperbole - a hyperbole is an extreme or unrealistic exaggeration, typically for dramatic, humorous, or ironic effect. For example, ""I'm so hungry I could eat a horse"" is a hyperbole., Another way to become more poetic in your interactions with others is by expanding your vocabulary. By incorporating new words into your daily interactions, you can develop a more poetic range of speech.You can learn new words by consulting a thesaurus. Any time you're tempted to use an old, familiar word, look it up in the thesaurus to find a suitable synonym.
Subscribe to an email list that sends out new vocabulary words. Garner's Usage Tip of the Day, Vocab Vitamins, Wordsmith, and websites like The New York Times and the Oxford English Dictionary all have word of the day subscriptions.

, Poetry dates back thousands of years, with every region of the world having its own distinct poets and styles of poetry. If you're new to reading poetry, you may be feeling overwhelmed and unsure of where to begin. Novice poetry readers may find it easiest to start with poetry that uses contemporary language, though every reader's tastes and preferences are different.


Try an online poetry database like the Poetry Foundation. You can search through thousands and thousands of poems by subject, poet, occasion, school/period, and geographical region.Explore different poets and different styles of poetry until you find someone or something that is highly engrossing. Discovering poetry that you're very fond of will make it easier for you to fully engage with the text.

, Reading poetry is very different from reading prose. If you're new to the genre, it may seem confusing and even intimidating. Learning how to properly read a piece of poetry will help you better understand the poet's stylistic choices and may allow you to walk away with a deeper understanding of the poem's meaning.Set aside any assumptions you may have about a particular poet, his or her work, or poetry in general. Every poem is different, so you'll want to approach each piece of writing as a unique experience.
Remember that poetry is not written like prose. Poets may play with spacing, word choice, and organization on the page to create distinctly original pieces of writing.
Line breaks help the reader find the poet's intended breath of each line. However, some lines in free-verse and experimental poetry are irregular and don't follow any metrical order.
Recognize that poetry is essentially about capturing a moment. A poem may not have a logical beginning, middle, and end, but it should cause you to have some type of emotional reaction and sense something deeper beyond the words on the page.

, Once you're comfortable reading poetry to yourself, you may want to take the next step and learn how to read poetry out loud. Hearing a poem can be a drastically different experience than reading it on a page. Many poems were meant to be heard out loud, either because of the pleasing sound combinations those poems produce or because the poem is an oral tradition passed on to others (especially in ancient poetry). If you're serious about becoming more poetic, you may want to try experiencing the sounds of spoken verse out loud.Read slowly. Don't rush through each line; take the time to savor the interplay of language and imagery.
Pause when you encounter punctuation, rather than pausing at the end of every single line break. This will make the poem less choppy and more clear to listeners, should you decide to read a poem in front of an audience.
Don't try to use a ""dramatic"" voice; just read the lines in your normal speaking voice and tone.
If you encounter a word you don't know or aren't sure how to pronounce, look it up in the dictionary. You owe it to the poet to understand his or her word choice and arrangement, so keep a dictionary on hand whenever you read.

, Hearing practicing poets read their work out loud can be a great way to get inspired or just develop a better understanding of how poetry sounds and feels. You don't have to wait for a world-renowned poet to come through your town, either - many colleges, bookstores, coffee shops, and bars host poetry readings for both published poets and amateur writers.


You can find a listing of poetry readings in your community by searching online. Even small towns should hold some type of reading series, especially if you live near a college or university.
Start out going to readings just to hear other poets and experience the sounds of poetry. As you get more comfortable living poetically, though, you may even want to bring your own poem(s) to read in front of an audience.

, Poetry classes can help you learn about a range of different poets, types of poetry, and styles or techniques in poetry. You can take a poetry literature course, which focuses on reading and analyzing the poetry of others, or you can take a creative writing course/workshop, which can help you write your own poetry.


Check your local college or community college for academic classes in poetry.
You can also take poetry classes or workshops for free through community centers, poetry organizations, or certain nonprofit groups.
Search online for opportunities to study and write poetry in a class setting in your community.

, Any moment, whether experienced or imagined, can become the source for a poem. You may want to capture a life-altering experience in your life, but some of the best poems have been written about otherwise mundane moments. A skilled poet can capture the essence of any moment and impart it with meaning and significance.Explore every aspect of the moment you choose.Consider what it felt like living that moment when it was fresh, as well as how it appears now that the moment has passed.
Don't overlook the everyday moments of your lives. A moment spent waiting in fear or apprehension, for example, could make for a powerful and moving poem.

, If you've chosen a relatively commonplace moment to write about, think about what could make that moment interesting or meaningful to a reader. That doesn't necessarily mean falsifying the moment; rather, it means looking for a different approach to a familiar sight, sound, smell, or concept.Instead of just seeing what people are doing in a given moment, imagine the private lives of those people. Think about what they do or don't do, what motivates them, and what makes them happy or sad.
You can also apply this method to physical places. Look past a building's four walls and think about what might have transpired within a given place and what it might have meant in someone else's life.

, You may be afraid to personalize your poems for fear that a reader might disagree with you. However, a good poem should convey the poet's thoughts, opinions, and feelings on whatever is being written about.Every poem has a theme. This is the central ""topic"" of the poem.
A strong poem will expand on the theme with the poet's opinions and beliefs regarding that topic. This makes it more powerful as well as more meaningful, and it separates your poem from every other poem on a given subject.

, Some of the best poetry plays with words to produce unexpected phrasings and enjoyable sounds. This can take a lot of work, and it may involve some trial and error in replacing or entirely removing certain words to test the effects of those choices.Say the words out loud to see how they sound, both individually and with one another.
Remove unnecessary words, including words like ""and,"" ""then,"" and ""because."" Many of these and other words can be removed without causing the poem to lose clarity.
Try swapping out familiar or overused words with something new. Let yourself be surprised and see how the poem turns out differently with those changes.

, A simile is a comparison using ""like"" or ""as.""A metaphor uses one word, phrase, or concept to stand in for another word, phrase, or concept to show an otherwise abstract relationship.For example, a metaphor for beautiful eyes might be written, ""Her eyes are deep pools of mystery and misunderstanding."" A simile for beautiful eyes might be, ""Her eyes are like deep pools that contain uncharted beauty.""


Poetry often relies heavily on similes and metaphors for their imagistic effect and their ability to relate two seemingly-disparate things in a short span of space.
Think about what a word really means, and find words that express similar things. For example, drowning can literally mean being incapable of swimming, but it can also describe a sense of feeling overwhelmed or overpowered.
Think about the symbolism of any words you choose. Even if you don't intend a word to carry a given symbolic meaning, some readers may interpret your work that way.

, Abstract words are concepts, feelings, or ideas that are intangible. While most people recognize what abstract words like ""happiness"" or ""sadness"" mean, it's much more difficult to create an image of those emotions with written words. Instead, poets rely on concrete words, which can be described using the five senses.Instead of saying that a person is happy, use concrete words to describe that person's smile or the look in their eyes.
You can also use a metaphor or simile with concrete words for added effect. For example, you might convey that a person was happy by saying, ""A smile cracked her stern face like ripples across a still pond.""

Decide what kind of poem you would like to write.,
Find a source of inspiration such as nature, a strong emotion, a beautiful or engaging image.,
Come up with one word or topic (from your source of inspiration) and list words or phrases associated with that topic, for example, for ""love,"" red roses, white doves, love letters/poems, light, hope, romance, family/friends, etc.,
Even in ""confessional"" or personal poetry, don't just write about emotions.,
Pay attention to strong or unusual images as you go about your life.,
Use a thesaurus.,
When you've finished your first draft, read it over and see if you've been unnecessarily repetitive.,
If you didn't start with a title, read over what you've written and write a title that either introduces, sums up, or perhaps gives a twist on what the poem says.,
You have become a ""poet""!

",How to Be a Poet," The external links explain different types of poems and descriptions of each.;
, If you're going through a life (or love!) crisis, or maybe a problem such as an addiction, use your experience to provide a topic. You may want to begin with a title to focus your thoughts. Or just start with whatever is on your mind. Perhaps you are feeling sad or angry, or maybe you're missing someone or feeling other internal pain. Let your thoughts flow on the paper until you don't have anything more to add.

, (For example, if you want to write about doomed romance, you can get ideas from Romeo and Juliet.)

, Tell the reader what you did, what you touched, specific memories, or make comparisons to nature or the world. Readers are curious to learn about you, but in order to touch readers and make them care about your poem, you've got to relate your confession to someone or something else. Draw a connection between yourself and the reader, or better yet, a surprising connection that makes the reader think ""aha!"". That being said ...

, Perhaps you see a bug struggling to get across a deep crack in the sidewalk. Describe the scene in words so that a reader has the feeling of seeing it for themselves. You can even add what the scene reminds you of in your own life.

, Poetry is about using as few words as possible, but using ""beautiful"" words to describe what you are writing about.

, Move sections around and see what version has the most impact.

, For instance, if you were writing about a bad love affair, a title like ""Rotten Apple"" might get any readers off in the mood you want.


However, don't add a title just to have one. Many fine poems are listed simply as ""Untitled"".

Identify your strongest poems.,
Find a unifying theme or form.,
Have a narrative arc.,
Link certain poems together.,
Put your strongest poem first.,
Leave out poems that do not fit with the whole.,
Read the collection out loud from start to finish.,
Consider dividing the collection into sections.,
Do a spelling and grammar check.,
Determine the page count of the collection.,
Include a title page.,
Add a table of contents.,
Put in an about the author page and an acknowledgements page.",How to Arrange Your Poems for a Poetry Collection," Start by reading through your poems one by one. You may have a stack of forty to fifty poems that you are considering or a pile of hundreds. Read each poem and then put them in two piles: strong and weak. You can then look more closely at the poems in the strong pile and include these in the collection.When you are putting poems in these piles, do not put too much stock in poems that have already been published or have won accolades. You should try to use your own judgement when deciding if a poem is strong or weak and not rely on outside opinions.You should also use this step to help you select poems for the collection and not as an organizing principle. Ordering your poems from strongest to weakest in a collection will not showcase your best work as a whole and may leave the reader deflated or disinterested by the time they get to the end of the book.;
, Many successful poetry collections will present a unified theme to the reader and include poems that speak to this theme. This will allow the reader to connect to the poems on a poem-by-poem level and the collection as a whole.For example, you may read through your poems and realize many of your strongest poems discuss queerness and being the outsider in a group. You may then use queerness as the theme for your poems and make sure that each poem relates back to this theme.
You may also notice that many of your strongest poems follow a specific poetic form, such as the sonnet or the haiku. You may then decide to use this poetic form as the unifier and only include poems that use this form.

, The collection should feel like it has a beginning, middle, and end, where you should start somewhere and end up somewhere else. The goal should be to take the reader on an emotional journey. The journey may end with a resolution of some kind or a conclusion.Think about how each poem sets a certain mood or tone and then place them side by side. Notice if the mood or tone shifts if you place one poem next to another.
For example, you may notice that you have a poem about being queer in high school and another poem about being queer as an adult. You may decide to place several poems after the high school poem so there is a build up and a change that happens by the time the reader gets to the adult poem about queerness.
As well, if you have recurring images or phrases in your poems, you may spread them out so they do not feel clustered together. You may also notice that certain poems fit together better side by side and certain poems become more meaningful when they fall at a certain point in the narrative arc of the collection.

, You can also try linking your poems together so they make sense on a micro level. This is often done with poems that feel more emotional and abstract. You may link poems together based on wording used in each poem or images that feel connected.For example, you may note a certain color in one poem and link it with another poem that explores the same color in a more abstract way. Or, you may link three poems together based on a repeated line or an image they all share.

, Like the first line of a novel, the first poem in your collection is crucial. It will tell your reader what they can expect in the rest of the collection and compel them to continue reading. You should try to have your strongest poem as the first poem in your collection so you can showcase your best work upfront.You may also decide to then alternate between stronger poems and weaker poems so the reader gets a wide sample of your voice and so the stronger poems can help to illuminate weaker poems.
However, you should not try to hide really weak poems by using stronger poems as a distraction. Your reader will likely notice this and question why weaker poems were included in the collection in the first place.

, You should be willing to let go of poems that do not fit with the rest or that do not mesh with the collection as a whole. Part of arranging a strong poetry collection is being willing to admit when a poem does not work and needs to be cut.Remember that you can always save any poems that are cut for future collections or other projects. Just because a poem does not fit with your current collection does not mean it will not find a home among other poems in the future.

, Once you have organized your poems into a collection, you should read it out loud to yourself from start to finish. Listen to how each poem sounds next to each other and notice if there is a build up of emotion, mood, and tension as the collection progresses.You should also read the collection out loud to a trusted friend or peer and allow them to read the collection on their own. They may be able to give you useful feedback and constructive criticism about the ordering of your poems. Having a second pair of eyes on the collection will likely only make it better.

, You may decide to frame the collection by dividing it into sections. You may divide the poems based on the narrative arc of the collection, such as poems that discuss the beginning, poems that discuss the middle, and poems that discuss the end. Or, you may break up the poems based on a theme or on specific images.Many poetry collections do not title or name the sections, as titles can feel too obvious and telling to the reader. If you decide to include section titles, try to make them still appear mysterious to the reader so the reader does not feel they are being told what to expect in each section.
You may decide to begin and end each section with strong poems that link each section together. This will help to book end each section but still allow the sections to link together into a cohesive whole.
Keep in mind you do not need to have sections in your collection, especially if you feel the collection does better without any breathing space or any interruptions. Some poetry collections benefit from having a straight narrative with no breaks or sections.

, You should also polish up the language in the collection to ensure it is grammatically correct and free of misspelled words. Do not rely on the spellcheck feature on your computer to do this for you. Instead, read the collection backwards, starting at the last page and moving backward. This will allow you to pay attention to each word and ensure it appears correctly on the page.Because you are writing poetry and access your creativity, you may decide to play around with language. If there is a misspelled word or a grammatically incorrect sentence in your poems, it should be there on purpose and it should be obvious to the reader that it is intentional.

, Most poetry collections range from 50 to 70 pages.Often, less is more when it comes to poetry collections. Avoid overwhelming the reader with too many poems and too many sections. Try to keep the poetry collection concise, but still true to your artistic vision.


If you are planning to send your poetry collection a specific publisher, find out their page count requirements and try to fulfill them. You may end up cutting down more poems once you work with an editor, which will then affect your page count.

, Your poetry collection should have a title page, with the title and the author name. You may use your own name or a pen name that you have used in publishing before.You may decide to title your poetry collection at the very end, once it has been organized and put together. You may come up with one word or several words that best describe the poetry collection, to you. Or, you may decide to use a phrase mentioned in one of your poems as the title for the collection.

, Most poetry collections will have a table of contents page following the title page. This page is a chance for you to show off the arrangement of your collection and present the order to your reader. Make sure you include the title of each poem in sequence on the table of contents page., You should include an about the author page at the very end of your manuscript, usually as the last page. Provide biographical information on this page and include a professional photograph of yourself, if you’d like.You may also decide to have the acknowledgements page at the very end of the manuscript, or at the front of the manuscript, after the title page. The acknowledgements page is your chance to say thank you to those who helped you complete the collection. If the poem has been published in other journals, make sure you credit these literary journals by name.
Keep in mind an acknowledgements page is optional and not mandatory in the formatting of your collection. Some poetry collections have an acknowledgements page and some collections do not.

Use the Shakespearean rhyme scheme.,
Write your lines in iambic pentameter.Iambic pentameter is a type of poetic meter, meaning that it’s a way of measuring out the rhythm of a line.,
Vary your meter from time to time.,
Follow the Shakespearean sonnet's stanzaic structure.,
Develop your stanzas thoughtfully.,
Choose your subject matter carefully.,
Write your Shakespearean sonnet.",How to Write a Sonnet1," The Shakespearean sonnet is a good place to start if you’re a novice sonneteer because it has the most regular and straightforward rhyme scheme and structure. The rhyme scheme of a Shakespearean sonnet always follows this pattern:


ABABCDCDEFEFGGThese letters represent the sound that appears at the end of each line.
So, following this pattern of alternating rhymes, we find that the last words of the first and third lines must rhyme; the second and fourth; the fifth and seventh; the sixth and eighth; and so on, ending in a final rhyming couplet.;
, Iambic pentameter is a very regular meter and is one of the most common meters in English-language poetry.


“Pentameter” derives from the Greek word pente (meaning five), and thus has five poetic ""feet."" Each foot is a unit of two syllables; thus, there are ten syllables in a line of pentameter.
“Iambic” means that each foot is an “iamb.” Iambs are comprised of an unstressed, followed by a stressed syllable, resulting in a “ta-TUM” rhythm. The word “hel-LO” is an example of an iambic foot.
So a line of iambic pentameter is a line of five iambic feet, resulting in a 10-syllable rhythm of ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM.
An example of a line of iambic pentameter is “Shall I / comPARE/ thee TO / a SUM / mer's DAY?” (from Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 18”), Although the majority of the lines in a Shakespearean sonnet should be written in iambic pentameter, the rhythm can get plodding and predictable if you use it exclusively. By varying the stress pattern slightly at key moments, you can break up the pattern and make the poem more aurally interesting for the reader, and also use the variation to draw attention to key phrases in your poem.


For example, the third line of Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 18” begins with a spondee, meaning two stressed syllables in a row: TUM-TUMAfter two lines of perfect iambic pentameter, he wrote: “ROUGH WINDS / do SHAKE / the DAR / ling BUDS / of MAY”
This both breaks up the rhythm for a little variation and draws attention to the roughness of the rough winds being described.

, A Shakespearean sonnet is composed of three heroic quatrains and a heroic couplet. A heroic quatrain is a group of four lines of iambic pentameter in an ABAB rhyme scheme; a heroic couplet is a group of two lines of iambic pentameter in an AA rhyme scheme.In a Shakespearean sonnet, the three heroic quatrains are the “ABAB CDCD EFEF” portion of the rhyme scheme
The heroic couplet is the “GG” closing.
You can separate these stanzas with blank lines, or leave them all together in an unbroken poem, but the sonnet should move as a function of these discrete stanzas.

, Although your poem should have a single focus, each stanza of the sonnet should develop the idea further. Think of each quatrain as a little thought bubble, like a paragraph, in which you explore an element of the subject of your poem. Each quatrain should build toward the final couplet, where you will have a turn, or a volta. The turn, which occurs in the 13th line of the Shakespearean sonnet, offers a resolution or insight into to the problem developed in the first three quatrains. It may help to examine an example, such as Shakespeare’s ""Sonnet 30"":


Quatrain 1 introduces the situation: Sometimes, when I think about the past, I regret the things and people I’ve lost. This quatrain uses legal terminology to get the point across: sessions and summons.
Quatrain 2 begins with the transition word “Then,” suggesting that it is connected to Quatrain 1, but moving on to a further development of the idea: when I'm in a nostalgic mood like that, I can cry freely about friends who have passed away or been otherwise lost to me. In this quatrain, he uses the language of commerce to develop the idea: cancelled woe and expenses.
Quatrain 3 begins again with the transition word “Then,” and further develops the idea using the language of commerce (accounts, payment): Not only do I cry, but I cry heavily, as though I’ve never mourned this loss before.

The closing couplet marks a turn with the word “But,” which suggests that this is not a continuation (like “Then”), but a new thought. There is no resolution to the problem of mourning here, but there is insight into grief and loss: to think of your memory is wonderful enough to make me feel as though I never lost anything. Again, this couplet continues the imagery of commerce (losses).

, Although you can write a Shakespearean sonnet about anything, they are traditionally love poems; you might keep this in mind if you want to write a purely traditional sonnet.


Note too that because of the top-heavy stanzaic structure of the Shakespearean sonnet, the form does not lend itself well to highly complex or abstract subjects. The turn and resolution must come quickly, in the final two lines, so choose a subject that can be easily resolved with a witty closing couplet.
If you have a more contemplative subject, a Petrarchan sonnet may lend itself better to what you want to say.

, Remember to follow the rhyme scheme, to write in iambic pentameter while inserting metrical variation from time to time, and to develop the subject matter through each of the three heroic quatrains, before offering a turn and resolution/insight in the closing heroic couplet.

Revise your poem.",How to Write a Poem," A poem might start as a snippet of a verse, a line or two that seems to come out of nowhere, or an image you cannot get out of your head. You can find inspiration for your poem by doing writing exercises and using the world around you. Once you have inspiration, you can then shape and mold your thoughts into a poem.For example, you may using a writing prompt to do a freewrite. You could then use lines or images from the freewrite as the inspiration for your poem. You can use an existing writing prompt or create your own writing prompt.
You could try brainstorming techniques like mind mapping or making lists of images or ideas. These techniques can help you generate inspiration for your poem.

, You may also be inspired by going for a walk in your neighborhood or to your favorite spot in the city. You may observe people on a park bench or in a public square and use moments from your observations as the inspiration for a poem.


You could try writing a poem about a person who is important to you in your life, such as your mother or your best friend. You could use the person as inspiration for your poem, expanding on their qualities and traits as an individual.

, You can start your poem by focusing on a specific theme or idea that you find fascinating or interesting. Picking a specific theme or idea to focus on in the poem can give your poem a clear goal or objective. This can make it easier for you to narrow down what images and descriptions you are going to use in your poem.For example, you may decide to write a poem around the theme of “love and friendship.” You may then think about specific moments in your life where you experienced love and friendship as well as how you would characterize love and friendship based on your relationships with others.
Try to be specific when you choose a theme or idea, as this can help your poem feel less vague or unclear. For example, rather than choose the general theme of “loss,” you may choose the more specific theme, such as “loss of a child” or “loss of a best friend.”

, Get your creative juices flowing by picking a form for your poem. There are many different poetic forms that you can use, from free verse to sonnet to rhyming couplet. You may go for a poetic form that you find easy to use, such as free verse, or a form that you find more challenging, such as a sonnet. Choose one poetic form and stick to that structure so your poem feels cohesive to your reader.You may decide to try a poetic form that is short, such as the haiku, the cinquain, or the shape poem. You could then play around with the poetic form and have fun with the challenges of a particular form.
You may opt for a form that is more funny and playful, such as the limerick form, if you are trying to write a funny poem. Or you may go for a more lyrical form like the sonnet, the ballad, or the rhyming couplet for a poem that is more dramatic and romantic.

, To get a better sense of what other poets are writing, you may look through examples of poetry. You may read poems written in the same poetic form you are interested in or poems about themes or ideas that you find inspiring. You may also choose poems that are well known and considered “classics” to get a better sense of the genre. For example, you may read:


“Kublai Khan” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge“Song of Myself” by Walt Whitman“I measure every Grief I meet” by Emily Dickinson“Sonnet 18” by William Shakespeare“One Art” by Elizabeth Bishop“Night Funeral in Harlem” by Langston Hughes“The Red Wheelbarrow” by William Carlos Williams , Avoid abstract imagery and go for concrete descriptions of people, places, and things in your poem. You should always try to describe something using the five senses: smell, taste, touch, sight, and sound. Using concrete imagery will immerse your reader in the world of your poem and make images come alive for them.For example, rather than try to describe a feeling or image with abstract words, use concrete words instead. Rather than write, “I felt happy,” you may use concrete words to create a concrete image, such as, “My smile lit up the room like wildfire.”

, Literary devices like metaphor and simile add variety and depth to your poetry. Using these devices can make your poem stand out to your reader and allow you to paint a detailed picture for your reader. Try to use literary devices throughout your poem, varying them so you do not use only metaphors or only similes in your writing.A metaphor compares one object or subject to another object or subject in a surprising way. For example, “I was a bird on a wire.”
A simile compares one object or subject with another using “like” or “as.” For example, “She was as alone as a crow in a field” or “My heart is like an empty stage.”
You can also try using literary devices like personification, where you describe an object or idea using human qualities or attributes. For example, “The car sank like a stone” or “My love is like a tornado in a jar.”

, Poetry is made to be read out loud and you should write your poem with a focus on how it sounds on the page. Writing for the ear will allow you to play with the structure of your poem and your word choice. Notice how each line of your poem flows into one another and how placing one word next to another creates a certain sound or rhythm to your poem.For example, you may notice how the word “glow” sounds compared to the word “glitter.” “Glow” has an “ow” sound, which conjures an image of warmth and softness to the listener. The word “glitter” is two syllables and has a more pronounced “tt” sound. This word creates a sharper, more rhythmic sound for the listener.

, Your poetry will be much stronger if you avoid cliches, which are phrases that have become so familiar they have lost their meaning. Go for creative descriptions and images in your poem so your reader is surprised and intrigued by your writing. If you feel a certain phrase or image will be too familiar to your reader, replace it with a more unique phrase.For example, you may notice you have used the cliche, “she was as busy as a bee” to describe a person in your poem. You may replace this cliche with a more unique phrase, such as “her hands were always occupied” or “she moved through the kitchen at a frantic pace.”

, Once you have completed a draft of the poem, you should read it aloud to yourself. Notice how the words sound on the page. Pay attention to how each line of your poem flows into the next. Keep a pen close by so you can mark any lines or words that sound awkward or jumbled.You may also read the poem out loud to others, such as friends, family, or a partner. Have them respond to the poem on the initial listen and notice if they seem confused or unclear about certain phrases or lines.

, You can also share your poem with other poets to get feedback from them and improve your poem. You may join a poetry writing group, where you workshop your poems with other poets and work on your poetry together. Or you may take a poetry writing class where you work with an instructor and other aspiring poets to improve your writing. You can then take the feedback you receive from your peers and use it in your revision of the poem., Once you have received feedback on your poem, you should revise it until it is at its best. Use feedback from others to cut out any lines to feel confusing or unclear. Be willing to “kill your darlings” and not hold onto pretty lines just for the sake of including them in the poem. Make sure every line of the poem contributes to the overall goal, theme, or idea of the poem.You may go over the poem with a fine tooth comb and remove any cliches or familiar phrases. You should also make sure spelling and grammar in the poem is correct.

Describe your feelings about a particular person.,
Focus on a loving moment or experience.,
Read examples of love poems.,
Choose a form for the poem.,
Use sensory description.,
Include metaphor and simile.,
Avoid cliches.,
Use humor and wit.,
Read the poem out loud.,
Show the poem to others.,
Present the poem in a loving, thoughtful way.",How to Write a Love Poem," Start by writing down any words or phrases that come to mind when you think about the person you are writing the poem for. Focus on nouns, verbs, and adjectives that come to mind when you think of your feelings for the person.For example, for a poem about your mother, you may write, “kind,” “hilarious,” “supportive,” “beautiful,” and “wise.”
For a love poem about your romantic partner, you may write, “sexy in the morning,” “greatest laugh in the world,” and “always optimistic in the face of adversity.”;
, You can also approach the poem by focusing on a moment or experience with the person where you felt loving towards them. Maybe you have a great memory of seeing the person for the first time and falling for them. Or maybe you have a special experience that you shared with the person.

For example, you may write about going to your mother’s childhood home and how you felt overwhelming love for her during that experience.

, To get a better sense of the genre, read love poems that are well known and considered good examples. Look for love poems in different forms, from sonnets to haikus to free verse. You may read:

“Sonnet 40” by William Shakespeare“Sonnet - To My Mother” by Edgar Allan Poe“Having a Coke With You” by Frank O’Hara“Video Blues” by Mary Jo Salter“” by e.e. cummings, Love poetry can be written in many different poetic forms. Some of the most popular include sonnet and free-verse. You can try writing a love haiku or an acrostic love poem. Pick a form that you feel suits the subject of the poem and your skills as a poet.You may also choose a form based on whether you want the poem to rhyme or have a very rigid structure.
For example, for a love poem for a romantic partner, you may go for a traditional sonnet form. For a love poem for a friend, you may try the free-verse form.

, Focus on smell, taste, touch, sound, and feel when you write the poem. Use your senses to describe your feelings for the subject of the poem. Tap into sensory detail to discuss a shared moment with the person.For example, you may describe the sound of the glasses clinking on the table at the romantic restaurant where your partner proposed. Or you may discuss the smell of your mother’s perfume when she cared for you as a child.

, Metaphors and similes are a good way to add some creativity and detail to the love poem. Metaphors compare one thing to another thing. Similes are when you use “like” or “as” to compare one thing to another.For example, you may use a metaphor like, “My mother is a fierce tiger in the jungle of my childhood.”
You can also use a simile like, “My mother is as bright as a peacock on a cold winter day.”

, It can be easy to slip into cliches, especially when you are writing a love poem. Avoid phrases that are so familiar they have lost their meaning. If you feel as thought a phrase or sentence is too familiar, change it up and make it more particular to your perspective as a poet.For example, rather than use a cliche like “My love is like a red rose,” you may write, “My love is like a hothouse orchid” or “a prickly cactus.”

, Make the poem light and funny to avoid being too sentimental or sappy. Try to include funny moments or lines that feel silly and fun. Keep the poem witty and humorous so the subject enjoys reading it.For example, you may include a line about how your partner makes funny faces when he is upset. Or you may include a detail about how your mother can be demanding, but loveable.

, Once you have finished a draft of the poem, listen to how it sounds out loud. Read it slowly to yourself several times. Notice if there are any lines that seem awkward or unclear. Adjust any phrases that seem cliche or familiar.

You should also look over the poem to make sure there are no spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors.

, Get feedback from people you trust, such as a close friend, a family member, or a peer. Show the poem to people who know the subject well and ask them if they think the person will like it. Be willing to get feedback from them and listen to their constructive criticism. Then, revise the poem according to their feedback., Make the love poem extra special by handwriting it in a nice, handmade card. Or type it out and print it on nice paper to give to the person.

You can also present the poem with a small gift to celebrate your love for the person.

Use the Petrarchan sonnet's rhyme scheme.,
Use the same iambic pentameter meter as the Shakesperean sonnet.,
Develop content as the Petrarchan stanzaic structure demands.,
Write your Petrarchan sonnet.",How to Write a Sonnet2," While the Shakespearean sonnet always has the exact same rhyme scheme, the Petrarchan sonnet does not have a single pattern. Though the first eight lines (the octave) always follow a rhyme scheme of ABBAABBA, the closing six lines (the sestet) have some variation. There are five patterns, though, that are most common in the tradition of the Petrarchan sonnet:


CDCDCD
CDDCDC
CDECDE
CDECED
CDCEDC

, All lines should follow the “ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM” pattern, but remember to insert metrical variation from time to time to enliven the rhythm and draw attention to key phrases.

, Whereas the Shakespearean sonnet has a top-heavy structure of 3 quatrains and a couplet, the Petrarchan sonnet is a little more balanced, using an eight-line octave and a six-line sestet to develop the poem’s subject. As such, it’s well-suited to complex issues that require a lot of room to resolve, rather than the easy, witty resolution of a Shakespearean sonnet’s closing couplet. The octave introduces and presents a problem. The turn, or volta, occurs at the beginning of the sestet (Line 9); the sestet offers new insight into the dilemma presented in the octave. Consider William Wordsworth’s “Nuns Fret Not at Their Convent’s Narrow Room” as an example for analysis:


The octave progresses through a series of examples of creatures and people who are not bothered by restricted spaces.
The progression moves from the most revered element of society to the lowliest: from nuns, to hermits, to scholars, to manual laborers, to insects.
The turn in this sonnet actually occurs a line early, at the end of the octave. Although this is not purely traditional, poets throughout history have experimented with the form and manipulated it to their needs. You should feel free to do the same.
In Line 8, “In truth” marks the volta or turn; now, Wordsworth will give more insight into the idea of being comfortable in restrained spaces.
The sestet suggests that the formal restrictions of the sonnet — with its rhyme scheme, iambic pentameter restriction, and strict octave-sestet structure — is not a prison, but a way for the poet to free himself and “find solace.” He hopes that the reader, too, shares this feeling.
The sestet provides insight that allows us to consider all the people and things in the octave with a deeper understanding.

, Just as you did with the Shakesperean sonnet, keep in mind the Petrarchan rhyme scheme and stanza structure, and remember to write in iambic pentameter with occasional metrical variation. Note that, just as Wordsworth did in ""Nuns Fret Not at Their Convent's Narrow Cell"" by moving the volta up from the traditional ninth line to the eighth, you can manipulate the form to meet the needs of the poem you're trying to write. The sonnet has changed in many ways throughout history, so make it work for you.


An example of a Petrarchan sonnet that beautifully manipulates the form to make a point is Edna St. Vincent Millay's ""I Will Put Chaos into Fourteen Lines,"" which is a sonnet about writing a sonnet.Millay employees the Petrarchan rhyme scheme and meter, but interrupts her lines with enjambments (splitting the line in the middle of a sentence or clause) and occasional disruptions of the meter to emphasize her struggle with the sonnet form itself.

"
"
Explore proportion through the curtal sonnet.This form was developed by Gerard Manley Hopkins, and takes its name from the “curtailed” nature of its manipulation of the Petrarchan sonnet form.,
Play with line breaks and fluidity using the Miltonic sonnet.,
Explore a different type of rhyme pattern using the Spenserian sonnet.,
Explore shorter stanzas and different rhyme schemes using the terza rima sonnet.,
Experiment with the sonnet form on your own.",How to Write a Sonnet3," Mathematically, the curtal sonnet is precisely 3/4 of a Petrarchan sonnet, shrunk proportionally. By experimenting with this form, you can explore how the ratio of the Petrarchan sonnet works within a more concise space. Consider whether or not you think anything changes in the relationship between the two halves of the poem when you transition from the full Petrarchan structure to the condensed curtal structure.


The curtal sonnet is composed of a sestet with a rhyme scheme of ABCABC and a quintet (five line stanza) of a rhyme scheme of either DCBDC or DBCDC.
Though it appears to be 11 lines, which is a little more than 3/4 of the normal 14-line Petrarchan sonnet, it is actually 10.5 lines; this is because the final line of the curtal sonnet is half a line of iambic pentameter — sometimes even less.
Other than the last line, the curtal sonnet is still written in iambic pentameter.
Hopkins’ “Pied Beauty” is a famous example of a curtal sonnet.Note that the final line, “Praise him” truncates the 11th line to the 3/4 proportion intended by Hopkins.

, This form, developed by John Milton, also takes the Petrarchan sonnet as its basis, and is almost identical in form to it. However, the Petrarchan sonnet treats the octave and sestet as two discrete sections separated by a turn; Milton wanted to explore what happened to the Petrarchan sonnet when you rid the poem of all separations.


A Miltonic sonnet has a Petrarchan rhyme scheme of ABBAABBACDECDE, and is written in iambic pentameter.
However, it omits the turn/volta at the beginning of the sestet, and instead emphasizes “enjambment.”
When you break a line or a stanza somewhere that is not a logical syntactic end (somewhere where you’d normally find a period, comma, or semicolon), that line or stanza is said to be enjambed.An example of an enjambed line is: “God doth not need / Either man’s works or his own gifts: who best / Bear his mild yolk, / they serve him best” (Milton, “On His Blindness”).
See Milton’s “On His Blindness” for an example of a Miltonic sonnet.Note how it makes use of enjambment both in individual lines and in the melding together of the octave and sestet.

, Whereas the curtal and Miltonic sonnets took the Petrarchan sonnet as their basis, the Spenserian sonnet, developed by Edmund Spenser, is modeled after the Shakespearean sonnet. However, it explores an interlocking rhyme scheme.


It is composed of three heroic quatrains and a heroic couplet, just like the Shakespearean sonnet. Furthermore, it is also written in iambic pentameter.
However, the rhyme scheme differs from the Shakespearean sonnet in that it is interlocking: The second rhyme sound from each quatrain becomes the first rhyme sound of the subsequent quatrain.
This results in a rhyme scheme of ABAB BCBC CDCD EE.
Contrast that against the rhyme scheme of the Shakespearean sonnet: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.
The interlocking rhyme scheme results in the three quatrains being closely linked aurally by the repeated rhyme sounds, especially in the transition between quatrains, when the second rhyme of one stanza is immediately repeated as the first rhyme of the next.
Just as the Miltonic stanza explores the relationship between parts of the Petrarchan sonnet by using line breaks and enjambments, the Spenserian sonnet explores the relationship between parts of the Shakespearean sonnet by using interlocking rhyme patterns.

, With the exception of the curtal sonnets, all of the sonnet forms we’ve looked at thus far make use of quatrains in their first section. The terza rima sonnet, though, is written using interlocking tercets, or stanzas of three lines.It is still written using iambic pentameter, and still has 14 lines.
However, it has a rhyme scheme of ABA BCB CDC DAD AA. Note that the “A” rhyme from the opening tercet is repeated in the sandwiched ending of the fourth tercet, and also in the rhyme of the closing heroic couplet.
Even more than the Spenserian sonnet, the terza rima sonnet asks you to consider the relationship between the stanzas in the poem, as developed not only through subject, but through sound.
By splitting the first part of the poem into groups of three rather than four lines, it asks you to develop the ideas in each stanza more quickly and concisely.
An example of a terza rima sonnet is Robert Frost’s “Acquainted with the Night.”, As you can see from the variety of sonnet forms presented thus far, poets have taken liberties with the sonnet throughout its history. Though the form came to prominence with Petrarch, after whom the Petrarchan sonnet is named, it evolved greatly in the hands of British poets like Sir Thomas Wyatt, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and, of course, Shakespeare, who brought the form to its greatest popularity. However, Hopkins, Milton, and Spenser felt free to change the rules of the two more established sonnet forms, and so should you. Some things you can explore might include:


Line length — what changes when you write a sonnet in iambic tetrameter (four iambic feet: ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM) instead of iambic pentameter?
Meter — what happens when you abandon the ta-TUM rhythm of iambic meter entirely? Consider Gerard Manley Hopkins’ “Carrion Comfort,” which follows all rules of the Petrarchan sonnet except for its iambic pentameter meter.Rhyme scheme — what happens when you write the octave of a Petrarchan sonnet in heroic couplets (AA BB CC DD) instead of repeated Italian quatrains (ABBAABBA)?
Does a sonnet need to rhyme at all? Many contemporary sonnets do not. Consider Dawn Lundy’s “” as an example."

Edit your poem.",How to Write Alliteration Poems," Beginner poets might be unsure of what an alliteration poem is. If you're just starting out, you may be confused between assonance, consonance, and alliteration. Though similar, these terms do have distinct differences.


Assonance involves the repetition of the same or similar vowel sounds in the stressed syllable of a word. These vowel sounds are then followed by unrelated consonant sounds (for example, ""hate"" and ""sale"").
Consonance involves the repetition of the same or similar consonant sounds in the stressed syllable. These consonant sounds are preceded by unrelated vowel sounds (for example, ""irk"" and ""torque"").
Alliteration involves the repetition of sounds through multiple words or syllables in a poem.If you're not clear on what an alliteration poem looks like, try searching online for published alliteration poems by well known authors. The Poetry Foundation website is an excellent place to start your search.;
, An alliteration poem can take on a number of forms. It can focus on a single sound that's repeated throughout the poem, or it can take on multiple sounds throughout the poem.


Remember that alliterations do not repeat letters, they repeat sounds. Because of this, ""fish"" and ""physics"" alliterate one another, even though they begin with different consonants.True/proper alliteration does not just repeat the consonant sounds at the beginnings of words; they repeat the syllable that is stressed most strongly. For example, ""above the belt"" works because a reader of that line would stress the ""b""s (aBove the Belt).
Your poem can reuse just a single alliterative letter, if you want. Alternately, your alliterative poem can change up the letters that alliterate within each line.
Alliteration can be used as much as possible throughout the entire poem, like in Gerard Manley Hopkins's poem ""Spelt from Sibyl's Leaves"".Alternately, alliteration can be used sparsely to accent or emphasize an image or phrase within the poem. See, for example, Yolanda Wisher's poem, ""Love is Like a Faucet""., A good place to begin with an alliteration poem is to write out a list of words that start with the same letter and sound. Even if you don't end up using most of those words, it will help get you thinking about sound and spelling.Choose a consonant. Most alliterative poetry uses consonants at the beginnings of words instead of vowels.Try to think of as many words as you can that begin with your chosen letter and write them down. For example, if you've chosen the letter ""B,"" you might write ""boy,"" ""brave,"" ""bring,"" ""behind,"" ""bad,"" and so on.
Circle or highlight the words that relate (even in an abstract way) to what you've chosen as your subject matter. The connections don't have to make sense yet, but there should at least be some vague connection in your mind.

, Now that you have a list of compiled consonants, you can begin constructing phrases out of those consonants. If this is your first attempt at writing alliterations, you may want to spend some extra time getting comfortable with the writing process.


You probably won't use all of the words you compiled, and that's okay. New words will come to you, especially once you start focusing on your poem's purpose and mood.Use a dictionary and/or thesaurus if you're having trouble coming up with words.
Remember to focus on the sound and mood of each word as you string together phrases and lines.Try to form coherent phrases and sentences with your words. Remember to include a subject, verb, and object in each phrase.
Continuing the example with the letter ""B,"" you might compose a phrase like ""Bad boys bargain, but betting brings burden.""

, You may decide to use some or all of your phrases, or you may find that you want to start from scratch. If you're keeping your phrases, try rearranging their order to produce new and interesting lines of poetry.


Try to avoid using too many alliterations per stanza. Some poets recommend using no more than three or four alliterative words per line to avoid confusing word play.Focus on getting a coherent poem down first (if that is your intention for the poem), and add in alliterative language after you've got a few lines or a stanza for your poem.
You can insert alliterative language by looking through the lines you've written and substituting non-alliterative words with words that start with the same consonant sounds.

, Alliteration is often used in children's books for a whimsical, lyrical effect. However, many traditional poets, like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, also use alliteration in poetry.Before you begin to write your poem, you should decide what kind of poem it is you want to compose.


There are many different ways to use alliteration in poetry.
Children's poetry typically deals with everyday subjects or nonsensical word combinations, often using repetition, rhyme, and lyrical/musical sounds.More traditional forms of poetry can take many forms. Much of the poetry being written today is either free verse (with no meter or rhyme) or fixed form, which use a set number of lines, rhymes, and/or meters.Study some of the various types of poetry by searching online for ""poetic forms"" or visiting your local library. Writer's Digest and The Poetry Foundation are good websites to search through., Most poems are about something. A poem can be about a concrete person/place/thing, or something more abstract, like a mood or feeling.


The subject (if you have one) will determine the content, so knowing in advance what you want the poem to accomplish may help you when it comes time to writing the verses.Choose a subject that resonates with you personally. The more honest you are with your subject matter, the more powerful and authentic your poem will be.
Poetry excels at capturing a moment. Think about something important or meaningful to you, and brainstorm related ideas, concepts, feelings, etc.Many poems are written as a response to something (an image or event, for example). If you're looking for a subject to start with, try visiting your local art museum and look for a painting that moves you., A great way to fire up your creativity before you begin writing is to read as much as you can. Reading poetry can give you ideas, help you understand how meter, rhythm, and alliteration work, or simply put you in the mindset to create your own work.


Think about the intended audience of your poem, as well as what you hope to achieve with it. Is your poem supposed to be fun/entertaining, or more serious and meditative?
Read all kinds of poetry, but especially poetry that falls within the genre you're interested in (children's poetry, free verse, sonnet, etc.).
Try to pinpoint what the poet is doing on the page that makes her poems work so well. Is it just her subject matter, or does it have something to do with the language, the form, and the sounds of her words?

, It can be difficult to revise or edit a poem that you've just finished working on. The concepts are still clear in your head, so if anything is unclear or doesn't make sense you are less likely to catch it. You may also be reluctant to cut out any lines that aren't working because you'll still be attached to the project as a whole that you've just completed.


Set your poem aside for at least a few days, although a week or two may be better.Once you're looking at it with a fresh set of eyes, try viewing the poem as an outside reader. Is anything confusing, lacking, or otherwise unsatisfying about the poem?
Ask a trusted friend to read your poem and give you feedback. Let your friend know that you don't just want assurances, you'd like to know what (if anything) isn't working and why.

, Clichés are phrases that are so overused they've become part of your cultural lexicon, like ""busy as a beaver"" or ""an early bird gets the worm."" Clichés may sound powerful because they're familiar, but to a studied poetry reader they will simply come across as unoriginal and uninteresting phrasings.


Consider what you're trying to say with the cliché you've used.
Try to express that idea or sentiment in your own words. Strive for originality, and don't be afraid to play with language in bold and inventive ways.
Turn that expression into a new phrase that is totally original and in your own words., Metaphor and simile are two of the strongest components of a poem. They help bring imagery to life and lend a more lyrical quality to your poem.A simile is a comparison that uses the words ""like"" or ""as."" An example of a simile would be, ""Your heart is like the evening sun.""
A metaphor is a comparison that lyrically compares one person, place, or thing to another by speaking of them as if they were the same. An example would be, ""You are the light of my life.""An original simile or metaphor should be creative and surprising. It doesn't have to make literal sense, because the reader will know you don't mean that one thing is literally something else.
Try to use simile and metaphor to capture the mood or essence of what you're trying to say. You should also use simile/metaphor to incorporate more imagery into your poem.

, Abstract words deal with concepts or feelings.These words can be difficult for readers to grasp, because a poem tends to deal with imagery (which you cannot express well with abstract words).


Any word that does not have a concrete image attached to it may be considered abstract. For example, even though you know the definitions of words like ""freedom,"" ""happy,"" or ""love,"" these words do not have a concrete form/image.
Any time your poem uses abstract words or concepts, try replacing those words with concrete terms and descriptions. Instead of saying someone is ""happy,"" for example, you might describe that person's smile or the look in her eyes when she experiences happiness.
Concrete words help the poem have more imagery, as their descriptive nature can help make depictions on the page come to life for readers.

, After you've finished revising/rewriting your poem, you'll want to perform some edits at the line level. While revision focuses on making the poem stronger and more lyrical or image-heavy, editing focuses on correcting any glaring errors that may have slipped through into your poem.


Look for repeated or redundant words. If you already have a word like ""occasionally,"" you don't need to say ""often"" or ""sometimes"" in the same line.Correct any spelling errors.
Check for tense agreement. Your poem can be all in past tense, present tense, or future tense, but it will be very confusing if you jump around from past tense to future tense.

Practice writing a single quatrain in meter.,

Write more quatrains.",How to Write a Quatrain Poem," A quatrain is just a stanza made of four lines with some kind of metrical and rhyme pattern. A metrical pattern means that each line has the same length and rhythmic stress pattern. For example, in an iambic pentameter poem, each line has five (pent) iambic feet (ta-TUM) that add up to ten syllables.


Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 18” is written in iambic pentameter: ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?""
Tennyson's ""In Memoriam A.H.H."" is written in iambic tetrameter: 4 iambic feet that add up to 8 syllables per line. ""Thou madest Life in man and brute"", Rework your practice quatrain using different rhyme schemes. This exercise will help you figure out what sound you like best. Later, you can apply that rhyme scheme to the poem you want to write. There are no rules about the rhyme scheme of a quatrain poem, so you can run wild with it!


Rhyme schemes are usually labeled with letters (ABCD). Every time a line of the poem ends in a new sound, assign a letter to that sound. So, if the last word of Line 1 is “smoke,” it becomes an “A” – and so does every other line that rhymes with “-oke” (“joke,” “baroque,” etc.). The next unique sound (and all its rhymes) would be “B,” the next would be a “C,” and so on. Some common quatrain rhyme schemes include:
ABBA: We call this an ""envelope quatrain"" because the A rhyme envelopes the B rhyme. The result is a dense rhyme in the middle with a comforting envelope rhyme around it.
When you write an envelope quatrain in iambic pentameter, we call it an Italian quatrain.
When you write an envelope quatrain in iambic tetrameter, we call it an In Memoriam stanza. The name comes from Tennyson’s poem “In Memoriam A.H.H.”ABAB: We call this scheme an alternate or interlaced quatrain because of how the rhyme sounds alternate.
AABB: The double couplet has two very strong rhymes. If you use this kind of scheme throughout a long poem, the rhyme might start sounding too sing-songy. Be careful!
You can also insert a third sound into the quatrain, even if it remains unrhymed: ABCB, ABCA, ABAC, etc.

, A quatrain poem has two or more quatrain stanzas. Each stanza should serve as its own little thought bubble, like paragraphs in a story or essay.


Practice developing a single quatrain before sitting down to write a whole poem.
Don’t worry about writing something that will develop into a full poem; this is just practice.
Try to develop a full thought in four lines of metered writing.

, Some rhyme schemes have a long tradition that you should research, but you don't have to follow any ""rules."" Learn the history of the pattern, but feel free to make it your own.


Tennyson said that his grief took the form of the In Memoriam stanza after his friend Arthur Hallam died. That's why ""In Memoriam A.H.H."" has that metrical pattern. The tetrameter (4 feet) feels like unfinished pentameter (5 feet). The A sound comes early, then returns at the end of each stanza. This resembles the poem and poet's inability to move past Arthur's death.Thomas Gray’s wrote “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” in Sicilian quatrains.A.E. Housman used double couplets in his “To an Athlete Dying Young” to mimic the upbeat tone of a cheering crowd. This contrasts the death that closes the poem.An example of a repeating ABCD rhyme scheme (where none of the first four lines rhyme with one another but instead rhyme with the lines of the next quatrain) can be found in the first two quatrains of John Allan Wyeth’s Souilly: Hospital:
Fever, and crowds---and light that cuts your eyes--A
Men waiting in a long slow-shuffling lineB
with silent private faces, white and bleak.C
Long rows of lumpy stretchers on the floor.D
My helmet drops---a head jerks up and criesA
wide-eyed and settles in a quivering whine.B
The air is rank with touching human reek.C
A troop of Germans clatters through the door.D


, What’s been on your mind recently? What problems have been bothering you, or what have you been happy about? Are you in love, or are you stressed about having too much work? Did you just get a new dog, or did your dog just die?


By choosing a subject you’ve been thinking about a lot, you ensure that you’ll have a lot of material to write about.
It may be that you can't think of anything specific that’s been on your mind lately. If that's the case, start with a generic topic like nature or emotion, and try to develop a more specific thought about it.
Observation is also a great way to come up with poem topics. Go to a crowded place, like the mall or a train station, and crowd-watch. Try to imagine the inner lives of the people you see, where they’re coming from and where they’re going. Take notes to help you remember what you found interesting about them later. You can turn them into a character in your narrative poem or dramatic monologue.

, You experimented with different rhyme schemes with the practice quatrain you wrote. Choose a rhyme scheme that seems to fit the subject matter of the poem you want to write, or which you liked the sound of. For example, if you are writing a poem about grief or loss, use just the In Memoriam stanza's envelope rhyme. You don't have to use its iambic tetrameter.


Now that you’re working with more than one quatrain, you can think about chain rhymes. This is when a rhyme sound from one stanza gets drawn down into the next one: ABBA BCCB CDDC, and so on.
Look at Robert Frost’s “Acquainted with the Night” for an example of a chain rhyme. Note that Frost used tercets (three-line stanzas), not quatrains, in this poem.Make your rhyme scheme more interesting by mixing rhyme styles. A poem that reads AABA BBCB CCDC would be more challenging and interesting to the reader. Even if the first B and C seem lonely all by themselves, they get repeated a lot in later stanzas. The only D breaks up the pattern, and is a nice reminder that you don’t have to make every line rhyme.

, This first line is the base of your poem because it doesn’t have to rhyme with anything yet. Of course, it can sometimes be hard to start the poem right at the beginning. If you have a line in your head that you like the sound of – even if it doesn’t make any sense yet – write it down so that you can start writing around it.

, Keep the rhyme scheme in mind and think ahead to words that you want these lines to end on. Remember, a quatrain should be like a thought bubble or a paragraph. Develop a full thought within these four lines.


Use a rhyming dictionary or thesaurus for help if you get stuck on rhymes or synonyms.Brainstorm a list of words that rhyme with the last word of the line you've written, but try to find ones that relate to your topic.
Build on the words you've brainstormed so they become a full quatrain. For beginners, try to create lines of similar lengths.
Feel free to use slant rhyme, also known as off rhyme, to make a difficult rhyme work. Slant rhyme is when two words don’t rhyme completely, but are like enough to feel like rhyme.
Emily Dickinson was a great master of slant rhyme. In “Because I could not stop for Death —” she rhymes away with civility, chill with tulle, and day with eternity., It should feel natural when read aloud, as though the rhythm and rhymes click into place like a song. If it sounds bumpy, you need to revise. Shorten long lines and lengthen short lines so that the rhymes occur at satisfying intervals.

, Consider what you just wrote, then decide where that stanza leads to next. Remember that each quatrain should stand alone as it develops its own idea. It should also connect to the stanzas that come both before and after it.


Add depth to the poem by including a turn. A turn is a line starting with a word like “but” or “however” that takes on a different tone from the rest of the poem. It often introduces a new element (ex. a dilemma, a question, a solution, or anything else the reader hasn’t anticipated up until this point).

Know the basic characteristics of a limerick.,
Choose the ending of your first line.,
Think of different words to rhyme with your first line's ending.,
Make associations with the rhyme words.,
Pick a story that appeals to you.",How to Write a Limerick2," While there are slight variations in this style of poetry, they all fall within the same rhythmic umbrella. A true limerick has five lines; the first, second, and fifth rhyme with each other, and the third and fourth rhyme with each other. In addition to rhyme, consider:


Number of syllables. The first, second and fifth lines should have eight or nine syllables, while the third and fourth lines should have five or six.
Meter. A limerick has a certain ""rhythm"" created by how the syllables are stressed.

Anapaestic meter - two short syllables are followed by a long (stressed) one (duh-duh-DUM, duh-duh-DUM). Here's an example (note that the emphasis naturally falls on the italicized syllables): Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house

Amphibrachic meter - a long (stressed) syllable is sandwiched between two short ones (duh-DUM-duh, duh-DUM-duh). Example: There was a young lady of Wantage
Lines can begin on two, one, or occasionally no unstressed beats. Some prefer to continue the rhythm across from one line to the next, especially when a sentence carries across lines, but this is not essential.



, Knowing this first will help you mentally sift through rhymes. The ending of the initial line is usually a geographical place. Take Pittsburgh. Note that the first syllable of Pittsburgh is stressed, resulting in one short syllable at the end of the line. Another example: New York. Note that the second syllable of New York is stressed. This will create two very different limericks.


Choosing a place like Pottawattamie or xyz may embark you on a long, uphill poem-writing battle. The more common the sound, the more rhymes you'll have at your disposal.

You don't have to choose a place! Or that place doesn't have to be a city -- ""There once was a girl in a shoe,"" is more vivid than a girl living in a plain ol' city.



, Let the story and punchline of your limerick be inspired by the rhymes you think of. After all, a good limerick is cohesive and clever. Let's go back to ""Pittsburgh"" and ""New York.""


Because Pittsburgh is stressed on the first syllable, you'll have to rhyme with both syllables. First things that come to mind: kids lurk, zits work, bits jerk, hits perk, lit smirk, or maybe a different combination of these words.
Because New York is stressed on the second syllable, you only need to rhyme with that one. First things that come to mind: cork, pork, stork, fork. Write your own extensive list.

, The two examples we're using are already starting to form their own feel. For the Steel City, with words like kids and zits and private bits, you could go for a limerick about puberty. And for the Big Apple, through the combination of cork, pork and fork, you could imagine a limerick about a fancy dinner with lots of meat and wine.


Go through the list you created and think up little stories of what could have happened and how your ideas could be related. The association only has to be loose. Sometimes, the more nonsensical, the funnier the limerick is. So long as it paints a picture in the reader's head, your limerick is successful.

, Decide on who the person(s) is you introduce in line 1. What is important about him or her? Do you focus on their profession or social status, or on age, health or particular stage in his or her life?


For the Pittsburgh limerick, you could go for the word ""adolescent."" Something everyone can relate to!
For the New York limerick, you might be thinking of the word ""distinguished"" with something following that.

"
"
Make the first line nice and fitting with the meter.,
Choose a situation or action in which your person starts off.,
Think of a 'turn' or 'twist' in your story.,
Wrap up the story with a punchline.",How to Write a Limerick3," Your word choice will determine which type of meter you employ; don't worry, you'll be able to hear what works and what doesn't. Let's keep going with our two examples:


Example 1, adolescent and Pittsburgh: Adolescent is stressed on the 3rd syllable. Pittsburgh starts with a stressed syllable. This means we need one more long syllable at the start, and only have room for one short syllable between ""adolescent"" and ""Pittsburgh."" So we might get: ""A young adolescent from Pittsburgh.""
Example 2, distinguished and New York: Distinguished is stressed on the second syllable. Combined with ""from New York,"" that leaves us only two syllables for in between, with the second one stressed. You could solve this, for instance, by borrowing from a foreign language: ""The distinguished beau monde of New York.""

, This is the starting point of your story or joke. Use one of the rhyming words from your list to complete your second line.


Example 1: ""A young adolescent from Pittsburgh, was just finding out how his bits work."" Now that's a set up for limerickal success.
Example 2: ""The distinguished beau monde of New York, was heavily dining on pork."" Note how the rhyme in line 2 seems to fit with the subject in line 1, while it actually is the other way around. Audience fooled!

, While considering rhyming words for the 3rd and 4th line, save the punchline for your last line. The fun in the limerick comes in the 4 line wait for the kick at the end.


Of course the ""bits"" story will probably get messy -- excellent. Because limericks often border on the obscene, you could have your hero's hormones take the best of him (without making it too explicit). How about: ""He dreamt every night, of a girl by his side?"" That's family friendly.
Example 2: Thinking of cork and pork, maybe you notice how wine rhymes with swine. That would be a great follow-up and set your imagery well.

, Go back to your list of rhyme words and find a nice one to cinch it all together. This is the most difficult part. Don't be put off if your first few limericks aren't funny enough. Remember that it's first of all a matter of taste, and second: everything takes practice. And sometimes it's just a matter of finding the right initial word to set up your rhymes!


Our Pittsburgh example evolved nicely: ""A young adolescent from Pittsburgh, was just finding out how his bits work. He dreamt every night, of a girl by his side, but his zits seemed to make all the kids smirk.""
The New York one did, too. ""The distinguished beau monde of New York, was heavily dining on pork. They drank so much wine, that instead of the swine, many were chewing on cork.""

Go for a walk in nature.,
Focus on a season or seasonal event.,
Choose a person or object as your subject.,
Read examples of a haiku.,
Follow the line and syllable structure of a haiku.,
Describe the subject with sensory detail.,
Use concrete images and descriptions.,
Write the poem in the present tense.,
End with a surprising last line.,
Read the haiku out loud.,
Show the haiku to others.,
Center the haiku on the page when it’s done.",How to Write a Haiku Poem," Many haikus are inspired by objects in the natural world, such as trees, rocks, mountains, and flowers. To get ideas for your poem, take a walk in a park nearby or go for a hike in the woods. Head to a mountain trail or a body of water like a river, lake, or beach. Spend some time in nature and observe it so you can get ideas for the poem.If you can’t go outside for a walk in an area with nature, try looking at nature photographs and art in books or online. Find a particular nature scene or object in nature like a tree or flower that inspires you.

, Haikus can also be about a season, such as fall, spring, winter, or summer. You can also focus on a natural event that happens at a certain time of year, such as the blooming of the cherry blossom trees in your neighborhood or the salmon run in the river near your house.Seasonal haikus often focus on a specific detail about the season, naming the season in the poem. Writing about a season can be a fun way for you to describe a particular detail you love about that time of year.

, Haikus do not all have to be about nature or the seasons. You can also choose a particular person or object as inspiration for the poem. Maybe you want to write a funny haiku about your dog. Or perhaps you want to write a thoughtful haiku about your childhood toy.Try to only focus on one person or one object in the poem. Haikus are short and you may not have enough space in three lines to write every thought you have about the person or object.

, To get a better sense of the genre, read haikus that are well known and considered good examples of the form. You can find examples in books or online. Read haikus that are about nature and other subjects. You may read:Haikus by the Japanese poet Matsuo Basho.
Haikus by the Japanese poet Yosa Buson.
Haikus by the Japanese poet Tagami Kikusha.Haikus by American poet Richard Wright.

, Haikus follow a strict form: three lines, with a 5-7-5 syllable structure. That means the first line will have five syllables, the second line will have seven syllables, and the last line will have five syllables.The poem will have a total of seventeen syllables. To count syllables in a word, place your hand under your chin. Then, say the word. Every time your chin touches your hand, this is one syllable.
A haiku does not have to rhyme or follow a certain rhythm as long as it adheres to the syllable count.

, Haikus are meant to give the reader a brief sense of the subject using the senses. Think about how your subject smells, feels, sounds, tastes, and looks. Describe the subject using your senses so it comes alive for your reader and feels powerful on the page.For example, you may write about the “musky scent of the pine needles” or the “bitter taste of the morning air.”
If you are writing a haiku about a particular subject, such as your dog, you may describe the “clacking of its nails on the tile” or the “damp fur of wet dog.”

, Avoid abstract or vague descriptions. Instead, go for concrete images that are easy for the reader to visualize. Rather than using metaphor or simile, try describing the subject with details that are particular and unique.Avoid wordy descriptions or elaborate language. Try using simple language so you can stick to the syllable count required for a haiku.
Do not use cliches, or phrases that have become so familiar they lose their meaning. Instead, go for images and descriptions that feel unique.
For example, you may write, “Fall leaves brush the road” or “Dog chases a bright blue bird.”

, Give the haiku immediacy by using the present tense, rather than the past tense. Using the present tense can also make your lines simple and easy to follow., A good haiku will have an ending line that is intriguing and leaves the reader hanging. It may leave the reader with a surprising last image or reflect on the previous two lines in a surprising way.For example, the haiku by Japanese poet Kobayashi Issa has a surprising last line: “Everything I touch/with tenderness, alas/pricks like a bramble.”, Once you have a draft of the haiku done, read it aloud several times. Listen to how the haiku sounds. Make sure each line flows easily into one another and that the lines follow the 5-7-5 syllable count. The haiku should sound natural when read aloud.If you notice any awkward or choppy lines, adjust them so they sound smooth. Replace any words that are too long or complicated. Make sure the haiku sounds pleasant when read aloud.

, Get feedback from others about the haiku. Ask friends, family members, and peers what they think of the haiku. Pose questions about whether the haiku embodies a moment in nature or a season.

If you wrote a haiku about a particular subject or object, ask others if they think the haiku does a good job of exploring it.

, Place the haiku in the center of the page and center the lines so it forms a diamond shape. This is how haikus are traditionally formatted.You can also add a short title at the top of the haiku, such as “Autumn” or “Dog.” Avoid long, wordy titles.
Many haikus do not have titles. It is not absolutely necessary that you title your haiku poem.

Decide what your radif is going to be.,
Consider what your qaafiya is going to be.,
Get writing!",How to Write a Ghazal," Every verse ends with the same word or group of words (radif). It makes sense to choose one that can be flexible in use and meaning, so you can use it in different ways in each verse.;
, The qaafiya is a rhyme that precedes the radif. Again, pick something with lots of possibilities.

, A ghazal consists of a series of couplets (two-line verses), with each line containing the same number of syllables. Each couplet is a separate, complete mini-poem, so there's no need for any narrative progression, or any real connection between the couplets. Both lines of the first verse end with the qaafiya and radif. See down the page for an example ghazal.

Promote your eBook.",How to Write Your First eBook," eBooks are no different from any other type of book except in their medium of publication, so the most important first step to writing one is to decide on, and develop, an idea for one. The basic way to do this is to sit down and write a brief phrase or sentence that encapsulates the information you'd like to put in your book. Once you have that, you can build on it to create a finished product.


Writers who plan to create a book of fiction will have to spend considerably more time coming up with ideas and plot points. Read this article on how to write a novel for more relevant advice.
The eBook format has the advantage of being not only open to self-publishers, but essentially free for them, which means that “books” too short to really be worth printing on paper can make perfectly valid eBooks. Therefore, feel free to use a simple idea.

, Start with the basic idea you wrote down, and think about different aspects of it. It may be helpful for you to draw a web of concepts to do this. For example, let's say you wanted to write a book about how to sell real estate for beginners. You could write down things like “licenses and fees,” “selling techniques,” and “cost vs. expected returns.” Connect specifics that are related to each of them, and so on, until you have enough detail to see the structure of the words in your head.


Different books call for different approaches. Memoirs and self-help books might do better with a vertical outline; a book of fixes for common household problems will probably come together faster using a web of ideas.

, After unpacking and expanding your core idea, you should have a lot of information about your basic topic written down. Rearrange and organize it in a vertical outline until it makes sense to you and matches the way you'd like your book to flow. Think in terms of what your audience will need to know first, and put basics at the beginning. Once those have been covered, more advanced concepts can follow without losing the reader.


Each step along your line will end up being a chapter in your book. If you can break the chapters into groups as well (for instance, if your book on home repairs has chapters that can be divided by room or type of problem), feel free to turn those into larger sections that contain a few related chapters each.

, Don't worry about a title, table of contents, or any of the other stylistic elements of the book yet. Just sit down and start writing it. You may find it's easier to “start in the middle” by writing a chapter of your choice first; you may prefer to start at the very beginning and write straight through. Just remember that you don't have to pick one method and stick with it. Use whatever techniques you need to complete the book.


Writing a book – even a short book – takes time. The important thing is to persevere. Set aside time each day to write, or write until you hit a certain word count. Don't stand up from your desk until you meet your goal. Even if you feel stuck, the act of writing something down will help loosen up your mind, and before you know it your words will be flowing again. Keep at it for as long as it takes.

, Once your book is finished, let it sit for a week or so, and then come back to it with a critical eye. Look at the order of the chapters and sections first. Do they make sense to you? Often, you'll find that some pieces seem to make more sense in a different spot than where you'd originally placed them. After you're satisfied with the order of the book, read each chapter in order and edit and revise it.


Like writing, editing takes time – not as much time, but still a significant amount. Pace yourself by editing a certain number of words or chapters each day.
You will often find that words, like chapters, simply need to be rearranged. Do your best to keep related ideas together, and don't forget to alter connecting sentences so that the new order still fits the text.
It has often been said that “deletion is the soul of editing.” If you find that a chapter is going down the proverbial rabbit-hole on a particular point, bring it back in line with the overall flow of that chapter by deleting the extra detail.

If such information is absolutely vital, consider setting it aside in a sidebar instead, or try to more smoothly incorporate it into the text so that it continues to flow smoothly when you read it.



, Once the body of your book looks solid, it's time to add a title, and any front or end material (such as an introduction or a bibliography) you'd like to add. Titles usually reveal themselves during the writing of the book; when in doubt, a plainspoken title (such as “How to Sell Real Estate”) is usually a safe choice.


If you pick a very simple title, have a couple of alternates on hand in case it's already been used. Adding adjectives or even your own name (as in “wikiHow's Guide to Selling Real Estate”) are simple ways to do this.
If you used information from elsewhere, always be sure to properly cite it in a bibliography. If your sources were friends, at least add in a page of acknowledgments so you can thank them by name.

, Like physical books, a major marketing tool for any eBook is its cover. Even though it's only a virtual cover, it's what potential buyers notice first. Consider springing for a professionally-designed cover, or go it alone if you think you can make something that looks good and will attract sales. Just be sure to get permission before you use any copyrighted images.


Even sections and pieces of copyrighted images are off-limits. When in doubt, get explicit permission from the copyright holder first.

, Once you've written an awesome ebook, you should share some copies with friends, relatives, and neighbors. Make sure to ask:


How was the book?
What did you like the most?
What did you not like?
How can I improve it?

, Factor in all of the responses and try to address each of the issues that surfaced. Don't be afraid to stir everything into the mix and redo the entire ebook from top to bottom. The likely result will be a marked improvement on what you created alone. If not, you can always retool and back up to the previous draft.

, The more clear information you compile about your eBook, the easier a time you'll have in both getting it published and promoting it successfully. On a separate document, write down the title of your book, along with any section and chapter titles, the number of sections or chapters, the word count of the book, and a page number estimate. Once you have all that, come up with a list of descriptive terms or “keywords” that are related to your book, and a general thesis statement if needed.


Contrary to what you may have learned in high school, not every piece of writing needs a thesis statement to work. However, most nonfiction writing will have an obvious thesis statement by the time you finish writing it.

, Try to gauge the types of people who will be interested in your book based on its title and description. Are they young or old? Do they own homes or rent? How much money do they make annually, and do they prefer to save or spend? You don't need to hire an expert; just make your best guesses. This information is only to help you market your eBook later.

, There are a few different ways to publish your eBook, which vary in terms of piracy protection, royalties paid to you, and audience scope. Consider each one of them and choose the one you think will make you the most money.

, One of the most commonly used is Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) platform. KDP allows you to format and publish your eBook to the Kindle Marketplace for free. Anyone who owns the popular Kindle line of e-readers can then purchase your book from the marketplace and read a copy on their Kindle. Under this setup, you keep 70% of the price of every copy you sell of your book, provided you set that price between $2.99 and $9.99. The main downside is that KDP doesn't publish to people without Kindle readers, limiting your audience.

, Services like Lulu, Booktango, and Smashwords are also available to take your manuscript and publish it for you in eBook format. Generally speaking, the basic service of these sites is free (and you shouldn't ever pay to publish your eBook, since it basically costs nothing), but they offer premium packages and services, like marketing and editing, for a fee. Be careful to avoid spending money when you didn't mean to if you go this route. On the plus side, these services can reach a much wider potential audience than KDP, and sometimes offer more royalties. Lulu, for example, pays a whopping 90%!

, For any professional eBook publishing platform (including KDP), certain formats have to be used. There are services that will take care of the messy business of formatting your book for you, but they always charge a fee. It's much cheaper to do it all yourself, but you'll need to learn the rules of the service you plan to publish with, and then download and learn any necessary software programs to make the appropriate file conversions. If you do opt for a paid service, don't ever pay more than a few hundred dollars at most.


Never work with a publisher that won't let you set your own price. Forcing a price can have detrimental effects on your bottom line in a few different ways, which essentially makes it another fee. As a general rule of thumb, eBooks turn the most profit when priced between $0.99 and $5.99 per copy.

, If you'd prefer to publish your eBook on the Internet at large, and not use any specific site, there are a number of specially-designed computer programs that allow you to do just that. They vary widely in cost and features, but all of them allow you to create a finished eBook with no restrictions on where or how you sell it. Be aware that the anti-piracy measures you'll have access to with these programs are generally less effective than those offered by publishing services.


Calibre is a newer program that is quick, powerful, and easy to use. It converts HTML files (and only HTML files) into EPUB (the industry standard) format easily, and costs nothing, though donations are appreciated by the creators. Most word processors can save your manuscript as HTML.
Adobe Acrobat Pro is the gold standard program for creating PDF files, which can be read on nearly any computer or device. Acrobat allows you to password-protect your PDF file when you save it, though once you've given out the password, anyone who has it will be able to open the book. It's a powerful and flexible program, but it isn't free.
OpenOffice.org is a popular free office suite that is similar to Microsoft Works. OpenOffice.org's Writer program (word processor) can save documents in PDF format just like Adobe Acrobat. Writer's tools aren't as advanced, particularly with regards to adding a cover, but the program can secure and encrypt your PDF just like Acrobat.
There are many other programs available to help you self publish, both free and paid. If none of the above options sound perfect for you, explore online and find one that suits your needs.

, Once you've published your eBook and deposited it for paid download somewhere on the Internet, it's time to let the world know about it. There are many services you can pay for that will increase your visibility; these may be quite worth the investment if you suspect you have a book that could really take off. However, even with professional help, it will pay for you to promote the book yourself.


Use social media for visibility. Post about the book (and link to a place it can be bought!) on every social media site where you have a presence: Twitter, Facebook, and so on. Even LinkedIn is a good place to add a link to your book on your profile page.
Think laterally to maximize exposure. Don't just tell people about your book; be clever and thorough. Link to it on StumbleUpon, take a photo of your computer screen and post it to Instagram, or even and talk about the book on YouTube. Use every user-created platform at your disposal.
Rely on yourself. People love it when authors are accessible. Advertise times for virtual Q and A sessions about the book, or send complimentary copies to bloggers who review eBooks and ask to do an interview.

, This one will be just two lines, up to 14 syllables maximum. Come up with something to suggest the same season as the first verse. It should link to the first verse, but shift away from it a bit as well. After that first verse, everything is fictional.

, Another three-line verse now, but this one should make no reference to season. And while it should link somehow to the previous verse, this should shift right away from the verse before that (the first verse)

, Of every three verses, one or two should mention a season. Main thing is to link (sometimes quite tentatively) to the preceding verse, while always shifting away from the one before that. Link and shift, that's what it's about.

Finish your set or selection of poems.,
Consider seeking professional help.,
Look into different self-publishing methods.,
Keep your expectations realistic.",How to Self Publish Poetry1," Before you even start trying to self-publish your book, have a finished and polished collection of poetry. If you start worrying about the publication details before you finish writing your book, you won't be able to fully focus on either task. Here's how to finish your book of poetry:


Write and revise each poem in the collection multiple times.
Find the best way to arrange the poems in the book. The arrangement will work best if it creates a mood or develop a theme. You don't have to arrange the poems in the order that they were written.
Ask for feedback from a few reliable sources. Make sure that you're not the only one who feels that your work is truly done.
Proofread your work. Check that the punctuation, line breaks, and grammar are all perfectly executed.;
, If know you want to publish your book yourself, but you're worried about working out the other details on your own, ask for professional help before taking the book to a vendor. Here are some people who can help you to work out the details:


Consider hiring an editor. A reputable professional editor can give you valuable feedback on the quality of your writing.
Consider hiring an illustrator or designer for your book cover. If you're nervous about creating the cover yourself, hiring a professional to do it for you can help make your book look more appealing.

, Once your book and its cover are done, look into different self-publishing methods to choose which one will likely work best for you. The best method can be determined by how much you want to spend, how many readers you expect to have, and how easy you want the publication process to be. Here are three popular methods of self-publishing:


The e-book. Self-publishing your book as an e-book is cheap, easy, and will create a digital copy of your book online for readers to download through different reading devices.
A print-on-demand (POD) service. Using a POD service is a way to create a visually appealing physical copy of your book and to sell it in an online marketplace.
Publishing through a website or a blog. Creating a website or a blog for publishing your poetry is a quick and easy way to reach a lot of readers without having to deal with a vendor.

, Self-publishing is a great way to take control of the publication process and to make your work accessible to more readers. However, it is not a reliable route to getting rich quick, especially not in the poetry business. Though you have undoubtedly heard a few success stories of self-published books that have become best-sellers, this rarely happens with self-published books.


Prepare to be excited to share a copy of your work with more people, but don't be disappointed if you don't have as many readers as you expected.

Understand the e-book's value and pitfalls.,
Work out the details.,
Format your book.,
Choose your online retailer.,
Upload your book.,
Publish your book.",How to Self Publish Poetry2," There are many advantages to publishing your book as an e-book, but there are some disadvantages as well. Before you choose this method of self-publication, be aware of the advantages and disadvantages. They include:Advantages:

Expenses. Publishing an e-book won't cost much more than it will to write it.
Potential for serious revenue. If your book becomes an e-book bestseller, you have the potential to make a lot of money. Some direct publishing vendors allow authors to keep up to 60 or even 70 percent of the revenue, so that could add up to a lot of money. However, this rarely happens, in spite of what you may have read about e-book incomes.



Disadvantages:

No advertising. You'll have to do all the marketing yourself. If you have a good Twitter, Google+ and Facebook following though, this can be something you can get started fairly easily.
Competitive pricing. Some e-books are sold for less than a dollar, so you will have to sell a lot of copies to make revenue.
No physical copy. You won't have the satisfaction of holding your published book in your hands, or of having a few copies around to show to people. That said, there is nothing stopping you from getting a few copies printed for posterity.



, Before you reach out to a vendor, work out a few of the details of the book. Here are a few things you'll want to have figured out before you moved to the next stage of the publication process: Create a cover. You can create the cover of your book of poetry yourself, or you can hire someone to do it for you or ask for the help of a design-savvy friend.
Set a price. A good price range for one copy for your book is $2.99-$9.99. If your book is cheaper, more people will be encouraged to buy it, but if it's more expensive, you may have less buyers but will make more revenue.
Decide whether or not to enable Digital Rights Management (DRM). When you upload your book to different online retailers, you'll have to decide whether or not to enable DRM. Enabling DRM makes piracy less likely, but it also makes it harder for people to read the e-book on various reading devices.
Write a description of your book. Write a few sentences describing your book, and choose the search keywords and categories that will help people find your book. If you're having trouble doing it yourself, contact a professional formatter.

, Format your book to make sure that it will fit the requirements of a Kindle, iPad, Nook, and other reading devices. You can either work this out yourself, or have it formatted by a professional e-book formatter.


Choose whether your book will be available as a PDF, which is the most common method, or if you prefer an HTML format or a Windows executable file (EXE).
Once you've chosen the format, convert your Word document to the appropriate type of e-book. Adobe is used for creating a PDF, programs like Dreamweaver can help you create the HTML format code yourself, and an e-book compiler will covert your EXE files.

, Do some research to decide which distributor suits your needs. Consider how each vendor formats its books, and what revenue rates each vendor gives its authors.Check out some e-books from a few different vendors to get a better sense of which vendors are right for you.

, Create an account with the online retailer, and upload all of the information you've worked out, including the book itself, the cover, description, and any other relevant information you need to finish the process.


Each retailer may ask for slightly different information though the basic process is the same.

, Once you've uploaded your book and all the necessary information, publish your book. You will have control of your online account and will be able to publish the book, and manage the distribution.


Don't forget to advertise. The online retailer won't advertise for you, so you should make sure to advertise for your book if you want to have a wide readership. You can do this by creating a website, blog, or a Facebook fan page.

Understand print on demand (POD) services.,
Choose a vendor.,
Format the book with the vendor.,
Upload your book and cover.,
Publish your book.,
Advertise for your book.",How to Self Publish Poetry3," These are services that allow you to submit an electronic copy of your book and print the book for you. Through these services, you can put your book on the online marketplace of that service and buy as many copies of that book as you like. Some vendors even distribute your book to other sellers, which gives your book more of an opportunity to have a readership. Here are the advantages and disadvantages of using a POD service:Advantages:

Having a physical copy of the book. Having a book that you can hold in your hands can make the book's publication feel more concrete, and can make it easier for you to show or give the book to friends or people who are interested.
Having a vendor work out the formatting and printing. Instead of doing this yourself, you can save time and effort by having someone do it for you. If you leave this work to the professionals, you have a higher chance of making the book look amazing.



Disadvantages:

You still need to market your book.
Expenses. This option is much more expensive than self-publishing an e-book.
Less room for creativity. Though the online vendors will have a wide variety of size, binding, and formatting options for you to choose from, you'll still have to meet their formatting standards and have less room to branch out.



, Before you choose a vendor, research as many vendors as possible to find the best place for publishing your book. If money is a concern, focus more on the pricing at each vendor, but if you're more worried about the quality of the product, spend more time focusing on the formatting and the look of the book once it's printed.


If you're struggling to make a decision between vendors, consider creating an account with one vendor and publishing one copy of the book and sending yourself a copy to see what it looks like.

Do this without making the book available to the public or creating an ISBN, so if you're not happy with the product, it will be easy for you to remove the book from the market and try somewhere else.



, Each vendor will have different formatting requirements, but the basic process of formatting won't vary too much. First, create an account with that vendor, and then do the following things before publishing your book:


Choose whether it will be a paperback or hardcover book.
Write the title and author's first and last names.
Select the privacy settings you want. This can determine whether anyone can view the book on the vendor's marketplace, or if it can only be seen by you.
Choose the type of paper you'll use.
Choose the size of the paper.
Choose the type of binding.
Choose whether the book will be in black or white or in full color.

, Once you've decided on the formatting settings for your book, upload a copy of your manuscript. Also upload your book's cover. If you haven't created a book cover in advance, most vendors will help you choose a theme and layout for your cover and create it before you publish the book.


You can also enlist the help of a professional to make your cover, or ask for the help of a design-savvy friend.

, Once you've chosen your settings and uploaded your book, simply push a button that will publish the book. Once the book is published, you can search it in the vendor's online marketplace and order as many copies of the book as you want.

, Though you have self-published your book of poetry, your work is not over. If you want to reach a wider audience, you'll have to advertise for your book, whether it's by starting a blog or a website, creating a Facebook fan page, emailing your friends and acquaintances, or getting a business card to promote the book.


Many vendors will also have an option that will help you promote your book, but you will have to pay for that.

Publish your poetry through a website.,
Publish your poetry on a blog.",How to Self Publish Poetry4," You can create a website for your book, or just a website for yourself as an author, which will allow readers to quickly and easily access your work. Make your website easy to find and navigate, and allow your readers to view and maybe even comment on your poetry.


Choose a simple format. Make sure that your poems look good on the online page and that the line breaks and font meet your standards.
You can decide whether every poem will be published on one long page, or if readers can simply view a table of contents and click on the poem they want to read.
Remember that a website is a great form of advertisement. Use your site to not only display your writing, but to promote your writing.

, A blog lets you release each poem individually and quickly get reader feedback as your blog readers leave comments, and it gives readers an easy way to keep up with your poetry by subscribing to your blog feed. You get no payment up front, but it's the easiest way to get reader feedback.


Research the various blog hosts and pick the one best suited to your needs and budget.
For a blog, set up your site appearance, URL, subscription options, and any custom web coding necessary to make poems display properly.
Once you build a readership, add advertisements to your blog if you want a source of revenue; or, release your poems as an e-book or physical book that can be purchased––added value in such a compilation may include illustrations and a special foreword from you.
You can also easily edit a blog, so you can go back to make changes, or even add some poems to your collection.
Just be wary about online reading attention span. Someone who reads your poetry on your blog may not be planning to give your work as much time and attention as someone with an e-book of your work or a physical copy of the book. If you feel that confining yourself to this attention span spoils the creativity, avoid using this outlet for your poems.

Give equal weight to the design and the style of the content.,
Stay on top of current events.,

Find a niche of readers that you connect with.",How to Write Online1," Online prose is often highly-referential, witty, and relentlessly current. If you want to put your content online and eventually get paid for it, it's a good idea to focus on developing your voice as a writer and in making your content as engaging and sharp as possible.


Work on your voice and writing voice-driven content. Online content will vary depending on the venue, but will often have a strong first-person ""I,"" with an emphasis on subjective ""views"" on subjects, rather than objective analyses. The world of online writing is more niche-driven, and less broadcast, so we look for strong voices and unique personalities as readers.;
, The introduction and the titles to online content are some of the most important parts of the copy. Since there's so much content online to click around, your writing needs to grab the reader in the first few lines, making it critical that you learn to break the silence quickly and effectively. Your hooks should be severe.


All you need to do to see this in action is check your email and look for the headlines: ""You've Been Eating Breakfast Wrong"" and ""Consider Switching Bank Accounts if Your Bank is Not on this List"" are instantly attention-grabbing. Even if you're completely happy with your bank and your corn flakes, there's a worm of doubt these writers have learned to grow in readers. You can't not click.

, Sites like Buzzfeed, The Onion, and Upworthy live or die by the funny content they provide. While online content is often serious and often informative, you'll make your skills much more amenable to world of online content if you've got a great sense of humor.

, For the most part, copy that you'll be writing for the internet needs to be short and to-the-point, usually in the neighborhood of 500-800 words per article. It also needs to be written quickly and efficiently, producing a diversity of well-edited and clean copy with a quick turn-around time. If you've got a tendency to ramble like Kerouac, writing online might be difficult to pull off unless you learn to cut the florid adjectives and get to the point.

, If you're going to be writing online, it's important to get familiar with how to use basic HTML commands, of which most blogger templates and online publications will use some simple variation. You don't need to know how to make your own website, but learning how to negotiate some simple commands will keep you one step ahead of the game when you eventually start adding your own content to blogs, journals, wikis, and other online venues.

, Learning to write with an eye for attracting the most traffic to the website will be essential if you're going to work as a content creator online. Web developers often live or die by the traffic that goes to the site. If you want to keep your job, learn about SEO.


Most websites generate revenue from ad sales. The way to get more money from advertisers is to prove that traffic to the site increases under certain conditions, so it's in the website's best interest to drive as much traffic from search engines to their website as possible by learning about search engines' algorithms and tailoring the content to the queries. The higher the site ranks in search, the more money the site makes. This is the basic principle of SEO.

, Online content offers a wide variety of rhetorical design choices that aren't available in traditional print media. The look of the writing and the design elements are equally-important to our experience and enjoyment of the writing, as what it actually says. You can't link to a YouTube video in the middle of an essay for school, and you can't slip a .gif into your novel, unless that content appears online, so you've got a wide variety of tricks at your disposal.Pepper your writing with pictures and .gifs when appropriate. Learning when to break up your prose with a well-timed or ironically placed picture or .gif is a great way of giving your readers another way of experiencing content. This works especially well for injecting an ironic tone into your writing–if you're writing with subtle-mockery about how much you love your boss's wardrobe, and link in a picture of the boss from Office Space, we'll get the picture loud and clear.
Link out to other articles you’re referencing. One unique element of online content is that, in an effort to stay as current and quick about producing it as possible, many writers won't summarize other articles or essays being references throughout, instead choosing to link to them in-text. This gives the reader the option of clicking out to get the back-story, or continue reading the essay at hand, making the content interactive and complex., If you want to be an online content writer, it's important that you stay on top of culture, and aggressively. You want to be the person who's already seen every viral video, already linked out to that New York Times article about Julian Assange, and commented in the comment stream 20 minutes after the content went online. Bloggers and tech writers are at the forefront of culture updates.


Content needs to be updated as often as possible. You don't want to be reviewing an out-of-date version of the iPhone that you just purchased, or write reviews of a record that's been out since 2004, unless you've got a particularly thrilling spin on it.

, Before content goes online, it needs to be as polished as it would have been if it had been peer-edited, turned into a lit professor, and returned to your desk with a shimmering score. Just because the content is online doesn't mean that you get to shirk the ability to follow the rules of copyediting and usage, or throw grammar and spelling out the window. Use the elements of style you'd use with traditional print media, and hold yourself up to the same standard of quality. You're not writing a Facebook update.

, You might be a great sentence-writer, but that doesn't mean that you'll necessarily be the greatest online content creator. If you want to write online, lots of work can be found at the entry level, especially if you're a talented copyeditor, content editor, and layout designer. If your goal is to find employment first and foremost, try to find a complementary set of writing and editorial skills that will both diversify your portfolio of talents and make sure that you get paid. Some good skills for the online writer, and things that you should devote a considerable amount of time to include:


Self-promotion and marketing

Basic HTML and design work

Networking
Copyedit and proofread
Read and write quickly

, Unlike traditional publishing, online writing allows the content-creator to focus on very specific sub-cultures, niche groups, and unique readerships, rather than worrying about connecting with the most amount of a general audience as possible. Thus, a site catering to vegan baking recipes, dodgeball, or traditional homemade banjo culture is a perfectly acceptable focus. What do you know a lot about? What is your specialty?


Terminal Boredom, a music blog and review site, caters specifically to super-obscure limited-run punk rock, metal, and lo-fi recordings. The content is crude, the website looks like it was made in 1998, and the reviews are often savage if the music doesn't live up to the site's punk ethos. And lots of people read it.
Video game culture is ripe for the picking with online content. Many sites freelance out game reviews from intelligent and opinionated gamers with the right writing skills, making reviews an excellent way of getting your foot in the door.
DIY topics like up-cycling home repair, farm-to-table cooking, wild fermentation, and homesteading are popular topics in aspirational online communities, that cater to urban dweller's interest in traditional rural culture.
Literature, specifically alt-lit, is a niche market online with a large following. Many sites like HTML Giant, the Rumpus, and others provide a venue for book reviews, interviews, and other types of resources for writers and readers alike of traditional and experimental fiction, contemporary poetry, and non-fiction writing.

Find a variety of freelance content jobs.,
Avoid content farms.,
Prepare a portfolio of your best work.,
Advertise your skills online.,
Submit to publications that pay contributors.,
Look for editorial or content positions with online publications or businesses.",How to Write Online2," Once you've developed an understanding of the types of writing and the skills necessary to write online, start looking for some freelance opportunities and open calls for content. Most big cities that update regularly don't have a paid staff of writers. Rather, they contract out the content to freelancers, who are paid by the article, or as per some other arrangement. Whatever your niche interest, there are probably venues within that niche that hire freelance writers regularly. There are lots of databases of freelance job listings, one of which can be found here.


If you're searching around on Craigslist, try looking for telecommuting opportunities in major metropolitan areas. Lots of online writing gigs are listed in the Bay Area, though lots of content will have no connection to that geography. You can do the job just as well from Iowa or Indonesia as from Brooklyn or SF.
There are also freelance agencies that serve small businesses, hiring out content and finding work for you. Digital Sherpa, Content Launch, and Zerys are examples of agencies that will hire you to write content for other sites on a rolling basis.Many jobs that involve lots of writing online aren't necessarily titled ""Writing Position."" Look for subtler buzzwords, like ""content"" and ""copy."" Lots of Internet start-ups will use the jargon of the start-up, but the job will essentially revolve around writing tasks.

, Content farms will offer a small amount of money for a huge amount of writing expected from you in a very short amount of time. These kinds of jobs won't provide you any good copy to use on a resume, because content farms are completely devoted to producing exponentially increasing numbers of low-quality content, basically as a way of having something to slap ads on to. If you've ever wound up on a page with more ads than writing, or on a mis-spelled domain page, you've seen one of these sites. These sites pay writers next to nothing, have no content standards, and lower the standards of online discourse considerably. Avoid them.

, After you've secured a few assignments and published some work online, keep track of the very best content you produce for use in your portfolio. While many future jobs will be interested in your experience and in your resume, online jobs–for the most part–will come down to one thing: whether or not you can write.


try to aim for a diversity of content. If you've written a review of a sci-fi novel for Kirkus Reviews, that might pair well with some product copy you wrote for LL Bean.Only include material you've written online in a job portfolio. Prospective employers probably don't need to see the senior thesis you wrote about Aristotle, regardless of how great it is. Depending on the job, your own personal blog, or guest posts you've made on other sites may be appropriate, and they may not.

, Promote your self and your skills on social networking sites like LinkedIn as a writer available for a variety of tasks. If you're a great copy editor, a talented banjo player, and a heck of a good cook, let your online presence reflect the diversity of your skills to apply to attract as many different sorts of employment out there. What if a pioneer-revival website needs a copyeditor, or needs someone to embed as a period-minstrel to do research at Civil War re-enactments? You just can't miss out on that because you played your resume too conservatively.


Employment sites like Monster and JobFinder are also good places to start, though they cater less to online employment for writing than you might be able to find your own on places like Craigslist.

, You don't have to wait for an assignment from an agency, or for a freelance contract to get paid for your writing. Research venues that publish the kind of work you're already writing, and try to tailor you submissions to their guidelines. Often, online magazines and journals will have open submissions, or reading periods, in which they'll consider unsolicited work.


In general, these kinds of publications are highly selective, publishing as little as 1% of the manuscripts they receive and peer review. While this would be a next-to-impossible way to make a living, publishing work in respected journals is an important way of building credibility as a writer and giving yourself a good-looking resume. Think of it less as a money-making venture and more as a reputation-building step.

, If you've been freelancing for a while, you may be ready to settle in to a more traditional employment arrangement. There's a diversity of sites that will hire on full or part-time employees in editorial and content-creation capacities, allowing you to pursue your love of writing in a paid capacity.


These jobs typically require that you have some measure of experience writing online, which your freelance experience should provide, a sample of your writing, a resume, and probably a Bachelor's Degree.
If you've freelanced for long enough, you've likely learned more about the kinds of venues that you might be interested in working for, or how to get hired on full-time at one of the businesses you've done freelance work for. Keep your head down and inquire about full-time opportunities until you find something.

Keep an eye out for open submission calls.,
Find online venues that publish the type of work you’re writing.,
Read the submission guidelines.,
Write your proposal or your piece and polish it thoroughly.,
Submit your writing to the editorial staff and wait for a response.,
Stick with it and resubmit if necessary.",How to Write Online3," If you want to submit some work that you've already written, or find an online venue for a writing project that you're thinking of undertaking, there are several resources in place for writers to check for submissions calls. When publications are seeking content of a particular style or content, they'll open submissions to unsolicited writers and consider work, sometimes for free, sometimes for a small fee. This can be an excellent way to get your good writing considered by professional publications.


Writer's Chronicle, the Association of Writing Programs (AWP), and the Poets & Writers database all collect lists of writing contests, open submissions, and general submission guidelines for a variety of websites and other publications. If you're not familiar with the sorts of publications that might be interested in your style of writing, explore there to learn more.

, Submitting work to selective journals is much easier if you become familiar with individual publications and the types of work they tend to publish. Spend time researching the writers, the editors, and reading the entries on the publications before you submit your work. If a journal only publishes serious and highly academic writing about culture, they're probably not going to be interested in a short story about werewolves.


Consider culture publications like Slate, The Awl, Jezebel, Flavorwire, the Culture-ist, all of which accept submissions on a rolling basis, and produce a diversity of interesting and engaging content. Non-fiction and cultural criticism would be excellent for these publications.
Check out literary journals like Narrative, PANK, Octopus, H_NGM_N, and Sixth Finch if you want to publish creative work. These are all highly-respected online journals that publish work by respected authors. If you've got non-fiction, short stories, or poetry that you'd like to see online, research journals that publish content you'd like to read and send them your best stuff.

, Online publishers will accept submissions in any number of different ways, so it's important to locate the submission guidelines of the particular publication you hope to submit to. It should be clearly marked on the site menu. In particular, you want to pay attention to the open-reading period dates to make sure you get in a submission on time, whether or not there is a required reading fee, whether or not there is a page count limit on submissions, and other specific instructions.


For some venues, it may be appropriate to query the editor before submitting your work. If so, prepare a formal proposal to submit your concept for a writing project. No uncapitalized informal emails to the editor, or PMs via Twitter asking Paul Muldoon if he wants to read your poems for the New Yorker. Go through the proper channels.
Make sure to pay attention to the policy regarding ""simultaneous submissions"" and multiple submissions. If you send a story to Jezebel and Diagram at the same time, you might rankle some feathers if they're both huge fans of the work. That's what is known as a ""simultaneous submission,"" and isn't allowed by many publications. Multiple submissions, or submitting more than one piece at a time, is generally not allowed anywhere, except with poetry.

, If you've found a good publication to shoot for, it's time to get writing! Show them your best stuff and polish it thoroughly, editing, revising, and cleaning up your work like crazy. If you're going to make it through the blind reading rounds, your work has to stand out from the crowd, so consider every line, every turn, and every word choice.


Online publications are often looking for ""buzz-worthy"" stories and new perspectives in their content. try to be current and on-top-of your submissions to online publications. If you're writing nature poems about plum blossoms or essays about Wordsworth, online publications might not be the best venue, unless of course they're really great.

, Almost every online publication accepts submissions online, either through a submissions manager, or via email as an attachment. Proofread your piece one last time and let it fly.


Write a cover letter, addressing the section editor directly, by name. You should be able to find this information on the ""Masthead"" page of most publications. If you're submitting News or non-fiction, find the appropriate editor and address it directly. In your cover letter, include any previous publications, your contact information, and a general salutation. Shorter is better.

, Most publications are highly selective, choosing only a small number of the pieces under consideration. If you get a long string of rejections, welcome to the club. That's part of being an online writer. Revise your work, resubmit, and research new venues to try with your best writing.

Using one has never been easier to negotiate. Look around for some common blog templates, checking out examples and playing with the interface to see what you like best. Common and popular blog templates include


Wordpress
Blogger
Weebly
Tumblr

, What do you like? What are you like? What do you have to offer the world? If you're going to jump into the world of blogging, you've got to find your ""thing"" and focus a blog around a unique and engaging concept, topic, or project that you're working on.


Teach people something. It might be a good idea to start a blog to document your home building project, or the great handmade banjos that you lovingly craft. Develop a blog around your life as a maker of the thing you make.
Go places. Travel blogs are extremely common, and can be a great way of keeping in touch with people back home. You can upload pictures, describe your feelings, and feel as if you have some connection to the familiar, even if you're far from home.
Rant intelligently. Nobody probably wants to listen to you complain about your dirty dishes, but if you do it intelligently, humorously, or with excellent writing, who knows? The Oatmeal is a wildly popular blog that documents mundane things like the behavior of household pets, but it's hysterically funny.Start a special project. Decide that you're going to visit every state park in Minnesota in a single year and blog about each one. Decide that you'll buy everything that Oprah recommends on her television show and blog about the experience. Decide that you'll watch every zombie movie ever and blog about the terror, the fun, and the political subtext of the zombie flick. These are all real blogs. Get experimental and document your project.

, Check out the competition by reading the styles and the topics of popular blogs and obscure blogs alike. Whatever blog use as a template, you can search other blogs using the same one, getting some sense of how to customize it and use the template to its best potential.


It's also a good idea to read blogs that cover similar content. If you're going to blog about family life raising children on a farm in Texas, you're going to have some serious heat from the Pioneer Woman. Consider ways to tweak the formula to stand out. Instead of being mildly self-deprecating and twee, make your blog super-sarcastic, or squeamish about the outdoors to see if that fits in more with a fun slant on the topic.

, Start writing the kinds of blog entries that fit in with your intentions. Make them witty, well-polished, engaging, and diverse. try to write different kinds of entries, with different content and different writing styles to see what works. No one will come back to read the same entry about your breakfast humble brag about how healthy your first meals are day-in and day-out. Shake it up.


Plan out a schedule of blog entries so you won't have to struggle for something new to say when you're confronted with the blank page. Write out a list of good topics that you'd like to cover on your blog and keep them with you in a schedule. If you know that you're going to have to write about consumerism in Romero's Dawn of the Dead tomorrow morning, you can start collecting your thoughts in the meantime.
Update your blog frequently. If you develop some readers, you don't want to leave them disappointed if they keep coming back to the same three entries for the next two months. Stay on schedule and aim to produce at least a few entries per week.

, If you're going to all the trouble to write these great entries, make sure people are reading them. Follow other blogs on the blogging platform you use, and share their entries to jump into the community. Start a Facebook page, Twitter account, and Instagram account specifically for your new blog and start sharing the heck out of your new updates when they come out. You can even use the online community as an inspiration for subsequent updates and posts, if it works out that way.


Listen to constructive feedback and ignore haters and trolls. If you're putting yourself out there, it's likely you'll stir up the gunk that falls to the bottom of the Internet barrel. Some people can be ugly and harsh, so try your best to ignore them and keep doing what you do.

, If your blog becomes popular and starts to attract a substantial following and traffic to the site, you might be able to start making money from ad revenue, but you'll first have to export your content and your page to an independent site and pay for the domain name. If you've got a lot of followers, though, this can be a necessary investment.


Hire a web designer to create you a page that will maintain a similar structure and feel to the blog you already use, but make it more professional. Contact advertisers that sell products similar in nature to the content of your blog, and include ad space on your website. try to keep it as unobtrusive as possible to avoid irritating your fan base.
Consider merchandising. Another great way to branch out into making money with your blog is to start selling swag. Make t-shirts for your hike across Minnesota blog, or start selling those art projects you're making for your DIY blog on Etsy.

Write your own confessional poetry.",How to Appreciate Confessional Poetry," Every poem ever written has somehow been affected by the writer's life, but this is even more so with confessional poetry. The whole idea behind the movement is for the poet to honestly express his or her life stories as poetry, with little or no limitations.;
, Since everyone's been influenced by their family (like it or not), most confessional poets have probably referenced their family, friends, and life events, along with the general family history.

, After you have a good understanding of the poet as a person, interpreting the poem should come to you much more easily. Not only will you have an idea of where the poem came from, but you'll also have an idea of the poet's intended audience and the emotion that they're trying to express.

, Confessional poets didn't just spill their guts onto paper and call it a day. They still paid careful attention to craft and construction.Look for metaphors, rhythm, and other poetic tools. See How to Analyze Poetry.

, Many times the arrangement of a poetry collection isn't random or a coincidence. Usually, the organisation of the collection is meant to show a particular period of the poet's life, from beginning to end. Knowing this will give you an idea of what other poems in the book could be about, and therefore help you appreciate the poem that you've focused on the most.

, Reviews aren't meant to dictate your opinion of a particular work. Instead, they're meant to help you shape it, usually by revealing information that you may not have known or by bringing a different viewpoint that you may not have considered.

, You'll find that it's not easy to reveal your most personal thoughts and feelings. Read How to Practice Radical Honesty and give it a shot. You'll be amazed at how people react, and you may gain a new respect for confessional poets because you may have a better understanding of what they might have faced for being so open.

Keep in mind that most readers do not like ""Mary Sues"", or characters who come across as perfect in every way. Make your characters have flaws, but make sure they have talents too.;
, Most stories on Quotev are fanfiction works, so you might want to find a fandom you have read and feel comfortable writing for. If you don't know anything about fandoms, skip fandoms and write with a general topic. It's better to be a bit different than making a terrible fanfiction about a fandom you know nothing about.

, If you are using a fandom, it's a bit obvious that wherever the fandom takes place, that will be where your story will take place. If you choose not to use a fandom default, you should aim to find a setting that would match the character you've created.


For example, if your character likes to swim, use a swimming pool as the setting of your story.

, No story is complete without supporting characters! You generally want to have your character to have a few friends and an ""enemy."" Remember that the readers will care as much about the supporting characters as the main one, so give your supporting characters back stories and a life behind where this story takes place.

, You want to try to stick to one point of view throughout the entire story, because otherwise it becomes confusing. Choose the one you feel most comfortable writing in, and stick with it for the entire story!

, Before you worry about proofreading and editing and such, you need a piece to edit! Type anything you think might be interesting to your audience.

, Using spell-check or something similar would really help out, since readers most likely won't read a story with improper spelling every two words.

, Make sure one word isn't repeated too often; excessive repetition can become annoying and cause readers to lose interest. If you find that you have used a word too many times, use a Thesaurus to find different words with the same meaning.

, In a sentence you only need one exclamation point, and you want to avoid using ALL CAPS, as it portrays screaming at another character.

, Readers don't really like to have to read author's notes, and sometimes they skip them altogether. Keep them short and sweet and related to the story.


Example of an acceptable author note - ""Thanks for reading! I will be on vacation from 7/14/14-7/21/14, so I probably won't be writing. I expect to be back writing about 7/23/14.""

, Saying ""I won't update until I get 15 reviews!"" Can be a huge turnoff to readers.

, It makes you seem polite and appreciative of an audience.

, Descriptions such as ""Read the title"" have become common recently, but this type of description can be a huge turnoff. You want a description that is short, sweet, and mysterious. You do not want people to know what happens at the end of the story, nor do you want them to be turned off by a bad description.

, If you see one bad review, it's probably just a troll. Overall, if it seems like they want you to continue, continue! If they don't like it, add a twist or start a new series.

, Thank authors for reviewing and reading, then start writing the next part of the story unless there is something absolutely necessary to say.

, Remember, as the author, it's ultimately your decision on whether you're going to continue or not.

Realize the mistake wasn't as big a disaster as you thought.",How to Perform Poetry," If you are attending a poetry slam, following a class assignment, or entering a poetry performance competition, you should read all the rules carefully. You may be required to pick a poem or multiple poems from a certain time period, or a poem related to a certain topic. Often, you'll be required to perform your poem within a certain amount of time.;
, Performing a poem lets you show the audience how the poem affects your emotions and ideas. Try to find a poem that causes you to react in some way, and that you want to share with other people. Unless you're participating in a poetry performance with a specific theme, you can pick any type of poem: silly, dramatic, serious, or simple. Don't try to pick a famous or serious poem if you don't enjoy it; any type of poetry can be performed.


If you don't know any poems you like, flip through poetry collections at the library, or search online for poems about a topic you enjoy.
If you want to write your own poem, you can find advice in the article How to Write a Poem.
If you're performing for a poetry competition, read the rules to see if you will be judged on the poem you picked. In some competitions, you'll score more points for picking poems with complex ideas, changes in emotion, and variations in style., If you're not sure how to pronounce all the words in the poem, find a video of the poem being performed and listen carefully. You can also search for ""how is ___ pronounced"" and usually find a written or video explanation. Look up the definition of words you're not 100% certain about. Poets often refer to two meanings of the same word, so learning a new definition might teach you a whole new interpretation of a line.


If your poem was written in a non-standard dialect, or more than 100 years ago, many of the words will be pronounced differently than in a modern pronunciation guide. Try to find a video of these poems being performed, or poems by the same author.

, It doesn't matter if you look up famous actors reciting Shakespeare or ordinary people recording their own poem. It will help if the poem being performed is the one you picked, or has a similar style (loud and dramatic, a realistic description, etc.). You should be able to tell within a minute or two whether you like a performance. Keep looking until you find someone you like, and study the performances they have recorded. Think about why you enjoy it, and write down the answer so you can follow the good example.


Do you enjoy poems read slowly and steadily, or performances that speed up and slow down to emphasize different moods?
Do you like performers who exaggerate the tone of voice and gesture dramatically, or ones who sound more natural and realistic?
This is especially useful if you're trying to get better at poetry performance. Listening to people you admire frequently will teach you how to improve., Print or write out at least one copy of your poem. Make notes directly onto it to tell yourself when to pause, slow down, gesture, or change your tone of voice.This is called scoring the poem, and you might have to experiment with several different styles before you find one you like. Guess at what might sound best, then read it aloud to see if you're right.


If you listened to other examples of poetry, you should have a few ideas about how much you want to change speed, pause, or change your tone of voice.
There's no one way to write down these notes. Use any symbols or words that make sense to you, or highlight the words you want to emphasize.
Think about what suits the poem. A dramatic poem like The Jabberwocky can be performed with big gestures and extreme changes in facial expression. A poem about a quiet view of a meadow should be read slowly, in a calm voice.

, When you're in front of a crowd, it's easy for nerves and adrenaline to cause you to speed up.Even for a poem you want to read quickly, practice starting out quite slow, then speeding up as it gets more exciting or tense. (More rarely, a poem will start out excited and calm down, in which case you can practice slowing down instead.) Pause where it sounds natural so the performance sounds smoother.


Don't pause at the end of every line, unless you really think it sounds better that way. If your poem has punctuation, save your long pauses for the end of sentences, and shorter ones for commas, parentheses, and other punctuation marks.Time yourself if there's a limit to how long the performance can go on. Generally, a poem performance only takes a few minutes. If your performance goes on too long, try to select one or two verses of the poem that make sense by themselves, or pick a different poem. Don't try to read super quickly to get under the time limit; this won't sound pleasant.

, Even a dramatic poem should be mostly about the poem itself, not the gestures and voices you're making. You can be more exaggerated than normal life if you think it suits the poem's style, but don't distract people from the actual meaning of the words.


Try to speak every word clearly. Do not ""swallow"" the end of your sentence, making it unclear or quiet.
If you're not sure what gestures are appropriate, keep your elbows loose near your side and put one hand on top of the other, in front of you. From this position you can make small gestures that seem natural, or stay still without looking too stiff.Occasionally, it's fine to break this rule. If you're performing in front of young kids, they love big, exaggerated movements and sounds. Some experimental poetry might instruct you to make nonsense noises or include other unusual actions in your performance.

, Once you've decided when you want to pause and which gestures to make, you'll still need to practice many times if you want to give the performance your best shot. Try to memorize the poem even if you're not required to, since you'll sound more confident and look more natural if you aren't reading from a piece of paper.


Practicing in front of a mirror is a great way to get an idea of the audience's perspective. You could also record a video of your performance and look at it afterward to get ideas about what looks natural and what doesn't work.
Practice in front of a friendly audience if you can. Even one or two people will help you adapt to the idea of performing in public. Ask them for advice afterward and try to consider every suggestion, even if you don't end up following it.

, Wear clothes you enjoy wearing, but make an effort to keep them tidy and clean. You should also pay attention to personal hygiene. The goal is to stay comfortable and relaxed, but also present a confident, prepared look to the audience.


If you're at a poetry slam or other place with lighting on the performer or people taking photos, avoid wearing white. Bright lights on white clothing make you hard to see clearly., Most people get nervous before the actual performance, so have a plan for how to deal with it. Plenty of practice will make you more confident, but there are also plenty of ways you can calm down the day of the performance:


Go somewhere quiet and relaxing. If you know how to Meditate or want to learn how, try it. Otherwise, just sit still and try to look at your surroundings instead of thinking of the performance.
Drink and eat as you would on a regular day. Eat familiar food, and only drink caffeinated drinks if they're a daily habit. Drink only water right before the performance to avoid drying out your throat.Calm yourself down directly before the performance by stretching all your muscles, walking around, and humming a little to relax your voice.
Take several deep breaths before you begin to perform.This will improve your sound as well as calm your nerves.

, Good posture has many benefits during a performance. Besides making you look confident and prepared in front of the audience, standing up straight will help you speak loudly and clearly, so everyone can hear you., While you're performing, you should be looking into the eyes of your audience members. Move between them frequently, rather than staring at one person for too long, but pause long enough to look into their eyes. This will get the audience's attention and make your performance look more natural.If you're at a competition, don't focus only on the judges if there are other people present. Pay attention to the entire audience, and make eye contact with non-judges as well., There are ways to make your voice sound louder and clearer without shouting. Keep your chin slightly raised, your shoulders pulled back, and your back straight. Try to speak from low in your chest, not your mouth and throat.


Pronouncing every word distinctly will also help your audience understand you.
Take deep breaths during your performance so you don't run out of air.Bring a glass of water on stage to refresh your voice if the performance is longer than a minute or two.

, Keep the microphone a few centimeters (about two inches) away from your mouth and slightly below it. You should speak across the top of the microphone, not directly into it.Before you begin performing, test the volume by introducing yourself or asking whether the audience can hear you.


If you're wearing a microphone attached to your shirt front or collar, you don't need to speak into it. Talk as though you were speaking to a small group. Don't turn your head too far or too quickly, or you could rip off the microphone.
If you are having problems with the mike, ask the person running the audio or the person in charge of the show for assistance. The performer does not need to fix problems with the sound system.

, If you say ""which"" instead of ""what"" or make a similar mistake that doesn't change the meaning or the rhythm, don't panic. Just keep the performance going without interruption.

, The audience has either noticed or is getting confused, so don't try to fool them by rushing past.You don't need to overreact: just pause and go back to the beginning of the line, or wherever you think makes the most sense.


""Bigger mistakes"" include saying the lines out of order, forgetting the next line, or messing up the words enough that the meaning or rhythm is affected.

, Sometimes, your own anxiety can get in the way of your memory. If you've backtracked a couple lines and still can't remember how the poem continues, go back to the beginning. The rhythm of reciting your memorized lines can often carry you through the part you thought you'd forgotten.


For especially long poems, go back a few verses, or about 10 lines.
Keep a copy of the poem in your pocket in case you still can't remember the next line.
If you don't have a copy of the poem and still can't remember the next line, skip to a line you do know. If you forget the rest of the poem, calmly thank the audience as though you reached the end.

, The audience at a poetry performance is there to listen to one person perform, not an argument. Anyone who tries to interrupt you should be dealt with quickly by the audience or by the people in charge.


Depending on how close you are to the beginning of the poem, you could start again or just go back to a natural starting point a few lines ago.

, Making mistakes on stage can actually make you a more confident performer in the long run.The dread of messing up is almost always worse than what actually happens. Look back on it once you've calmed down and realize that people will forget the incident sooner than you think.

Read the poem once silently to yourself slowly.,
Read the poem again and find the literal meaning of the poem.,
Read the poem again to find the connotative meaning of the poem.,
Find the symbolic meaning of the poem.,
Stop and ask yourself, “What is the author trying to say?” What is his goal for this poem?,
Begin to analyze the different parts of the poem.,
Identify the speaker and audience.,
Determine the poem’s structure and organization.,
Determine the rhyme scheme of the poem.,
Analyze the poem in terms of poetic devices.,
Draw your conclusions.",How to Analyze Poetry," The first time you read through a poem, record any “gut reactions” you have to the poem: any emotional connections you have with what the author is saying, reminders of personal detailed experiences, things you like or dislike, or things you like to share with others. Think in terms of, “How do I feel about this? Why? Why not?” These reactions can help you focus on the type of response the poet is looking for in a reader and also give you the true feeling of life.


For example, read Bliss Carmen’s “The Vagabond Song.” Your first impressions may be ones of brightly colored leaves, edged in frost. Or summer turning to fall. It may call up memories of time spent in the woods when the leaves are all changing.;
, The literal meaning is the most straightforward version of the poem and does not refer to any poetic devices. Translate the poem into conversational English. How would you tell the poem’s story to a friend? Think in terms of, “What’s the most common dictionary definition of this word or phrase?” This can be a difficult step, but remember that all good poetry, even when it seems incredibly inaccessible, is still based on words that carry literal meaning.For “The Vagabond Song,” the story is of the poet witnessing the change from summer to fall. He feels like fall is the most captivating season, and it sets his blood going to think of the leaves changing.

, Take several keywords or phrases from the poem and consider the kinds of connotations they carry. Think in terms of, “Why this word and not another?” Refer to your first reactions: often connotative meanings, rather than denotative, are what engage our emotions.


Take the word “mother,” for example. The dictionary would define mother as “a female parent.” OK, but the word “mother” probably creates emotions and feelings in you: it paints a picture in your mind. You may think of love and security or you may think of your own mother. The emotions and feelings that a word creates are called its connotative meaning.
For “The Vagabond Song,” take the phrase “gypsy blood.” Technically gypsy blood means the blood of someone who is of Romani descent. Yet in the poem, the connotation of “gypsy blood” is that of a wandering spirit. The poet may have home or permanent place to live, but when the fall season comes, he suddenly feels restless.

, Record any allusions you recognize, references to symbols, etc. Think in terms of, “What could this stand for? Why?”


In “The Vagabond Song,” consider the word “native.” The line reads, “There is something in the autumn that is native to my blood.” Native in this case, does not mean that the speaker was born with autumn in his blood. Instead it is a symbolic representation of the concept that the speaker feels like he was born to be a part of the autumn, that he feels most alive in the autumn, and that autumn is an inherent part of himself. Native means intrinsic, siren-like, and joy-inspiring.
For another example, consider the word ""light."" This may not refer to the literal condition that means the opposite of darkness; often ""light"" is used to symbolize knowledge, truth, peace, joy, or spirituality.

, What kind of a reaction is he trying to get out of readers? Why?” Try to identify the author’s purpose for writing.

For “The Vagabond Song,” Carmen’s purpose for writing is to celebrate the transition from summer to fall. He wants to express the feelings he gets when the leaves begin to change and a sudden restlessness grips him.

, Analysis from here on out will help you examine how the author accomplishes that affect or meets that goal, rather than what that effect or goal is. This means exploring poetic devices, tone of voice, audience, and more.

, Is there a specific person talking? Is the speaker the poet? Even if the speaker is the poet, you should always refer to the speaker as ‘the speaker’ in your analysis. In regards to the audience, who is the speaker addressing? Is there a specific group? Does the audience help to define who the speaker is?


The speaker of “The Vagabond Song” is the poet. He addresses all of the other ‘vagabonds,’ those people called to movement by the changing of the leaves. However, to him, the vagabonds are everyone who delights in the changes the fall brings--not necessarily actual vagabonds.

, Does the poem follow a narrative? Are there ideas grouped together in different sections? Does each stanza cover a separate topic, or is there a continued theme throughout the poem? How is the poem physically organized--it is one long poem, or does it have stanzas or separate lines?


“The Vagabond Song” has three stanzas composed of four lines each. The whole poem discusses the theme of being inspired by nature (the fall.)

, There are many different kinds of rhyme schemes. Rhymes are used to give the poem a musical, pleasing sound. They can also be used to deepen meaning, and strengthen the form of the poem. Is there any meaning behind the placement of the rhymes? Does it put emphasis on a specific idea within the poem?End rhymes are one of the most common forms of rhymes. When the last word of a line rhymes with another last word of a rhyme, this is considered an end rhyme. In “The Vagabond Song,” the lines “And my lonely spirit thrills/To see the frosty asters like a smoke upon the hills” are an example of lines that have end rhymes.
Internal rhymes are when words in the middle of line rhyme with other words in the middle of a different line. In a poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, he writes “The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew” ‘blew’ and ‘flew’ are examples of internal rhymes.
True rhymes are words that rhyme exactly. For example, the words “cat” and “rat” are perfect rhymes.
Off-rhymes are words that almost rhyme, but do not rhyme exactly. These are also called slant rhymes. For example, the words “fate” and “saint” are off rhymes--they sound very similar, but very subtly end in a different way. Off rhymes use assonance and consonance. Assonance is when the vowels of two words rhyme, while consonance is when the consonants of two words are the same.

, Look for tools of sound (alliteration, assonance, etc.), imagery (sensory detail, word pictures, etc.) and so forth. Think in terms of, ""What kind of language tools is this author using? How do those tools help him accomplish his goal?""What imagery does the author use? Does he use metaphor, simile, or personification? In “The Vagabond Song,” Carmen personifies fall, saying that she is a woman and that “she calls and calls each vagabond by name.” By making the fall into a woman, Carmen draws parallels between the idea of a seductive woman tempting him with the fall calling him to the wilderness to revel in its beauty.
Does the poet use alliteration? Alliteration is when words in a line begin with the same letter. An example would be, “the terrifying tiger tackled the traumatized toad.”
How would you define the poem’s language (or diction?) Did the author choose to put specific words in the poem for a reason? Is the language flowery? Stark? Sad? In “The Vagabond Song,” the diction is whimsical but filled with passion. The color red, which is the color of passion, is referred to throughout the poem. Blood, crimson leaves, scarlet maples, and hills of flame all make an appearance in the poem lending the poem a sense of vitality and passion.

, What is the theme or goal of the poem? What tools did the poet use to convey the theme or main idea of the poem? How did he or she use them? If you are assigned to do so, write down your findings in an analytical essay.

A haiku should consist of three lines. The first line has five sounds, the second has seven, and the third has five. Oftentimes, these ""sounds"" are treated as syllables in English.
A limerick has five lines. The first, second, and fifth rhyme with each other and have eight or nine syllables. The third and fourth rhyme with each other and have five or six syllables.
A sonnet has 14 lines and should usually be written in iambic pentameter. Shakespearean sonnets follow a rhyme scheme of ABAB/CDCD/EFEF/GG. Petrarchan sonnets follow a rhyme scheme of ABBA/ABBA/CDE/CDE.;
, The length of each line and the way the lines are broken up will influence the reader's experience, so you need to format your lines in a way that makes sense.Readers have a tendency to pause briefly at the end of each line, regardless of whether there is any punctuation there. As such, it makes sense to end a line at a point in which a pause would seem natural or could be used to emphasize an important idea.
Words placed toward the end of a line usually seem more significant than those in the middle.
Short lines seem more jagged and rushed, so they can speed up the reader. Long lines look more like prose and can slow a reader down.
Look at how the lines appear on paper. Poems with a light content matter should have a light appearance, with short lines and plenty of white space. Deep, contemplative poems may look more compact.

, Even though readers naturally pause at the end of a line, placing punctuation at the end of that line will encourage a longer pause.


On the other hand, when there is no punctuation at the end of the line, the end pause is minimized and may even be skipped.
Ending a line in the middle of a sentence can highlight an idea or create suspense.

, Stanzas are for poems what paragraphs are for prose. Lines are grouped together in separate stanzas to maintain order and flow.


Stanzas are typically used to organize ideas, so one stanza will likely have a different tone or slightly different point of emphasis than the stanzas before and after it.

, You probably won't find the best combination of rhythm, lines, and overall arrangement in your first draft, so you might need to rewrite your poem a few times to improve on its format.


As a general rule, it might be easiest to write your ideas out instinctively and naturally the first time around.
Re-read your poem out loud and make any revisions necessary after you get it on paper. Keep in mind both appearance and sound.

, Use 1-inch (2.5-cm) margins and 11-point or 12-point font.The left, right, and bottom margins should all be 1-inch (2.5-cm). The top margin can also be 1-inch (2.5-cm), but you can also make it as small as 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) if it looks better.
Use a standard font, like Times New Roman, Arial, Cambria, or Calibri.

, In the upper right corner of the page, type your full name, followed by your full mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, and website (if applicable).


Each piece of information should be on a separate line.
Keep this information single spaced and right aligned.
While this format is standard, it is also acceptable to put this information in the upper left corner of the page, especially if it makes the overall organization of the poem look cleaner. Include the same information and keep the text single spaced, but left align it., On the line immediately following your contact information, list the number of lines.


This only applies if your contact information is in the upper right corner.
If your contact information is in the upper left corner, place the number of lines in the upper right corner, on the same line as your name.
When specifying the number of lines, write ""xx lines."" For example:

14 lines
32 lines
5 lines



, Space down four to six lines, then type the title of your poem in all capital letters.


The title is usually centered on the page. If your contact information is aligned to the right of the page, however, you can left align the title if desired.
A single blank line should follow after the title.

, Align each stanza to the left of the page. The text should have a ragged right edge and should not be justified.


Each stanza is single spaced.
The space between two stanzas should be double spaced. In other words, there should be a single blank line separating each stanza from the ones above and below it.

, If your poem continues onto a second page, you will need to place a header at the top of that page.


The header should include your last name, the title of the poem, and the current page number.
The last name should go in the upper left, the title in the center, and the page number in the upper right. All three pieces should be on the same line.
This header format should be used on each multiple page, regardless of whether it is the second page, third page, eleventh page, or so on.

, Introduce the quote and include the text of the quotation within the rest of the sentence.


Do not create a hanging quote. A hanging quote refers to a block of text that is nothing but the quotation, without any of your own words leading in or leading out. Citing a poem this way does not provide enough context for the quote.

Correct example: In ""Sonnet 82,"" Shakespeare compares the beauty of the poem's subject to her wisdom, stating, ""Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue"" (line 5).Incorrect example: In ""Sonnet 82,"" Shakespeare compares the beauty of the poem's subject to her wisdom. ""Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue"" (line 5).

, When you are only quoting one, two, or three lines from a poem, include the quotation within the main body of the text, placing it in quotation marks.


Use the backslash symbol (/) to indicate a line break. Place a space before and after each symbol.

Example: The poet praises his subject's knowledge and beauty, stating, ""Thou are as fair in knowledge as in hue, / Finding they worth a limit past my praise"" (lines 5-6).

, When you are quoting four lines or more, place the quotation on a separate line after your lead-in.


Use a hanging indent of ten full spaces from the left margin. Each line of your quotation should begin at this indent.
Do not use quotation marks or slash symbols.

Example: Shakespeare opens ""Sonnet 82"" with words spoken to a friend about his Muse:

I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair subject, blessing every book. (lines 1-4)



, For each in-text poetry citation, you need to state the line or line numbers that your quotation came from within the poem.


When citing three or fewer lines within quotation marks, place the line numbers in parentheses after the closing quotation marks. This citation should come before the period, however.
When citing four or more lines offset from the main test, place the line number after the final period of the quotation.
Write ""line,"" ""lines,"" or ""ln"" before the first citation of this poem to clarify that you are citing a line and not a page. For each additional citation, however, you only need to include the number.

Example: Shakespeare opens ""Sonnet 82"" with words spoken to a friend about his Muse:

I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair subject, blessing every book. (lines 1-4)


He continues later, praising both the beauty and intelligence of his Muse, stating, ""Thou are as fair in knowledge as in hue, / Finding they worth a limit past my praise"" (5-6).

, Use infographics, examples and images. Ebooks that feature text without images are less likely to be read and receive recommendations.


Use your own Internet marketing ideas with your ebook. Most customers will view your book on an e-reader or on a computer, so make the content rich, as well as useful.

, Ask friends, business partners and editors to read and edit the book before it is published.

, Look at services like CreateSpace, Clickbank, Smashwords, Barnes and Noble and Lulu. Some ebook publishers include editing services with their product.

, Some Internet marketing experts choose to give their book away after people register on their website landing pages. You should do research on other marketing books, to see what price is typical for a book of the same relevance and size.


Although giving your ebook away is a great way to increase your exposure, charging a small price, between $5 to $10, may make your ebook appear more valuable.

, Write guest blogs on other marketing sites, apply to give speeches at marketing conferences, write articles, send free books to industry leaders, create a Twitter account and publish testimonials.


Consider offering a small portion of your ebook for free on your website. A chapter or portion of a chapter with insightful text and infographics is an excellent selling tool, but does not require you to give away the entire thesis of the book.

, Many online publishers allow you to produce a limited number of paperback copies. Bring these to interviews, meetings, conferences and your office.

Know if it's possible.,
Before the exhibition, do your homework.,
If at all possible, attend the opening.,
Your review will need coverage of the physicality of the exhibition.,
Get coverage.,
Write your review.,
Include as references in your review all the things to read in preparation and that you found in followup.,
Publish your review.",How to Write an Exhibit Review Which Qualifies as a Reliable Source on Wikipedia," Not every exhibition is capable of being reviewed in a manner that reaches the Wikipedia criteria, but every well-written review helps future reviews of the same artist, exhibition, collective or exhibition space meet the criteria, as well as developing the reviewing skills of the author.  Reviews of early-career artists, pseudonymous artists and collectives and certain kinds of anarchist traditions employing deliberate obfuscation present particular problems. Reviews need to be independent of the subject: reviewing your own exhibition, your friends’ exhibition, your partners’ exhibition is going to cause problems. There are, however, methods of overcoming this, for example, a collective of a couple of dozen people who review each others’  exhibitions and other exhibitions in the area.;
, Reading the exhibition flyer or promotional material to see who's exhibiting what, check the them out on the web and in any print libraries you may have access to (keeping notes of what you read where). This will inform your visit to the exhibition and help with writing the review.

, This is where you'll get to meet the artists, curators, etc. and get a feel for the reception of the material. You will probably need to come back for a second look at the exhibition when there are fewer people around; but get as much information as you can.

, Describe the works in detail, their nature, size, shape, texture, etc, etc. Describe their presentation, staging and interaction with the space. Describe the exhibition space itself. etc, etc. Whether you do this from memory, notes or a repeat trip(s) to the exhibition is entirely up to you.

, Your review will need comparative coverage. How do these works compare with previous works by the same artists / curators (ideally compare to public art or pieces with images accessible on the web, since these are typically the most accessible to the most people)? How does the exhibition reflect what you know of the artists and curators lives and influences? How do these works compare to other artists working on the same subject matter, genre and/or technique? How does the presentation of the works compare to previous exhibitions in the same space?

, Don't be afraid to take your time writing up the review and checking the details and checking the spelling and grammar. Don't be afraid to email the artist or curator with any questions you may have, but ensure that the bulk of the review is not a direct quote from them, since interview-based items aren't 'reliable sources' by Wikipedia standards. Go back to the exhibition if necessary to check your first impressions.

, These are very important, because they are evidence that your review is a 'secondary source'. Ideally these references will either have a URL to them (for things on the web), an ISBN (for printed books) or an ISBN and details of issue (for newspapers, etc that aren't on the web). If you can't find many sources on the works, artist and venue of the exhibition, or can only find sources that are not independent, your review is unlikely to meet the bar for Wikipedia. The good news is, however, that by publishing your review, it can be used as a source for other reviews to meet that bar.

, When looking to publish your reviews, don't worry about the technical platform you use, blogger.com, WordPress or the website of your local art society is just fine; what's important is the clear editorial intent rather than the method of publication.

Click that button to start setting up your account.You'll be prompted to choose a user name, and provide an email address and password. Choose a user name that you think best identifies you as a gamer.;
, Once you enter the required information to get started, My IGN will send you an email asking you to verify your email address. If you don't get this email within a few minutes, check your spam folder., Just as on any social media platform, My IGN gives you the ability to tell other users a little about you. For IGN in particular, focus on highlighting your favorite games, what kind of gamer you are, and the games you play online.You can include game IDs as well, if you want to be able to play online with other IGN users who see your profile.

, The My IGN community is similar to any other social networking platform in that the posts you get on your home page depend on the accounts you're following. Start by following some of your favorite games.Following games you love will lead you to other people who also enjoy that game. Follow and talk to these people to expand your network.
At least at first, follow back everyone who follows you, unless they never post about anything you'd want to see or read. Right now you want to expand your network.

, When you move around the website, you accumulate points for completing various actions, such as uploading a picture or commenting on a post. As you continue to participate, you will gradually level up.You have to be at least level five and have an account at least two weeks old before you will be allowed to post blogs or reviews.

, Before you start posting your own work, get a feel for what other community members are posting. This helps you avoid repeating what someone else has already said.You also can get a feel for what types of writing are most popular, and start finding your voice, or the style you'll use when you write your review.
You also can introduce yourself through comments and reach out to other users who you think would enjoy your work. For example, you might comment ""I thought your discussion of color was interesting here. I just started, but I'm planning a blog entirely devoted to the use of color in Skyrim. If you're interested, check it out!""

, Instead of thinking broadly about the games that you love, think about something specific that you like that sets you apart from the crowd. You also might find a niche in some particular, narrow aspect of gameplay or game design.Reading others' posts can also help you get a sense of what your niche should be. If you see a lot of people writing about a particular topic, ask yourself if you have anything new to contribute to their discussion.

, If you're trying to build up a following so your blog will be successful, you need to show up on other people's blogs frequently. This doesn't mean you have to comment on every post, but you should be an active follower.When you show up on others' blogs frequently, they'll have greater recognition of your username and be more likely to read your posts when they see them.
Supportive notes in particular are likely to get you more support from those who follow you.

, You have the ability to private message and communicate directly with other My IGN users from your account. Adjust these settings to suit your personal safety preferences.For example, you may want to allow anyone to message you, or you may want to restrict messages to followers who you also follow.
The more interaction you have with other users, the more interested and supportive they'll be of your posts. Don't necessarily think about it in those terms, though. Just relax and have fun talking to other gamers.

, When you log into your account, you'll see a tab that says ""blog."" Clicking on it will give you the choice of either writing a new blog post or uploading a header. Before you write your first post, make sure your blog looks the way you want.You can use a header image to make your blog more attractive to view. Play around with this to get your page looking the way you want. If you change your mind about it later, you can always upload a new image.

, For your first blog post, your best option typically is to let your followers and readers know who you are and what kinds of things you're going to write about on your blog.Use the same writing style and voice you plan to use for your reviews. This gives first-time readers an introduction to your writing style as well.
Start by introducing yourself as a person, using highlights that are relevant to your gaming interests. Then discuss the structure and focus of your reviews and your schedule for posting them, if you have one.

, When you've finished writing your blog post, proofread it carefully for errors. Click the button at the bottom of the page to publish your blog when you're satisfied with it and ready for others to read it.Once you publish your blog, anyone who follows it will see it pop up in the feed on their home page.

, At the bottom of each blog post, you'll see a big red button that says ""submit."" Clicking this button will pull up an email client so you can send an email to IGN staff asking for your blog to be featured.Use the email to briefly sell yourself and your blog post. Talk about what makes it (or you) special, and why your post deserves to be featured.
You'll receive an email notification if your blog post is selected to be featured on the IGN homepage.

, Once you've published your blog post, you can still link to it on other websites or around the community to get people to read your post. Encourage others to share it as well to get the word out about your reviews.The more popular your blog posts are, the more likely you are to be featured on the IGN homepage on a regular basis.
Even if you're not featured, if you have a lot of users following your blog your reviews will still get a lot of attention.

, You can promote individual posts by messaging or commenting on posts. If you read something that you think is related to something you wrote, drop a link so the other person can read it.Be careful with this and make sure your post is actually relevant to the discussion. You don't want to spam people, and most people are put off if they feel like you're only talking to them to promote your work.

If anything, you’ll also be able to determine what you don’t like about someone blog!For example, if you’re creating a home and food blog, scroll through other popular home and food blogs. Notice the layout, content, and images on the other blogs. Pay attention to how long the posts are, the frequency of the posts, the writing style, and the subject matter.
If you’re creating a business blog, look at how other sites approach a certain business topic. Also, note if the site has an active comments board and how often the writers respond to reader comments.;
, The language you use and the style of your writing will shift based on who you are writing the blog post for.If you are writing for a personal blog meant for only close friends and family, you can likely be as honest or casual as you’d like. You also won’t need to explain that Toby is your 4 year old son or Baxter is your cat.
Treat a personal blog like a conversation. Write like you are chatting with a close friend or family member. Avoid jargon, complicated sentences, or cliches.The reader wants to feel like they are getting to know you, so don’t be afraid to put your unique voice front and center.
If you are writing for a personal blog that is meant for a larger audience, you can still write casually and honestly. But you may need to include references, a glossary, or explanations to ensure your readers can follow along.
Though business blogs or marketing blogs may be a bit more formal, they should still have a conversational tone. Above all, you want to avoid confusing or boring the reader.
For a business or marketing blog, think about what your readers expect from your blog. Are you providing information to your readers/buyers? Are you trying to persuade them to buy a certain product?It’s also important to think about the information your readers already have. If the majority of your readers are Millennials looking to start their own business, you probably don’t need to provide information about how to use social media. But you may want to give them information on how to adjust their approach to social media to be more business-savvy.

, Consider what you can write about that is different from what everyone else is saying. An effective blog post offers unique information to the reader, whether its an opinion, experience, or guide.For example, you are writing a blog post about how to make chocolate cake on your personal food blog. Of course, there are many recipes for chocolate cake online. So what makes your recipe stand out? Are you adding interesting ingredients like salt or candy? Or are you using a unique technique to make the chocolate cake?

, This can be as general or specific as you’d like. But keep in mind, more specific blog posts are usually the most effective.


If you are writing a personal blog about fashion, you may want to consider a fashion issue or problem you are interested in discussing. This could be the lack of nice clothing for plus size women, the neon fall trend that won’t go away, or even your struggle with finding the right pair of jeans.
If you are writing a business blog, you may want to focus on a particular aspect of your business that might be interesting to your customers. For example, if you run a retail camera store, you may want to talk about the latest camera releases, or a more specific topic like your favorite digital camera on the market.

, If you are stuck on a title, try to narrow down the title so it is specific to the blog post.


Don’t be afraid to have a bold title. The title is the first thing the reader will see on your blog, so make it attention grabbing.It may be better to have a simple title, rather than a complicated or confusing one. Though you may want to be snappy or witty, often titles that are clear and easy to read are the most effective.For example, a blog post on your food blog about a chocolate cake recipe could have the title like: “My Amazing Salted Chocolate Cake Recipe”.
A blog post about finding the perfect pair of jeans could be: “Blue Jean Blues: Finding the Perfect Pair”. Or something shorter and simpler, like: “My Search for the Perfect Pair of Jeans.”
If you are writing a blog post on your favorite camera on the market, you could use a title like: “The Best Point and Shoots Out Right Now”. Or something more formal like: “My Top Ten Best Digital Cameras on the Market”.

, This is the hook that will get people to start reading. In fact, its proven that if you get people to read the first 3-4 sentences, they are more likely to read the rest of the post.Writing a grabbing opening sentence and paragraph can be difficult, so try these techniques:


Identify a need.Think about what problems or issues the reader would want to solve. Create an opening line that promises to answer this need. For example, on your food blog, you identify a need for your reader to learn how to properly ice a cake. Your opening sentences could be: “We’ve all been there. Your child’s birthday is set to start in an hour, but you can’t figure out how to ice the triple layer chocolate cake.”
Ask an intriguing question. Use a question that leaves little room for the reader to respond with anything but “yes”. Make the question seem interesting enough to the reader. For example, on your camera blog, you could begin with: “Looking for a digital camera that produces top quality images, but doesn’t weigh a ton? Ready to switch to a point and shoot, but shopping on a budget?”Say something unexpected. But make sure it still relates to the topic of your post. This could be a unique statement or phrase that you haven’t used often on your blog. The idea is to jolt the reader into paying attention. For example, if you often talk about cakes or cookies on your food blog, begin a post on pies with: “Okay readers, it’s time for me to do something radically different on here. I give you: lemon meringue pie.”Make a claim or promise. This technique works well for business blogs that are selling a product or providing product information to their readers. Just make sure you can back up your claim with solid content. For example, the camera post could begin with: “Today, I am going to help you buy the best digital camera you have ever owned.”, Sometimes a specific topic can lead to pages and pages of relevant information. But most online readers have short attention spans and likely won’t spend hours pouring over your blog post. Work on saying the most you can in the fewest words.


Create an outline for the post. Break the topic down into sections, short paragraphs, or subtitles.If you are writing a blog post with a recipe, you may want to create a separate section for the recipe and then a separate section with the directions. Or if you are writing a post with a list, use numbers to organize the content.
Download free blog post templates online, which are pre-organized based on the most common blog post types., Many readers will approach your blog post with skepticism. Particularly if you make a claim like “the most amazing chocolate cake ever” or “the best digital cameras”. So don’t be afraid to use outside sources or content to back up your claim.


You could include customer testimonials, expert quotes and industry research or data.
You could also include a seconding of your claim from another blogger who is considered an expert or tastemaker in the eyes of your audience.

, Give your reader practical, easy to apply advice or information.Avoid wishy-washy content or vague sentences.If you are writing a blog post with a recipe, breakdown each step in the recipe. Explain how the reader can whisk the eggs, combine the wet and dry ingredients, or place the cake in the oven. Be specific and go through each step in a logical order.
If you are writing a more opinionated post, like the best ten digital cameras, back up each camera with a personal note about your experience with each camera. Include your reasons why each camera is worth the reader’s attention.

, A blog post does not need to be a short novel, or a guide to solving all the reader’s problems. Avoid packing in too much information into one blog post.Remember that your blog has an unlimited amount of space for posts and images. So don’t be afraid to focus on one aspect of a topic and then expand on another aspect in another blog post.

, Get your reader involved in the blog post by asking them a direct question at the end of the post, such as: “what do you think about this recipe?”You can also include a “tweet this quote” option on a quote from the post, or add a share button for Facebook or Twitter., Tags are keywords that describe a post. They allow the reader to browse for related content on your blog and encourage your reader to read other posts on your site.


Think of tags as keywords, terms, or categories that relate to the post. Avoid a laundry list of terms and only include terms that apply to the topic of the post., Images are a good way to keep the reader engage and to break up any long chunks of text. Don’t go too image crazy though. Use one or two high quality images that relates to the topic of the post.Focus on images that look interesting, are easy to understand, and trigger an emotion in the reader., Reread and edit the post for any grammatical errors. Make sure you have covered the topic in detail and are offering a new perspective on a familiar question or current issues.If you are writing a personal blog post, it may be useful to read the post out loud. That way you can check that the voice sounds natural and casual.

, Based on your readership, it may make more sense to publish the article at a certain time of day or during the week. This will ensure you publish the post when your readers are already online.Most blog experts argue that posts published on weekdays will get more exposure and traffic than posts published on weekends.
Public holidays are also not the best times for publishing a post as web traffic is usually already down during these times.
Figure out the best time of day for you to publish posts by testing out different publishing times with your audience.

, Blogs that attract the most readers are the ones with frequent updates. Spend time updating the post and adding to it so it remains fresh in your reader’s minds.If you are updating your blog on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, keep it consistent so your readers know when to look for new content on your blog.

, The best way to build your readership is to maintain an active comments board. Show your readers you care about their thoughts by responding to their comments and starting a dialogue.Responding to reader comments also allows other readers to have conversations with each other on your blog. This builds reader loyalty, and creates a space where readers feel like they can talk and “belong”. It also gives the content of the post more depth by including other opinions and impressions from readers.

, You can use any plain text editor. This includes Notepad, Notepad++, gedit, Atom, VIM, Emacs, and plenty more. There are also other programs specifically made for Markdown, downloadable to the operating system of your choosing, including MarkdownPad for Windows, and MacDown for Apple computers, and many more. And finally, there are online editors galore. Choose any editor you please., Headings are denoted by the # tag, with the first word of the heading coming immediately after, with no space. # denotes Heading 1, ## denotes Heading 2, and so forth all the way up to Heading 6. Headings are typically used as section titles.

, ** denotes that your want the text following to be bold. Note that to end the bolding text, you must repeat this tag like this **

, * denotes the following text should be italicized. This too must be closed to end this tag.

, Though not in the official Markdown specs, a strike-through is commonly denoted as ~~. Most Markdown compilers will recognize this, but it is not always consistent. It must be closed by an end tag too.

, Blockquotes are denoted by a > at the beginning of a line. A blockquote must start on its own brand new line. Each additional new line to be included in the blockquote must start with >. Blockquotes can have further Markdown inside of them, and blockquotes can be layered like this >>. Blockquotes don't have an end tag, you simply stop putting > on each new line, and give an additional line between the end of the blockquote and the normal text.

, +, -, or * followed by a space, on a new line with each item, is used to denote unordered lists. It does not matter which one you use, but for clarity sake, don't switch in the middle of a list.

, Start your first item with the number one, followed by a period and a space. The following numbers each take up their own line. Also the numbers you use consecutively after don't matter, but must exist.

, Links follow the format (link here ""optional title here""). The quotes and optional text can be left out. Automatic links can be done <www.wikihow.com>, along with emails the same way. Make sure your link URL is correct, nobody likes dead URLs!

, Syntax for images is very similar to links. !(image path ""optional title here"") is used to link an image. The quotes and optional title can be left out., To add code, each new line should at least 4 spaces or a single tab in. To end the code block, return to writing normally. Small parts of code can be denoted with ` as both the beginning and end tag. Note that this is not the single parenthesis symbol, but instead is a backtick.

, Writing horizontal rules and other miscellaneous format features requires some special tags, too:

Horizontal rules are written on their own line with ***, ---, or +++.
Line breaks are done with two spaces at where the line should end, followed by moving to the next line.
emails are added with <address@example.com>


, Certain characters need escaping when they are used outside of Markdown code. They are escaped by putting a \ directly before each character, with no space between. These characters include:

\ backslash
` backtick or grave accent (used to denote code)
* asterisk (used to denote italics, bolding, and unordered lists)
_ underscore
{ } curly braces
square brackets
( ) parentheses
# hash mark or hashtag or number sign or pound sign
+ plus sign
- minus sign or hyphen
. dot
 ! exclamation mark

Turn the essay in and enjoy the fruit of your labor: an easy ""A""!

",How to Write an Essay on WikiLeaks," Read news articles. Sometimes news sites will have a place below the article for user comments. It can be informative to read through some of them because they can offer a layman's perspectives and opinions.;
, Will the essay be informative? Will you argue your opinion and try to convince people that you are right? Will you argue for an opinion that you don't really care for? This last choice is a good way to open your mind and expand your horizons. You may also not be given a choice and have the type of essay given to you by your professor.

, This isn't difficult. It just involves taking a stand or stating what you hope to accomplish. For example (don't use these - come up with your own):


Wikileaks has damaged the credibility of many powerful nations.
Wikileaks has benefited mankind through the disclosure of shady foreign policy wranglings.
WikiLeaks provides many people with insight into diplomacy between great nations.
Bradley Manning's actions in disclosing classified documents to Wikileaks were shallow and misled.

, Is your teacher or professor going to be the only one to read this essay? Will you be addressing a group of peers? Your tone and respectfulness can make or break your argument. Maintain your tone by being consistent with the way you are addressing your audience, or you may seem wishy-washy. Stay true to your thesis.

, You want to look for works that are academic or respected sources, such as journals, periodicals, and respected press articles. Blogs, Wikipedia, and personal websites generally do not qualify as reliable sources. Google Books is a good place to begin searching. Also, there are online journal websites that may give free access to information, but most require some sort of membership. Wikipedia, although unacceptable as a source, can be a great stepping stone to building your formal sources.

, You will be required to get physical books most likely and you don't want to be stuck without a means of acquiring them at the last minute.

, You may also include notes on opposing views, so that you can be better armed to defend your opinion.

, In academic environments, this may be dictated to you. A good thumb-rule to use is ""tell them, tell them what you told them, and then tell them again"". That is, introduce the reader to what you will be writing about, including stating your thesis, then make each point with support, and finally, conclude by restating what you have covered. Be sure to explore the different ways of structuring an essay.

, In this case, assemble your bibliography page in the format approved by your organization, professor, or teacher. Typical styles include MLA or APA. The Rules for Writers handbook is an awesome resource for learning how to cite sources.

, This will nail down the structure of your essay. Start with the introduction and simply list each point you will cover. Longer essays may require multiple paragraph introductions, so don't feel that you have to keep it to one paragraph. Move on to the body supporting paragraphs. Include your source citations. Finally, write your conclusion paragraph(s) by stating what you have already covered.

, Review the criticisms, corrections, and advice that your professor has given you and incorporate them into your writing. Flesh out each paragraph with your further thoughts on each point. Read a paragraph out loud to a friend or family member and have them ask questions. Answer those questions in writing.

, Use a protective cover and a title page if required. Be sure to include the bibliography page.

, These can be paid or unpaid, but different sites have different regulations and will give you exposure and practice on different platforms. Some suggestions are Textbroker, Demand Studios, wikiHow, Break Studios, or Internet Brands. You can even reach out to niche sites that align with your areas of expertise.

, Provide links to your site profiles where people can see your published work. You can also provide some personal information that will help in branding yourself, but you should stick to things that qualify you as a writer. For example, you can list your education and areas of interest and expertise, but avoid writing about your home life. While you may love it, the information comes across as unnecessary and annoying to potential clients or employers.

, Whether it is in Twitter or your blog feed, find individuals who have made a career of freelance writing and read all about their successes and failures. This will help point you where to go and may even uncover some wonderful opportunities for you.

, You will find that some sites pay much better than others. The goal of this step is not to earn a lot of money, but to gear yourself towards writing to a client’s detailed specifications. Chances are, the higher the pay, the pickier the editors are in publishing content. If you only want to freelance as a hobby, you can stick to the sites that are easier to publish on, but you will not receive nearly as much constructive criticisms on how to improve your writing.

, Sites like Elance and The Freelance Writing Jobs Network are some good sites that display high quality jobs. You may only land a few or none at all at first, but it is a learning process that must be embraced and you will be surprised at how much you learn from just trying. The better and more established you become, the more money you will be able to earn.

You upload your electronic file and they convert it into an eBook. You then include information about the book and choose a sales price. If you choose not to go through one of these platforms, then you’ll need to create your own eCommerce site and fight for visibility. The most popular platforms include the following:


Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing
Apple iBooks
Barnes and Noble Nook Press
Google Play
Kobo Writing Life;
, Each has different rules for publishing content. You should look around the sites and find each site’s terms of service. Read it thoroughly to see whether the vendor allows you to publish public domain content and what terms/conditions apply.


Kobo, for example, will only give you a 20% royalty for public domain titles.Apple iBooks and Nook Press have also refused to sell public domain work in the past., Amazon won’t allow you to publish a public domain title if there is already a free version in their store.You should search the Amazon site to see if a title already is for sale.


It’s okay if there is a title so long as it is not for sale for free.

, Amazon, for example, will let you publish the public domain title if you differentiate your book. Your book will be differentiated if you do the following:Offer a unique translation. This means you translate the book. Don’t use an online translation app or use a translation that is in the public domain.
Include unique annotations, such as literary critiques, study guides, detailed biographies or historical context.
Provide 10 or more unique illustrations that relate to the book.

, Don’t assume that because you found a book on the Internet that it is in the public domain. Also, you shouldn’t assume a work isn’t copyrighted because it lacks a copyright notice. Instead, you need to individually analyze each book based on the following:


Certain work is not eligible for copyright protection because it is common property, such as calendars or works by the U.S. government.In the U.S., a book is in the public domain if it was published before 1923.Pre-1923 material is the safest material you can use.
If the work was published after 1923 but before 1978, then it is in the public domain if it was published without a valid copyright notice.
If the book was published after 1923 but before 1964, it is in the public domain if the copyright was not renewed. You can check if a work was renewed by searching at the Copyright Office. Be careful, however. Works might have been registered under different names. You’re inviting a copyright infringement lawsuit if you publish a work that is protected.
The copyrights for books published after 1978 will not expire until the middle of this century. The only way it is in the public domain is if the author dedicated it to the public domain. There should be a notice to that effect on the work.

, Online publishing changes rapidly. Vendors change their terms and conditions at will, and what was legal six months ago might no longer be allowed. Accordingly, stay up to date on publishing requirements.


Join different message boards for indie publishers so that you can keep up on changes to each publisher’s terms and conditions.
Also check your accounts regularly. Books might be removed from sale without notice, so you always want to check.

, You can upload content directly to most publishing platforms, but you must create an account first. Each vendor should walk you step-by-step to creating an account with them. For example, do the following:



Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing: You can create a publishing account by signing in with your Amazon customer account.If you don’t have a customer account, then create one. Kindle will ask you for contact information and bank information so that they can pay you.

Apple iBooks: You need a Mac with OS X 10.9 in order to create an account.Alternately, you will have to go through an aggregator, but many of these aggregators such as Smashwords and Draft2Digital do not accept public domain books.

Barnes and Noble Nook Press: Provide your email address and a password to create an account.

Google Play: You need a Gmail account to create a Google Play account. Google only occasionally allows people to create publisher accounts on Play, so keep checking back.

Kobo Writing Life: Visit https://www.kobo.com/writinglife and click on “Create an Account.” Provide your email address and password.

, Online publishers allow you to upload different document formats, which they then convert into eBooks. For example, Amazon KDP will let you upload in Word, EPUB, MOBI, Rich Text Format (RTF), Plain Text (TXT), Adobe PDF, or HTML.However, Amazon recommends you upload in Word, using either the .DOC or .DOCX format.Remember to include a title page at the front. You should identify the title and author of the public domain work. Also identify any original contributions, such as the creator of illustrations.

Include your copyright notice for any original contributions.
Also insert a table of contents. This is tricky. You should use the “Insert Table” feature in Word.

, The formatting must done correctly, otherwise the book will look funny after it goes through the conversion process. If you’re publishing on Amazon KDP, then remember the following tips for a clean presentation:


Don’t us “Tab” to create an indent. Instead, go into “Layout” or “Page Layout.” Then under “Special” select “First line.” Pick the indentation, such as 0.5 inches. You should set the paragraph indent before you even compile the book.
Also insert a page break after each chapter. If you don’t, then the text will all run together.
To insert a picture using Word, select “Insert” > “Picture” > and then the file you want to insert., You can create your own cover or use Amazon’s Cover Creator. The Cover Creator will walk you through the steps of choosing a design and the layout.You can wait to use it when you upload your files. Remember the following tips when creating a cover:KDP accepts both JPEG and TIFF file types for your cover image.
The height/width ratio should be 8:5. The shortest side should be at least 625 pixels, while the longer side should be at least 1,000 pixels.
The cover image cannot be greater than 50MB.
Cover art that is white or a very light color should have a thin border added to them so that they stand out.

, At Amazon KDP, you should go to the bookshelf page: https://kdp.amazon.com/bookshelf. You have to fill out information about the book, such as the following:


The book’s language.
Book title. Remember to include the words “Translated,” “Illustrated,” or “Annotated” to the book’s title. The tag you use will depend on the original content you provided.For example, if you provide detailed biographical essays or a study guide, then you would use “Annotated.”
Author’s name. Remember to include the name of the person who authored the public domain work.
Contributors. For example, you can select “Translator” and then include your name.
Description. You get 4000 characters to describe the book. Remember to include information about what you added to the book. For example, “New illustrations.”
Public domain work.
Keywords. You can select up to seven keywords. These keywords help customers find your book. If you are publishing Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights, don’t pick generic keywords like “gothic.” Instead, be creative.
The category, such as “Fiction,” “Non-Fiction,” etc.
The age and grade range of your reader.

, You’re now ready to upload your Word document (or other file) and your cover image. If you need to use Cover Creator to make a cover, then you can do so now.


You should also preview your book by using the Online Previewer. Read through the entire eBook looking for errors.
KDP will also identify typos. Review these carefully because the program sometimes identifies words that are spelled correctly.
Common errors include using “Tab” to indent and not inserting pictures properly. If you find something wrong with the formatting, then go back through your Word document and make corrections before uploading the corrected document again.

, Amazon KDP sets a minimum price of $0.99. To get a 70% royalty, you must price your book between $2.99 and $9.99. If you price below or above those amounts, then you get a 35% royalty.


Generally, public domain work is only eligible for the 35% royalty.
To be eligible for the 70% royalty, you must publish an original translation or add substantial original content to your public domain title.KDP does not define “substantial,” which will probably be decided on a case-by-case basis.
You also must price competitively. Look what other versions of the book are selling for on each vendor's website. You can price a little higher if you are providing substantial extra value. However, you generally don't want to be too high.

, If you provide a study guide or academic essays to a public domain title, then be sure to register the copyright in your material. You can’t copyright the public domain material, but you should protect your own original contributions.


You don’t have to register in order to have a copyright in your material. However, you must register before you can bring a lawsuit in the U.S. for copyright infringement."

Make connections.",How to Start a Sports Blog," It's important to decide how you want your blog to appear, because in part this will determine how your blog is consumed. You might want a more visually-oriented blog, posting screenshots of scoreboards or photos from a game, for example. Or you might want a blog that lets you write long, detailed reports on game statistics, player performance, or predictions for the season. How you envision your blog appearing and being used may affect your choice of platform.A primarily visual blog can be built for free using a site like Tumblr. Tumblr is widely used as a form of social media across all demographics, has mobile compatibility, and uses tags that can help drive traffic to your blog.A platform like Medium might be more compatible to a longer, text-driven blog.Platforms like Typepad and WordPress can be curated to either a visual or text-driven blog.;
, It may seem like an obvious choice, and for cash-strapped bloggers it may be a necessity to choose a free service. But the trade-off is that a paid service, which typically charges a monthly fee of $8.00 or more, allows you total control over the design and layout of your blog, and may offer technical support and search-engine optimization for your blog.There's no clear-cut answer to this choice, but some factors to consider as you choose between free or paid services include:


how important design and layout are to you
how often you will write for your blog
how big an audience you hope to reach

, This is another choice that may seem obvious, but owning your site outright (called a self-hosted blog) or using an existing blogging platform both have their advantages and disadvantages. Owning your own self-hosted blog requires you to pay for a registered domain name, which can cost anywhere from $7 to $15 annually.The advantage to a self-hosted blog is that you have full ownership of your site's content, and you can sell ads on your blog and make money.The downside to a self-hosted blog is that it requires maintenance and some extra time and effort. You'll need to update the software for your blog's platform when new updates are released, whereas if you were using an existing blog platform the site would be automatically updated by the platform's server.If you're just getting started in blogging and aren't sure whether it's something you'll want to continue longterm, you may want to opt for a free platform on an existing server that won't require you to do anything other than post updates from time to time.
Consider whether you hope to make money off your blogConsider how important content ownership is to youConsider whether you're willing and able to regularly check for updates and maintain your site's platform, If you're blogging about sports, you have some flexibility in terms of subject matter. You may want to write about the sport itself, covering an entire league or even multiple leagues. You may want to focus on a sport's conference, an individual team, all the teams in a given city, or even an individual player. Unless you're extremely knowledgable about a sport and follow the entire league's play closely, it may be easiest to focus on an individual team or player (especially if this is your first blog)., Once you've been following a team or teams to report on long enough to get some material, you'll want to find some kind of niche within sports blogging. There are countless sports blogs on the internet, and many of them are written by knowledgable, passionate sports fans. So what will set your blog apart from the rest and make people want to follow your posts? Some bloggers focus on subjects that sports fans are interested in across all teams and regions, such as collective bargaining agreements or other financial aspects of sports. Whatever niche you choose, it's important to find a subject that you have some kind of special knowledge or authority on, as this will help establish your blog much more quickly.Think about whether any aspect of your education, work experience, or life experience qualifies you to become an expert on a certain area of sports reportage. This can help you find your focus and may help you gain popularity more quickly., Depending on the platform you've chosen, you may have limitations with regards to how much you can customize your blog. But it's a good idea to make your page as unique as possible. Creating a logo, customizing the layout of your blog page, and adding colorful photos help set your blog apart from other sports blogs on the internet, which is important in getting your page off the ground.Having a meticulously-customized blog page might also help inspire you to be more active in writing posts and maintaining the page.


Try looking at some successful sports blogs for inspiration and ideas about what kind of customization is possible. You can even search for ""sports blog design"" in an online search engine to find some striking and successful examples., One of the most important things to remember when undertaking any kind of writing project is to consider who your audience is, and what they want from you as the blog writer. Your audience is obviously an audience of sports fans, but within that demographic, who are you trying to reach? Former athletes who are now sports fans? Parents of athletes? It may be worth deciding who you want to inform and entertain before writing your blog, so that you know how to tailor your posts to meet the needs and interests of that audience., Most readers checking in on a sports blog won't want to commit to spending an hour on a sports manifesto. Keep it short, but punchy. Some experts recommend a maximum of 750 words per post in order to ensure that you don't lose a reader's attention., No two blogs are going to be exactly the same. The best and most sincere way to make your blog stand out is to let your personality come through in your writing and invest a piece of yourself into the blog. Readers will enjoy your blog for the same reason your friends enjoy spending time with you - because reading your blog feels like having a conversation with you., Some of the best-ranked sports blogs are those that make an argument and defend that position. Some experts believe the reason for these sites' popularity is because news outlets already report objectively on players, teams, and league happenings. Sports fans can find that information anywhere, but a writer who takes a stance and argues for or against a subjective opinion is not something you'll see as much on ESPN., Much like taking a stance on an issue, another thing sports fans seek out in popular blogs is the under-reported dirty laundry of sports. Many people feel tantalized by a good scandal, and sports blogs that address athlete drug use or otherwise bad behavior, for example, give fans something to gossip about.For an excellent example of a sports blog that addresses the dirty laundry of sports stars, take a look at badjocks.com. It's grouped into topics like illegal activity, dumb behavior, and painful injuries.

, Each blog post needs a title, and how you phrase that title is important, as it could make or break someone's interest. If you can get a reader to read the first few lines, that reader will probably be interested.The title is how you pull people in. When choosing a title for a given blog post, consider:


communicating some kind of benefit, like a title that offers to instruct or inform readers on something they may not knowstarting a controversy or passionate debate with your titleusing key words that will be relevant to sports fansusing humor, One of your goals as a blogger should be to reach as wide an audience as possible. You can do this by making your blog posts SEO-friendly. SEO, or search engine optimization, is the use of key words that will bring your posts closer to the top of an online search in a search engine like Google.Use key words early on in the title to ensure that your post shows up earlier in search results. So, for example, instead of titling your post ""Ten Ways to Write a Great Sports Blog,"" try titling the post ""Writing a Great Sports Blog: Ten Great Strategies""., Don't say everything you have to say on your subject in the first few blog posts. You'll be left scratching your head wondering what more there is to say on your blog. Instead, try to think in terms of longevity: will these issues change over time? Will they be relevant in six months? Rather than saying everything in one long-winded blog post, ask yourself how you can break that idea up into many smaller (750 or fewer words) blog posts that can be posted serially for several weeks. It takes a while to gain a dedicated readership, so you don't want to run out of steam once fans finally start to take an interest in your blog., The best thing you can do for your blog is to make frequent posts. Whether you commit to a daily blog post, weekly posts, or somewhere in between, keeping your blog's feed fresh will help keep people coming back to your blog. Anyone who is interested in what you're saying will want to check back regularly to read your newest posts, which is crucial to getting your blog noticed., One thing that will keep readers coming back is if they feel like their voices are being heard. Let readers comment on your blog posts, and respond to as many as you can, both good comments and critical ones. This allows readers to feel like there's a dialogue, and readers may even suggest compelling topics they'd like to see in future blog posts., Some blog platforms allow readers to subscribe to a blog's RSS (rich site summary) feed. Readers who subscribe to your RSS feed can view your blog posts through an RSS feed reader without having to track down your blog page to check for updates and new posts.To gently remind readers to subscribe, you can use a standard line at the end of your blog posts, like ""If you enjoyed what you've read, please consider subscribing to my RSS feed for all the latest news in sports.""

, Online analysis suggests that blog posts tend to receive more web traffic when they're posted on weekdays instead of weekends. That's because many people kill time online at work, whereas weekends tend to be reserved for vacations, running errands, or spending time with family members., If you're serious about blogging and want it to lead to a job as a writer or sports analyst, you'll want to promote your blog on social media sites. You can do this through your own personal social media account, or create an account for your blog and invite your friends to follow you on your chosen social media site. This will help your blog get attention and a broader base of readers, and can help your readers/followers keep on top of the newest blog updates.Social media also lets you interact with your readers, answer questions, and take suggestions for future blog posts., Whether you focus on promoting your blog through social media or by word of mouth, it's important to make connections. You can reach out to players, teams, or even brands and companies that you frequently blog about. They might be willing to participate in an interview, or at least re-post a social media update about a particular blog post you've written. You can also reach out to other bloggers and collaborate on future projects, or invite one another to write a guest post on each other's blog page.Building connections with other bloggers and relevant subjects can help you build a community online and get some additional web traffic for your blog."

Maintain your storyblog.,
Advertise!",How to Start a Storyblog," The whole point of a storyblog is to tell a story without it being confined to a certain amount of pages or space. Make sure your story is not only interesting, but will be interesting for a long time.;
, Writing and keeping up storyblog takes a lot of time, and that time has to be consistent. Whether you write every day or every month, you need to have a solid block of time to sit down at the computer and write.

, Depending on your experience with creating a blog and your internet connection (among other things) you might need to join a different hosting site. A few good sites are: WordPress, and Blogger. While WordPress and Blogger are specifically for blogs, Webs is for complete websites. Know what type of storyblog you want before you choose your site.

, This, obviously, is an important step – so do it right. Make sure the web address, theme of your blog, and assorted other things are relevant to your story.

, There's a difference between writing and posting – make sure you know it. Open a word processor and write your first entry. This can either be the first ""episode"" of your story or an explanatory post that deals with things that don't relate to your story (how often you'll be posting, ""Join my blog!"" etc.). Make sure you save the entry onto your computer!

, There's nothing worse than a sloppy entry full of mistakes and grammar errors. Ergo, this is where the word processor comes in. Do a quick spell/grammar check of your post.

, After your entry is error-free, go to your blog and click 'Post New Entry'. Although the wording may vary, this is how you post. Then copy (right-click on the mouse and hold down while you drag it down the post, then click 'Copy'. Make sure everything is selected!) and paste (right click again and select 'Paste') into the text box. Click 'Post', 'Save, or 'Publish', whatever is there, and then visit your blog. Your entry should be there!

, Repeat Steps 5, 6, and 7 consistently, whether it be every other month or every other hour, make sure you keep a schedule so readers know when to check back.

, Although this step is optional, it's one of the most widely used. Once you feel you have enough posts and your storyblog is ready, submit your site to search engines like Google, Yahoo! and Bing. Make sure the tags you have are widely searched, relevant to your storyblog, and common words. Another recommended idea is to make yourself present on sites like Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter. Make sure to 'Tweet' or post whenever you update your storyblog. Joining other things like AIM and Skype aren't bad ideas either. Make sure you tell family, friends, and co-workers about your storyblog too!

Quotev is a relaxed writing community that largely consists of teens, and FanFiction.net - as the name suggests - is a website for only fanfictions, which are popular among teens today. Plus, if you're writing as a teen, Teen Ink is an online writing group for teens that publishes several works in a magazine each month as well. Do you want to write on a private website and only get comments on your work? Start a blog!


Keep in mind that there are also sites for specific interests that you can write for. If you want to write a fanfiction on a certain topic or write a lot of a certain genre, chances are that you can find a more private website with interested users.;
, Starting to write online is a huge commitment, so you probably don't want to just jump in without any knowledge of the website's workings. What do users at this website expect in writing? What is the main audience of the page? Be sure that you'll be getting what you want from the place, as it can be hard to leave once you join and get an audience.

, If you're starting a private blog, the creation process will vary from site to site, but if you're joining a community, you'll usually need to pick a username and password, as well as submitting your email and sometimes, your age.

, Especially if you're professional, you'll need to set limits as far as how much is posted from your book. Many writers' journals won't accept work that has been published anywhere else, and some publishing companies won't take work that's been published online, either. , The most common technique of writing online is to write chapters and publish them as you go along. The writing is often unplanned and casual, and editing happens as you go or at the end of writing. You can also write the entire story and publish it when you finish, although it generates less popularity due to the fact that your article won't appear in ""Newly-Updated"" lists as often, or write the entire story, edit, and publish the finished chapters one at a time.

, Once you have your ideas in mind and know how you'd like to publish, you can get right to it. It's a good idea to at least revise each chapter before releasing if you're publishing as you go to avoid spelling errors and confusing sentences.

, If you're writing online, chances are that you started to get critique, so get it! Invite friends and family to read your work, talk to other users on the page (if it's a community), advertise your account or website, and update frequently. Share your stories on social networks if you can. Get advice from your friends and readers as much as possible.

However, you will find a small button, generally at the bottom of the page, to take you to the writer's page, which provides you with information you may need about Wattpad.;
, You will sign up for a reader's account, but you can use it to post stories. You can sign up with Facebook to create an account. However, if you prefer, you can use an email, username, and password instead of Facebook.

, On the next page, the sign up section requires you to pick three stories to follow. You can search for different types of stories by keyword, then click on the cover to select.

, Choose ""My Profile"" from the menu. You need to create a profile because readers are interested in knowing who you are. On that page, click on ""Edit Profile.""

, Let the readers know who you are. You can provide some background information, including your education and a little bit about your family, if you want. It's important to talk some about your writing, however, as the bio introduces you to the readers. Discuss your style and what you like to write. You might also talk about how you got started writing.


This bio should be in first person rather than third person. In other words, you should be using ""I"" in your bio.For instance, you could say something like ""I'm a fiction writer living in Denver with my 2 kids and 3 cats. I love to write young adult fantasy, from fairies and princesses to dystopian futures. My style of writing is fun and funky, with touches of humor throughout.""

, You can use your name as your author's name, of course. However, you can also choose a pen name for your work. Enter it in the box near the top of the page.

It can be merely descriptive or provide an air of mystery., Just like your background, you can upload a cover to set the tone for your book. Be sure to include the title and your name or pen name on the cover. Also, make sure the cover fits the genre. You don't want a dark, blood splattered cover for a romance novel., It's like the back of the book that provides a short, engaging summary of the work. This type of description works best if it reveals just enough to leave the reader wanting to know more but not so much that you give away the whole story.Don't forget to include the main characters' names and the setting.Use strong imagery, and make sure that imagery is appropriate for what you're writing. For instance, you wouldn't want to use a sentence like ""Leslie yearned for a man to sweep her off her feet"" with a crime thriller, but it would work well for a romance.Keep it relatively short. 100 to 150 words is plenty., Tags are short keywords that describe your story. Tags are used all across the web to help people find what they are looking for. Pick tags that cover your setting, genre, and tone of your story. For instance, for a camping ghost story, you might include ""ghost,"" ""haunted,"" ""campfire story,"" ""scary,"" ""spooky,"" ""West Coast,"" ""California,"" ""woods,"" and ""camping."" You can add tags by clicking ""Add a Tag"" under the description box., Basically, this category is what type of story you're telling. You can choose categories such as ""Fanfiction,"" ""Humor,"" ""Romance,"" or ""Spiritual."" If your story falls under two categories, pick the one that is strongest in your story., From the drop-down menu, pick the main language of your story. Next, choose the copyright you want to have. If you don't understand copyright yet, a good bet is ""All Rights Reserved,"" as that means the copyright remains with you. You also must decide if your story is meant for a mature audience or not. Save the changes you've made, which will take you to the next page.

, Once you've input all the information, you can publish the first part of your story. Click on ""Untitled Part 1"" on the next page. Type in your text on the next page. When you're done, submit it.You can also add a title to each part, as well as video or photos by clicking the buttons at the top of this screen.

, You can add a new installment on the same page you found ""Untitled Part 1"" by clicking ""+ New Part."" Readers on Wattpad expect regular updates to their stories. In fact, you should update at least once a week, but two or three times a week is better."

Be professional.,
Keep it simple.,
Complement the story with your cover.",How to Make a Book Cover for Wattpad1," Your cover is the first thing that people see when they look at your book. It shouldn’t be off-putting, disturbing, or too comic and absurd. Even if your book is a very funny book, the cover needs to be professional looking. Remember that there’s a difference between professional and boring – your cover should be interesting and enticing, but it also needs to look composed and clean.


For example, if you want your cover to be a naked man running through a football field that is perfectly okay. You just have to find a professional way to show that. Maybe the picture is from behind and far up so that you can see an empty stadium and the entire field. This cover is interesting, professional and engaging.
Avoid low quality pictures and sloppy fonts.
Make sure that people can actually see your title. You don't want it to be fading into the background of your cover.;
, You don’t need that much on your cover to make it interesting. Don’t choose a picture that is too busy or complicated. Remember, most people are just going to be glancing over books. Your book cover should pop without being too intricate. You also don’t need to use Photoshop or any other more serious editing software to make a good cover. You might just end up with a poorly photo shopped photo if you do that.

, Everything from the text to the color scheme to the picture should act as an extension of your story. It doesn’t necessarily have to show a scene or character from the story, but it should match the general feeling that you want the reader to have while reading the book.

"
"
Find a picture you are allowed to use.,
Avoid a busy picture.,
Choose a visually attractive photo.,
Trust your gut and be willing to wait.",How to Make a Book Cover for Wattpad2," Just using google images probably won’t cut it. You’ll end up with a picture that is copyrighted for commercial purposes. Try using Flickr creative commons for photos that you can use for free. You can also scan a photo that you have and use that. , If there is too much going on in the photo than it will be less likely to capture someone’s attention. You don’t want too much action, and you also need space for your title and the authors name.

, Pick a photo that people will want to look at. Even if your story is a horror story, guts and blood isn’t that appealing when it comes to the cover. Pick something else that is spooky but also beautiful, like a dark lake, or the forest at night.

, You will know it when you see it. Don’t settle for a book cover that you are feeling unsure about. There are so many beautiful pictures out there that you shouldn't settle for one until you find a picture that really sticks out to you. You should be proud and excited that you found this picture, not tentative.

"
"
Choose a font that’s easy to read.,
Use one font for the title and another font for the author’s name.,
Avoid using more than two fonts.,
Make sure your picture and your font mesh.",How to Make a Book Cover for Wattpad3," You want your picture and title to capture the eye. If nobody has any idea what your text says they are less likely to be interested in the book. We naturally skip over text that is unintelligible.

, Some recommend using one font to accentuate a few words that you want to stand out in your title and then another font for the rest of the words including the author’s name. This is also a tactic that you can take; just make sure that neither font is too dramatically different from the other.

, More than two fonts make the cover start to look messy and busy. Stick with two fonts that complement one another.

, Don’t choose bubble letters if your picture is a serene landscape. Choose a font that complements your picture. "

Explain the whole procedure to your child.",How to Motivate Your Toddler to Write an eBook," Read at least three of these, to get a good idea of how they are constructed and what they look like.;
, Before choosing the topic, keep in mind the following:


Age group for which you are writing
Clarity of the concept
Popularity of the topic
Practical implications.


Ask your toddler to suggest a suitable topic. Since your toddler who will be co-writing some of this book, she or he might have some fun ideas that will be ideal for the storyline and content.

, While you will need to write the basic outline and ensure that the story moves along properly and has a good structure, allow your toddler to fill in as much as possible from her or his own storytelling imagination. Invite your toddler to participate with stories and ideas. If your toddler starts to tell whole storylines, record these, as they can be edited back into the book's content later but you'll likely only hear that story once.

, When writing for children, pictures must be included in the story, to make it more interesting and understandable for kids, especially if the book is aimed at the same age group as your toddler. Ask your toddler to choose pictures of her or his own. You can decide later which ones are the most suitable, keeping in mind that your toddler's eye for a good image may be just what the other toddlers want to see too.


The pictures must be copyright free or you must own the copyright to them. Use Creative Commons, public domain and self-created images.

, Ask questions about what should happen next, what the characters think or do, and what the ending might be. Feed all of your toddler's ideas into the text as you write it. Remember to keep it all very simple, just a few sentences a page, or even just one sentence.

,, If your toddler seems bored, doesn't like certain parts or tells you something isn't funny or good, pay attention and remove or rework those parts. When both of you are happy with the final story, it's good to go.

, Though there are other platforms you can choose for publishing your ebooks, if you prefer––this is just one simple example that works well.

, You can upload the ebook but as you do so, explain the procedure to your child so that she or he begins to learn about the idea of publishing online and can see how easy it is to do. This will encourage your toddler to want to write more.

, After having published the ebook, invite your toddler and even your toddler's friends to read it together online. Sit down together somewhere comfortable, open up the digital device on which you read your ebooks and open her or his ebook from the account. When your child finds the ebook with her or his pictures online, she or he will be thrilled at the idea that it is available for other people to read too, everywhere in the world.

, This will provide your toddler with a new concept of e-learning and will motivate them to write their own ebooks.

Browse a collection of free books.,
Find rare, historical, or academic books online.,
Browse free books on an eBook database.,
Search for a specific book online.",How to Read Books Online1," There's a lot of advertising and spam for sites that promise to provide free books, but there are a couple reliable, long-lasting sites that provide extensive free collections.



Project Gutenberg hosts a large volunteer-provided collection of books without U.S. copyright protection, usually because the author died more than 70 years ago.All of them are free, almost all of them are available in plain text for any computer, and many are available in eBook reader formats as well.Google Books has an extensive and varied collection, but not all of it is fully available or free. Books under copyright protection usually only have a few pages displayed, but sometimes there is a link provided for purchasing the full version.;
, If you are studying an academic subject, or are interested in historical works, books in these fields may be easier to find online than in physical form. Take a look at the following free, specialized collections:


Use the HathiTrust website to search for books in many academic collections, including many free eBooks. Some materials, but not all, are restricted to members of universities or other academic institutions.
A large collection of classical Greek and Roman literature is available through Tufts University's Perseus project.
The Library of Congress has an online collection of rare historical documents and a few other old books that can be difficult to find anywhere else.

, Companies that sell eBook readers often have their own collection of eBooks, including free options. If you do not have an eBook reader device, you can download a free program to access the Kindle collection on your Windows or Mac computer, or use a non-proprietary database such as FeedBooks by installing Adobe Digital Editions for free.Apps are also available for most eBook databases in the app stores of all major phone and tablet manufacturers.

, If you are trying to track down a specific book, and it is not available in any of the above collections, an online search may locate it on another website. Keep in mind that most recent books are not available for free, although some publishers offer a free or discounted eBook if you already own a paper copy.


Be cautious about any website you do not recognize as a well-known, trustworthy source of books. Try searching for reviews of the website before you download anything, and never enter your credit card information for a ""free"" eBook.

Visit the publisher or author's website to download your eBook.",How to Read Books Online2," The Amazon Kindle store, The Barnes and Noble Nook store and Google Books are all large and well-established, and can be used on a computer, tablet, or smart phone as well as an e-reader device. They are likely to have the latest available eBooks, and carry little to no risk of viruses or identity theft.


If you are using a computer, you can either download the free eBook reader software made available by the book seller, or look for books in general purpose formats. PDFs can be viewed in Adobe Acrobat Reader, while .LIT, ePub, and .Mobi files can be read in Microsoft Reader.

, Independent eBook sellers may offer collections focused on specific topics, or works by new and unknown authors.Before downloading any files from a site you do not recognize, search for reviews of the site online to determine whether it is safe.



Smashwords offers self-published and independent works, with a focus on fiction.

Safari offers access to O'Reilly Publishing's extensive library of programming and computer books.

APress Alpha and Manning Early Access provide access to books on technological topics as the book is being written.

, Book subscription services offer access to a library of online books for a periodic subscription fee. Many of these services offer a free trial month.

Entitle offers access to your choice of two books each month, for a monthly fee.

Oyster is a book subscription service oriented at mobile devices, with a heavy selection of indie and new authors.

, Commercial sites like CourseSmart.com, Chegg.com or Textbooks.com are often the most likely to have recent or required textbooks, but may require paid registration. Portions of the textbook may be available for free, or the entire eBook version may come free with the physical textbook.

, If you are looking for a specific book, search online for the author's personal website or the publisher's promotional website for that book. An eBook is sometimes offered through these sites, or the author may provide free supplemental material or previews.

Download additional eBook apps.,
Transfer eBooks from your computer.,
Consider buying an eReader.",How to Read Books Online3," Many tablets, smart phones, and eReaders come with their own app for reading eBooks. In order to read books available through other sellers, however, you may need to download another app. Search for apps such as Entitle, Kobo, Amazon Kindle, or Noble Nook to access books through those proprietary services, or to import eBooks in other formats. The Adobe Acrobat Reader app can be used to view any PDF document, no matter where it was downloaded or purchased.

, Computers are often faster at downloading files, and may have access to online databases that do not function properly on your mobile device. Many devices can be plugged into your computer for quick file transfer, or you can use Bluetooth, iTunes syncing, Dropbox, or email.


Some files, especially those purchased from an eBook store, may have DRM protection, preventing them from being opened on more than one device.

, While mobile phones and tablets can be fine, portable ways to read books, eReaders typically offer an easier way to download books, and more energy-efficient and daylight-visible screens. Keep in mind that many eReaders use DRM protection, which will prevent you from transferring the books to other devices.

Use caution and high security measures with this method.,
Download books using BitTorrent.,
Use Internet Relay Chat (IRC).,
Purchase a Usenet service.",How to Read Books Online4," File-sharing websites transfer files from user to user, with no third-party oversight. While you may find books not available anywhere else online, there is a significant chance of exposing your computer to viruses and malware that could slow it down or steal your personal information. Many file-sharing sites contain copyrighted material, whose download is considered illegal in many countries.


Set your operating system's security level to its highest setting. In Windows, this is available through the Control Panel; on MacOS, this can be done through the Internet option in System Preferences.
Turn any security software you have on to maximum. Turn on your anti-virus software and your firewall software and turn them to their highest settings.

, Note that the selection of books that are available on BitTorrent tend to reflect popularity instead of literary or reference value.This method can also take a little time and effort to set up and learn how to use.


Choose a BitTorrent client. In order to avoid malware, using a trusted source such as BitTorrent.com is recommended.
Search online for an ""eBook torrent tracker."" These collections of links to eBook files come and go quickly, so searching online is the best method of finding them. Many require a signup, and a minimum amount of time spent using your computer to share files before you can download files. Public torrents without a signup may have a higher security risk.

, Many out of date or otherwise obscure works, as well as recent popular ones, are available on IRC, or Internet Relay Chat. Once you've downloaded an IRC client, such as mIRC, you can use it to search for chat channels devoted to ""books"" or ""eBooks"" to find other users to share files with or talk to about books.

, Usenet is a bulletin-board-like server-based network originally developed for secure, high-speed chat. Today Usenet is also heavily used for file sharing, but it requires a monthly fee from a Usenet service such as Usenet Server or Newshosting. Many of these services also provide search tools and automatic conversion of downloaded NZB files to readable formats, which is recommended if you are new to Usenet."

Keep updating!",How to Make a Webcomic," For many webcomics, this means having a good plot. Your webcomic doesn't have to have a plot, but having one will make it easier to come up with ideas and stay motivated. Use tools like Monomyth and Act Structure to make sure that your story has good pacing and that your readers will be able to connect with the story. Choosing some themes and issues to cover can also help.


Remember the most common writing advice: write what you know! It's good advice! This doesn't necessarily mean that you should only write about your life or make realistic fiction style stories. It just means that you'll usually write best when you write about overall experiences and emotions that you know about.;
, Create some primary and secondary characters, if your comic will have regular characters. Draw a character sheet for them so that you're sure to stay consistent with their look. Then write yourself a ""cheat sheet"" of their character history, personality, flaws, and other details.


Remember that characters that lean more heavily on the flawed side will give you more to work with as writer and develop over time. Balance is important, but you need to give yourself wiggle room!

, Write three or more test comics. They should incorporate all your main characters (if you have them) and be in the style you want your webcomic to be. Don't make it very quick and sketchy or very careful and precise if this isn't how all the comics will be done. The goal here is for you to get an idea about how long it takes you to make a comic and learn how you might streamline the process. You might end up deciding that you need a simpler style, less coloring, or other changes.

, Show them to your friends to review. If you don't think your friends will be a very reliable source, try to find a chat-room or some online friends to send them to. You'll want to understand what's good about your comics and what things you need to do to improve. Ask for a good amount of detailed feedback on them, not just an ""I like it!"" or ""It's funny!"".


Don't worry about catering to what every single person says. You want to deal with what the most common complaints are.
Do people dislike your main character? Are your jokes funny? Is your drawing style a bit slapdash? Work on things like this before you complete your final comics.

, You'll want to have a regular schedule that you can update on and then stick to that schedule. This is so your readers will know when to come looking for a new strip. Having a really irregular schedule is a good way too lose most of your readers and deter new ones. An update schedule will also help motivate you to work on your comic, as working on it as a habit will help you overcome laziness and procrastination.

, You want to start your webcomic with as many strips as possible. Your first update should include more than just one strip, so that your readers can get a sense of what you're about, and then you want to have extra comics available in case you can't work on one that week (or whatever your update schedule is). If you find it hard to write up this many comics, then this possibly isn't something you should pursue. You should probably have quite a few ideas in your head already - you won't have to write as many at a time in the future, so don't worry.


Generally you want to start with 1-3 months worth of strips.Do more if you know your schedule is hectic or you're prone to procrastination.
If you wish, you can use the same plot lines you used in your first three, just cleaned up from the new feedback you've received.

, You can get your comic hosted for free on websites like Comic Fury, Smack Jeeves, Drunk Duck, and others, but these websites severely limit your ability to make money from your comic. They also tend to look unprofessional. If you're okay with that, then that's fine! Otherwise, you'll want to get your own website domain. You can get a website for very cheap and the right web host can make it much easier to run. Give your website a good name that's easy to remember. Naming it the same as your comic will help a lot.

, If you do not know much about web design, you may want to hire somebody or get a friend. The place you get the domain name from may offer this! Hosting sites like Web Fury can help if you have little experience with setting up websites, as you can use their templates and tools. You'll want a simple layout, with basic colors and few visual distractions. This will help make sure that your website doesn't distract from your comic. When you format your site, try to do the following:


Center your webcomic in the middle of the page. It should not be too big or too small.
Make your comics easy to navigate. Include a link to an archive of all of your comics. Arranging them by story line or chapter usually works better than by date, if your comic has an actual plot line. You should also include buttons below the comic that let you see the ""first"", ""previous"", ""next"" and ""latest"" comic strips.
List the name of your webcomic at the top of your page, along with the update schedule.
Let your readers ""see"" you. Include a Contact page, so people can e-mail you about the comic, advertising, collaborations, feedback etc. You should also have a blog area, possibly below your comic, that will just be random musings from you, possibly about the comic. This way you can keep people informed and help them connect with you.
Give your readers a voice. Consider a comments area for viewers to comment on your comics. This is not for everyone, but it will make your readers much happier and invested in the story. You can add a forum later if your comment section can't handle the load.
Consider a link exchange or links section. They may do the same in return for you, thus raising your site traffic. Just talk to other artists!

, Get the comics up and on to your website. You can put them all up at once, or spread them out over a series of time. Many websites will let you make an update queue, so that the website updates at a set time, even if you're away. You should already be writing new comics as you are putting these ones up: always maintain your buffer!

, People won't just come across your site. Talk to people who run other web comics and get them to write a small blogpost about you, or have a link to you on their site. Get an advert for your webcomic on similar sites. Go onto forums and make a thread about the site. Put links on your Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook and in your signature on any forums you are a part of. Ask any friends who would appreciate its humour to go on, and perhaps advertise it on their blogs/sites.

, Getting in with the webcomics community and making friends with other creators can really help you be successful in webcomics. They can give you advice, encouragement, and help you promote your comic. The community is strong and supportive, so don't be afraid to reach out. Just spend time interacting with and supporting other comic artists, and be sure to be respectful and positive. Definitely don't be creepy!

, Running a website can be expensive, especially if you have a lot of readers. It is also really time consuming. If you want to create more time to work on your comic, you'll need to find a way to get it supplementing your income so that you don't have to work as much. You'll make a little money by putting ads on your site (Google Ads are easiest) but most webcomic cartoonists make most of their money from merchandise (often called ""merch""). Be prepared to deal with getting books, posters, stickers, and other items printed and made, as well as traveling to conventions and things like that. If you're not up for these things, then you're unlikely to be able to sustain your comic in the long run.

, Don't let your web comic die. If you've been unpopular for a few months, don't stop updating! If the material is good, people will come. Making a really successful webcomic is like becoming a movie star. It takes a lot of hard work and most of the time recognition won't come right away. You have to persist!

Whatever it is, choose something you know that you can write about with passion, vivid interest and an obvious skill. Making your story fascinating is absolutely vital for getting noticed.;
, Don't write a story about drying paint. Find something that will have your readership riveted.

, Extend your vocabulary, your phrasing and your descriptiveness beyond the ordinary. If you find this difficult, it means you need to read a lot more, and more widely too.

, What are their stories about? Werewolves? Fanfictions? Or maybe some poetry? Try writing in a similar vein, without copying, of course. You will need your own plot, your own twists and your own characters––be inspired by, not wed to, someone else's works.

, Contrary to the old saying, a lot of people actually do judge books by their covers, and the cover is definitely the first thing people will see. Make it look professional with eye-catching pictures and fonts, and make sure the title stands out. Study covers of books you own to see what good covers look like. Along with the cover, something readers will first see is your description, so make the description detailed and interesting. Again, you can study the blurbs on published books you own as a model.

, Make it sound interesting to read - because many people just ignore all the requests.

, It's against the Policy and no one wants that. Simply go with the flow and eventually, some reader will stumble across your page.

, If you feel you're a really good writer and you absolutely adore fame, you can categorize your story under ""Watty Awards ___"", since everyone likes reading the Watty Awards entries.

, Try being the exact opposite and you'll gain lots of followers and readers - remember, treat other people the way you want to be treated.


Equally, don't make deals with people to vote on each other's stories so that you can gain fame.

, Comment on those clubs and interact with other Wattpadders. Create your own discussions that people can join. That can really help you get noticed.

, In addition, keep them updated as to when your next update will be, since most readers doesn't have the patience you expect and some of them might stop reading your story because they think you stopped updating it. The update deadline also pushes you to ensure you meet it.

, Fame on Wattpad doesn't occur in one night. Let your works slowly achieve the number of reads/votes you desire, even if it takes a long time. Remember, there are millions of writers/readers out there!

, Ask them for ""A read for a read?"" Give them a friendly compliment on about their profile. At the end of the day, trading reads isn't the best way to get 'famous.' Occasionally the person your trading with may go and read the rest of your story out of interest, but most of the time the reads you get from read trading are meaningless. Remember, you want readers, not reads.

, Get yourself out there. You cannot expect to become famous (though, in rare cases you can) and write a book without commenting, voting and becoming a part of the Wattpad community. Talk about movies or books or sometimes randomly message people.

, You'd be surprised at how easy it is to gain followers just by commenting and engaging in conversations with people! Make yourself known to others.

, Let them read about it; you can find information about Wattpad if you keep scrolling till you reach: About Us.


If they have any problems, they could contact Wattpad to make sure it is quite safe.

, This includes both written and speaking, as well as expanding your vocabulary.

, Although you shouldn't say it as forcefully as this, the general gist is to impress upon them: Would they rather have you be writing a story rather than partying till late? Be polite, now!


Explain to them that your friends have said that Wattpad makes their free time more exciting and that they look forward to writing and joining in with the Wattpad community.

, You could even explain that you feel this would help to raise your self-confidence and competency in schoolwork. And if your story starts gaining in popularity, you'll also learn some online socializing skills in showing gratitude and interacting with other people in a kind and caring way.

, You could throw in a few sweeteners, such as promising to do more chores or finish them faster, or to do things they don't like doing around the house. Promise these in exchange for being able to spend time on Wattpad.


It's also a good idea to explain to them that you will fit Wattpad in around your schoolwork, and not the other way around!

, Be honest in your answers. Do not exaggerate about the site or its benefits. Stick to the facts and how you consider it would benefit you. Your parents will do their own research and checking of facts.

, Don't pressure them; say that you'll ask them again after they've had a few days to think about it. It's a rare person who likes to make a decision on the spot about something important and, if pressured, you may just get a straight out ""no"". Give them time to get used to the idea and to have a little play around on the site.

, Don't go behind their backs; inevitably they'll find out and that will only disappoint them and shows them that you cannot be trusted. If they realize that you're persistent and will only try to persuade them again at another time, they may be more receptive in a few months time.

Promote preview of your book on social websites such as Squidoo or You Say Too.

",How to Grow eBook Sales," Your website doesn't have to be elaborate in order to grow your e-book sales. Use free blog publishing software available at sites such as Wordpress.org or Blogger.com to tell the world what your book is about and why they should buy it. If you have researched your audience carefully, you will know what keywords and bullet points will get their attention in order to sell your e-book.
, Set up a Facebook fan page, a Link'd In profile and a Twitter account to help increase e-book sales by allowing people to share your page within their networks. Update these outlets daily by sharing small bits of the topic addressed in your e-book.

, These sites allow you to publish your book in their directory so that other people can sell it on their websites and receive a small commission in return.

, Participate regularly in blogs and discussion forums related to the topic of your book. Be subtle; don't overly sell your book when commenting. Simply offer your perspective on the topic related to your e-book and include your book title in your signature line.

, Give interested buyers downloadable previews of chapters and provide a few free sample pages from your book. Including several reader testimonials about how your e-book affected them will help grow your e-book sales too.

, Each business card you hand out is another way to take advantage of free advertising that can grow your e-book sales.

, Remember to include a cover letter with well-written content that they can use in their review. To get the word out to reporters, send out press releases on distribution websites such as Free Press Release.com., You can grow your e-book sales even more if you make it available as a Portable Document File (PDF) for those who don't have an e-book reader. A PDF can be read on any computer that has the free PDF reader software installed on it.

, For example, offer bonus chapters, worksheets or promotional materials to buyers. You can sell more e-books if you make people feel as if they get a bargain on your e-book.

Be prepared to 'self promote'.,
To briefly summarize the e-publishing experience, an author will want to consider the following points:


e-publishers do not pay advances, but most of them pay their royalties on a monthly or quarterly basis.,
Understand that one misconception is that e-book publishers are not as stringent in their editing and selection requirements.,
Decide if print publishing and e-publishing is what you need.,
Key to publishing e-books is that you have to love to write: be flexible, be prolific, and be persistent.,
Look at the whole picture.",How to Decide if eBook Publishing Is Right for You," Since e-publishers expect their authors to assume responsibility for marketing and promoting their own books, this is an area with very specific challenges. One idea is the establishment of a network of authors, linked together, with targeted meta tags and keywords, that would result in high ranking on the major search engines.


In the early days of e-publishing it seemed that everyone with a computer was starting an ebook publishing business, however, over time, the shoddy ones were flushed out by market demand for quality work.;
,
The majority of the e-publishers also publish in print (but because they are print-on-demand, the paperbacks are frequently more expensive and because most of the e-book publishers do not allow returns, many of the major chain book stores are reluctant to stock the books (unless the author is willing to personally provide the stock – which many authors do quite successfully). This scenario is, however, changing, and over the next couple of years the industry will see great strides made by successful e-publishers to compete in the print marketplace. My publisher, Cerridwen, for instance, has purchased their own printing press and they now publish trade paperbacks that sell at mass market prices.
E-publishing royalties are generally much higher than print royalties – in the 35% range for ebooks compared to approximately 7% for print books.
One of the biggest benefits with e-publishing (and their print editions) is that your book stays in print for an indefinite period of time. As long as your books continue to sell your publisher will keep them available and in stock.

, In fact, the opposite is true. Given the initial skepticism and the necessity to establish themselves and gain respect in the industry, most eBook publishers have extremely high standards and those authors accepted can expect extensive editing. In recent years it has become increasingly difficult to break into e-publishing, especially if you do not have a publishing history/track record.

, Many authors who publish with traditional print houses have also signed with e-publishers. The reasons are varied with e-publishing you don't need an agent, you don’t have to wait months (and in some cases years) for publisher responses, you can gain a track record as a published author a lot quicker, books come to print much faster.

, If you build up a nice library of your published e-books with a good e-publisher and you're willing to do the marketing that needs to be done to get your books recognized – at join a site like Books We Love to get the news about your books out there, you are in a position to make some decent money and build an extensive list of published works.

, In summary, if you want more control of the books you write, the size of your own personal published library and you want your books to stay in print for an indefinite period of time, then e-publishing is probably a good fit. If, however, you only plan on publishing one or two books in your lifetime and you don't care for any of the online or marketing aspects, then you're likely not a good fit for e-publishing.

Identify who you are selling to.,
Choose a bold, San-serif font for your eCover's headline or title.,
Include at least one benefit in your eCovers headline or title.,
The smaller the font is, the more you need to spread out the letters.,
Decrease the tracking on larger text for your eCover.,
Avoid placing text over busy background images.",How to Create eCovers That Sell," Most new marketers don't take the time to get to know their prospect. This includes the other places they go, what they do in their spare time, and most importantly, the language and words they use to describe things.


There's much more you can find out about your market, and when you do this, you can make creating any sales material easy on yourself- including an eCover of the product you're selling. Marketers that have years of experience do this very thing.;
, Use a smaller (but legible) text for the sub headlines and other text below it. What are the best fonts to use for your eCover headline? Verdana, Arial Bold, Copperplate, Tahoma bold, and Myriad Pro.

,


The title is great if your brand is already established and is recognized by many people.
People will buy a thing from emotion, and if you include the benefits your target market care about, you can grab their attention and increase the value of your eCover.

,


Increase the font tracking in the image editor of your choice. This is a way of increasing the readability of the eCover. To test this, all you have to do after adding headlines and sub-headlines to your eCover, is to use the magnifying glass tool in your image editor.
Decrease the magnification and check to see if the text in your eCover needs to be a little larger, or if the tracking needs to be increased.

, This should be simple, now that you've done the opposite to the smaller text. You can also bring the vertical space or ""leading"" closer together for better readability. This is also easily accomplished with the tools in your image editor.

, If you are ever in doubt of using a great looking background image over the words that will be used on your eCover, don't do it. More than likely, if you do, it's going to distract your prospect away from the words. Busy backgrounds will kill the message. Any images that don't relate to your target market, or the theme of what your product is about is asking for trouble.

Include visual and audio content as appropriate.",How to Create an Online Magazine," All types and genres of magazines can be published online, from international news magazines to small literary reviews. Before you create any online content, you need to nail down a specific plan for your magazine.Ask yourself:

What topics and type of content will your magazine focus on?
How large of a staff will your magazine have?
Will you hire copywriters or freelance writers, or will you serve as the magazine’s editor and review submitted work?;
, A polite email to the editor of a small magazine—especially if it’s similar to your planned magazine—could result in an informative conversation which will help you establish your magazine.


Look around online—through Google and Facebook—to find similar magazines and contact them. Ask specific questions, such as:
“How many staff members do you employ?”
“How did you market your magazine to attract new readers/subscribers?”
“How long did it take you to start the magazine?”
“What are some common mistakes that I can avoid when starting my online magazine?”

, Determine how much money you will need to start and maintain your magazine. Also consider how your magazine will generate financial income.Keep in mind that many online magazines can be started and initially maintained for free, even if they subsequently need a small budget.
When forecasting your magazine, consider your rate of return, note the current economy, and allocate money for advertising.
Eventually, you may need to establish a magazine-dedicated savings account for any unforeseeable events.
In determining your staff budgetary needs, consider freelance writers, interns, and volunteers. However, it is unlikely that you will have all (or any) of these positions filled upon the launch of your magazine.

, Sit down and formulate a strategy to publish the magazine. Eventually, you may want the magazine to generate an income. Your business plan should include financial goals for the magazine, and include how you plan to fund various expenses.


For example, the magazine's mission, the type of content and how you plan to get and keep subscribers.
In developing your marketing strategy, note your target audience, how often the magazine will be published, and research the competition.
Once the magazine is up and running, use social network sites to promote your online magazine and specific articles.

, If your magazine will not have financial income through online subscriptions or generate income by charging for submissions, it may need to sell advertising space on the website.Ask business in your area if they have advertised in the past, which parts of the experience were successful, and which parts failed.
Explain how advertising on your magazine’s webpage will benefit the business (more customers, etc.), and invite them to buy advertising space.
Also reach out to online-only businesses, as these depend on website-based advertising.

, Try selecting a name that will draw customers to explore the magazine, and that also describes the magazine content.


Brainstorm a list of potential magazine names—then check online and make sure none of them have already been taken.

, Once you have selected a name for the magazine, research the availability online—there are a number of internet-based websites that help you search registered domain names.


If the name is available, register the name. This will prevent other magazines from using the name.

, You should display your magazine’s title and logo (if you have one) in a way that is succinct will catch the eye of your readers.Hire a professional if you’re not comfortable designing or coding the website yourself. You should retain full creative control over the design of your online magazine.
For ideas and inspiration, look at the print magazines in a large bookstore, or browse the layouts of online magazines you enjoy reading.

, This is the point at which you figuratively “build” the magazine’s website. Consider how you want the magazine to catch a reader’s eye, where you want the content to appear, and how many


As with the layout and logo design, if you are not experienced coder, consider hiring someone with the expertise to deliver a professional result.
There are also a number of sites that allow you to build a website with minimal coding knowledge, such as www.wordpress.com.

, In business terms, you will need to market your magazine in person and online, in order to attract new readership. Consider using one or more of these means to build up an audience:


To generate your audience, look for an already existing online community that has an interest in same topic your magazine covers. Send work to that community (e.g., through a forum post) and consider their input on your content.Make business cards and pass them out in person. Prominently feature your magazine’s URL, and pass these cards out to everyone you know.
Use social media—reach out to friends and friends of friends on Facebook.
Create a subscription link on the web page. This will allow your readers to receive updates and information about your magazine.
Although online magazines are usually website-based, consider providing some of the magazine content via email subscription. Readers with busy schedules may find your magazine more accessible if its contents (or at least links to online content) are delivered directly to their inbox.

, You can use email service to get subscriptions and remind customers when new issues are available.


Don’t make yourself a nuisance, but an email or two asking friends and family to subscribe to your magazine could dramatically increase your readers.

, Brainstorm topics you want to include in the magazine, and consider what types of content you plan to include. For example, if your niche is food or travel, choose related topics and interviews with experts in those fields.


Develop a table of contents for the first issue; this will let your readers know what the magazine issue entails. Keep articles short, communicative and to the point.Write headlines using keywords so that readers can find your magazine.
Tailor your content to your audience. Once you’ve started publishing regularly, take a look and see which content has been viewed the most. Use that information to create new content that is similar to your most popular published work, and to move away from less-popular topics. This strategy will increase both the size and loyalty of your audience.

, No magazine is truly “up and running” until it has begun to publish content online.The urgency of generating content will vary, based on how often your magazine publishes. If you plan to only have a quarterly magazine, you will not need to generate content as quickly as if you plan to publish monthly. There are three common ways to obtain content for your magazine:


Write your own content. If your magazine will not have a staff to begin with (which is pretty common), you may need to write every article yourself.Hire a staff to write your magazine content. If you have a budget that can accommodate paying staff members, start by bringing on board one or two writers who share your passion for the topic of your magazine.Gather content from online submitters. If you plan on serving as the editor for your magazine (e.g., for a literary journal), you will need to start gathering content from writers online. For example, www.submittable.com is a common choice, which allows users to send submissions to your magazine.

, Since your magazine will be web-based, you’ll be able to host video and audio content, whether it has been generated by your magazine’s contributors or you have created it yourself.


The coding for this should be relatively simple; in many online platforms, you can essentially copy and paste a video or audio file.
Always make sure that the content you are hosting has no previous copyright. This won’t be an issue if you’ve created it yourself, but if you’re receiving work from contributors, confirm that they created it themselves and have not “borrowed” the work from another source.
If content is already copyrighted but you would still like to post it on your website, contact the copyright holder and ask permission to reproduce their copyrighted work.

There are many programs that allow you to write your book the way you want. Some people prefer to use Microsoft Word. You can easily add a title page, table of contents, and set the margins and align the text. Microsoft Word is a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editor. This means that the way your type looks on the page is how it will look when exported.
Some programs offer markdown language editors. This is similar to writing in a code language. Instead of hitting a button to bold or italicize a word, you would wrap the word in specific brackets of text. When exporting, the text converts to a final, view-ready version. There are many apps that are aimed at streamlining the setting up and writing process. Many of these are made to be distraction free, so you can get to the important part, writing. Apps like Scrivener or Ulysses III are very popular . These apps allow you to write in a markdown or WYSIWYG language. You can add notes, include research, and jump around your text. There’s also features that allow you to only see the page as if you were on a typewriter.
There’s also an option in Chrome’s apps called Writer that is a browser based minimal writing platform. , Once you’ve picked the software that best suits you, now it’s time to sit down and do the hard work, actually writing your book.


If this is your first book, try and keep it relatively simple. eReaders have made shorter, pulpier novels popular again. People can easily download your book and read it in a few hours. Consider keeping your book relatively short, give it a simple plot, and keep the style consistent. Focus on building your characters. People typically want to read about the characters and the importance of the situation you put those characters in. Think of your favorite books. Chances are you loved these books because the characters were compelling. Those compelling characters drove the plot forward.
Trying to throw too much into a plot, especially your first time around can be overwhelming. Don’t try to write the next Game of Thrones right now. Stick to a simple plot that has your personal spin thrown on it.

, Then add the “When” “What” “Where” “Why” and “How”. You want to answer one question at a time.


Trying to cram too much in at once will make your book hard to understand and follow.

, Set a minimum each day for how much you will write. Whether it’s one page or one chapter. Pick a goal you can stick to.


Trying to accomplish too much can make you feel discouraged or frustrated. The key to actually finishing a book is consistency.
It’s better to get something on the page every day than to put it off because you’re not in the mood. You can always go back and edit.

, Once you have completed your first draft, take some time away from it. Let it breathe so you can come back to it with a fresh pair of eyes.


Go over your first draft and check to make sure that you’ve hit all the necessary plot points. Make sure your characters are fleshed out. Fix any continuity problems.
Then proofread and make sure that there are no spelling or grammatical errors. You want your book to look as professional as possible.

, Be aware that the full version of Adobe Acrobat offers features that other programs that create PDF files do not, so you may want to pay for the full version.


Publishing to sites like Amazon will be able to read many different files like HTML, Doc/Docx, and even RTF. However, you shouldn’t be ready to publish your book yet. You need to get it edited.
Convert your book to a PDF so that you can print it or electronically send it easily to an editor.

, You can do this while your still writing or after you’ve had an editor look at your book. But you should go to workshops. These groups will read your material and give you notes, ideas, and can even drum up some interest in your book. You can participate in online workshops or read aloud workshops. The goal is to get your work out there to others in the industry.
Getting your work seen and critiqued by other writers can be nerve-wracking. But these people will help you frame your story and make valuable revisions.

, You can make a pass or two on your own before sending your book to an editor. But you will need an editor. Many people will be tempted to forgo paying a professional editor to save money, or because the author thinks that the book is perfect.


Not getting an editor to read over your book can make the difference between people loving it and no one downloading it. You should edit your book yourself first, then send it to an editor for a second, professional pair of eyes.
Edit as much as you need to yourself, but don’t edit if you don’t know what to edit. If you don’t know how to fix a problem area, you’ll chop up your story and have a hard time putting the pieces back in the right spot.
Over-editing is possible and dangerous. A big reason an editor is so valuable is because you’re too close to your book. You’ve spent a lot of time writing and editing. A second pair of eyes will help you find things you’ve overlooked.

, Get someone you trust to give you notes and feedback. Before you go to an editor who doesn’t know you or your work, consider getting someone who does to read your book.


Take the notes you’re given. You probably won’t like all the notes someone gives you. So read the notes, decompress, and after some time go back and incorporate the ones which are helpful. Don't use the ones which aren’t.

, Editing is not the same as writing. You will need someone who knows how to structure a book, find the issues, and sell your book. A professional editor is better than spellcheck. The last thing you want is a glaring spelling error in your book after all your hard work. Computers are a good helper, but only a trained pair of eyes can really catch errors you and your computer have missed. Your editor will bring a much needed objective eye to your work. Maybe you need to cut three chapters to shorten your story. Perhaps your title is misleading. An editor can help you find the true story underneath all the extra stuff you don’t need.

, Once you’ve gone through several versions and drafts and have edited your book, it’s time to get the cover art.


Cover art is going to be a big selling point for your book. Even in an online marketplace, people judge books by the cover.
Consider hiring a professional graphic designer to create your book’s cover. Or, if you or a friend know how to design, you can take a stab at it.
Your cover should be exciting and related to the theme of your story. Look at the covers of your favorite books for inspiration. Notice what the cover says about the book.

, The biggest opportunity for publishing an eBook is Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing. You can easily upload your manuscript to the KDP program and begin to sell copies.


Kindle Direct Publishing will accept a variety of file formats when uploading. Kindle uses a Mobi format to output the eBook so that eReaders can read it. But when uploading you can upload your manuscript as an HTML, Doc/Docx, RTF, Mobi, or ePub.
Use can use a program like Calibre to convert your manuscript to Mobi or ePub before uploading if you wish. This sometimes makes the uploading easier and keeps any images or forms in your book intact.

, In addition to the file type that you upload your manuscript in, you’ll also have to decide if you want a standard eBook format or a fixed layout format. Standard formats are typically ePub and Mobi files. These formats allow readers to adjust the size of the text in an eReader. Note that in this form, there isn’t a set pagination as the size of the text will adjust how many words appear on a page. This format is good for text-heavy books.
Fixed layouts are better used in comics, children’s books, and books with a lot of pictures and graphs. This format preserves the qualities of a printed page. It’s more like looking at photos of a page on an eReader than reading “living” text.

, Amazon has a few eBook publishing options. The standard is the KDP service. There’s also KDP Select. This is the “premium” version of Kindle Direct Publishing. Though both are free to upload.


The standard KDP service allows you to upload your book to Amazon’s service for free. There’s no charge to upload the file. Author’s will receive about 30-35% of royalties while Amazon keeps the rest.
The KDP Select service gives Amazon an exclusive on your digital book for 90 days, meaning you can’t upload it anywhere else. You do receive closer to 70% of royalties. Amazon will also market your book for you through the Prime member’s lending library. You also have the option to make your book free or discounted for five days. During this time, it will show up on Amazon’s sales pages.

, Once you’ve decided on which option you like best, sign up to publish through the “independently publish with us” link at the bottom of Amazon’s homepage. You can sign in with your Amazon account. You will have to read and agree to the terms of service. Once completed you will have a publishing account.
Follow the uploading steps to add a title and enter your book’s details. The details allow you to specify if the book is part of series, book type, pricing, etc.
You can add you ISBN code if you have one. But it is not needed with Amazon.
Select your category. Amazon encourages you to add up to two categories to get better exposure. Search for books like yours and see which categories these books have used. You can also add up to seven keywords to make your book show up better in a search.
Finally, upload your cover. Then you’re ready to upload.

, When you’re ready, click “Browse for book” to find the copy of your manuscript on your computer. Then click “Upload”.


Amazon allows you to choose if you want to enable digital rights management (DRM) or not. Enabling DRM makes it harder for others to copy and share your work without you earning payment. For example, someone can’t copy the file and download it to another eReader.
You most likely won’t lose any money or sales for not adding DRM, however.

, Once you upload your book will have the option to use the “Online Previewer” link to see how your book will look.


Amazon does a pretty good job of retaining your book’s formatting, especially if you already had the book in a correct format, like Mobi. You can see how your book will look on a variety of devices from a Kindle to an iPhone to a browser window.
You should look over your book in all these options to make sure everything is how you want it.

, You will now have the option to price your book. Amazon will also give you an option for royalty percentage. Your options are usually 35% or 70%.


Choosing the 70% makes your book fall under the KDP Select option. You get the marketing benefits and ability to discount your book for a time. But, you aren’t allowed to upload it, or sell it anywhere else for 90 days. If you price your book below $2.99 USD, Amazon will only give you the 35% option.
Choosing to take the higher royalty also means that Amazon deducts a small “delivery fee”. This fee is usually 15 cents per megabyte. Most books with little to no graphics and roughly 100,000 words don’t go over 1 MB. There’s no charge if you take the smaller royalty.
Once you pick your royalty options, you are finished and your book is now available! Congratulations, you are a published author.

Publish your book if you want to sell it.",How to Create an iBook," You can find this free program by searching the App Store on your Mac computer, then download and install it. iBooks Author is an easy, intuitive way to create iBooks that’s great for beginners. You can try other apps instead, if you’re already familiar with them, including:Adobe InDesignBook Creator for iPadTumult Hype;
, The program includes many preset templates that make it easy to just plug in content. Templates pre-determine things like where to place text and images, and how your table of contents should appear. You’ll be prompted to choose one when you open the program. Scroll through the choices until you find one you like., The first thing you’ll see in your template is a page prompting you to select a cover image and add it to a field. You can add an image in a couple of ways:Drag an image from your computer’s desktop and drop it onto the cover page field.
Click the cover page. A dialog box will open up and ask you to select the image file you want, wherever it is stored on your computer.

, If the cover image you are using doesn’t already include the title and author’s name, you can add these by selecting the fields marked for this on the title page. When you’re done, click “next” and add the same information to the iBook’s title page.You may see “dummy text” beginning “Lorem ipsum…” filling the space of the title page fields. If so, just delete it and add the text you want.
Now’s a good time to save your work if you haven’t already. Select “File” at the top left, then “Save As,” and give your file a unique name. Make sure to save your work regularly.
If your template includes a table of contents page, you can enter its information in the same basic way as the title page’s.

, In the left column of iBooks Author, you’ll see a place to click and add “Chapter 1” (use this whether or not your book is actually divided into chapters). Once you have this selected, click the plus sign (“+”) at the top left to start adding text. You can do this in several ways:Type text directly on the iBook page by entering it in the fields preselected by the template.
Open up a file, select the text you want, and drag-and-drop it onto the iBook page.
Copy the text you want from a file, then paste it into the preset field in your iBook.

, If you have a multi-chapter or multi-section book, when you are finished entering in the text for the first section, click “Chapter 2” for the next (then “Chapter 3,” and so on). Enter text in the same way as you did for the previous section.

, It’s easy to add images to your iBook. Click the “Widgets” button and choose “Gallery.” A dialog box will pop up, prompting you to select the image file you want to add. Select the file stored on your computer, and repeat until you have all the images you want to add. Close the dialog window.To actually insert an image, just drag it from the gallery to the spot you want it to appear in your iBook.
You can also include video clips or similar media. Just add them to the “Gallery” and insert them into your iBook in the same way.

, Click the “Preview” button at the top of the iBooks Author screen, and you'll be able to see exactly what your iBook will look like once it's published. It’s a good idea to use this feature every so often as you work, just to make sure everything looks in order., Once your book is done, if you just want to create an iBook for personal or limited use (such as sharing it with a group of students), select “File” then “Export.” You’ll be prompted to save the completed file as a particular type.The iBook file type is Apple’s proprietary file type, readable on iPads and other Apple devices.
The ePub format is readable on a wider range of devices, both Apple and non-Apple.
You can also save your work as a PDF or text file. However, these can be more cumbersome to read on most electronic devices.
You can share your iBook via a personal website, by emailing as an attachment, by uploading it to cloud storage, or any other convenient method.

, If you want to sell an iBook via either the iBooks or iTunes store, you must first have a program called iTunes Producer downloaded and set up. Look for this in the App Store. Hit the “Publish” button in iBooks Author when you are ready to publish, and follow the prompts.The “Publish” feature will allow you to upload your work to the iTunes/iBooks stores in either iBook or ePub format.
You can sell your iBook via a personal site or other venue. However, it must be in the ePub format. You can only sell iBooks in the iBooks format via official Apple venues.
When setting up iTunes Producer, you’ll need to include banking account information for tax purposes and for the financial agreement with Apple.
According to this agreement, you receive 70 percent of your sales, while Apple gets a 30 percent portion.

Think of what you want to convey to your users.,
Know the keywords.,
Write your content in a conversational, straightforward manner.,
Structure it for the scanners, not the readers.,
Edit, edit, edit.",How to Create User Friendly Web Articles and on Site Content," Visualize and plan. Whether you're selling items, providing a service or simply writing an entry in your blog, know what you want your users and visitors to know. Brainstorm and list everything up. Whether if it is a promotional piece or simply a product description, leave no stone unturned and cover everything important.;
, Do keyword research using Google's AdWords tool. But wait, we're not writing for search engine optimization purposes, right? Well, here's the thing, writing for users means that you're writing for search engines as well. Keywords play an important role – it gives users (and search engines) an idea of what your website is all about. If you're selling online sports apparel, make sure to mention “basketball jerseys, football gear and cricket equipment in your write-ups!

, Remember, you're not writing for doctorate degree holders or people with extensive vocabulary – you're writing for everyone. Cut the jargon, deep words and unnecessary adjectives. Your writing teacher may appreciate it, but Internet users won't. If you want to incorporate jargon and flowery words, there are proper avenues for that, like your blog for example. Also remember to keep it conversational, like how you talk to your friends and family.

, The Internet is an open book – millions of gigabytes of content are being added every day. Even if it is figuratively a book, don't make it look like one: AVOID long lines and paragraphs. Remember, users want information in a quick and straightforward manner – long paragraphs don't give that. Use short paragraphs and bullet and numbered lists instead. A user rarely reads while surfing the net – he scans.

, Don't just post your article or write-up without checking for errors. Even if you are a gifted writer, you are still prone to committing even the simplest grammatical errors. Most errors, especially typo ones, are done unconsciously. Factual errors are a result of poor research, so be sure to master the subject matter before writing about it!

",How to Become a Popular Author on Quotev," Make your password tricky to guess, but easy for you to remember. It has to be over eight characters, but make it longer to be safe.



Come up with a username to create. It could be a song lyric, your name, something you like, a quote, or anything else. Remember the username policy. There are a few simple rules: no profane/shocking language, or sexual material. Your username is what appears on your stories and next to your forum posts so make sure it sounds good and suits you.;
, The same rules apply, but you cannot stylize on URLs This will be the link to your user page.

, Follow about 25-30 users but don't ask an account to follow you back, it will seem rude and immature. Most people with something similar to ""follows back"" in their profile will do so without prompting. There is definitely no guarantee that randomly followed accounts will even want to read your stories or follow you, however don't let that put you off.

, That way, you'll know what to do to popularize yourself on Quotev. Try to emulate them, but don't copy what they do; you want to be yourself, not a copy of someone who is popular.

, You can write anything you set your heart to except sexually explicit stories because they are against the site rules and could even get your account banned if you continue writing them.


Write what you enjoy writing. If you write about something that you enjoy, your audience will see that, and you'll have a better chance of people liking your writings.
Make your writing engaging to the readers. Be sure to know that what you write is real, begin with a statistic that shocks, and make revisions and edits to your writing. Doing these things will grab the reader's attention.
Try asking other people for advice on how you can improve your writings. Doing this will help you become a better writer.

, Post one saying that you're new like ""Hi, Quotev users! I am (your name) and I love to write! Check out my story!""

, Doing this will especially place your story down on the lower list because everyone does them. If you want to become a popular writer come up with something original.


Avoid cliches like ""I'm pregnant."" or ""I cheated on you."" Or even ""They kidnapped me and beat me, but I'm in love with them."" Everyone hates reading stories like that because they have been done so many times. It just gets boring actually, so come up with a story about your personality and make it original. Honestly though, Quotev thrives off clichéd stories. You can be original, or you could churn out the same storyline every twelve year old on the site's been using. Sadly the latter will earn more fans, so it really lies in what your priorities are - do you want readers, or to write stories you care about while running the risk of them going unnoticed?

, Sharing your writings outside of Quotev is a good way to attract more readers, and thus will boost your popularity as a Quotev author. Provide a link to your writings so others can read them.

, Keep updating even if you don't have many readers. Make posts frequently and reply to comments swiftly. Thank your readers often. You definitely shouldn't let your readers control your schedule. Your writing should be a fun hobby, not another assignment. Remind them firmly that you do, in fact, have a life outside of working for them.


You can't just disappear for three weeks when you have left a cliffhanger. This is not to say that you can't disappear. Your readers get that you have a personal life. It is just that you have to prepare them first.

Introduce yourself.,
State why you are writing.,
Be specific with what advice you want.,
Explain briefly why you are having trouble accomplishing the goal on your own.,
Keep it brief.,
Include closing remarks.",How to Write a Letter Asking for Advice1," If the person does not already know who you are, you will want to include a short paragraph introducing yourself at the beginning of the letter (after the salutation). Include information about who you are, and any information that is related to the reason why you are writing.For example, if you are writing to an advice columnist to ask for parenting advice, you can say, “My name is Anna Smith and I am a 36 year old mother of two daughters.” In this case, you don’t need to say what you do for a living unless, for example, you were writing to ask about how to raise children well while also working full time.
If you are writing to someone you don’t know, briefly let them know how you found them. For example, “I was referred to you by , who thinks you might be able to help me.”;
, After introducing yourself (if necessary), you will want to get straight to the point. You should begin by explaining the purpose of your letter. There are lots of ways that you can open a letter politely. Examples include:”I am writing to ask if you could help me with…”
”I would appreciate if you could give me some advice about…”
”I am writing to ask for your advice.”
”I wonder if you could help me with a problem.”

, You should come up with 3 to 5 questions that you want answered, and write them out. Avoid writing a long list of complicated questions that would take hours of work to answer. Keeping it short and to the point will increase your chances of receiving a reply., If you’re asking for advice for a problem or situation that you have been trying to solve on your own, but haven’t been able to. Then briefly explained what you have tried, and why it didn’t seem to work.This can help the advice giver know that you’re not just being lazy, and that you really need their help. Additionally, it can save effort and time because they won’t bother suggesting a solution you’ve already tried.
For example, if you would like advice about how to deal with bullying at school, you could say, “There is a big problem with bullies at my school. How can I deal with them when they are bothering me? How can I help stand up for someone who is being bullied? What can I do to make bullying happen less often?”

, The person you are asking for advice will be less likely to respond if you send them a very long and detailed letter. This is because they will have to spend significant time reading and understanding your letter. If and when they write their response, they will probably have to write a longer, more detailed response in order to address everything you have written. Keeping it brief will increase your chance of getting a response, especially if you are writing to a well-known person.A general rule of thumb is to keep your letter between 300 and 400 words. This length will give you enough words to introduce yourself and your questions without over doing it.

, Before you end the later, you should include a “Thank you in advance.” You can also talk about a few different ways that you can be contacted to talk about your letter. It is important to show your appreciation in the closing remarks. Remember, this person does not have to help you, and if they take time to read your letter, you owe them a thank you.


For example, you could say, “Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I understand that you are a busy person, and any advice you could offer me would be greatly appreciated. If it is helpful, I would also be happy to discuss my questions over the phone or over a coffee. My contact details can be found at the end of this letter.”

"
"
Include a salutation.,
Include a valediction.,
Include contact information.",How to Write a Letter Asking for Advice2," A salutation is what you write at the very beginning of the letter to let the reader know the letter is meant for them. If you are writing your letter to someone you don’t know this part will need to be formal. On the other hand, if you’re writing to someone you know well, you don’t have to be so formal. Remember not to be too casual though as it is important to be polite.For example, when writing to someone you don’t know, you can say: “Dear Mr./Ms. ” In a less formal letter, you could simply say, “Dear .” Always be sure to include the “Dear.”

, A valediction (also known as a closing) is the part of the letter where you wish them well in some way, and include your name. If you are handwriting the letter, you might consider printing your name carefully a few lines below the valediction, and then signing your name in between these spaces. If you are typing the letter, you can do the same by adding a few spaces between the valediction and your name, then printing the letter out and signing it before sending.


Some of the common closings that you could use include, “Best regards,” “Kind regards,” “Respectfully yours,” or simply “Sincerely.”

, At the bottom of your letter, underneath your name, include your phone number, email address, and any other way that they can get in contact with you. You should definitely include an email address or phone number, if you have one. If you are hoping for a response via mail, make sure to write your name and address neatly on the outside of the envelope.


If you are hoping for a written response through the mail, you can improve your chances of receiving a response if you include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your letter. This way, the advice giver will only have to write their response and place it in the envelope provided before sending it back to you.

Make a list of people you think could help you.,
Identify what you hope to get out of asking for advice.,
Research the background of potential advice givers.,
Think about why the person should want to help you.",How to Write a Letter Asking for Advice3," If you want advice about a specific topic, you should write down people you know have experience or knowledge with that topic. For example, if you want advice about how to deal with health issues, you might write to a nurse or doctor that you know.


If you want to work as a nonfiction writer, you might write the names of accomplished writers, agents, or publishers that you could write to.
You should include the names of people you know personally as well as people you don’t know as well, this could include past teachers, former bosses or colleagues, well-known people from the area in which you are seeking advice, or even advice columnists.
Don’t forget family members. People, such as your grandparents, have had many experiences in life. This makes them well-qualified to give advice. If you’re having trouble thinking of someone, try going through your family members.
Although you can certainly try writing to famous people, your chances of receiving a response are small. If you do get a response, it probably won’t be written by that person. For example, though might want advice from the President of the United States, any response you get will likely have been written by an intern or other public relations employee. Furthermore, these responses will usually be generic responses that aren’t able to address your needs specifically.

, Before you decide who to write to, you will need to decide what it is you really hope to get out of the letter. Do you truly just want their advice, or are you perhaps hoping to do a bit of networking and get yourself acquainted with people in a particular area?


For example, an advice giver may be able to introduce you to others, connect you with specific resources or people, teach you how to do something, or they may just be able to provide a written response.
Some people on your list may have more connections and ways of getting you started on something than others. If all you want is advice and nothing else, you can write to someone you know personally or to an advice column.

, If you are writing to someone you already know well you don’t need to do this, but if it is someone you don’t know, find out about their background to make sure they would be able to help you.


For example, if you are looking for relationship advice, see if the person you want to write to has had education or experience working with couples before.
You can avoid wasting your time by doing this research. For example, although you might think writing to an advice columnist might be a good way to get advice, different columnists often specialize in certain topics. Some specialize in relationship advice, some focus on do it yourself advice, while others might focus on giving practical life advice.

, Whereas a guidance counselor's job is to provide advice, others to whom you write may not be accustomed to giving advice on a daily basis. Think about why this person should be willing to help you, and what you can do to make it worth their while. You might appeal to the advice giver's sense of paying it forward or offer an exchange of services.For example, if you know the person you could say, “I know it is not your job to answer requests for advice; however, I believe you are the best person to help me. I would be happy to offer you a home cooked meal in return for your time.”
If you don’t know the person, you might offer to compensate them for their time, if you can afford to do so.

Consider hiring an artist.,
Check the technical requirements.,
Learn about the genre.,
Look at the cover in thumbnail size.,
Choose a font.,
Lay out the title and author's name.,
Plan around your budget.,
Browse artist portfolios.,
Consider using an existing image.,
Work in stages.,
Trust the artist's judgement.",How to Choose a Cover Design for an eBook," A poorly designed cover will drive away potential readers faster than any other mistake. This section will teach you the basics of what to look for, but they cannot replace graphic design experience. The next section of this article will cover the process of hiring and working with an artist, which gives you the best chance of success.;
, Familiarize yourself with the size and format restrictions on your eBook cover image. The Amazon standards are by far the most important due to that site's massive market share. The Smashwords requirements are a distant second, as that site will automatically take care of formatting for other websites.


If you are not technically minded and don't plan to hire a professional artist, use a ""cover creator"" service such as Kindle Direct Publishing. This should take care of technical requirements automatically. If you want more options, use Photoshop or a similar image editor instead.

, Each genre has its own rules of cover success. It's usually best to play it safe and put a gun on the cover of an action Western, or a couple on the cover of a romance. While there's a lot more to it, these rules should help a beginner get started:


Books aimed mostly at women typically include human figures in the cover art.
Books aimed mostly at men should include some action or motion.
Readers should be able to identify the genre and general style based on the cover.

, Many great printed covers can never work for an eBook, because most readers see the image at a much smaller size. If your thumbnail doesn't grab attention, few people will ever click it and see the full size version. Make sure your cover makes sense at small sizes, and don't rely on tiny details.

, If you're not familiar with typography, you may be surprised how difficult and important this decision is. Your first priority is to make sure your title is legible at thumbnail size. After that, make sure your font accurately communicates the genre or mood of your book. If you don't know where to begin, browse eBook covers in the same genre as your book for examples.

, Place the title so it's large enough to read, but doesn't interfere with the cover image. Unless you already have fans, the author's name is less important. You can generally reduce its size to leave more room for the title and art.

, Your cover image is the single most important factor in marketing an eBook. Putting this in the hands of an experienced artist is almost always worth the cost. Choose from a range of options depending on your budget:


Hiring a cover design professional typically costs US $500–$600. If you have high expectations for the book and money is no object, you could even put in $1200–$1300.
You can negotiate a much cheaper price if you use an existing image. Keep reading for more advice on this topic.
A non-professional artist is much cheaper, but a little risky. Start as early as possible, as these artists tend to work on their own schedule.

, There are many online databases of artists available for hire. Look through them for artists you enjoy, and ask friends with an eye for graphic design to lend you their opinions. You're looking for art that grabs your attention, especially at ""thumbnail"" size. If possible, find a portfolio that includes cover designs and/or illustrations in your book's genre.


If you're not sure what to look for, read the section above on choosing a cover design.

, If you're looking to save money and turnaround time, find an image that suits your book already. Contact the artist and ask for permission to use the image as a book cover. The artist may be willing to add your title and author name for a moderate price, and possibly tweak it to suit your needs.


If you want exclusive rights over the image, you'll need to pay the artist extra.
Copyright law can be confusing and lead to major legal headaches. Even if you think you're using an image legally, it's best to get permission from the original artist.

, Arrange a plan with the artist that divides the project into stages. It's usually best to approve a rough proof of concept, then the final image, then the title font, then the final cover. You'll typically pay the artist by the hour, so you want each revision to ""undo"" as little as possible. This is especially important if the artist does not have much cover design experience.


Keep copies of the art and font at each stage. This will make it easier to tweak the cover for future editions.
If the artist is a non-professional, it's best to pay only upon completion of each stage, to provide more deadline incentive. Also stipulate that partial payment will give you rights to the partially completed image. This allows you to take the work to another artist to finish, if the amateur job doesn't end up the way you like.

, Most new authors are not good at designing a cover. Give the professional artist room to experiment or invent her own designs. While you can definitely ask for revisions or adjustments, overly restrictive instructions often lead to poor results.


If possible, ask artistic contacts for their opinion on your cover design.

, Are you drawn to the author's article as ""How to Write Web Articles"" or ""5 Tips to Write Winning Web Articles?"" However, overuse of any or all of these elements may bring the quality down.

, Get and keep the attention of web readers by delivering short messages. You put effort into gaining your web reader's attention; now make their click worthwhile with brief compelling copy in bite sizes. Start with the conclusion. Your readers may not make it to the end of your piece to get it. Web readers don't want to get bogged down in long blocks of text. So get to the point early and use the rest of your article to support that main point.

, Dull titles will not capture your readers' interest. It will make your article fade into the sea of other boring articles listed in article banks these days. You have to create a title that will reach out and grab your reader by the collar. Make it short. Create interest. Include the main benefit or solution in your title.

, Your information is not for everyone. Avoid generalities. Choose a friend or family member that's interested in your topic. Write your article to them. Writing to a friend will make your copy personable and friendly. You won't come across as a fussy hen, do this, do this, don't do that. You will connect with your readers as a friend giving advice. Your article will do a better job of building credibility for you.

, Resist fluffing your articles. Include practical, valuable information in your copy. Everyone loses when you don't take the time to impart substance. It increases the reputation of the web being an unreliable source of knowledge. Additionally, lack of substance will block your road to profitable referrals. Do the research and/or draw from your knowledge and experience to illustrate. Your stories and real life examples will meet your reader's need for practical information and connect with their emotion. It's a known fact emotions will move people to action. Whether you desire them to act by signing up or making a purchase, add substance and improve your reader responses.

, Create a more web professional look by using short sentences, then format your page to approximately 65 characters per line. Long stringed sentences that stream from side to side of the web page look visually unprofessional. Select a layout for your article from several short article formats that include the how-to, tips list, question-answer, problem-solutions and interview. Make your introduction and summary short but do add one. Your web readers don't want just a list of boring facts and information. They want to connect with you by reading your personable introduction and practical tips with a definite ending or summary. Remember, excited readers become enthusiastic buyers and enthusiastic buyers will refer your product or service to all their friends.

Be aware of differences in terminology.,
Use active or passive voice appropriately.,
Avoid colloquial (informal) writing.,
List quantities in metric units.,
Specify any references to currency.,
Be cognizant of cultural differences.,
Avoid ambiguity.",How to Write for a Global Audience," Such differences exist even between cities (like athletic shoes being called ""sneakers"" or ""tennis shoes"") and there are many differing names to deal with on an international scale. For example, what is called a ""potato chip"" in the U.S. is referred to as a ""crisp"" in the UK. The best way to note these differences is to find out which countries your readers are coming from (which can be done relatively easily online through analytics) and have some people from those countries read your work before it's published.


There are many websites where you can find freelance editors and pay them to read your work and point out any unclear terms.
An alternative is to find forums or communities where most of the members are from the country in question, and ask them if the writing makes sense to them.
If you always write about a particular topic, you'll eventually become familiar with relevant differences in terminology, and you may not need as much feedback.;
, You probably tend to write in either active or passive voice, depending on what is customary in your country. If you are writing in active voice, you will write ""The user turns on the computer"" whereas in passive voice, you would write ""The computer is turned on by the user."" Some cultures, like Japanese and Chinese, consider active voice to be condescending and rude. In countries where active voice is the norm, passive writing may come off as awkward and impersonal. Read material written in English for and by people in the country in question (such as in a magazine) and make note of whether they prefer using the active or passive voice. Adjust your own writing accordingly.


If in doubt, use active voice. It is generally better understood by non-native English speakers.

, While you may not want your writing to be so formal that it alienates your audience, some aspects of formal writing may help your work reach a wider audience:


Colloquial words and phrases are called ""colloquialisms."" There are also terms such as ""ain’t,"" which are not considered standard English and generally are not appropriate for formal writing. Finally, there are non-words, combination of letters and characters that do not form real words, such as ""a lot."" If you are in doubt about a certain word, look it up in the dictionary. If the dictionary makes no comment about it, but it sounds informal to you, consult another dictionary. A dictionary will label an incorrect word such as ""ain’t"" as ""Nonstandard"" and informal word as ""informal,"" ""colloquial,"" or ""slang."" Some dictionaries also include phrases. For example, when you look up ""to put up with"" (""to tolerate"") in the dictionary, you will see that it is informal.
Avoid contractions. You may want to avoid all contractions or use fewer contractions in your writing than you would use in your speech. ""Cannot"" is preferable to ""can’t,"" especially in formal contexts. Some languages don't use contractions at all, so this can become a big obstacle for translators.
Do not use apostrophes to indicate possession, either, as it may be confused for a contraction. Instead of writing ""the calculator's battery"" write ""the calculator battery"" or ""the battery of the calculator"".
Omit needless words. Look at every adjective and adverb in your writing. Is it clear? Is it necessary? If not, take it out. A common ""fluff"" word is ""really"" (e.g., I am really tired). It's a vague synonym for ""very"" that is not likely to be understood by a non-native English speaker, who may wonder ""What makes this tiredness more 'real'?""

, There are only three nations in the world that don't officially use the metric system: Myanmar, Liberia and the United States. If you aren't using the metric system already, and you want your work to be reach a global audience, it's time to start. This applies to temperature, distance, ingredient amounts, height, weight, and any other measurement.


Keep in mind that while most of the countries officially use the metric system, some of them continue to use Imperial units. If your writing is aimed at readers in the UK, for example, you might indicate weight not only in kilograms, but also in stone., You probably won't list sums of money in currencies for more than one or two countries, but make sure to name whichever currency you list. Remember that the dollar sign ($) denotes currencies in many different countries, so it is wise to include some indication of which country is intended, e.g., USD, AUD, or other currency.

, Remember that what exists in one country may not exist in another, or it may exist but go by a very different name. For example, if you live in the U.S., the number to dial in case of an emergency is 911. If you live in the U.K., the number is 999. If you were writing about this subject for a global audience, you might need to mention both, or, if it wasn't central to the subject, you might just state it generally: ""summon an ambulance,"" ""call the police,"" or ""dial emergency services.""


Remember that the names of such things as governmental departments, grades and levels in school, and political parties and systems vary between countries. Try to provide some context if you do refer to them, e.g., ""the fourth grade class (9-10 year old students)...""

, The following guidelines will help eliminate potential confusion.


Don't use slashes.


Mary/John will go to the store. The reader may have trouble knowing if you mean both of them, or one or the other.
and/or


Keep sentences short (16 word maximum, in most cases). While native English speakers usually read in phrases, international readers tackle each sentence one word at a time, and a long sentence can be difficult to follow from beginning to end.Avoid false subjects. Don't start sentences with ""It is"" or ""There are"". What is ""it"" or ""there"" referring to?Here are a few examples:

It is cold outside. > The weather is cold.
There are trees in the meadow. > Trees are in the meadow.


Avoid negative words (no, don't, not, won't, etc.) when asking questions. Negative questions can be very difficult for international readers to decipher.You're not coming to the party, are you? > Are you coming to the party?
Don't you want to be there? > Do you want to be there?


Avoid double negatives. In English, a phrase like ""not unpleasant"" roughly means ""pleasant"" (or at least ""tolerable""), but in other languages, double negatives are interpreted differently, and could be interpreted as ""extremely unpleasant.""If the use of the word ""which"" may be avoided, do so. Don't worry about being repetitive.Example: The tree, which I used to climb when I was a kid, was gone. > I used to climb a tree when I was a kid. Now it is gone.
Write out dates. The ways in which dates are written can vary from country to country. For example, 6/2/00 can mean the 6th of February or the 2nd of June.

Members of the UN pledged to protect and promote these rights.The largest concentration of rights in the UDHR can be categorized as “civil rights,” which are rights related to one’s physical integrity and protection under the law. The first 18 tenets of the UDHR set forth individual’s civil rights, which include:The right to equality and the right to life, liberty, and personal security.
Freedom from discrimination, slavery, and from torture and degrading treatment.
The right to recognition as a person before the law and equality under the law.
The right to a remedy from a competent tribunal and to a fair public hearing.
Freedom from arbitrary arrest and exile and from interference with privacy, family, home and correspondence.
The right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.
The right to free movement in and out of one’s own country and the right to asylum from persecution in other countries.
The right to a nationality and the freedom to change it.
The right to marriage and family, and to own property.
Freedom of belief and religion.;
, Human rights that are political in nature include those rights related to a person’s participation in government and the freedom from governmental intrusion. These rights are set forth in Articles 19 to 21 of the UDHR and include:Freedom of opinion and expression and the right to information.
Freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
The right to participate in government, equal access to public service in his or her country, and the right to vote in free elections., These rights establish the conditions that are necessary for individuals to prosper and to have an adequate standard of living. Articles 22 to 26 of the UDHR set forth economic and social rights, which include:The right to social security.
The right to participate in desirable work and to join trade unions.
The right to rest and leisure and an adequate living standard for one’s health and well-being.
The right to education, which is free during elementary and fundamental stages of development., Article 27 of the UDHR sets forth a person’s cultural rights. These rights include the right to participate in the cultural life of the community and the protection of the moral and material interest in a person’s own scientific, literary or artistic production., The protection and promotion of human rights is not limited to the United Nations or governments. Every person has an affirmative duty to help create an environment in which human rights are promoted and respected., There are a number or ways that you can become educated about human rights, human rights abuses, and activism against human rights.

By creating a petition to support local, state or national legislation, you are actively promoting and protecting human rights. Amnesty International has a number of human rights related petitions at http://www.amnestyusa.org/get-involved/take-action-now.
Support politicians with a demonstrated commitment to human rights issues., If you witness a violation of any of the human rights set forth in the UDHR (discussed above), you can report these violations to organizations dedicated to protecting and preserving human rights for all. In order to submit a complaint about human rights abuses, you must be able to document and provide the following information:


Identify the specific article of the UDHR that was violated.
Set forth all of the facts related to the human rights abuse in a detailed manner, and if possible, in chronologically order.
Provide the date, time and place of the incident(s); name and position of the perpetrator(s); place of detention if applicable; names and addresses of any witnesses and any other important details., After documenting local human rights abuses, you should report these abuses to a trusted organization dedicated to protecting and preserving human rights. Even if the perpetrators are not criminally prosecuted, by reporting violations you enable these organizations to shed light on the abuses and hopefully pressure the perpetrators into changing their behavior. You can report human rights abuses to:


Amnesty International at: https://www.amnesty.org/en/about-us/contact/.
Human Rights Action Center at: http://www.humanrightsactioncenter.org/about/.
Human Rights Watch at: https://www.hrw.org/contact.
Children’s Defense Fund at: http://www.childrensdefense.org/contact/.
You can find links to additional organizations at: http://www.humanrights.com/voices-for-human-rights/human-rights-organizations/non-governmental.html., If you are witness to serious violations of human rights, particularly atrocities committed by your government and you are not sure where you can turn, you can report these violations directly to the United Nation’s Sub-Commission on Human Rights. You must draft a written complaint, which includes:


Your name or the name of the organization making the complaint and a clear statement as to whether you want to remain anonymous.
The complaint must clearly state and uncover a consistent pattern of significant and documented human rights violations.
You must identify the victims of the human rights violations as well as the perpetrators and provide a detailed description of the violations.
Include evidence such as a statement by the victim, medical reports or any other information that can support your complaint.
Clearly state which rights, as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, were violated.
Give the reason you are seeking UN intervention.
Show that you have exhausted any other remedies.
Your complaint can be sent to: Commission/Sub-Commission Team (1503 Procedure), Support Services Branch, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations Office at Geneva, 1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland.
The complaint can also be faxed to + 41 22 9179011 or emailed to: CP(at)ohchr.org., National and international law are the primary way that human rights are guaranteed and protected. Therefore, pursing a career as a human rights attorney is a very direct way that you can professionally protect human rights around the world or in your own country. Human rights attorneys bring cases on behalf of victims of human rights violations and against state actors or governments that are violating national and international law., If you are unsure of how best to put your skills to work in supporting human rights, you can consider participating in the United Nation’s human rights fellowship program. These programs are run throughout the world and provide those selected an intensive introduction and understanding of human rights mechanisms and international institutions. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) offers four fellowship programs:


The Indigenous Fellowship Program, which is for members of indigenous groups who seek human rights training.
The Minorities Fellowship Program is for persons belonging to national, ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities who with to receive human rights training.
The Human Rights LDC Fellowship Program is a program for graduate students from the least developed countries who want to participate in training on the United Nations and human rights.
The Fellowship for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) Staff provides staff members from NHRIs training on international human rights and the work of OHCHR with NHRIs.You can find application information and instructions at: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/CivilSociety/Documents/Handbook_en.pdf


, There are numerous organizations dedicated to promoting and protecting human rights. These organizations hire a variety of staff including activists, administrative assistants, and people who work on campaigns, policy positions, and lobbying. If you are interested in pursuing a career in human rights, consider:

Trying to get internships and volunteering as much as possible as a way to get a better sense of the work that these organizations do and whether you are really interested in it.
Reading about human rights and thinking about how you can contribute to the movement.
Studying or interning abroad while you are in college and learning another language.
Learning how to write grants, fundraise, research and write, which are all essential skills for working at a non-governmental organization (NGO).You can review a list of human rights organizations, with contact information, at: http://www.humanrights.com/voices-for-human-rights/human-rights-organizations/non-governmental.html.

, Governments have primary responsibility for protecting and promoting human rights. They must pass laws that establish and protect the human rights of all citizens and they must actively refrain from impinging on those rights. If you are interested in politics, you should consider a career as a legislator. In this role, you will have the ability to introduce human rights legislation, advocate your position, and ultimately support laws that protect human rights."

Make it fun.,
Associate the things they eat with the cow.,
Point out basic facts about cows.,
Show your students cows.,
Assign a project or quiz.",How to Teach Young Children About Cows," A picture of a cow is always the best place to start. Simply showing a picture of a cow and asking them to guess what it is will be a good starting point if they haven't yet learned what a cow is. It's also a good place to start if they already know what cows look like, but don't know all the facts yet.


Having the sound recording of a cow's ""moo"" will also get children excited about learning about cows. Ask them, ""What animal makes this sound?"" play the recording, then have them guess.;
, Ask them, ""Where does milk come from?"" or ""Where does cheese/yogurt/ice cream come from?"" You may also want to tell them the very basics of how cheese or ice cream is made as well.


You can also ask them ""Where does beef come from?"" and point out it comes from a cow, but try not to get into details how it's obtained until you think they are at the age where it is safe to do so.

, You may want to include certain facts such as:


Some cows have spots
Cows are farm animals like chickens, sheep and horses
Cows live on farms
Cows eat grass and hay


, For example, take a field trip to a dairy farm. If this isn't possible, show your students pictures or drawings of cows. Then, have them draw pictures of cows.

, This will wrap up the lesson. Projects can be graphic organizers, posters, or oral reports. Think up your own quiz on what you taught about or emphasized on cows.

Decide when your child is ready.,
Take it slowly.,
Sing the ABC song.,
Teach them the ABC song.,
Watch fun videos online with the alphabet song in them.,
Use letters in play.,
Encourage curiosity about the alphabet and reading in general.",How to Teach Kids the Alphabet," A child can express interest by pointing at letters or engaging in conversation about them. If your child is not yet ready, wait until they are.


Refrigerator magnets made of letters are a good way to see if your child is interested.;
, Remember that there are 26 letters in the English alphabet. That's a lot for a small child to remember right off the bat!

, Start by singing it around them, even if you don't ask them to participate or copy you (yet).


Use your child's favorite character or stuffed animal to help. If your child likes Elmo, have them watch Elmo singing the ABCs., Start at the beginning and help them learn it chunk by chunk. Dance around and be silly while you learn. Keep it fun. Use the cartoon character as well.


It is most effective to both use a cartoon and to do some teaching yourself.

, If the child is entertained, they're likely to learn the tunes and letters through repetition alone.

, Build with ABC blocks, play with fridge magnet letters, and write letters and words while you draw with the child. Have them play computer and tablet/phone games with the alphabet in them.


Again, start slow. Teach the child just a few letters at a time.

, Talk to them about letters and spelling. Label their art work so they can see the letters. Answer their questions. Building familiarity with all writing and letters will help them want to learn the alphabet. Once they get the alphabet down, they'll be ready to move on to learning to read.


Be enthusiastic when the child displays his or her new skill. Positive reinforcement and attention will be key to keeping the child excited about learning.

Join an astronomy club.,
Make astronomy a part of your daily life.",How to Teach Kids About Astronomy," In order to interest children in astronomy, you yourself need to have some interest in the subject. While many of the activities suggested in the following steps will further your interest along with your child's, you first need to familiarize yourself with the planets, their moons, and some of the major constellations.


You can find a number of resources at your local library or bookstore and on the Internet, some of which will be discussed in later steps. While you read up on the solar system and universe, take some time to look at the night sky. This will make real some of what you're learning and help you find places to interest your child in astronomy, as well.;
, Science, not just astronomy, is based on coming up with ideas and testing them out to see if they work. Much of the way children play is devoted to exploring and understanding the world around them. While you should restrict your child from doing anything that would hurt someone or that is simply unacceptable behavior, giving him or her the opportunity to play with various things, with supervision, is a good way to stimulate creativity and to develop a desire to learn new things.


For encouraging a love of astronomy, many parents choose to buy their child his or her own telescope. While a telescope is a good way to view the night sky, in many cases it may be better to start your child observing the night sky with a good pair of binoculars and then move to a telescope as he or she shows a deepening interest in the subject.

, A good book on astronomy should explain concepts in simple, clear, real-world language, with examples that your child can relate to, and plenty of pictures. You'll want 2 kinds of books, a desk reference that you can keep in the house and a field guide that you can take with you on outings in your backyard and elsewhere. One good astronomy field guide is Howard Schneider's ""Backyard Guide to the Night Sky.""

, Computer software adds a visual dimension to teaching astronomy to children along with the ability to control what they learn. Astronomy programs include star-map programs that display the night sky for various dates from various latitudes, Orrery programs that chart the positions of the planets, ephemeris programs that give rising and setting times for the moon and planets, and programs that graphically display moon phases for any date. Many programs are available commercially at software stores or on the Internet, and other good programs are available as freeware or shareware on the Internet.


One good freeware program is Celestia, created by a development team led by Chris Laurel. It is designed to let users tour the solar system and the stars in its catalog by either entering the name of a destination or browsing the solar system or its star catalog. You can tour other solar systems and return to our own by selecting our sun (Select Sol), read summaries of solar system objects and then display them, or see a list of stars currently known to have planets orbiting them. You can capture any of the images displayed and even create short animated tours of your own. The program is available at http://www.shatters.net/celestia/.
You can install star-map programs on a laptop or tablet computer and take it with you when exploring the night sky. Check with the manual for your laptop or tablet for the minimum air temperature at which it can be safely operated and any recommended means to protect the unit against moisture if you decide to do this.
With the advent of the smartphone, astronomy software is now available as downloadable applications for the iPhone, Android, and other systems. One such app is Google Sky, which works with global positioning satellites to let you point your phone at a location in the sky and display and identify the constellation your phone is aimed at on its screen.

, There are a vast number of websites that can help you teach astronomy to children or simply help them further their interests. Sites such as http://www.kidsastronomy.com/, http://osr.org/en-us/articles/great-space-and-astronomy-lesson-plan-ideas/ and http://geology.com/teacher/astronomy-space.shtml are clearinghouse for astronomy lesson plans for teachers and for parents who home-school their children. NASA also maintains an education website covering concepts in astronomy and science in general, ttp://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/index.html, as well as an Astronomy Picture of the Day site, http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html.

, While astronomy software can display constellations, it can only do so on a single, flat computer monitor, instead of the large hemisphere that planetariums use as a display screen. Planetariums also let multiple users share the experience of viewing a simulation of the night sky, accompanied either by a lecture given by the operator or a recorded show that may also include projections of still photos or movies on a portion of the screen. A few even feature a series of pre-recorded programs from which viewers can assemble their own customized shows.


Planetariums may be found on college campuses or attached to science, history, or children's museums. Planetariums attached to science museums often include exhibits in rooms adjacent to the planetarium that cover the history of astronomy or space exploration.
Some colleges with astronomy programs own observatories as well as planetariums. These observatories may be open to the public 1 night a month either year-round or during seasons such as spring or fall. In addition to offering visitors the opportunity to look through its main telescope, they also feature short lectures on the night sky and science demonstrations by visiting professors and graduate students.

, Many science fiction conventions have a dedicated science track, with panel presentations by guests who've been associated with astronomy and space exploration in some fashion, such as current or former NASA or Jet Propulsion Laboratory employees. Conventions also feature art shows, many of which may include art by artists who specialize in astronomical art, and dealers' rooms, in which you can purchase astronomical art. You can learn about science fiction conventions in your area by doing an Internet search or through publications such as ""Locus,"" ""Science Fiction Chronicle,"" or other magazines dedicated to science fiction fandom. Many conventions also feature reciprocal links to other conventions, so that if the first convention whose site you visit doesn't interest you, you can look for others that might.

, You can further your child's interest in astronomy by painting the ceiling of his or her room with the planets of the solar system or a view of the night sky, hang astronomy-related posters and art on the walls, or both. If your child has particular artistic talent, he or she can do this with you.

, If either you or your child have musical ability, you can write songs about certain astronomical concepts or objects, such as a song about the planet Venus to the tune of either the Frankie Avalon or Bananarama songs of the same name. If you and your child share an interest in computers or broadcasting, you can do your own astronomy podcast. As suggested previously, you can also encourage your child to produce space-themed art if he or she has artistic ability.


Science fiction conventions have long featured late-night sessions of folksinging, devoted to original songs and song parodies with a science or science fiction theme. Some conventions are now offering talent showcases for attendees to perform their own creative works in front of others. If your child has both a performing and an astronomical interest, this can be a suitable venue to share his or her creative works with others.

, If you enjoy camping, take along a field guide and pair of binoculars or a telescope to do some field observing of the stars, planets, and constellations. You can also view the sky from a deserted road or from your own backyard, if you're sufficiently far away from city lights that can obscure your view of dimmer stars.


Be aware that as the moon approaches its full phase, it gets brighter and can make it harder to see dimmer stars in the sky. If you choose to view the sky during or near the night of the full moon, you may want to make it the primary focus of your observing session.

, Astronomy clubs are great local resources for promoting and supporting interest in astronomy for both children and adults. Some clubs have their own observing areas from which members can observe the night sky at regular times and maintain an inventory of telescopes that can be checked out to members. Some clubs organize ""star parties"" by themselves or jointly with other clubs at which a large number of astronomy enthusiasts gather, and they also have observing programs, with certificates of accomplishment, for such things as viewing all the objects in the Messier catalog.


Many astronomy clubs have an education or outreach coordinator who works with local school systems to interest children in astronomy. This person can also be a resource to you in providing ideas to teach astronomy to your child.

, The easiest way to reinforce lessons learned in teaching astronomy to children is to make astronomy a part of your everyday life. You can point out newspaper articles on the latest discovery of a new planet or new fact about one of our planets or watch astronomy-related science shows on television and discuss them over the breakfast or dinner table. For young children, you can celebrate their ""Mercury birthday"" with a small gift 4 times a year. (Mercury's orbital period is 88 days, as compared to Earth's 365 1/4 days, or roughly 1/4 that of Earth.)

Reinforce the idea through social interactions with like-minded people.",How to Teach Children Liberal Values," It is important that your children understand that they are in control of their bodies, and they don’t have to hug, kiss, touch, or be touched if they don’t want to.Liberals believe that people should have control over what happens to their bodies, whether they are a man or a woman, or whether they are young or old.


Don’t tell your children who they have to show affection to. For example, don’t say, “Kiss Grandma before she goes home!” Instead, let them decide how the feel comfortable saying goodbye to grandma.
Conversely, it is also important to teach your children that they need to ask permission before touching anyone else. Encourage them to ask Grandma if they can give her a kiss if they have said that they would like to do so.;
, Don’t reinforce the gender stereotyping that leads boys to believe that they shouldn’t show emotions, and girls to believe that they have to be dainty and wear dresses all of the time. Instead, let them find out who they are and what they like without injecting your own biases into the situation.For example, let your daughters engage in physical activity, and let them do it the same way that boys do. Don’t discourage them from climbing on the monkey bars because you’re worried they’re too fragile. Conversely, don’t discourage a boy from liking something because it’s pink, and don’t say things like, “big boys don’t cry” when he feels sad about something.

, Being empathetic to the experiences of others plays a big role in liberal ideology. Your child will need to develop their own skills of empathy, and research suggests that parents can play a big role in helping develop this skill.For example, research suggests that children who feel secure and loved are more likely to be empathetic.
Spend time talking with your child about different emotions and about how emotions can affect our behavior. It doesn’t matter how young your child is, talking to them about their own feelings as well as your own will help them understand that everyone has different experiences.
Set a good example for your children. Being empathetic yourself is a great way to teach children about empathy. If you and your child witness someone who is going through a hard time (e.g. a homeless person on the street) talk with your child, and ask them how they think that person must be feeling.
Expose them to different types of people. Try to let your children see that people are quite different if you venture outside your hometown. Expose your children to the different cultures and experiences that the world has to offer. For example, you could take them on a trip to a foreign country. While you are visiting that country, ask them to identify what is different about the people in this country. However, also ask them to notice how they have similarities with those people.

, One of the core values of liberalism is tolerance.It is important to teach kids that being tolerant doesn’t mean sacrificing their own beliefs. It means that children should learn that it is good to be open to learning about the differences of others.This doesn’t only refer to political values either. It also refers to cultural differences, religious differences, and all the other kinds of ways in which people can be different.

, Many liberals believe that it is important that the government fund programs that help people in need. This could involve a range of different programs; for example, if you are fired from your job you are able to get unemployment benefits that will help you take care of your family while you search for a new job.You can demonstrate why this is important by pointing out ways that you or someone you know has been helped through a tough situation by a social support program. For example, you can use an example like this: “Last year, Aunt Sarah was fired from her job and she was very worried for awhile about how she could take care of her family without a paycheck. However, she was able to get money from the government to help feed her family while she looked for a new job.”
You can also demonstrate the value of social support programs by asking them what they think should be done in a particular situation. For example, if you see a homeless person asking for money on the street, ask your children how they would help that person. Liken their response to something the government can also do.”

, Liberal people tend to be against war as a means for solving problems. War results in unnecessary loss of life, pain and suffering, and money being spent on the military that could have been spent on other things, such as education.One good way to talk about this topic with your kids is to ask them about how they have been taught to solve problems with friends at school. Hopefully, you have demonstrated that you never ever use violence to try and solve a problem. Point out how many governments think that it’s ok to use violence to solve a problem, but in the end it leaves a lot of families feeling sad because they have lost someone they care about.

, Liberals are generally in favor of immigration laws that make it possible for people to immigrate legally to the United States. Additionally, liberals are typically in favor of extending help to undocumented immigrants who wish to stay in the United States.You can talk with your children about immigration by talking about your own family history. Unless you are a Native American, your family immigrated to the US from somewhere else, even if it was 200 years ago. Point out to your children how many families would like to come to the US to have good lives just like they have.

, Perhaps one of the biggest debates in politics these days is the pro-choice/pro-life debate. Typically, people with liberal values tend to support the pro-choice side of the argument. This is the notion that a woman has the right to choose what she does with her body, and if she wants to have an abortion, then that is her decision.Similarly, be in favor of offering women several methods of birth control. Just because you are pro-choice doesn’t necessarily mean you think people should get abortions all the time. It does mean though that you support giving women (and men) lots of different ways to prevent unwanted pregnancy.
This may be a difficult topic to discuss with your child directly, but you can still demonstrate that every one should have the right to choose what to do with their body, regardless of their gender.
For example, you can talk with your child about how they have been taught that they don’t have to touch or kiss anyone they don’t want to kiss. Point out to them that everyone has this right, no matter their gender.

, Another hot debate in the United States in recent years is gay marriage. Liberals tend to support marriage for all people, whether they are hetero- or homosexual. The belief is that love is love, and Americans should have the right to choose who they marry, as long as it is with another consenting adult.Talk with your kids about sexuality. You can explain to them that just because they are a girl doesn’t mean they have to “like” boys, and vice versa. Explain how there are many boys who like boys, and girls who like girls, some who like both boys and girls.
Ask your children what they think about gay marriage, and why they think what they do. Ask them if they think that a person should be allowed to marry the person they love regardless of their gender, as long as the other person also wants to get married.
Showing your child that you are open to conversations and questions on any topic will make them more open to discussing topics that they find difficult.

, There are likely many values that you want to instill in your child. Think about which values are the most important to you. It is important to realize that you only have so much influence on your children, so focus on the ones that mean the most to you.For example, you may feel very strongly about raising children who are tolerant and open-minded, but you may not care too much about what religion they follow, if the follow any religion at all. You can talk with your children about religion, but don’t make it the most important thing. Instead, focus on setting examples of tolerance. Talk about what can happen when people are narrow-minded and intolerant.
In one study, liberal parents reported that teaching tolerance was the most important thing in their mind.If you have a partner that you are raising your child with, be sure to spend time talking with them about what values you want to instill. This could be challenging if you and your partner have different political views, but try to find a middle ground, or at least a few areas you can agree on.

, There is research that suggests that if you constantly push your beliefs onto your children, there will be a tendency for them to rebel against those beliefs.If you consider yourself liberal, and want to raise liberal children, then don’t force them to accept it as though it is the only right way to live.


This doesn’t mean you can’t talk to them about your political beliefs and why you believe them. Instead, it means that you should avoid being dogmatic about your beliefs, and try to avoid saying negative things about conservatives in front of your children. Explain both sides of the story, and talk about why you feel liberal values are best for you.
Ask them their opinions about things without first telling them what you think. Learn about who they are and how they feel.

, Your child may come to you with lots of difficult questions about why you believe what you believe, and they may even ask questions that challenge your beliefs. Do your best to avoid losing your patience and getting angry.For example, your child may come home from a sleepover and tell you that Jimmy’s dad was talking to Jimmy’s mom, and said that anyone who believes gay marriage is acceptable is an idiot. Your child may ask you why that is. In a situation like this, you may feel very angry that Jimmy’s dad was saying these things in front of your child, but avoid getting angry. Instead of getting angry, say something like, “Well, Jimmy’s dad might think that is true, and he is entitled to have that belief. However, gay people are just the same as everybody else. They are also entitled to love who they love and marry the person who wants to marry them. Do you think that people should be able to marry the person they love, or that they shouldn’t be allowed to because someone else doesn’t like it?”
Framing your response as a conversation where you explain your own beliefs as logically as possible helps your child to make the idea their own, and decide what makes sense to them.

, Both sides of the political spectrum have their faults, and being liberal doesn’t make you or anyone else perfect. When you child asks you a question, try to give them an honest answer. Try to talk about both sides of the issue and why you have chosen to believe what you do.For example, many people start out somewhere on the political spectrum and then move to the other side for some reason. Talk to your children about your early views and why you eventually became a more liberal person. Give examples of events that led you to believe in more liberal values.
Keep in mind that when it comes to values there is not usually an objectively correct answer. There is only a belief in a morally correct answer. Keeping this in mind will help you avoid being dogmatic.

, If you are a very political person, you might have strong opinions about those that have differing views. You may think conservatives are nothing more than racist bigots. However, one important value of liberals is tolerance. Thus, you should set an example for children. Be tolerant of those who don’t agree with you.You can explain to children why you don’t agree with conservative values, but do so respectfully without using hateful or derogatory language.

, The best way to help instill liberal values is to set a good example for your children by living in accordance with those values. Whenever possible, set a good example of what you think it means to be a good liberal person.For example, be tolerant of people who are different than you. Don’t talk badly about someone just because they are somehow different.
Try volunteering for a political movement that you support, and bring your kids along. Try to opt for peaceful movements where your child will be able to see liberal people at their best. Try to avoid movements that are violent as this may frighten your child.

, For most children, politics is a confusing subject. Take time to explain why it is important to have an opinion about politics.For example, take time to explain to them the main two parties in the US (Democratic and Republican) as well as some of the other parties (e.g. Green Party, Tea Party, Libertarians, etc.). Talk about the values of each party, and give some examples of different presidents from each party.
Explain how in the US, everyone over the age of 18 is entitled to vote in elections that will help decide who will run the country. Explain how elected leaders are supposed to represent the will of the people that elected them.

, Have your children spend time with friends and family who have similar values. Hearing about why other people have similar beliefs may help them decide on their own beliefs.


This doesn’t mean that you should keep them away from people who have different values. As they mature and grow older, your child will have to learn to deal with, and be understanding of, the fact that people are different. Since tolerance is a liberal value, showing them that there are people who don’t think the same as them is also important.
If they spend time with someone who has strong conservative values, address the matter with your child. For example, you can say, “Today you are going to spend time with Grandpa. Grandpa is a good and kind man, but sometimes he might say something that you don’t think is right. Try to remember that he has some different ideas about things, but that he loves you very much, and that you love him too. We don’t have to agree on everything to be a close family.”

Look at the course as an opportunity.,
Don’t assume that you are naturally bad in the subject.,
Remember that it matters.,
Ask for something harder.,
Look to the future.",How to Survive Remedial Classes1," Many students are discouraged when they are assigned to a remedial class. Some assume this placement means they aren’t ready for college. However, being assigned a remedial class doesn’t mean that you are behind, just that you have an opportunity to receive better instruction and improve your skills in a subject that you have struggled with in the past.There is nothing unusual about being asked to attend a remedial course: two thirds of community college students take at least one remedial course. At four year colleges, approximately 40% of students take a remedial course.;
, The number one obstacle to being good at math is the belief that you just don’t have the ability to succeed. Many people only develop a mastery of a subject later in life. Perhaps, you believed you were bad in the subject and therefore never tried hard enough. Perhaps, you just didn’t have talented teachers.


Once you convince yourself that there is nothing wrong with you, it’ll be easier to commit to work hard enough to succeed., While you might think that math doesn’t matter if you want to be an artist, you would be wrong. If you are successful, at some point you will need to price your work and account for your sales. Your career can take you in unexpected directions and you should master all the skills that you can, because you never know which will be useful., If the material is so familiar that it is becoming boring and hard to pay attention to, ask you professor if you can be assigned extra credit. Don't tell her that you find the course ""boring"" and don't give the impression that you are above the course. Just indicate that you want to learn more and ask if you can be given something more challenging.If you go above and behind and establish a special relationship with a professor, she might be willing to help you out in the future when applying for jobs.

, There might be nothing you can do to really get interested in your remedial course. In that case, look ahead to what it means to finish up and pass the class. Remember that to move on to the major courses you want to take, you will need to finish your remedial course first. Think about where you want college to take you in life. Focus on that to muster the energy to get through this obstacle."

Consider the ways in which the approaches between Western and Islamic approaches differ.,
Be aware that the concept of separation of church and state is a foreign concept in Muslim culture.,
Discuss how diplomatic relations may continue between secular cultures and Muslim cultures.

,
Discuss how civil rights are observed in Muslim nations.,
Discuss the ways in which people live in predominantly Muslim countries or cultures.,
Respect both cultures.",How to Study the Concept of Islam in International Relations," For example, be familiar with realism, liberalism, structuralism, and so forth. You must have a good understanding of the different theories in order to be able to apply them to your research and reflection.;
, After you've mastered the concepts behind the Western thinking, turn to the concepts behind the Eastern thinking.

, Also consider the ways in which they are similar. Reach these conclusions for yourself, while being guided by what you've read.


Compare the basic principles of both Eastern and Western concepts when analyzing international relations.
Extract the common grounds and the differences between both concepts.

, This is an important element to bear in mind when reading international relations theories that focus on Islamic cultures.

,, Where you do not consider that such rights are observed, discuss why this may be the case and what can be done about it.


Remember to see things from the perspective of those living in the country or culture you're examining, not just from your Western mindset. Try not to impose what you consider is ""right"" onto other people who may have a very different and yet equally valid way of seeing things.
In what ways is human dignity maintained even under differing cultural interpretations of ""rights""?

, Consider what is different from and what is similar to your own experiences.

, In what ways can both cultures live harmoniously, showing respect while finding the common grounds to work together?

Get to know the professor.,
Master good study habits.,
Finish assignments on time.,
Do not fall behind.,
Write your notes by hand.,
Reach out for help.,
Get involved in the campus community.,
Get a good night’s sleep.,
Eat a balanced breakfast.",How to Survive Remedial Classes2," Most professors should hold office hours during which you can get to know the her. This can be a good opportunity to build a relationship with the professor and learn about her expectations.


If you establish a relationship with your professor, she might be willing to dedicate more time to advising you about how to be successful in the class and in college more generally.
Ask her about the requirements for the course. What sort of time should you expect to spend on assignments? How can you go above and beyond in the class? What qualities does she expect to see in an ""A"" level assignment? , Ultimately, it is important to be able to develop a schedule to complete your work promptly. Make a point of finishing assignments in advance, rather than waiting until the last second. Organize your work, notes, and handouts so that you can find all relevant course materials.

, Maybe in high school your teachers were lenient when you turned in an assignment late. Don’t expect that to be true in college. You might not get any credit for a late assignment and sometimes in college a single assignment can make up a large chunk of your grade. Turning in any assignments late is flirting with failure.

, Sometimes you might be assigned readings that you won’t be tested on immediately. Don’t assume that you can wait until the final to learn everything you need to know. College classes require that you master much more information than high school classes. You might well find it difficult, if not impossible, to catch up if you fall behind.


Course lectures and discussions often follow readings. If you haven’t familiarized yourself with the text, the lecture might be unintelligible and you could have missed your one opportunity to understand the subject.
Professors can also call on you in class for information. If you don’t know the material they will probably subtract points from your participation grades.

, Research has shown that writing notes by hand forces you to engage with and better remember the lecture than typing notes. Typing notes actually impairs the learning process by encouraging the note taker to mindlessly transcribe information without thinking about what is being said.While it can be harder to get all of the information in the lecture while hand writing notes, notes are really less important as a point of future reference than they are as a way to actively engage with the lecturer as it happens. Because it is harder to keep up while handwriting notes, the note taker abbreviates the notes and is forced to decide what the most important points are.
Computers also provide plenty of opportunities for distraction. In the study, however, note takers were not permitted to surf the internet or play games. That means that, even in the best case scenario, typing is a worse way to take notes than handwriting.

, Colleges typically have much more extensive resources for students in need than were available to you in high school. There should be a tutoring center and possibly a writing center on campus. Other specialized resources might be available for harder classes. Ask your professor about what sort of assistance is available. Search the college website for more information.


The professor should also be able to provide some help with problems during office hours, but her time will be limited. Come in with a specific question that you hope to have answered. If you simply announce that you need help, your professor will not know where to begin and might be reticent to help.
When visiting the writing center, have an essay on hand. Someone should review the essay and not only correct mistakes, but also tell you more generally how to improve your writing.
If no other options are available, talk to other students in the class about forming a study group to help each other.
Remember, to improve you need to be willing to accept criticism. Your problem might not be that you can't handle the work, but that you are unwilling to adapt and use better methods. Find someone who is willing to talk honestly about what you need to do and take their comments to heart.

, To a greater degree than high school, college isn’t just about going to class and taking tests. It’s also about meeting people who might be important to your career and getting involved in organizations from which you can learn something. Ultimately, this experience important both in and out of classroom.


While getting involved in a club might seem to distract you from classes, that doesn’t need to be true. Being engaged in and enjoying the campus community can make you more invested in and dedicated to your collegiate success., If you don’t get sleep, you will have difficulty concentrating on class and school work. Research has also shown the missing sleep can severely impair your IQ. To be bright in the classroom, you need to make sure that you wake up bright and rested., For energy that will keep you alert throughout the day try to have a hearty breakfast that includes protein like eggs, bacon, or yogurt. Whole grains, like granola or oatmeal can also help sustain you through the day. Don’t forget, however, to also get some vitamins in by including fruit in your breakfast."

Focus on learning in high school.,
Take four years of math.,
Study for placement exams.,
Familiarize yourself with college requirements.,
Don’t take your senior year off.,
Discuss placement with a counselor.",How to Survive Remedial Classes3," Some colleges might look to your high school performance when deciding whether you need to take a remedial course. Others will require that you take special tests after you are accepted. In the latter case, you need to be sure that you not only did well in high school, but also retained what you learned.To retain the math you learn in high school, don’t focus on memorizing formulas. Instead, try to understand the logic behind the formulas. You might forget the formula’s over time, but, if you understand how math works, you can figure out the process on your own.

, Many high schools only require three years of math instruction. However, you are likely to forget much of your math knowledge if you go a full year without studying it. This will leave you unprepared for your placement exam.

, Most four year colleges use scores for the SAT, ACT, or Advanced Placement exams to determine whether or not you need remediation. Community colleges typically used specialized exams like ACCUPLACER or COMPASS. Despite some myths to the contrary, you can study for these exams in advance and improve your score.


Before taking an exam, search online for it. Most exams have some practice tests available that you can take. This allows you to familiarize yourself with some of the concepts that will be tested in advance.
There are also online courses that you can take to brush up on your math skills prior to an exam. Consider KhanAcademy or IXL.ACCUPLACER is used by 62% of community colleges and COMPASS is used by 46%. Therefore, almost all community colleges use one of these two exams to determine if you need remedial courses., When you know what colleges you are interested in applying to, search online to see what they require to skip remediation and plan your course and test schedule to meet these requirements. To make sure that nothing slips by, visit your high school counselor and ask if you are on track for college.

, Many students assume that their senior year is not vital to their success, because they have already passed all the hurdles necessary to get into college. Actually, much of what you do in your senior year will be important to how you are placed once entering into college. Stay on task and see if you can get ahead for college.


If possible, take a class at a local community college during your senior year to familiarize yourself with college expectations., If you have been placed in a remedial class and believe it is unnecessary, talk to a counselor at the college about why you received this placement. In some cases, she might be able to help you get out of the course.


Usually, if you retake and pass the placement exam, you can get out of the remedial course. However, not all of these tests are offered regularly and you might have a limited amount of time to retake the test between your placement and when you begin class.

Interact with your child.,
Offer toys.,
Reinforce cause and effect through conversation.,
Demonstrate.",How to Teach Cause and Effect to Your Kids1," Even young babies can begin to understand cause and effect: they cry, for example, and someone comes to feed, change, or comfort them. Maximize this natural way of learning by responding to your baby and interacting in various ways. Make faces to get your baby to laugh; pick your baby up if he or she reaches out for you.;
, Babies and toddlers learn through play, so offer a variety of toys suited to your child’s developmental level. Your baby can learn that shaking a rattle creates a sound; your toddler can learn that pressing certain buttons may make a toy light up or make a noise.

, As your child grows and understands more and more, you can enhance their understanding verbally. So, for example, you can say, “oh, you didn’t eat your lunch, and that’s why you’re hungry again already” or “oh, you were too rough with that balloon, so it popped.”

, Toddlers can grasp cause and effect best with a practical demonstration. Puncture a balloon with a pin, and see what happens. Or go to the kitchen sink with your toddler, and pour water into a cup until it overflows. Ask your toddler what happened, and why. Repeat with other household objects and procedures.

"
"
Be familiar with your punctuations and writing format.,
Get a notebook or journal.,
Find out what genre of writing you like.,
Keep your journal and a pencil with you.,
Know your characters.,
It's always best not to try too hard.,
Play your story inside your head.,
Gather all of your ideas and drafts.",How to Start a Good Story," It would be a good idea to start a rough draft to begin with so you can get all your ideas scribbled down so none of your ideas slip away from you. That will help with your organization when you start to write.

, Write down what your inspirations are and keep a journal of your thoughts. It will help you get to where you are used to writing all the time.

, This will help you decide what you want to do your story on. Whether it's action, drama, romance, fantasy, biographies, or nonfiction, I'm sure you will find the right genre for you.

, Something happens or you think of something that could play apart in your story but you can't write it down. This is why you should carry a journal and pencil with you. That will help you get more material for the start of your story when you begin to write it.

, Every story needs a plot and characters as well as the main character. This is where your imagination plays a part. You need structure after you do your rough draft and creating your characters in the beginning will let you know what direction to go in.

, Let the story write itself. If you start to stress over it, walk away and cool off. If you write when you're stuck or upset, it could vary the outcome. Don't get me wrong; some good stories are written with varied emotions but when you first start your story, you want to play it out easy and gradually alter the emotion.

, Play it like a movie so you can visualize the detail so when you begin to start your story you can describe the detail like you saw it in your head.

, Get your inspirations, creativity, imaginations and scribbled on journal paper and begin to write. Let the words go where they go, remember you can always go back and change it; it's not set in stone, so don't be afraid to take risks. After you start your story and put all your ideas in story format, read it!! After you have conquered the beginning of your story you can add on to it. After you get the hang of that, try to put a little more structure and thought into your story through the rest of it.

Teach your child the vocabulary of cause and effect.,
Use the word “because.” Reinforce the relationship between causes and effects by using the word “because” in conversation; it makes for better understanding for many kids.,
Explain why cause and effect relationships are important.,
Make a T map.,
Play cause and effect games.,
Read books.,
Create a timeline.,
Teach analytical thinking.",How to Teach Cause and Effect to Your Kids2," Explain that a cause is an event or action that makes something happen; an effect or consequence is a thing that happens as a result of that cause.


As your child gets older, add additional vocabulary. Words like “influence,” “results,” and “factors,” for example, as well as words that will help with cause and effect sentence construction: “therefore,” “consequently,” “thus,” and others.

, So, for example, say, “Your shoes are dirty because you stepped in the mud,” or “The house is cold because we left the windows open.”

, As your child grows, you can point out that the principle of cause and effect is significant in a number of ways. We try to discover the causes of things that are bad so that we can eliminate them and make the world better; we try to discover the causes of things that are good so that we can apply them and maximize the results.


Once your child starts school, it’s important to emphasize the academic uses of cause and effect. Scientists use it all the time (What is causing global warming? Why did these plants die? What will happen if we mix vinegar and baking soda?), and so do historians (Why did the American colonies revolt? What happened after Cortes conquered the Aztecs?).

, A T map is a simple table with two columns. On one side, you can write causes; on the other, you can write effects. For example, on the left side, write “It is raining.” Have your child brainstorm possible consequences: it gets muddy, flowers grow, the school has indoor recess, there are traffic jams. Write those on the right side of the table.


You can also use T maps for individual cause and effect relationships to illustrate language. So, in this case, you would write “It is raining” at the top, instead of on the left. Then, on the left, you’d write, “It gets muddy because it is raining.” On the right, you’d write, “It is raining, so it gets muddy.” This method teaches the two main forms of stating cause and effect: the “because” form and the “so” form. It also reinforces the concept.

, One example is the cause and effect chain. Choose a consequence (say, “pants are dirty”). Then have your child think of a potential cause (for example, “I fell in the mud”). Then you (or another child), follows up by saying the cause of that consequence (“it was raining and slippery”). Continue as long as you can. This game will help your child develop his or her understanding of cause and effect.


You can also play a simpler game where you offer an imaginary effect (say, “the dog barked loudly”) and have your child think of as many possible causes as he or she can. Examples might include “the dog barked loudly because the mailman came,” “the dog barked loudly because someone pulled on its tail,” or “the dog barked loudly because it saw another dog.”

, Look for themed picture books designed to tackle causes and consequences. Read them with your child, and talk about the situations presented in them.

, For older children, draw a timeline on paper. Choose a historic event, like a war, and mark its important moments on the timeline. Connect those moments based on cause and effect.

, As your child grows, his or her understanding of cause and effect will get better and better, and you can begin pushing for deeper, more analytical thinking. Ask why something occurred, and then follow up with “How do you know?” or “What’s your evidence?” Try asking “What if?” questions to engage your child’s imagination: “What if we accidentally used sugar instead of salt in this recipe?,” “What if the American colonies didn’t revolt?”


Introduce the idea that correlation is not causation. If there is no evidence for a particular cause making a particular event happen, then it may be a random occurrence rather than a causal relationship.

Get some feedback.,
Check off the requirements.",How to Start a Conclusion Paragraph," One of the most important components of an effective conclusion is a well-written thesis statement. Before you can draft your final paragraph, you need to make sure that your argument is coherent and polished. Spend some time editing and polishing your thesis statement.Make sure that your thesis is not vague. For example, don't just say, ""This is a paper about the death penalty.""
Instead, try being clear and specific. You might write, ""The death penalty costs America millions of dollars per year, and as such, is one of the major expenditures in our penal system. This paper will examine why the justice system in the United States needs significant reforms.""
Try reading your thesis statement out loud. Does it make sense? Does it flow well?;
, Your conclusion should re-state your main points. A major part of a good conclusion is a reiteration of your argument. Take care to clearly state your argument again in the conclusion.Do not just copy and paste your thesis statement. Put it in different words.
For example, maybe your thesis statement is, ""The Cold War significantly changed American foreign policy. It caused many policymakers to grow accustomed to having a defined enemy. This made for a somewhat confused foreign policy in the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union."" You will want to rephrase it in the conclusion.
Try saying, ""As demonstrated by looking at the foreign policy actions of President Bush and Clinton, the post-Cold War foreign policy suffered from a lack of coherent action.

, Your conclusion should remind your reader what they have learned. Take care to remind them why your argument is strong. By using specific examples, you will be strengthening the argument you've worked hard to lay out.Consider using a quote. You want to highlight the importance of the reading that you've done.
A quotation from an expert will help strengthen your point. You can preface the quote with, ""As expert biologist Frank Smith reminds us..."".
You might also consider providing a useful anecdote in your conclusion. For example, if you are writing about the plight of the polar bears, offer a story about the polar bear at the San Diego zoo.

, Your paper should be organized in a way that clearly explains the main components of your argument. For example, maybe your paper on the Civil War addresses the causes and the impact on the economy and politics. Make sure that your conclusion reminds your readers of each part of your paper.Try to synthesize. This means taking the analysis further than just simply summarizing your points.
Your conclusion is a great place to not only summarize, but to draw connections. Tell your reader how your different points connect.
For example, you can point out that the Civil War affected both the economy and politics, and that the two were intertwined.

, Your conclusion is your final chance to make a powerful impression on your reader. Make sure to include all of the necessary components in your conclusion. You will want to review it carefully after writing a draft.Make sure that you have clearly stated your argument. Your reader should not be confused about your point.
Review your main points. Have you included all of them in your conclusion?
Does your conclusion explain why your topic is significant? Remember, it is your last chance to convince your reader that your research is important.
Make the importance clear. You can state, ""This research is significant because it illustrates connections between 19th century literature and the feminists of today.""

, You want your reader to know that they have reached the end of your paper. The wording and content of your conclusion paragraph should make this clear. There are a few ways that you can establish a sense of closure.Try connecting the last paragraph to the first. For example, if your introduction talked about a dog named Sam, finish your paper by referring once again to Sam.
Linking the first and last paragraphs is a good way of ending your paper. It ""bookends"" your topic.
You can also finish your essay with a quote or fact that you referenced earlier in the essay. This provides a nice sense of closure for your reader.

, A conclusion is not just a a place to emphasize your points that you have already made. You should also use it as a space to point out necessary ""next steps"". You can tell your reader about what should be done to solve the problem. Talking about next steps makes it clear to your reader that you are concluding your essay.Maybe you are writing a paper about the obesity epidemic in America. Your conclusion is a great place to offer some solutions.
For example, you could say, ""Clearly, there is need for a greater focus on physical activity at a young age."" Or you could say, ""More research should be done to help learn to effectively treat the negative side effects of obesity.""
You can also use your conclusion to point to broader themes. For example, your paper about the Freedom Rides in 1961 could indicate some broader points about the Civil Rights movement.

, What ever device you use to start your conclusion, you should focus on your word choice. Make your point clear and concise. You want your argument to be clear and to the point. There is no need to try to use big words or flowery prose in your conclusion.Try to avoid using a long sentence to start your conclusion. You want to grab your reader's attention and keep it.
There is no need to say, ""And so, as we have effectively demonstrated through the use of complicated evidence..."" Instead, just say, ""It is clear we need change.""
Try writing the first sentence of your conclusion using only one syllable words. This will enhance the drama of your paper.

, Context is information that helps your reader fully understand your argument. You may have made your points clear, but you need to do more than that. Context will tell your reader why your topic-0-and argument--is important.Clearly stating the importance of your argument is a good way to start your conclusion. Your reader will understand exactly what you are trying to say.
You can say, ""This research is important because it could help save the lives of animals."" That is a direct, declarative statement.
Context can help you explain why a topic is important. For example, your conclusion could begin with a statement such as, ""As this essay is being written, there are blank amount of youths incarcerated in the United States.""

, Your reader will likely know that they have reached the end of the essay. Generally, that is obvious simply because they are out of pages to read. Don't feel the need to state the obvious.Avoid saying, ""In conclusion"". There are other, more interesting, ways to start your conclusion.
Try saying, ""As the research has demonstrated."" You can also just introduce your final points by saying, ""Finally...""
You can also indicate that your reader is at the conclusion by saying, ""To review..."" or ""We can see...""
You can also write, ""It is clear..."". Try a few different options to see what works best for your particular paper.

, Transitions are the sentences that connect the different pieces of your paper. There should be clear transitions between your introduction, each of your body paragraphs, and your conclusion. When you edit, make sure that your transitions are well-written.There are several words you can use to indicate that you are transitioning to the next part of your paper. You want your reader to know when you have reached your conclusion.
In addition to saying, ""In conclusion...."", there are other choices you can make. For example, you would try, ""Finally,..."" or ""As this paper demonstrates..."".
Make sure to transition between each main point. You can use words such as, ""In comparison"", ""Next"", or ""A different approach"" to illustrate your are shifting topics.

, You have put a lot of hard work into your conclusion, and your paper as a whole. You wouldn't want your efforts to be marred by shoddy editing. Take time to thoroughly edit your paper before submitting it.Look for spelling and grammatical errors. Use spell check to help you.
Edit for content. Read each sentence of your paper to make sure that it makes sense and helps get your point across.
Don't be afraid to make cuts. If you find a paragraph that doesn't add to your argument, get rid of it.
Read out loud. This is an excellent way to catch errors that you didn't notice while reading., Sometimes it can be difficult to be objective about your own writing. Ask someone else to read your paper for you. A friend, classmate, or family member might be willing to offer some input.Be open to constructive criticism. Don't take it personally if your friend offers some helpful pointers.
Explain the assignment. You can say, ""This paper is supposed to be an assessment of the public school system in Indiana. Are my points clear?""
Ask your reader to pay careful attention to your conclusion. They might spot holes that you didn't see.

, After you have edited, make it is time to give your paper a final look. You want to take time to make sure that you have fulfilled all of the requirements. For example, if the guidelines state it should be 5-7 pages, make sure that it is.Format the paper as specified. If it is supposed to be written in 12 point Times New Roman, verify that that is the font you used.
Submit the paper as specified. If your teacher asks you to submit both an electronic copy and a hard copy, follow those instructions.

Talk to an IB coordinator.,
Maintain high academic standards.,
Start second language instruction early.,
Seek outside assistance.,
Take the appropriate courses.,
Finish an extended essay.,
Complete internal and external assessments.,
Meet scoring requirements.",How to Stay in the IB Program," If you are interested in the program, you should talk to your school’s IB coordinator upon beginning high school. Many schools require the completion of specific courses and certain GPAs to be admitted into the program.If your school does not have an IB program, but a neighboring one does, you can contact the IB coordinator there and ask if they would be willing to consider your application.;
, The IB program is extremely rigorous, requiring on average two to three hours of homework per night. To obtain entrance and stay in the program you will need to demonstrate commitment and ability.


Stay focused in class, ask questions, and complete work.
Study. Tests and quizzes are a big deal in the program. Take good notes and use your time wisely in class.

, The IB program requires comprehension of a second language. In order to obtain an appropriate level, it is recommended that you begin instruction in a foreign language by 9th grade.


If you do not begin instruction in a second language by 9th grade, try taking a summer session at the local community college to catch up., If you are having difficulty meeting school requirements, try to seek outside assistance from an outside resource, like a tutoring agency or counselor. They might be able to help you identify and correct any learning problems. Furthermore, they likely have extensive knowledge of the how the program works in your community.

, You are required to take English, Second Language, Social Science, Experimental Science, and Math. You will also need to take an elective, 2 semesters of the Theory of Knowledge, 150 CAS hours, and write a 4,000 word essay.


At least three of your courses should be at the higher level.Your IB counselor and you should devise a plan to meet these requirements at the beginning of the program, either at the end of your Sophomore year or beginning of the Junior year., Over the course of your junior and senior year you should complete a 4,000 word essay on a subject of your choosing. Consult consistently with a research librarian, subject adviser, and essay adviser to establish that you are making satisfactory progress., Unlike the AP program, where your final grade consists exclusively of final test scores, IB scores are based in part off of in class assignments graded by your instructor with supervision from the IB organization. You should both study seriously for end of the year tests and keep up with class assignments.Internal assessments usually constitute 20-30% of your grade., IB classes are graded on a scale of 1-7. To obtain a degree you should aim to have a cumulative score of 28 between your six courses. That means you should struggle for average score between four and five points. However, these scoring requirements are contingent upon an array of circumstances.


With 28 points you will still be required to have earned a grade of at least D in either the TOK or the extended essay. You are not permitted to get a score of 1 in any of your courses, more than one 2 in higher level courses, three grade 2s in standard classes, and no more three grades of 3 or below total. At least 11 points should have been secured in higher level subjects and 8 in standard level subjects.
You can still get a degree with a cumulative score between 24 and 27, if you meet additional requirements. You must have earned at least a D in both TOK and extended essay. You are permitted no grade 1s or grade 2s at higher levels. You can only get one grade 2 at a standard level. You are still permitted no more than three scores below 3. At least 12 points must have been earned in higher level subjects (if you took four such classes the number is 16). At least 9 of your points need to have been earned in standard level subjects (6 if you have only taken two such classes).
You cannot receive a diploma if you have been found guilty by the IB Organization of malpractice---including plagiarism, submitting the same project for multiple classes, and copying the work of a peer."

, Obtain your parking decal or bus schedule before class starts so you can plan accordingly.

, They can help you plan your class schedule to meet your needs. If you need help with your schedule, make sure to meet with your adviser.

, Go to Course Wizard to see the books you will need for class and to get the syllabus. This will help you see what is expected of you before the semester starts. Also, it is always a good idea to plan ahead. College demands that you spend lots of time studying, so knowing ahead of time when assignments are due can help you plan which days and times you can devote to studying. That way you can avoid procrastination.

, This will help you avoid problems throughout the semester.

, They will help you stay healthy, eat right, and provide you with tools that will help you succeed.

, Visit Campus Recreation. To meet new people, you have to go where people are. That means, you need to join clubs and organizations, participate in after school events, and hang out at the social hubs on campus, like the Flight Deck and gym in the UC. According to a 2007 study of student success, students who participated in after school activities ""have been positively associated with student persistence and educational achievement"" (Ullah and Wilson 1193).

, You are in college to enrich your life in many ways. Take advantage of this opportunity to learn. To do so, make sure that you are active in your education. In other words, do not sit around and wait for someone to come and tell you what to learn. Take initiative and determine what and how you should learn.

Before you can write a paragraph, you must have your thesis statement firmly in mind. A thesis statement is a one to three sentence description of what you are arguing and why it is important.For example, are you arguing that all Americans should use energy-efficient lightbulbs in their homes? Or, are you arguing that everyone should have free internet access?
Make sure you have a clear thesis before you begin writing.

, For an academic essay, you will have to include many different types of paragraphs to fully explore a topic. These can range from descriptive paragraphs that illustrate a problem for readers with vivid details, to paragraphs that make a point in support of an argument and that then use evidence to support that point, to paragraphs that acknowledge the opposition’s main argument and provide a refute.


Identify what your paragraph needs to do and then begin gathering ideas for what to include in the paragraphs.
Some questions you might ask include, is this paragraph going to be read alone or as part of a full essay? What do you want to accomplish with this paragraph? What are the most important details for your readers to know? What is the most effective way to organize this information? What tone (serious, humorous, concerned, etc.) should you use to get these details across?
Take the time to answer each of these questions before you begin to write your paragraph?

, The topic sentence of each paragraph is a signpost that the reader will use to follow your argument. Your introduction will include your thesis statement, and each paragraph will build upon this thesis by offering evidence. As the reader goes through your paper, she will recognize how each paragraph contributes to the thesis.Remember that the thesis is the larger argument, and the topic sentence helps prove the thesis by focusing on a smaller topic or idea. This topic sentence will make a claim or argument, which is then defended or reinforced in the following sentences.Identify the main idea of your paragraph and write a mini thesis statement that states this main idea. Let's say your thesis statement is ""Charlie Brown is the most important comic strip character in America,"" your essay might have the following topic sentences:


""The high ratings that Charlie Brown television specials have garnered for decades demonstrate the influence of this character.""
""Some people contend that superheroes such as Superman are more important than Charlie Brown. However, studies show that most Americans identify more readily with the hapless Charlie than with the powerful, alien Superman.""
""Media historians point to Charlie Brown's catchphrases, distinctive appearance, and sage wisdom as reasons why this character is beloved by adults and children alike.""

, Often it is easier to start writing in the middle of a paragraph instead of at the beginning of the paragraph. If you are stressing out about writing the topic sentence, then focus on the part of the paragraph that is easiest to write, such as the evidence and analysis for an argumentative paragraph. Once you have finished the more straightforward component of a paragraph, you can return to the topic sentence.

, If you have to make an argument in your academic paper, then you will have to use evidence to convince your reader that you are correct. Your evidence could be many things: historical documentation, quotations from experts, results from a scientific study, a survey, or your own observations.Before you proceed with your paragraph, list out every piece of evidence that you think supports your claim.There are many different types of evidence that you might include, such as new reports, statistics, the results of different studies, or even firsthand accounts.

, For paragraphs that will present and analyze evidence, each paragraph should have just one to three related pieces of evidence. Take a close look at all the evidence you have gathered. Are there any pieces of evidence that seem like they fit together? That is a good indication that they belong in the same paragraph.Some indications that evidence might link together include:


If they share common themes or ideas.
If they share a common source (such as the same document or study).
If they share a common author.
If they are the same type of evidence (such as two surveys that demonstrate similar results).

, The 6 W's of writing are theWho,What,When,'Where,Why,andHow. This is the important background information your reader will need in order to understand the points you are making.As you write out your related pieces of evidence, keep your reader in mind. Always explain what your evidence is, how and why it was collected, and what it means. A few special things to keep in mind include:


You must define any key terms or jargon that might be unfamiliar to your reader. (What)
You must provide any key dates and locations, if relevant (such as where a historical document was signed). (When/Where)
You must describe how evidence was obtained. For example, you might want to explain the methods of a scientific study that provided you with your evidence. (How)
You must explain who provided you with your evidence. Do you have a quotation from an expert? Why is this person considered knowledgeable about your topic? (Who)
You must explain why you think this evidence is important or notable. (Why)

, After you present your key, related piece(s) of evidence, you have to spend some time explaining how you believe the evidence contributes to your larger argument. This is where your own analysis comes into play. You cannot simply list evidence and move on: you have to explain its importance. A few questions you can ask yourself as you analyze your evidence include:


What is it that ties this evidence together?
How does this evidence help prove my thesis?
Are there any counterpoints or alternative explanations I should keep in mind?
What makes this evidence stand out? Is there anything special or interesting about it?

, After you’ve written the paragraph, read over it. Ask yourself if the topic sentence supports the paragraph’s ideas and details. Do they fit together? Are there ideas that seem out of place? If so, think about how you can alter the topic sentence to cover all of the ideas in the paragraph.


If there are too many ideas, you may need to break up the paragraph into two separate paragraphs.
Be sure that your topic sentence isn't simply a restatement of the thesis itself. Each paragraph should have a distinct, unique topic sentence. If you are simply restating ""Charlie Brown is important"" at the beginning of each body paragraph, you will have to narrow down your topic sentences more thoroughly., Unlike full essays, not every paragraph will have a full conclusion. However, it can be effective to devote a sentence to tying up the loose ends of your paragraph and emphasizing how your paragraph has just contributed to your thesis. You want to do this economically and quickly. Write one final sentence that bolsters your argument before moving on to the next set of ideas. Some key words and phrases to use in a concluding sentence include ""Therefore,"" ""Ultimately,"" ""As you can see,"" and ""Thus.""

, Unlike an argumentative paragraph, your creative paragraph isn't going to further a thesis. However, it should still have a purpose. You do not want your paragraph to seem aimless or confused. Ask yourself what you want your reader to gain from this paragraph. Your paragraph might:Provide your reader with key background information.
Advance the plot of your story.
Show how your characters relate to one another.
Describe the setting of your story.
Explain a character's motivations.
Provoke an emotional reaction from your reader, such as fear, laughter, distress, or sentiment.

, Prewriting exercises are a good tool to allow you to get to know the story you wish to write and to develop some good content for your paragraph. These exercises can also help you to see your story from new angles and perspectives. Some exercises to help you gain inspiration for your paragraph include:


Write a letter from one character to another.
Write a few pages of a journal from your character's perspective.
Read about the time and place where your story is set. What historical details are the most interesting to you?
Write a timeline of plot events to help you keep everything in order.
Do a ""freewrite"" exercise, where you spend 15 minutes writing everything you can think of about your story. You can sort it out and organize it later.

, The 6 W's in writing are Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How.If you are writing a creative, fictional story, you will need to have these questions firmly answered before you begin writing. Not every W will need to be addressed in each paragraph. However, you should not begin writing unless you have a thorough sense of who your characters are, what they are doing, when and where they are doing it, and why it is important.

, Creative writing paragraphs are more flexible than paragraphs in argumentative, academic papers. However, a good rule of thumb is that you should begin a new paragraph whenever one of the major W's of writing is switched.For example, if you switch from one place to another setting, begin a new paragraph. When you describe a different character, begin a new paragraph. When you describe a flashback, begin a new paragraph. This will help keep your reader oriented.Always change paragraphs when a different speaker begins using dialogue. Having two characters use dialogue in the same paragraph creates confusion for your reader., Academic writing often involves paragraphs that are roughly the same size. In creative writing, your paragraphs can be one word long to several-hundred words long. Consider carefully what effect you want to create with your paragraph, which will help you determine your paragraph length. Varying the length of your paragraphs can help make your writing seem interesting to your reader.Longer paragraphs can help establish a thick, nuanced description of a person, place, or object.
Shorter paragraphs can help establish humor, shock, or fast-paced action and dialogue.

, Like any piece of writing, taking time to consider the reason why you are writing and who will read what you write is a beneficial step. However, it can be even more crucial for business writing because you often have limited space and time to get your message across. Therefore, everything in your document needs to be on point. Before you start writing, ask yourself:What do I want/need to accomplish with this document? Your answer might be something like get a job interview, describe a problem to my boss, or sell a product.
Who is going to read this document? Your answer might be something like a member of the human resources department, my boss, all of my coworkers, or a customer.
What is the best way to get my message across to this audience? Your answer might be something like emphasize my qualifications for the job, be direct about the problem, explain the new policy in clear terms so that all of my coworkers will understand, or highlight the biggest selling points for this product and create a sense of urgency.

, The tone of your paragraph is also important to get your message across. Think about what the most appropriate tone would be for your situation and try to write with this tone in mind.For example, if you are trying to write a paragraph in an email to your boss to describe a problem, then a serious tone would be most appropriate. However, for a paragraph in a cover letter, you may want to use a friendly, professional tone.
It is fine to use humor occasionally in professional writing, but don’t overdo it. Also, avoid using sarcasm, dark humor, or any other type of language that could alienate or offend your reader.

, One good way to engage your reader for a paragraph in a professional document is to emphasize the positive. You can do this whether you are writing a cover letter or a sales pitch in an email. Try to focus on all of the positive aspects of hiring you or buying what you are selling.For example, if you are writing a cover letter, then emphasize your training, experience, and other qualifications that would make you an excellent candidate for the job.
If you are writing a sales pitch, then focus on what the reader will gain or how the reader will benefit from buying your product.

Review any information you’ve been given about the assignment so that you’re clear on the requirements and format.If you have any questions about your term paper, ask ahead of time. Instructors are usually happy to answer questions provided you’ve read the assignment or prompt first and give them enough time to answer.
Do not wait until a day before the paper is due to email your instructor a question about the paper. S/he is likely very busy at that point and will probably not have time to respond. This delay also suggests to your instructor that you have not planned ahead or given the assignment the proper attention.

, You may have been assigned a topic, or you may be free to choose your own. Even if you have been assigned a general paper topic, it’s likely that you will need to decide on your “angle” in approaching it. For example, “the American Civil War” is too big a topic for a term paper to discuss. You need an angle, such as “Roles of African-Americans in the military during the American Civil War.”


You’ll also want to identify your purpose for the paper. Sometimes, this is given to you, such as “Write an analytical paper about ___” or “Discuss the history of ___”. If it isn’t, you may have some freedom to determine your own purpose. Is it to persuade, inform, argue, or analyze? It’s a good idea to check in with your instructor to make sure that your goal aligns with the assignment., Most term papers require research. You should begin to gather research materials before you outline and write your essay. As you write, you will likely discover gaps in your argument that require further research, but you won’t have a good idea about what you want to say until you do some preliminary research.If you have a library, consult with your librarian. Librarians are excellent resources who can guide you to credible and relevant research sources.
Make sure your sources are reliable. It’s a good idea to look in published books, peer-reviewed journals, and government or university websites. Credible, mainstream journalism sources, like The New York Times or The Guardian, are also helpful, though make sure you do not rely on editorial or “opinion” pieces as sources of fact.
Keep track of your sources. EndNote and RefWorks are very handy for keeping a record of sources you consult. You may have access to these through your school. You can also keep track by writing the bibliographic information (author’s name, title, publisher, place and date of publication) on an index card or in a word processing document. Make sure you record the page numbers and sources for any quotations you copy out.

, You should generate some ideas about your topic before you try to organize your paper. You may find that prewriting exercises can help you get started. Here are a few you can try:Try freewriting. Write for 5-10 minutes about whatever comes to mind about your topic. Don’t stop or edit yourself. Once you’ve written, review your material and highlight or underline things that seem useful starting points. You can repeat this exercise multiple times to generate ideas.Try clustering. Clustering is a type of mind-mapping that can help you see connections between ideas. Start by writing your topic on the center of a piece of paper and draw a box around it. Then, draw a few lines extending from the box. At the end of each of these lines, write down an idea that corresponds to this topic and circle each. Continue drawing lines outward and connecting ideas until you feel like you’ve thoroughly explored the connections between facets of your topic.Try questioning. The big questions, “Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?”, can help you determine what information you need in your paper. Write each question on a separate sheet of paper and respond to the question in as much detail as you can. When you hit places where you do not have answers to the question, make a note to yourself -- these are places where you’ll need to do some inquiry or research.

, Your thesis statement will likely evolve as you write your term paper. This is very common in argumentative or analytical essays, where you will continue to think about your material as you write, and you may reach conclusions you didn’t expect. It’s important to have a working thesis to start out with so that you know your paper’s central goal or point.It is common in high school to write 3-prong thesis statements, which include three main points, each of which will have its own body paragraph. This type of thesis rarely works for term papers, as they are longer and more complex essays. Go with a statement that states the main focus or claim for your paper.

, A term paper is usually longer than other types of essays, and it often counts for a significant portion of your grade. Additionally, a term paper usually requires research that takes time and work to produce. Don’t wait until the last minute to start working.


Work on your paper in stages, if you can. Give yourself at least a day between each stage to allow you to come to the paper with fresh eyes.

, This may involve explanatory remarks of what your field entails, what the purpose of your paper is, and contextual information that your reader needs in order to understand your argument.Don’t fully write the introduction yet. It’s generally best to wait to draft your introduction until you’ve written the essay. Your thesis and argument is likely to evolve as you write, so spending too much time on the introduction up front may be a waste of time.Write a placeholder outline for now. Introductions usually begin with a broad statement and narrow in until you present your thesis statement. Provide a few bullet points about where you will start and include your thesis statement., Separate different topics into different sections or paragraphs, so that each paragraph deals with one main idea. This provides a visual/organizational clue to the reader that different pieces of information are being presented.Your topic sentences should set the direction for the paragraph. Make sure they act as a “road map” to let the reader know what the main topic will be.
Avoid using facts or statements that don’t give an idea of what the rest of your paragraph will argue. A good topic sentence will be informative, directional, and interesting.
For example, “Salt water is not suitable for drinking” is not a great topic sentence for a paragraph on water rights, because it does not communicate the main idea of the paragraph. “It is a human right to have clean water” is a better topic sentence, because it asserts your main argument for the paragraph.

, Once you have your topic sentences, you will have an idea of what your paragraphs will discuss. You can now decide how to organize these paragraphs in the first level of your outline. This level uses capital Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, etc.).I is your introduction. II is your first body paragraph, III is your second body paragraph, and so forth. Place each Roman numeral on a new line, followed by a topic sentence.
Don’t be afraid to experiment with the paragraph order. You may find that as you develop your paragraphs further, they fit better in other sections of the paper.

, The second level of your outline uses English capital letters (A, B, C, D, etc.). This level incorporates subpoints of your main point. They will form the body of your body paragraphs.Place the capital letter on a new line beneath the first level. Indent the second level about 0.5” past the first level. Many word processing programs will do this automatically.
List your subtopics beneath your topic sentence. Each subtopic should be related to the main goal or idea of the paragraph.
Use your research and the material you generated during prewriting to help you fill in this level.

, If you need to, you can use a third outline level to expand on your subpoints. This level uses Arabic numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.).Use this level to provide evidence or further explanation for your subpoints.

, Your conclusion will wrap up your argument for your reader. It should return your thesis, but should not restate it exactly.


You do not have to write a full conclusion while outlining. You may not have a clear idea of how you want to conclude until you’ve written more of the essay.
Common ways to conclude an essay including returning to the theme you introduced in the introduction, extending the relevance of your argument to a broader context or concern, proposing a course of action or solution to a problem, or ending with a provocative question., Although it is less common than the standard alphanumeric organization, you can also organize your outline using only Arabic numbers and decimal points. This type of outline is sometimes used in the final term paper as well, to identify headings and subheadings in a longer work.Begin a decimal outline with “1.0” and each subsequent section with the next number (“2.0”, “3.0”, etc.).
Change the number after the decimal point to reflect new information. For example, “2.1” might be your first subpoint, and “2.2” would be your second subpoint.
You can continue adding subsections by adding another decimal point and number, such as “2.1.1” etc.

, After you have finished writing your first draft, let it sit for a day, if you can. Return to it with fresh eyes and read it through from start to finish. As you read, briefly summarize the main argument of each paragraph. You can do this off to the side of the paper, on a separate sheet of paper, or as a comment in a word processing document.Try to limit your summary to a sentence. You can also use a key phrase or a few keywords.
If you’re having trouble summarizing the main idea, it could be a sign that your paragraph is wandering. Consider splitting your paragraph into two paragraphs so that you can devote one to each idea.

, Once you have completed summarizing the main idea of each paragraph, look at what you’ve written. Do the ideas progress logically? Do they seem to build on one another to create momentum for your argument? Or do they wander around?!


You may need to consider moving paragraphs around. In some cases, you’ll even need to delete -- yes, delete! -- and rewrite sentences or even whole paragraphs.

, If you’re having trouble envisioning how to organize your term paper after you’ve written the first draft, it could be because you’ve been looking at it too long on your computer screen. Print out the draft and cut it up into its separate paragraphs.


Physically swap the paragraphs around. Do they make better sense in another order?
In a strong term paper, each paragraph will build upon the previous one, so that there is only one ideal way to structure them for your argument. If you can swap the paragraphs around easily, you may need to hone your focus.
Consider adding clearer transitions and topic sentences to help make stronger connections between your paragraphs.

, You’re probably dealing with a fairly long project, so it can help to revise your original outline to reflect the new order you’ve decided on. After you have done this, revise the term paper according to your new outline.


After you’ve revised the term paper, double-check with the new outline to make sure that you have stuck with the structure you decided upon.

Summarize your paper.,
Consider further work that can be done.",How to Start a Paragraph3," Start off your paper or essay with an interesting sentence that makes the reader want to dive in and read your whole work. There are many devices that you can choose from. You can use humor, surprise, or a clever turn of phrase in order to catch your reader's attention. Look at your research notes to see if a clever phrase, surprising statistic, or intriguing anecdote jumps out at you. Some of these possibilities include:An anecdote: “When he was growing up, Samuel Clemens watched steamboats on the Mississippi River and dreamed of being a river boat captain.”A statistic: “Women directed a mere seven percent of major Hollywood films in 2014.”A quotation: “ 'I am glad to see that men are getting their rights,' Sojourner Truth said in 1867, 'but I want women to get theirs, and while the water is stirring I will step into the pool.'""A thought-provoking question: “What will Social Security look like in 50 years?”

, It can be tempting to use a large, general phrase as your hook. However, hooks are more effective when they are specific to your topic. Resist the temptation to introduce your essay with sentences that begin with phrases like:


""Since the beginning of time . . .""
""From the beginning of mankind . . .""
""All men and women ask themselves . . .""
""Every human on the planet . . .""

, Once you have your hook, you will need to write a few sentences to orient your reader to what the rest of your essay will be about. Is your essay making an argument about Social Security? Or is it a history of Sojourner Truth? Give your reader a brief roadmap about the scope, purpose, and overall thrust of your essay.


If possible, avoid phrases such as “In this paper, I will argue that Social Security is ineffective” or “This paper focuses on the ineffectiveness of Social Security.” Instead, simply make your point: ""Social Security is an ineffective system."", When you want to grab the reader, you need a sentence that is clear and easy to follow. The beginning of your paper is not the place to write a convoluted, long-winded sentence that the reader will stumble over. Use common words (not jargon), short declarative sentences, and easy-to-follow logic to guide your introduction.Read your paragraph out loud to see if your sentences are clear and easy to follow. If you have to take a lot of breaths while you read, or if you have a hard time keeping track of your ideas out loud, you should shorten your sentences.

, A thesis statement is a single sentence that provides the overarching argument of your essay. State your thesis at the end of your opening paragraph if you are writing an academic paper. For an academic paper, the thesis statement is the most important part of your essay. Remember that a thesis statement must be:


Argumentative. You cannot simply state something that is common knowledge or basic fact. ""Ducks are birds"" is not a thesis statement.
Convincing. Your thesis must be based in evidence and careful analysis.Do not posit a wild, deliberately unconventional, or unprovable thesis. Follow where your evidence leads.
Appropriate to your assignment. Remember to adhere to all parameters and guidelines of your paper assignment.
Manageable in the space allotted. Keep your thesis narrow and focused. That way you might be able to prove your point in the space given to you. Do not make a thesis statement that is too large (""I have discovered a new reason why World War II occurred"") or too small (""I will argue that left-handed soldiers put on their coats differently from right-handed soldiers"")., Bring the reader back to your introduction by starting off the conclusion with a reminder of how the paper started. This strategy serves as a frame that bookends your paper.


For example, if you started your paper with a quote from Sojourner Truth, you might start the conclusion with: “Even though Sojourner Truth spoke almost 150 years ago, her statement continues to ring true today.”

, You can use this final paragraph to offer one last insight into the discussion that took place in the rest of your paper. Use this space to pose a final question or propose a call to action.


For example, you could write: “Is an e-cigarette really any different from a regular cigarette?” Or, “It’s time to write to these companies and tell them we want things to change.”

, If you’ve written a paper that is long and complex, you may choose to reserve your conclusion for recapping what you’ve written. In doing so, you can reiterate the most important points for the reader. This also helps the reader understand how your paper fits together.You can start off by writing, “In summary, the cultural policies of the European Union support global trade in three ways.”

, Conclusions are a great place to be imaginative and to think about the bigger picture. Has your essay opened up new space for more work to be done? Have you asked some large questions for others to answer? Think about some of the larger ramifications of your paper and articulate them in your conclusion.


For example, if you wrote about a current human rights violation in another country, then you might bring the problem back home. What comparable problems have members of your country faced? How were they solved? Can any of this be applied to the problem you have raised?

If you are in college, then consider visiting your university’s writing center. They provide help to students, usually trough one-to-one meetings with a tutor who can teach you strategies to improve your writing process.
Another option is to make an appointment with your professor for help with getting started.
Just make sure that you do not procrastinate because of trouble getting started. This can put you in a worse situation where you have to write an entire paper the night before it is due. Doing this puts unnecessary stress on you and it also often results in mediocre writing.

, If you are stuck on a paragraph, try to turn off your brain for 15 minutes. Simply write down everything you think is important about your topic. What do you care about? What should others care about? Remind yourself of what you find interesting and fun in your paragraph. Simply writing for a few minutes--even if you are writing material that will not enter your final draft--will inspire you to keep going., You do not have to write a story, paper, or paragraph from beginning to end in that order. If you are struggling to write your introduction, choose your most interesting body paragraph to write instead. You might find it to be a more manageable task--and you might get ideas for how to get through the more difficult sections., If you are getting tripped up by a complicated sentence or concept, try to explain it out loud instead of on paper. Talk to your parents or a friend about the concept. How would you explain it to them over the phone? Write it down once you've gotten comfortable speaking it out loud., First drafts are never perfect. You can always fix imperfections or clunky sentences in future drafts. Just focus on getting your ideas on paper for now, and revise later., Your brain sometimes needs breaks in order to function at a high level. If you have been struggling with a paragraph for more than an hour, let yourself take a 20-minute walk and come back to it later. You might find that it looks a lot easier once you have taken a break., You should begin a new paragraph when you move on to a new point or idea. By starting a new paragraph, you signal to your reader that you’re shifting gears in some way.Some cues that you should begin a new paragraph include:


When you begin to discuss a different theme or topic
When you begin to address contrasting ideas or counterarguments
When you address a different type of evidence
When you discuss a different time period, generation, or person
When your current paragraph is becoming unwieldy. If you have too many sentences in your paragraph, you may have too many ideas. Either cut your paragraph into two, or edit down your writing to make it more readable.

, As you move to each new paragraph in what you are writing, each one will serve a specific purpose. Start each new paragraph with a topic sentence that clearly builds upon your previous thought.For example, you might transition from a paragraph describing how e-cigarettes may provide a safe smoking cessation option for smokers, to a paragraph about how using e-cigarettes may improve the health of former smokers. You could do this by beginning your paragraph with a transition like, “Along with the apparent safety of e-cigarettes, former smokers who switch to vaping may enjoy some of the same health improvements as people who quit cold turkey.”

, When your paragraphs are building a sequence (such as discussing three different reasons why a war took place), start each paragraph with a word or phrase that tells the reader where you’re at in the sequence.For example, you might write: “Firstly…” The next paragraph would start with, “Secondly…” The third paragraph could start with either “Thirdly…” or “Finally…”
Other words to signal a sequence are: eventually, ultimately, at first, in the first place, in the second place, or lastly.

, Use your paragraphs to compare or contrast two ideas. The word or phrase that starts your topic sentence will signal to readers that they should keep the previous paragraph in mind as they are reading the next paragraph. Then, they will follow your comparison., For example, use phrases like “in comparison” or “similarly” to compare.
Use phrases such as “in spite of,” “however,” “nevertheless,” or “on the contrary” to signal that the paragraph will contrast or oppose the idea from the previous paragraph.

, If you’ve discussed a particular phenomenon in the previous paragraph, give the reader a solid example in the following paragraph. This will be a concrete example that gives weight to a general phenomenon you've previously discussed.


Use phrases like “for example,” “for instance,” “thus,” or ""more specifically.""
You might also use an example type of transition when you are putting special emphasis on the example. In this case, use transition words like “particularly” or “notably.” For example, you might write: “Most notably, Sojourner Truth was an outspoken critic of the patriarchal system of the Reconstruction era.”

, When you are describing a circumstance or phenomenon, you can give the reader clues that point to how this phenomenon should be perceived. Use vivid, descriptive words to guide the reader's views and to encourage them to see things from your point of view.Words like “fortunately,” “luckily,” “oddly enough,” and “unfortunately” are useful here.

, The connection between one paragraph and the next may be that something in the first paragraph causes something in the second paragraph. This cause and effect is indicate by transition words such as: “accordingly,” “as a result,” “consequently,” “therefore,” or “for this reason.”, Include proper punctuation in your writing by following the phrase with a comma. Most transition phrases such as ""finally,"" ""ultimately,"" and ""notably,"" are conjunctive adverbs.These phrases need to be separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma.For example, you might write: “Sojourner Truth was, most notably, an outspoken critic…”
""Ultimately, we can see . . .""
""And, finally, the expert witness claimed . . .""

, Toss anything you don't need. If you need to keep papers, purchase a cheap file cabinet or box, and file them there. If the desk surface is large enough, frequently-used paper may go in baskets, binders, or racks on top.

, A trash can is the ideal spot. A few objects that are meaningful or inspirational could occupy the back corners or hang on a nearby wall, but don't trade work area for trinkets.

,,,, This can help to corral paper clips and other small items and still keep them handy. If your desk has drawers, though, take a good look at what's in them. If you don't need it for your work (pennies, loose screws, last year's birthday card), toss it!

,, This is essential for writing at night. Consider getting a desk blotter. It will protect the desk from ink and offer a clean surface on which to write. Many desk blotters are printed with calendars, too, if you wish to track your schedule or progress.

Submit your work.",How to Rewrite Someone Else's Short Story," Read it twice or even three times if you feel that's necessary. Examine the plot, the theme and the writing of the story. This will help you know how you want the rewritten story to be.


Identify the theme of the story. Figure out what is wrong with it. Do you feel it is impossible or awkward as written, or just old-fashioned and dated?
Also look at why you think that this story is worth rewriting. Do you like the idea, or maybe the plot? Or do you think the writing is amazing but the plot not so good? This step is important as you will understand what to improve and what to keep.;
, Do you feel that the perfection of the protagonist is going way too far, or are the dialogues hypocritical? Look at what you want to change.


Always keep in mind the plot and the theme of the story, whether the original one or your new improved one. The characters should always fit in with the theme of the story, and the dialogues should never clash with the established mindset of the character in question.

, If you like the writing but not the plot, you can simply write in a similar style and improve whatever you want to improve.


This may be a little difficult, but if you have read many works of the author, imitating the style will become easier.
If you feel that you cannot keep the writing and improve the story, just write it out how you like it and edit it afterwards to keep the style of the original author. Once you write out the story in simple language, making the words flow to your liking is not that difficult.

, Do you think the ending should be not be a cliffhanger, or maybe the beginning is too long, or the details too tedious? This will reduce the time you spend on rewriting the story.

, This will keep your writing more organized.


In the original story, highlight what you want to change, or keep. You can look over these while writing out the first draft of your improved story.

, This will create the base for your improved version.


Write out the story in points. This will keep your outline clear and concise. You can elaborate it while writing the actual version.
Make sure that you have figured out what parts to change. You do not want to be stuck while writing the story!

, Once you have got your outline prepared, you can start on your first draft.


Once you have finished writing it, read it all once to make sure it is exactly to your liking. If you feel some parts are still in need of improvisation, do that now.

, Write it or type it out.


Go over it to remove any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes.

, If it is for an assignment, make sure that you include the original story's name and the author.


Don't try to sell the story as your own. This is a very enjoyable personal project, and you can just store your version to read by yourself. This will keep you out of unintended trouble when it comes to plagiarism, and you can read the story without the feeling of dissatisfaction that you got when reading the original story!

Use more dialogue.,
Don’t clump up your language with too many big words.,
Keep your sentences short.,
Keep it action-packed.",How to Minimize Reader Time Spent on a Novel Page1," Dialogue reads quickly, as it is usually short. It is also easier to read visually, as it is spaced out on the page more.


Plus, it’s easy for readers to skip over unnecessary words like “she said.”;
, You can use an occasional larger word, but don’t make it every other word. You don’t want your reader being confused all the time or having to stop to look up too many words.

, Long sentences require more attention and may even force your reader to re-read the page. It is easier to take in a whole sentence all at once if it is short.


For instance, saying, “Katy, who usually ate bananas at breakfast, decided she wanted a bigger meal to share with her friends before she went out to run errands” could be broken up into smaller sentences like “Katy usually ate bananas at breakfast. Today, though, she decided to make a bigger meal to share with her friends. Plus, it would keep her fueled through her errands.” Essentially, keep it to one big idea per sentence.

, Action passages tend to keep the reader more engaged than paragraphs of description. This does not mean that you should cut description out entirely, but you should consider limiting the amount of description you use and increasing the action of your story.

For instance, “The dog ran outside.” should be easy enough for you to take in at once.

, Some speed readers just read the first and last sentence of a paragraph. You still get the general idea, but you will be able to get through the text much faster.

, Skimming just means scanning over a text to find only the important parts. Essentially, you let your eyes float over the page until they pick up on a significant word or idea. Your brain will start picking up on what’s important, and you can stop to read just those parts.


It helps to have something to look for. If you are reading a book for a class, you may have some guided questions about the book that you can use to help you determine what is important.

, That is, don’t sound-out words in your head. Rather, let the words flow without that extra step. If you find a word that you don’t know how to say out loud, don’t sweat it.

, You may think you didn’t catch the meaning of a previous passage, but you likely did. Keep going unless you are thoroughly confused.

Be mysterious.,
If you don't follow step one, be open.,
Introduce some kind of action to get the story going.,
Relax, but not too much.",How to Make a Capturing Introduction for a Book," Here's an example:


""The man stood over the high hills, looking over the dark ocean. 'The mission,' he thought to himself. But he didn't move. Ding...ding...ding. His phone rang. Answering it, he said, ""What do you want?"" ""The package is late, Mordred."" Then the line went dead."" See? Introductions like that capture readers because...well...the mystery!
Even if it's not a mystery story, that's a good introduction. Why? Because, even with that kind of beginning, maybe Mordred is actually a mailman who's taking a break from his job. His conscience is nagging at him to finish the mail route, but he doesn't. Then a tenant calls him, saying his VERY important package is late. Nothing mysterious about that! But with that kind of introduction, readers will keep reading!;
, Maybe a mysterious introduction just didn't work for your kind of story. You could go with this kind: ""Adam walked happily up the high hills, looking over the nighttime ocean. His hair, unusually long for a male, was long and golden. He was clearly very strong and was a handsome boy. Ring-ring-ring! His phone rang. He answered it, saying,'Hi Aaron! I was just thinking--Mom said I could have a couple of my friends over when they could. Wanna come Oh, you're grounded? Your mom just let you call me to tell me that? Ah, alright. When will you be ungrounded? Alright, tomorrow it is. See ya' then!' Then Aaron hung up the phone.' Same setting, same general structure, but different from the other one. Why? Because you introduced your characters. You described them. Using words like ""night time"" as opposed to ""dark"" can change an introduction too.

, For example: ""Adam walked calmly home. He opened the door, got on the floor, and everybody walked the dinosaur! Just kidding. He opened the door and was shocked at what he saw. His mother, with a butcher knife, was viciously stabbing a large chunk of deer meat. 'Mom!' Adam said. 'What in Toilet-Paper's name are you DOING?!' 'Uhh... stabbing this chunk of meat?' 'Why?' 'Dunno! Something just possessed me to do it.' 'Mom, you were never like that before.' 'Nope!' Then his mom walked out the back door like nothing had ever happened. But still, he felt the presence of an entity.' There's some action, getting the story along. Well, that's how I would continue an OPEN introduction. The mysterious introduction comes next. ""Mordred stepped down the hill angrily. Down below, waiting for him, was a large, white truck. He got inside reluctantly and began his mail route again. He made sure the man who had called him got his important package. He went around, double-checking that everyone had gotten their mail. Everyone had except one couple. Mordred shrugged, thinking they had gone on vacation. Then he realized their car was still in the driveway, and that they had been there on his first time around. His heart sank--something had happened to them--he just knew it!--and he had to find out what.

, Let your story get a bit easier, but don't make it too boring. Even though you have a good introduction, the rest of your story could stink. A capturing introduction won't do much good if what comes after it is something no reader would read under any circumstances.

Explore different kinds of inspiration or writing prompts.,
Play around with different physical writing methods.,
Write at different times of the day to find what works best for you.,
Figure out what type of writing environment works for you.,
Emulate different writing styles.,
Ne consistent, no matter what your style or writing methods are.",How to Master Your Creative Writing Process1," Maybe you need a bit of meditative silence. Maybe you need a prompt. Maybe you need to start writing the second you have an idea (though this might not always the most practical option). It’s likely that more than one thing will help get you started; just use the one that feels best when you sit down to write. Try different things to figure out what works best for you. Some ideas include:


Use writing prompts.
Go to readings to hear other people’s works.
Read poetry or fiction before starting to write, in order to spark your own creativity.
Use a photograph or a special item to prompt your writing.;
, Also experiment with where and how you write down your ideas. The way that you physically write out your thoughts will make you think and write a bit differently, which can improve your work. Some famous writers, such as Neil Gaiman, exclusively write their first drafts by hand.


Try writing on paper rather than on a computer.
Try writing by hand with a fountain pen.
Explore using markers to write.
Use a chalkboard.

, Maybe you write best in the morning when your brain is fresh. Maybe late at night works better because the sleepiness you feel helps turn off the super-critical part of your brain. Try working in the middle of the day at lunch. Keeping going until you find a time that feels right for you.


You may also find that some days you produce more in the morning, while on others you might produce more work at night. Listen to your body and try to be flexible.

, Experiment with the environment you write in. Some people need complete silence. Some people need light background noise. Still others work best with lots of noise. Find what works best for you by trying each type.


Try writing with other people around. Sometimes, something magical can happen just by being forced to write in the same room as other people.
You can also try writing a story together by shouting out ideas and then passing the story from person to person.

, When you are first beginning to write, try channeling some of your favorite authors in an attempt to find your own voice. Of course, once you become a professional writer, you don’t want to exactly copy other people’s styles.


Take a story you love and try writing one in the same style. Set a similar mood, and look at how the author uses syntax and grammar.
Similarly, in poetry, try writing poems that copy the style of another poet. Most artists learn by copying first, and that’s no different for writers.

, Yes, writing takes talent. But more than that, it takes persistence. Write every day if possible, even if it’s only a little bit at a time. If you write just 200 words a day, you could have over 70,000 words in a year, which is easily a novel.


Persistence will also teach you how you write best, as it will give you plenty of practice in trying out different techniques and environments.
Just keep going. Even if it seems like it’s not working, just try to keep writing. Eventually, you’ll find a rhythm, and you’ll figure out what works for you. First drafts are terrible; they’re supposed to be. That’s why you take time to revise your first draft over and over.

"
"
Never underestimate the importance of revision.,
Look for typos and grammatical errors.,
Don’t be afraid to rewrite.,
Be experimental.,
Try to rewrite the piece without looking at the original draft.",How to Master Your Creative Writing Process2," Revising is essential no matter what kind of writer you are. Take the time to reread your work. Try putting your writing aside for a while, so you can come back to it with fresh eyes.

, Check for awkward phrasing by reading it aloud. Sometimes it can be hard to really proofread your work because you are so familiar with the words you have written. Try reading your writing out loud in order to give yourself another perspective and see what your words sound like together.

, If you’re worried about losing something good, just save the original in another file and start rewriting. That way, you can rewrite without worrying about destroying your original copy. You may find that after rewriting, there are certain aspects of both versions that you want to combine.

, If a piece of writing isn’t working, try taking a different approach to it. Write it from a different point of view, such as third person instead of first, or try writing it from a different character’s perspective.

, One unique way to rewrite something is to read through the piece once, and then try to recreate it without looking at the original.


This technique works especially well with poems, as it may help you decide what you really need to keep in the poem.

"
"
Take classes and one day workshops on writing.,
Read books on writing.,
Ask for help from other people.,
Learn how to deal with criticism.",How to Master Your Creative Writing Process3," Try to learn what works for other writers and incorporate these techniques into your own process. Writing workshops will often have you write during the time you are there. The instructor will usually talk about a particular style of writing and how to use that technique yourself. In classes, you’ll be assigned writing projects to do at home. You may also be asked to read books that discuss writing techniques.


You can find workshops by checking listings at your local library. You can also run an internet search to find writing workshops in your area. Community colleges also offer writing classes.

, Most writers who author books on writing also talk about their process, which can help you refine your own. Choose an author who writes in the same genre(s) that you do.

, Let people you trust read your work, or join a workshopping group where you can exchange your writing with other people; workshopping groups offer critiques to one another and can help you improve your writing over time while also improving the story you are working on at the time.


You can find a workshopping group through your local library, online, or through social media platforms.
If you can’t find one you like, create one with a group of friends that have similar interests.

, Receiving constructive criticism can be challenging, but try to remember not to take the criticism personally. Most other writers will have a genuine interest in helping you write better.


However, that doesn’t mean they’re always right, so take criticism with a grain of salt. Use the criticism that you feel makes the piece better; throw out what doesn’t.
Keep in mind that it’s usually a safe bet that if quite a few people point to the same part of a piece of writing over and over again, then you should probably do something to change it.

Write somewhere you feel comfortable and don't feel disturbed by other people.",How to Make Writing One of Your Favorite Hobbies," Some people prefer writing with pen and paper, such as in a notebook. Some prefer typing into a word processor such as a computer, iPad or laptop. Many people like to combine both approaches, as this allows for different modes of thinking, working, sitting, relaxing, and so forth. Try each and then combine them to find your favorite approach.


You could even try typing on an old typewrite if you'd like to conjure the ghosts of old. Old typewriters can be found through online trade and auction sites, although you'll also need a supply of typing ribbon/ink, so check that before buying.;
, If you're using notebooks, decorating them can help to keep you inspired. This can be as simple as sticking a favorite logo or sticker on the front or as elaborate as adding scrapbook cut-outs, fabric collage or decoupage. Totally up to you, as long as it as a nice tactile feel and interesting look to entice you to pick it up and use it., This is the first good habit to get into. Write down the things you think you'd like to write about as you come across them. While many of these ideas may amount to nothing, some may turn into your next poem, article, great American novel, or whatever. If you don't note down these ideas as they occur to you, you'll be likely to forget them.

Carry a notebook and pen or have a note-taking app on your smartphone. Have these with you wherever you are, to record those ideas as they come to you.

, These are another source of inspiration for spurring on writing. For example, perhaps you have seen an amazing photo of a place taken by a friend and uploaded to Facebook or Instagram. The photo captivates you and carries you away to another time and land, and words about this experience begin to form in your mind. That's a great form of inspiration!


Keep a Pinterest or similar account filled with your favorite images. Keep the board secret if you don't want to share your writing inspiration.

, Take note of what inspires other people, what they like to read and learn about and what's current both now and in the past. All of these tidbits can feed into inspiring your writing., These are all practice prompts. Once you have chosen the best ideas from these, you will probably feel ready to start the writing process.

, There is a vast array of writing activities possible, including book summaries, book critiques, blog posts, short stories, poems, novels, non-fiction, journal entries, commentaries, essays, website reviews, and so on. You might like to try a few different ones to find which niche you're most comfortable in. As well, since writing novels or non-fiction can take a long time, mixing in some other styles of writing can help to keep you interested and current.

, Just as with any hobby, you'll need to set aside time to indulge in it. Write regularly so that you stay in the swing of it. The longer the breaks are, the less likely it is that you'll feel like returning to a piece of work. Small breaks are good, but don't stretch them out for too long.

Set aside slots during your week just for writing. Keep these times as much as possible, seeing them as important for your hobby.

, It's entirely up to you whether you mind or don't mind people around you when you write. If you wish to hole yourself up in the attic or gazebo, that's fine. So is sitting in a café and penning your piece amid the hubbub of others chatting away. Choose whatever works best for you, noting that this may change over time or even back and forth over days and weeks.

, Structure your report to respond to three aspects of the thing you are presenting or answer three questions, such as “what,” “why” and “how.” The human mind is set up to respond positively to three things in a list or in a presentation.

, This will help evoke a mental image and get them thinking critically about what you’re saying.

, Balance that and then tell them why the data is important in each of your three sections. Remember, most of the data can be shown with visual aids, so don’t over report.

, Instead of telling them the trends you see in the data, challenge them to find what the trends are telling the company. Build interaction into your presentation to avoid boring lectures., Adjust your writing for each new audience you have. Research your audience so that you can better customize your presentation to their needs.

, Practice it in front of a colleague or friend so that you can ask them what they’ve taken away from the presentation.

, The audience may only leave with this impression., A shorter presentation is likely to be memorable. If the presentation is over 30 minutes, you should consider cutting it back or breaking it up into several chapters.

, If you don’t have a projection screen or you’re outside in full sunlight, a PowerPoint won’t be the best way to present your data. PowerPoint presentations are still the gold standard of the business world; however, you might be able to employ a laptop, a projector or even cell phones to ensure you are reaching your audience.

, There’s very little reason to design your own template when so many slideshow programs give you compelling templates to choose from.

, Consistency allows the listener to notice the information, rather than the way it’s presented. Don’t change colors, fonts or structure unnecessarily., Use white space so that the audience’s attention is focused on particular data.

, Your speaking will provide the insights, so give the data in the most straightforward way.

, This is a chart or graph that incorporates pictures with data and words to form a coherent, and very attractive, story. You may need to use an infographic service or hire a graphic designer.

, Make sure you don’t simply use stock imagery. Any way you can tie in company or emotional images will create a better response.

, These things can detract from a presentation, rather than add to it. A no frills approach is usually best.

Approach the prompt from a different angle.The best thing about a creative writing assignment is that you get to be creative!,
Write people you know into your characters.If you’re finding it hard to care about your characters, infuse them with people you care about in real life!,
Draw from your personal experiences.Another way to connect to a boring assignment is by using it to explore your meaningful personal memories.,
Borrow interesting stories from your friends.,
Try to write in the style of your favorite authors.,
Ask the teacher if you can write about something else.,
Ask questions.If you doze off in the back of the classroom every day, you'll never find anything in the class interesting.,
Steer the conversation toward topics that interest you.,
Ask the teacher for reading advice.,
Try to make a friend in class.",How to Make the Most of Boring Creative Writing Assignments," Maybe the exact wording on the assignment sheet doesn’t excite you. That doesn’t mean you can’t find a way to get excited about it.


For example, the assignment might ask you to write about a character that’s fighting with his parents. That doesn’t mean you can’t set your story a thousand years in the future, in space.
A poetry prompt might ask you to describe your mother. What if you wrote from your perspective when she was still carrying you? What do you imagine you might have thought about your mother as an unborn child?;
, Your protagonist’s crush on a boy at school will seem more realistic if she feels the way you feel about your own crush. You can also try mixing different people into your characters. For example, your antagonist might pop his gum all the time the way your mean older brother does. Try adding the way your mom glares at you when she’s mad to scenes where the protagonist and antagonist confront each other. You might even use a description of how your dog snarls at trespassers to describe that person.


Be careful not to be too obvious about who you’re writing about. It would be really embarrassing for your crush to find out you liked him before you were ready to tell him!
You can also hurt people’s feelings if you’re not careful. Use just enough of the people in your life to keep yourself interested, but not enough to make it a story about them.

, For example, your teacher may take you on a walking tour of a park and ask you to write about something you see. The poem you write might start off talking about a tree you saw, but use it as a bridge to a more meaningful memory. The field reminded you of the summer you spent at your grandmother's farm in Oklahoma. You worked out in the sun that whole summer, and for some reason your grandfather always gave your ice cold buttermilk when you came into the house, sweaty. You saw a horse give birth that summer. When you watched your grandparents looking after the foal, it made you wonder how they tended your mother when she was little.


In this example, you started with a broad, potentially boring prompt: respond to this park. But you turned it into something meaningful. The park is a place that connected you to memory and family.

, Remember that time your cracked up everyone at the lunch table talking about her adventures over winter break? Work some of those details into your story! Great writers are always stealing from what they observe around them. This might mean they make a character look like someone they saw at the airport. It might mean they make a character say something funny they overhead at the mall.


Instead of stealing wholesale from one source, try to ""braid"" your material.Braiding means weaving details from different sources together to create a new, stronger fabric.
Pair a funny story from your best friend with one of your mom's mannerisms. Change some things about the story to make it even better. Don't be limited by reality in creative work!

, If the subject you're being asked to write about doesn't hold your attention, focus on the way you write it instead. While you want to create your own original voice, mimicking your favorite writers is a great way to develop it. What do you like most about the way your favorite books are written? Do you love the way Faulkner uses natural dialogue? Make a game of observing the people around you, and try to describe how they talk. It doesn't have to be the south, either. If you live in New Jersey, really try to capture the way people speak in your state.

, Don't ask for a subject change immediately. You should at least put some thought into how you could come up with an interesting response to the prompt. But if the deadline is coming up and you can't find your way into the assignment, it can't hurt to ask. If you have a good relationship with your teacher, he may be willing to give you some leeway. Many teachers find that letting students follow their interests produces better work anyway.Make sure not to insult him when you ask to change the subject, tough. There's a good chance he put a lot of love and care into crafting this assignment.
Be as diplomatic as possible. Explain that you've tried to write the assignment several times. Describe your failed attempts to him.
Offer a clear alternative that's still related to the original task. For example, don't try to replace a poem with a short story. Or if a story is supposed to focus on a relationship, don't try to replace it with a murder mystery.

, When you pay attention, though, you may hear things you either don't understand or disagree with. Either way, asking questions is a great way to increase your interest in a subject. Try playing devil's advocate if you're having trouble engaging with the subject. For example, if the teacher says that not all poetry has to rhyme, you might say ""but it has throughout most of it's history. What if this is just a fad that people will make fun of 200 years from now?""

, Your teachers want to know who you are and what your interests are. They may even begin crafting lectures and assignments toward those interests. During class discussions, find ways to guide the conversation toward the things you want to talk about. Say, for example, that you love the A Song of Ice and Fire novels on which Game of Thrones is based. If the class is talking about character development, ask for opinions on having a huge cast of characters, like those books do. Do people think the characters are underdeveloped? Does the length of the books come into play? The number of books that have been written about those characters? With any luck, your teacher will pick up on an interest shared by the students and give you a fun assignment!

, If you just can't get interested in the class, be honest with your teacher and ask for help. Set aside some time for a real conversation where you share your interests with him and ask for advice. Think about what kinds of TV shows and movies you like. What's the best book you've ever read? The only poem that's every really spoken to you? The teacher will be able to make recommendations based on your preferences. If you're reading books you love, you'll be more excited about creative writing assignments in general.

, Having someone to talk to can make any class more enjoyable. Find someone who has a similar interest in getting more invested in the class, and talk to them about it. After school, you can talk about what bored you this particular day, and what you wanted to talk about instead. Together, you may be able to drive class discussion toward subjects that are more interesting.

Decide what form of creative writing interests you most.,
Take creative writing classes.,
Read books on creative writing.,
Attend writing workshops.,
Follow writing blogs and podcasts.,
Join a writers' group.,
Practice.",How to Learn Creative Writing," You may have interests in several forms of writing; however, it's usually best to start with one form or a few similar forms before branching out into other areas.


To determine where to start, consider what interests you most. If you enjoy a particular genre of fiction, such as science fiction, and imagine how you would write the story differently, you may want to begin by learning to write in that genre. If you find yourself paying particular attention to the choice of words in your favorite songs, you may want to learn how to write song lyrics.
You may also wish to tackle a smaller project within the form of writing that interests you most, such as a short story or novella instead of an epic trilogy, or a few good songs instead of a concept album, for example.;
, Creative writing classes are available in a number of venues:


College campuses. Many colleges and universities offer the opportunity to major or minor in creative writing as part of a fine arts degree, or as an elective class for credits to count toward a degree in something else. These classes are usually taught by tenured or adjunct professors, with classes lasting an entire semester.
Community colleges. Many community colleges offer a variety of non-credit, continuing education classes for those who want to learn new things. Writing classes are often among their most popular offerings. Some community college writing classes may last a full semester, while others run only a few weeks. These classes may be taught by professors at the college or by experienced writers in the community.
Seminars. These are short, one- or two-day classes that may be held at a community center, a civic organization, a writer's retreat, or at a convention devoted to a particular genre. These classes are usually taught by experienced writers.
Online. Online creative writing classes may be offered by four-year or community colleges as an outreach program or by organizations geared solely to teaching writing online. Some classes may be offered for free, while others have charges ranging from nominal to substantial.

, Books on creative writing cover a number of aspects:


General how-to books teach the basics of creative writing. These books may include techniques on how to stimulate your creativity, provide suggestions on how to structure your writing time, or offer advice on dealing with agents and publishers.
Technique-specific how-to books teach particular writing methods that can be applied across a number of writing genres. Dwight Swain's ""Techniques of the Selling Writer,"" for example, teaches how to structure stories to build tension.
Genre-specific how-to books teach how to write in a specific genre, such as mysteries, science fiction, or romance.
Genre-specific reference books provide information that writers need to know to create realistic settings for their stories in that genre. There are books covering life in the Middle Ages for historical fiction and fantasy writers, books on forensics for mystery writers, and books of age-appropriate words for children's book writers.

, Writing workshops provide you the opportunity to share your work with and have it reviewed by fellow writers, and to learn how other writers develop their works. Writing workshops may be part of college writing courses, continuing education classes, or part of writers' conferences or conventions.


Most writing workshops will require you to have a piece of writing to share with the other writers attending the workshop.

, A number of authors set forth their opinions on writing in the form of either a weblog or podcast. You can find authors who write in the area you are interested in and either bookmark their blogs or download their podcasts to review at your leisure.

, Writers' groups provide the chance to network with other writers to share both techniques and opportunities to market your work. Large writing groups may share writing techniques through the group newsletter, while small groups may be organized as critique groups, which function similarly to writing workshops. Some groups meet physically, while others connect online through forums or Yahoo groups.


You can find writers' groups in your area by using an Internet search engine or through Meetup.com.

, No matter what formal or informal methods you choose to learn creative writing, the surest way to improve your writing skills is to write regularly and often, applying what you've learned from the methods listed above.


If you write fiction, one way to practice is to take part in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWiMo), held informally during the month of November. The goal is to start and finish a writing a novel during those 30 days.

",How to Write Murder Mysteries," The more you learn about them, the better. By watching murder mysteries as well as reading them you may gather some ideas about how murders are solved. Watching real life cop shows may also help. If you are serious about writing and can get the permission, it may be a good idea to shadow a detective team or at least ask them how murder investigations work.;
,, Sit down and think about the basic component of your murder mystery. Think of different scenarios: murder on a train, murder by stabbing, murder at a house, or even serial killings. Whatever inspires you, write it down. You've got to answer all these questions:


Who are the detectives?
Why were they murdered?

Who will be murdered? How was the person's life? Does anyone else get murdered too?
What will they be murdered with?

Does anyone discover about the murderer? Is information about the case released by the police, or is it kept a secret? How the victim's friends and family reacted to the news?

Who are the suspects? Did they have a relationship with the victim, the murderer or another suspect? What are their life stories?
Lastly, who was the murderer? What was his or her sentence after trial? How was their relationship with other existing character like? Do not make the murderer too obvious.

, Some writers like to write straight away but murder mysteries can get complicated so it might be a good idea to read your ideas again, and do some detailed planning. Make character profiles to remind you of who's who. Write down some lines, some phrases and some possible endings you could use.

, With your storyline in place you should write your story. This is the fun part where you can get creative.



Write the opener. This is basically introducing all the characters and the setting, then going into the action. A good idea for this part is where the suspects have a massive argument, one after the other, with the person who will soon be dead. This would swan the suspects into the reader's head.

Write the murder. Write this in huge detail. You should have so much detail that the reader would have a clear picture in their head. Does the person who's about to get killed see the murderer, or is he/she taken by surprise? Describe the victim's feelings right before he/she gets killed. Describe the setting of the murder. Try something like, The golden statue shone in the silver moonlight that came through the thick glass windows. Paul stared into the broken glass, his eyes not moving from the person's face as the statue came down on him. His piercing scream was stopped as the statue came next to his scarlet ear...


Write the discovery. Who finds the body? A suspect, or a random person? Is the murder weapon at the crime scene, or has it gone with the killer?

Now bring the suspects in. Does someone get arrested because they are suspected? Do one of the suspects stalk the police or does someone see the murder and start stalking the murderer?

The plot thickens! Is new evidence discovered? Has it been placed there on purpose? Are the police confused because they are being tricked? What's happening?

Get a couple of suspects ruled out. If the killed person had 12-20 suspects, rule it down to something like 9-16. If they had 7-17, get the suspects down to 6-15.

Thicken the plot even more! Add an unexpected twist. Does one of the suspects commit suicide? Does someone kill a suspect? Does one suspect come forward with fresh information about the murder? Add something else to throw the reader's off-track.

Rule the suspects down. By this point in the novel, there should only be about 3-4 suspects. Remember that whatever you do, don't make it predictable. Jumble it up so the reader can't guess quickly. A good idea is to make all of the suspects innocent, and there is a very unexpected person that is the murderer. That would be exciting and would throw your reader totally off-track!

Write the ending. Is it a cliffhanger? Is there a confession? It could still be a complete mystery, like this; ""It was me!"" A soft voice cried from behind the lamppost, then footsteps echoed off the stone walls as the mystery killer ran away for the last time...


, Read it through, and re-write it if you don't like it. Some books have been re-written many times. You may need some help with this, ask a fellow writer, friend, relative, or teacher to check your work, suggest improvements and to help make your work better. Adults are good at spotting mistakes like spelling and punctuation, especially in the writing of children. You can't take what they say to heart and you have to be harsh on your own work.


Make sure the word ""said"" isn't used to many times. It's appropriate to use ""said"" 6 times on one page. Also, you should only use ""and"" 9 times on one page.

",How to Write That Book You've Been Dying to Get Down on Paper," Preferably one that can close or has some clasp to control loose papers. Carry this notebook with you anywhere because you never know what could spark your inspiration. And if possible get that piece of inspiration somehow into your notebook. Through a picture, pamphlet, etc. Label sections and for easy navigation either you stick on tabs or sticky notes.;
, Don't make it too short but don't write out the entire book either. If you have some ideas or details make sure to jot them down in a section of your notebook.

, It might seem like homework at the end of the day but push through. Or if you really feel helpless about writing that day go somewhere with lots of inspiration for your specific story. For example if you are writing a book about skaters go to a skate park. This feels your brain with ideas and great notes to add later on. But be sure to write it down, photograph it or somehow find a way to be able to go back to the info you find that day.

, Then on the next day type up that chapter but also use this as a form of editing. So be careful not to always type word for word. If you don't specifically like how something sounds change it, change it, change it.

, Ask them to get a peek at and see how they like it. Every comment about your book is vital to you being published.

, Then read it like you were reading it for the first time. Sometimes you may think something is obvious when it truly is not apparent to the reader.

, Since a few missed place comas and a bunch of boring words could truly be ruining your story.

There are a lot of changes that come in life that can make people sad. Friendships and other relationships ending can cause sadness. The death of a loved one can also make someone sad. Sadness can also be caused by more minor events. Losing a family pet can be sad. Having to move to another city can be a cause of sadness. Consider what you think sadness is. What thoughts and emotions do you associate with sadness?
As you write, talk about your own personal experiences with sadness. For example, when in life did you feel the most sad? Why? You may be able to use experiences from your own life in a short story.;
, The best way to become a better writer is to read more. If you want to know how to write sad stories, you'll have to read a lot of stories with unhappy themes and plots.



Read sad stories. Ask your friends and teachers for recommendations for sad stories. As you read, do so actively. Pay attention to how writers build their stories and characters. How do the stories start? How do they end? Why do you have an emotional response to these stories? Ask yourself these questions as you read.
Pay attention to what works in these stories. When writing a short story, you only have a short period of time to get your reader's attention. As you read short stories, pay attention to opening lines. How does the writer get your attention? Where does the story start? Many short stories may start when some of the important actions or events have already occurred. Authors may recount such events in flashbacks or imply them through means like character dialogue.

, If you want to write a story, you'll need to know basic story structure. Stories are made up of exposition, rising action, a climax, falling action, and a resolution. The first parts of the story come with exposition and rising action.


Your exposition comes at the beginning of the story. This is where you explain who the main character is and what he or she is doing at the beginning of the story. Exposition should be brief and grab the reader's attention.A story's rising action is the series of conflicts that move the story forward. No story can exist without a problem that needs resolving. In a sad story, there should be an element of tragedy to that problem. For example, maybe your main character is caring for her sick dog. The rising action could include her taking the dog to the vet, finding out the sickness is worse than she thought, and struggling with the setbacks and challenges of her dog's medical needs., Once you've figured out basic story structure, write a short outline for your story. Write out how your story will begin, what rising action you'll include, the climax, and how the story is resolved.


An outline can be brief. It's not necessary to use full sentences in an outline. You just need to have some sense of the basic events that will occur. You can separate your outline into the five elements of story structure: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution.
An outline should use numbers and letters for structure. Big headings, like ""exposition,"" can be marked with a roman numeral. You can use letters or regular numbers to elaborate on aspects of that heading. For example, ""I. Exposition, a. introduce Susan.""
To help you see how to write an outline, let's return to this article's example. You could begin the outline with something like this: ""Exposition, a. Introduce Ada, crying in art class, b. Sad to be reminded of her father's cancer, c. Returns home alone (her mother is at work) to help care for her ailing dog.""

, An opening line is a vital part of a short story. A good opening line should grab the reader's attention instantly. Readers should go into the story curious, wanting to continue reading.


A good first line should establish a strong voice and offer some hint as to what is to come in the story. If you're writing a story centering around themes of sadness, it's important to hint at this in your opening line.If you're stuck, read a few opening lines from your favorite sad stories. You can also Google search something like, ""Most memorable opening lines."" Read through a variety of opening lines and examine how they function. Why are they successful? Why do you want to keep reading?
Take a look at this article's example. In this story, Ada has to eventually accept her dog's death. Let's say her father died of cancer and it's difficult for her to deal with loss. Write an opening line that conveys a sense of coming loss, while also emphasizing past sorrows. For example, ""Ada did not mean to start crying during Mr. Cheny's lecture, but she couldn't help but feel that loss was following her everywhere.""

, Readers are more inclined to be emotionally moved by strong relationships. This makes sense. Everyone has people in life they are close to. When a story deals heavily with relationships between characters, a reader may experience a stronger emotional reaction.


Show how your characters are close. They can finish each other's sentences, help each other without question, and comfort each other during bad times.In this article's example, there are three main characters: Ada, her mother, and her dog. You could write scenes of Ada tenderly caring for her dog, showing how much she loves him. You could also show that's she close to her mother. Ada and her mother could joke lovingly with each other. A brief flashback to Ada's father's funeral could reveal Ada helping her mother cope in the aftermath.

, As you progress through your story, engage with rising action. Build up to the sad event. People are unlikely to be moved by sadness without buildup. If you're not emotionally invested in a character or a situation, you're unlikely to feel sad when reading a story.


Each scene in a story should move it forward in some way. Refer to your outline when in doubt. What is your climax? How can you get your characters to this climax? In this article's example, the dog could have a seizure and need to be rushed to the vet. Ada learns the dog's cancer has spread to the brain. Do not just focus on the actions. Pay attention to the emotional story at play. Ada will eventually argue with her mother. You can show her mother gently trying to help Ada brace for the worst case scenario and Ada resisting.As you write these scenes, think about the heart of your story. What is the main point or realization for your characters? Each scene should build up to this point. In our example, Ada may have to accept death is part of life. Try to emphasize inevitable death and decay in each scene., Once you've written the falling action, focus on your climax. This is the height of action in your story. Try to write a climax that is intense without feeling forced or melodramatic.


Remember the character's hopes and dreams at this point. This can help you see what is at stake here. In this moment, what is the character fighting for? What will happen if he or she fails?The best stories have a moment of discovery. This should be somewhat universal. Your character will discover something about herself or her situation that can point to a universal theme or message.In this article's example, the climax is when Ada and her mother fight about having the dog put to sleep. On the surface, what's at stake is the dog's life. On a deeper level, Ada's sense of purpose is at stake. Helping the dog gives her a sense of control over the inevitability of death. A larger realization here could be that accepting death is part of life. Perhaps Ada's mother could say something along these lines during their fight.
Levels can benefit sad stories in many ways. In addition to making sad moments feel more intense, readers crave theme and character development. A reader may be more moved by a sad story if he or she feels they learned something along the way.

, Once you've written your climax, it's time to end your story. A story's ending should offer some kind of resolution to the action. A reader should feel satisfied by the ending, even if it's unhappy. You should not leave your reader with any lingering questions or concerns.


You need to build up to your ending with falling action. This is what leads to your conclusion. The main character should make peace with his or her fate. All scenes after the climax should lead to a resolution, serving to lessen the tension rather than build it up. In our example, Ada could have a good cry and then tell her mother she's ready to accept her dog's death.
A sad story does not necessarily have to have a sad ending. However, it may feel inauthentic to have things suddenly turn around for your character. If you want to give a sad story a happy ending, make sure you build up to this point. In our example, do not have it suddenly turn out the dog is okay after all. This is not realistic. Instead, maybe it could end a few months in the future. While Ada misses her dog, she has moved on with a new puppy.

, Melodrama is a common pitfall in sad stories. You do not want your readers to feel like you're trying to force sympathy for your characters. Avoid overwriting tragic descriptions or emotional dialogue. This is often where melodrama creeps in.


Melodrama can sometimes be hard to spot, especially if you're invested in a story. In the first draft, you may be desperate to get everything out on the page. It's okay, and even helpful, to overwrite in your first draft. However, when you read your work over for revision, be very strict with yourself.
Eliminate any bit of description or dialogue that isn't absolutely vital. Often, less is more when writing a sad scene. If you're describing Ada's dog dying, maybe you could describe this in only one or two sentences. This allows the audience to experience the moment on their own. A certain perspective will not be forced on them.Thinks of your audience's larger perspective, as well. In our modern world, sad stories are all too common. People are at a point where they may be somewhat numb to tragedy that feels generic. There are many stories on the news about death and disease. Zooming in on the emotions of a particular character can help you avoid melodrama. Yes, losing a pet is sad, but why is your character specifically sad? What unique brand of sadness does she feel?, People are often resentful of work that's tragic for the sake of tragedy. People appreciate good storytelling, character development, humor, and dialogue. Remember, your story and your characters come first. The tragedies they experience come second.


Really get inside your characters' heads. Establish backstories for your characters that are unrelated to the tragic events they face. Give characters believable personality traits, likes, dislikes, and other quirks. A character should not be defined solely by bad events.
Make tragedy feel organic to the story. Do not have the protagonist's mother suddenly drop dead, despite having shown no previous signs of illness. This will feel like a cheap ploy to garner sympathy. If you plan on killing off a character, offer some hints first. Maybe that character is nervous after a doctor's appointment, for example.

, A story that's too heavily invested in tragedy can rub readers the wrong way. Many incredibly sad stories offer a great deal of levity along the way. For example, John Green's bestseller The Fault In Our Stars includes a lot of humor while telling a very sad story. The film Steel Magnolias is famous for its fusion of laughter and tears. Look at these works for inspiration on how to use humor.

, As you revise, you'll want to increase the sadness in the story. Comb through your work and look for ways you can increase the emotional intensity. One way to make sad moments sadder is to remind readers of better times.


What makes sad moments upsetting is how much they contrast to happier times. This sharp contrast is often jarring. It can strike an emotional chord with readers.When describing a sad scene, add a throwback to a happier moment of your story. For example, say in an earlier scene Ada's dog could make a gurgling noise that sounded like, ""Hello."" This made Ada and her mother laugh. In a later scene, when the dog is on his deathbed, it could make that noise again. A previous happy noise is now tainted with a sad moment., Spend some time reviewing a character's good qualities. People will be more moved by tragedies if the characters involved made a positive impact on others. You can add a few sentences as a character is dying, for example, briefly reminding the reader of the positive impact he had. In our example, you could write something like, ""Riley wagged his tail at Ada, still the loving and loyal dog he'd always been."", A good way to help enhance sadness in a story is to link your tragedies. Make connections between different sad and traumatic moments. This adds extra emotional impact.In our example, you could easily draw a parallel between Ada's dog's death and her father's death. Ada could feel sad that, once again, she's failed to stop the inevitable. This will make readers feel for the character. She has gone through a lot.

Designate a writing area in your space.,
Limit any distractions.,
Change your environment if you get stuck.",How to Keep Momentum when Writing1," You can maintain your writing momentum by setting aside a specific space for writing in your home or at school. You may designate a certain area as your writing spot, such as at a desk in your room or at a table in your living room. Look for a spot where you can focus and feel productive.You may also designate an area at school for writing, such as a desk in your school library or a bench in a park by your school.
You may try setting aside a space for writing at work, such as at your desk during your lunch break or early in the morning before everyone else gets to work.;
, A big element of having a productive space is limiting distractions around you. You may need to shut your window to block out distracting noises like construction outside or the sounds of a busy city. You also might have to shut your door to get away from other people in your space. Do what you need to do to minimize distractions so you can focus and continue writing.You may try shutting off your wifi connection and putting your phone on mute so you are not distracted by social media or calls from others.

, If you find yourself having a mental block when you are writing, you may try a change of environment. Consider going outside and sitting on a bench if you tend to write inside all the time. Or switch to a different spot in your home or at school to see if you can be more productive in a different space. Changing up your environment can sometimes help you stay focused and keep writing.You may also try adjust elements in your environment to change it up. This may mean shutting your blinds if you tend to keep them open or moving your computer to a different side of your desk. Making a small adjustment to your writing space can help you feel more focused.

Hook the reader with a great first sentence.,
Discuss briefly what you'll be talking about the rest of the essay.,
Transition to your thesis.,
Don't make these mistakes when writing your thesis.,
If necessary, transition from the thesis to the first body paragraph.",How to Write Introductions2," Your first sentence should draw the reader in and make them want to read more. If your sentence is uninteresting or clichéd, the person reading your essay may not be motivated to continue. Set the tone right from the beginning with a stellar hook.


Ask a question. A great question will make the reader want to stick around to hear the answer.

Example: ""What do dolphins and military fighter jets have in common?""


Lead with a great fact or statistic. A great fact or statistic will put the discussion of what you're writing about into context.

Example: ""The Golden Gate Bridge is continuously painted, 365 days a year. That's 50,000 gallons (189,270.6 L) of paint per coat.""


Use a quotation. A quotation from a famous (or infamous) person might pique the reader if they know something about him or her.

Example: ""Machiavelli once wrote: 'Never was anything grand achieved without danger.'""


Define a keyword or phrase. If a keyword or phrase you're using is uncommon, specific, or technical, you may want to define it first.

Example: ""Merriam-Webster defines tenacity as 'a persistence in maintaining, adhering to, or seeking something valued or desired.'""



, After your hook, and perhaps one or two sentences about your hook, you'll want to briefly explain what it is that your essay will touch upon. This will give the reader a roadmap, or guide, that they'll be able to use as they continue on reading.


You don't have to come out and say ""This essay is about x"" if you don't want to. You can frame this summary briefly and elegantly without saying that's what you're doing.

Example: ""Early American settlers experienced a wide variety of diseases in the 17th century. These diseases led them to experiment with home-grown medicines.""


Don't give away every single detail in your brief summary. It's called a brief summary for a reason. You want to tell the reader enough without giving away every significant fact or theme of your essay.

, Your thesis is probably the most important part of the introduction. Your thesis is your argument boiled down to one sentence. If someone were to ask you to describe your position using only one sentence, you'd tell them your thesis. Here are two examples of a thesis statement:


""So-called 'gap years' are becoming increasingly necessary for good reason: they allow young students to experience grown-up responsibilities in an atmosphere of fun before going to college, where learning these skills can be difficult.""
""E. B. White's Charlotte's Web argues strongly that women deserve to have equal rights and input into society's decisions as men, even if the characters in the book are animals.

, Your thesis is your most important introductory sentence, so you want to be sure it's formatted the right way and doesn't contain any of the following common mistakes:


Your thesis is not a fact or observation. Your thesis should take a stand; it is an argument that someone could could argue against.
Your thesis isn't written as a list, as a question, or as a springboard to talk about something else. Your thesis is focused on a single idea, or argument of ideas, and is a statement.
Unless given permission to do so, your thesis should never be put in the first-person (contain the word ""I,"" as in ""I think..."").

, Usually, your thesis will be the last sentence in your introduction. This isn't always the case, however. Sometimes, you'll have a sentence or two after your thesis, as a way of transitioning from the introduction to your body paragraph.


Example: ""After elephants received widespread environmental protection in key parts of Africa, their numbers started significantly growing.""

"
"
Start off with your hook.,
Don't be afraid to get really personal.,
Know that a personal essay won't necessary contain a traditional thesis.",How to Write Introductions3," As mentioned above, your hook can pretty much be whatever you want it to — especially in a personal essay — as long as it sets the scene and touches on what the essay is going to be about. You might find some of the following hooks to be profitable starting points or examples to you in your introduction:


""I was walking down our driveway when disaster struck.""
""Though she wouldn't know it at the time, my mother was poised to make a far-reaching political statement on the morning of June 4th, 1976, without even saying a word.""
""I've made a few mistakes in my young life, but none of them ended up teaching me as much as when I first disobeyed the law.""

, Personal essays are powerful because we share information in them that often isn't shared. This can be anything from a phobia to a love affair. Don't be afraid to provide that sort of information in your intro if it has to do with the story you're telling. Without sharing too much, give your side of the story while staying true to what happened and being honest. Remember to cite any information that you use to a website.

, Although your introduction might contain a thesis of sorts, it won't ever look like a thesis you put into an expository essay or an argumentative essay. And that's okay. Your personal essay introduction may just be a story, or an explanation of events. As long as it helps tell your story, or gives some helpful background information that will play a part in the story later, your introduction does not need to contain a traditional thesis.

Know the difference between an abstract and an introduction.,
Briefly explain the experiment.,
Explain the experiment's objectives.,
Provide any theoretical predictions for what the results will yield, if applicable.",How to Write Introductions4," An abstract is a summary of the experiment. It assumes that the reader knows something about the subject area, but has not read the paper itself. It should be around 200 words.An introduction, meanwhile, details the type of experiment, its objects and importance, along with general background information needed to understand the experiment. It has nothing to do with the findings of the experiment.

, Whether you're working on temperature models, DNA/RNA replication, or plate-tectonics, a good introduction adequately explains what the experiment is going to be about. A great introduction will make it clear which factors will determine whether the experiment is going to be successful.

, What do you aim to figure out by undertaking this experiment? These objectives should be related to, but not synonymous with, your hypothesis. Your objectives will be analyzed in your conclusion, and are therefore extremely important to be clear about.

, It may be helpful to list any theoretical predictions for what the experiment might yield, especially if your experiment resulted in a groundbreaking finding. This provides a contrast between what's expected and what is actually true.

"
"
Start off with a declaration.,
If possible, plug your thesis into your introduction.,
Situate the work in its literary or filmic context, if necessary.",How to Write Introductions5," This declaration can be about the work itself, or a conclusion you've come to about the theme or significance of the piece. A declaration has the benefit of sounding authoritative and should grab the reader's attention. Some examples of good declarative first sentences:


""There is such a thing as too much beauty in a film, as Terrance Malick's The Tree of Life illustrates.""

, Your thesis will be an analysis and presentation of the artistic work you are reviewing. Broadly speaking, you can endorse or reject an artistic work, or choose to avoid giving a general verdict and instead focus on painting a picture. Because many film review readers, however, expect a verdict of the film you are reviewing, it's best to at least mention that in the introduction if you do plan on offering one.

, Many readers of serious artistic review expect critics to put the piece(s) of art being written into a literary or filmic context. What does this mean? This means talking about what other books or movies influenced it, whether it firmly owes to one artistic movement, or whether it has any political aspirations, for example. Many readers appreciate this fitting into a framework to at least begin to happen in the introduction.

"
"
Determine when you will write.,
Create a writing schedule.,
Set daily writing targets.,
Adjust the schedule as needed.",How to Keep Momentum when Writing2," To maintain momentum, it is important that you first identify when you are going to sit down and write. This could be at night after dinner or in the morning before work. You may also try writing on your one hour lunch break. Try to write at least once a day, even for a few minutes a day, so it becomes a habit. Having a set time for writing can help you stay motivated and build momentum, especially when you feel you are writing something worthwhile.You may try writing when you are at your most productive so you can get more work done. If you are a morning person, you may try writing in the mornings before work or school. If you are more of a night owl, you may write at night after work or school.

, Once you have decided when you are going to write, you should create a writing schedule that accounts for every day of the week. Put the times you are planning to write into the writing schedule and be specific.


For example, you may put in your schedule: “Monday: Working on Chapter 4” or “Wednesday evening: Polishing the love scene.” Specifying when you are writing and what you are going to write about can help you stay focused.
You may also include mini breaks in your writing schedule so you have a chance to stretch, get up, and walk around. You may plan for ten minutes breaks for every hour you write, for example, to help your brain recharge and to allow you to come back to your writing with fresh eyes.

, You should add writing targets to your writing schedule so you can stay on track and build on your momentum day by day. You may have writing targets based on page count or based on word count. You may also break your writing into chunks and set targets around completing certain chunks or sections. Add these targets to your writing schedule so you know what you are working on day to day.For example, you may put in your schedule: “Monday: Chapter 4, 500 words” or “Wednesday evening: Love scene, 20 pages.”

, Though you want to get into the habit of sticking to a writing schedule to build momentum in your writing and keep it, sometimes you may need to adjust it. Be willing to be flexible and adjust the schedule if you are feeling overwhelmed by your own deadlines or if you feel you are farther along in your project than you planned.


For example, perhaps you notice you have completed several chapters of your novel in a shorter amount of time than you planned in your writing schedule. You may then adjust your writing schedule so you tackle other chapters in the days or weeks ahead.

"
"
Use a timer.,
Do a freewrite if you get stuck.,
Reward yourself for completing your work.,
Do not get distracted.,
Find a writing partner.",How to Keep Momentum when Writing3," You can stay focused on your writing and maintain your momentum by using a timer when you write. Set the timer for a specific amount of time when you start writing and then continue writing until the timer goes off. Try not to stop writing or get distracted when the timer is running.You may shut off the timer during mini breaks to give yourself some time away from your writing. This way, when you come back to your writing, you can turn the timer back on and focus.

, If you feel your momentum stalling, you may try doing a freewrite to stay on track. You may use an existing writing prompt for the freewrite or create your own prompt. Time the freewrite and try to write for the entire time in response to the prompt. This will allow you to let your ideas flow and stay focused on the topic of the freewrite.For example, maybe you are stuck on how to describe a setting. You may then do a freewrite about walking through the setting to help you gain some momentum and have a better sense of the space. You could then use lines in your freewrite to describe the setting in your story.

, You can motivate yourself to maintain your momentum and get work done by using a system of rewards. You may reward yourself with a small treat once you have reached a writing goal or completed a written piece by a certain deadline. You may also penalize yourself if you do not finish writing something within a set goal or timeframe. Using a system of rewards and penalties can help you stay focused and capitalize on your momentum.


For example, you may reward yourself for completing a draft of a chapter within a week by having a nice meal with a friend or by going for a walk outside to your favorite park. If you fail to complete the draft, you may penalize yourself by missing a friend's get-together or by staying in and reading instead of socializing.

, You may find yourself surrounded by distractions, despite your attempts to remove yourself from others. You may be briefly interrupted by your child, your partner, or a friend calling you on the phone. Try to block out these distractions or address them quickly and then get back to your work. You do not want distractions to break your momentum and get in the way of your work.


For example, if you have a child who tends to distract you when you are working, you may say, ""I am working right now. Can you go play on your own in your room for a little while? Once I'm done, we can hang out.""

, If you find yourself losing momentum when you are writing, you may want to try writing with someone else. Having a writing partner can help you to stay focused and feel supported by someone other than yourself. You can also share your ideas with your writing partner and encourage each other to keep writing.You may also consider joining a writing group to help you maintain your momentum as a writer. You can then workshop your work with the group and encourage each other to explore different ideas or approaches to writing.

,How to Write an Obituary1,
"
Do the research and analysis.,
Brainstorm a thesis.,
Make an outline.,
Develop your introduction.,
Build the body.,
End with a strong conclusion.,
Know what your teaching is looking for.,
Check for grammar and content errors.,
Use transitions.,
Write in the third-person present tense.,
Do not summarize or plagiarize.",How to Write a Paper," Begin the process by researching a topic you have chosen. Take notes as you find interesting points and follow what interests you.


The research you find will be used as your sources, so make sure they're legitimate and can be shown to your teacher.
Utilize the internet, books, and various academic databases to find solid primary and secondary sources.

If you've chosen a topic that isn't quite amounting up to what you thought it would, it's still early. Pick something else that you may find easier to write about.



, This paper is all about you. As you do your research, what questions do you find yourself asking? What patterns are you noticing? What are you own reactions and observations? Delve into yourself to find your thesis--the string that ties it all together.


A good thesis will succinctly express the main idea of your paper in one or two sentences. It should also:

Touch on all the points made in your paper
Explain the significance of your argument
Be logically sound
Appear at the end of the introductory paragraph



, This should organize your thoughts and be a skeleton of your points. Don't worry about citing examples now, simply plan out how you want your paper to flow. It'll save you loads of time in the long run.


Write down what points come from where. Finding information a second time can be like finding a needle in a haystack.
Organize your outline to address the introduction, body, and conclusion. Bring in the reader and state your thesis in the intro, support your reasoning in the body, and wrap it all up at the end.

, Think of your paper as a sandwich--the introduction is the first piece of bread. In the first paragraph, the reader's attention should be grabbed and your thesis made.


Introduce the topic in which you will be talking about. Start with a relevant quotation, intriguing question, or by addressing the counterargument.
Make sure that your thesis statement is clearly stated and leads into your paper. The reader should have a fairly good idea by the end of this first paragraph what they are about to be a part of.

, This is the ""meat"" of the sandwich: the part where the true argument and taste of your paper lies. It should be three paragraphs long, all addressing a different, yet related, point.


Make sure each point is logically sound and adds weight to your thesis. A topic sentence (generally the first sentence, but not always) should clearly say what this point is. Be sure to attack it from all sides--in the sentences that follow, have you given clear evidence from a number of views? Back up your assertions with multiple sources.
Follow the same format for each paragraph. The spotlight should dote on each point separately, allowing you time to argue in favor of it. How does it relate to your thesis? Are you leaving anything out?

Three paragraphs is standard for the traditional 5-paragraph paper. If your paper is longer, support your points as need be.
If your points aren't all equally strong, sandwich your weakest point in the middle.



, This is the ""bottom bun,"" the last paragraph in your paper. All you need to do in this paragraph is bring your paper to a close, restate what you have already mentioned in the opening statement, and leave the reader feeling satisfied.


End on a memorable thought, quotation, or call to action. Or, if your paper calls for it, allude to the consequences of your thesis if left unaddressed. What should the reader walk away thinking or wanting to do?

, They've probably said it in class 5 different times, but if anything is foggy, ask.


Do they want your paper in MLA or APA format?
Are they a stickler for third person?
What's their take on page numbers and margins?
How many sources do they require? Are there sources that are unacceptable?

, You've been going over this paper for so long it may be difficult to truly see it in all its glory. Take a break for a bit, go back, and read it twice.


It's a good idea to get someone else to go over it for you. Your writing may be clear to you but difficult to understand for someone else. What's more, have them go over punctuation and grammar as well--you may have read it so many times you stopped noticing.

, An easy way to make your paper flow is to incorporate transitions even within points. Show the logical connections between your ideas.


Transitions make it clear that one paragraph flows into the other. What's more, your topic sentences should ease into the evidence effortlessly.

There are dozens to chose from, but here is a short list: in the first place, comparatively, likewise, coupled with, in addition, in the light of, by the same token, etc.



, Though once in a while a certain teacher will tell you it's appropriate not to, the majority of papers should be written in present day third-person. This means never using the word ""I.""


Use the present tense regardless of the time period you are referring to. Your paper is making a point that is relevant now. Instead of, ""Ralph and Piggy struggled for order and democracy,"" it should be, ""Ralph and Piggy struggle for order and democracy.""
If you feel weight could be added to your argument by using ""I"" statements, ask your teacher if he/she is okay with it. They very well may be.

, The first will result in a fail and the second will result in a fail. Whatever you do, avoid these two things.


A paper that summarizes is not your own work. Your teacher is looking for something coming from you--some idea that would not be found in another reader. Because of that, you cannot (within reason) be wrong. Stand by your opinion and use it to create a unique thesis all your own.
If you plagiarize, your teacher will know. Each person writes differently and your paper will be interrupted by the change of style. If you're thinking about plagiarizing the entire thing, know that all teachers have access to sources that identify this in addition to being able to recognize when it's not your style of writing.

Remain courteous and professional.",How to Write a Letter Asking for a Refund," What can the company do to make the situation better for you? Are they obliged to remedy the situation by giving you a refund, replacing the product, or providing an alternative service? Ensure that your complaint is legitimate before proceeding to write the actual letter.


Be sure to check out the warranties and guarantees that come with the particular product. For example, if you have a warranty on a product and you damaged the product, you may still be able to get a refund or a replacement. However, if you are responsible for damaging a product (such as dropping it on the floor) and it did not come with a warranty, you may just have to chalk it up as a loss and move on.
If the purchase you are dissatisfied with required at-home assembly (such as furniture), check that you’ve followed all the instructions. In some cases, it may be that you missed a step and simply haven’t set it up correctly. You can also call customer service for assistance regarding this.
If a product is sold “as-is” it will be difficult or impossible to get a refund as the consumer assumes all the risks that may come with purchases marked “as-is.”;
, Once you’ve ascertained that a letter of complaint is necessary, you must find out who to write your complaint to. If there is a specific department or person who handles complaints, you want to be sure your complaint goes directly to them to ensure prompt attention.


If you are requesting a refund from a large company, you should call customer service first and tell them your concerns. If they are not able to satisfactorily handle your complaint, request the name of the appropriate person or department and mailing address for your letter.
If you are dealing with a smaller company or store, look on the receipt or purchase order to find contact information. Send your letter to the person or address that is listed on the receipt. If there is no information on your receipt, call the store or check the website for information about refunds and returns.
If you are looking for contact information online, you can typically find a customer service number at the bottom of the website page or by clicking a link that says “Contact Us” or “Contact Information.” Websites also typically have a search bar at the top of the page, so you can search for “customer service” or “contact information.”

, In order to maximize the chances of having your concerns adequately addressed, you should gather as much documentation as possible to include with your letter.


Provide copies of all receipts, invoices, purchase orders or other supporting documents. The documents should list the date of purchase, cost of the merchandise or service, and payment information.
If you already spoke with customer service and they were unable to solve your problem, write down their name as well as the date and time of the call. You can then include this information in your letter as proof that you already tried to resolve the situation but had to resort to writing a letter of complaint.

, Reading other sample letters of complaint will give you an idea of how to format your letter and they can also give you an idea of persuasive phrasing that you can use to your advantage.


You can browse the Internet for sample letters. Below is one example, but remember this is only a template and you should write your own letter that details your specific situation.

Return address and date
To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing regarding the lamp I purchased through your website. I have bought other household items through your website and have always been pleased with your prompt shipping and the quality of past items. However, upon receiving this particular order, I found that the stand of the lamp missing and therefore could not properly set up my lamp. I would like to request a full refund or an exchange for a functioning lamp. I have bought other products through your website in the past and have always been a satisfied customer up until now. Attached is my proof of purchase. I trust that you will respond to this matter promptly. Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
John Doe



, Even if you are upset, you should begin your letter on a positive note. You could note that you are a loyal customer or that you have appreciated their services in the past. Anger tends to be counterproductive and the veiled threat of losing an otherwise satisfied customer will often motivate the company to address your complaint.


One approach could be “praising with faint damn” or praising first and then complaining second.For example, you could start your letter by saying “As a long term customer of your business, I am usually impressed with your services. Unfortunately, I can no longer say this is the case as the last service I received was extremely unsatisfactory.”
If you’re a first time customer, you could start by stating a positive aspect of the product or service or by emphasizing your excitement. An example opening line is: “I was excited to try out your services” or “Your product was recommended by several friends but I was ultimately disappointed.”

, This step is especially important if you are writing to a larger business that may have trouble identifying your particular transaction. Important information may include order numbers, customer identifications or numbers, or names of the people you spoke with.


Keep all receipts, emails, or any other evidence of past interactions as the company may ask for these materials to move forward in addressing your complaint. Whenever you speak to a customer service representative, be sure to ask for and write down their name so that you can reference them in your letter as further proof of the steps you took prior to writing the letter.

, Provide details about your dissatisfaction with the purchase or overall experience. Write about any unexpected difficulties or damage to the merchandise.


For example, instead of just writing that you received a damaged item, explain exactly how the item was damaged and also clarify why the damage is not your fault. That way, you can preemptively ward off any attempts from the company to blame you for causing the damage.

A sample description could be: “I opened the package containing my purchase and found that pieces of it had broken off as there was no styrofoam or other packing material to protect the item during shipment.”


If you are complaining about never having received an item or an incomplete service, add any details you can think of that make it clear why the company is at fault. For example, you could write, “I was told to be home during the hours of 12 and 6 pm, yet the servicemen never arrived and I was still charged for the service. I should not be expected to pay for a service that I never received.”

, Clearly state if you want a refund, replacement, or whatever else you consider to be proper compensation. Making your expectations clear will help the company know what they can do to make you a satisfied customer.


In writing about their dissatisfaction, many people tend to forget to ask for specific compensation in their letters. Remember that your ultimate goal is to receive compensation, not just to vent.

, Keep in mind that some companies may take longer to respond, particularly if it’s a smaller company that doesn’t have a specific department that handles customer complaints.


Some larger companies may have written policies on their website to let you know how long you should expect to wait for a response. However, if you can’t find any information about what a reasonable wait time is, try calling customer service or the business owners (if it’s a smaller business). If you cannot get in touch with anyone, expect to wait anywhere between two weeks to a month for a response.

, You’ll want to close the letter with a brief statement re-emphasizing your interest in reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution. Keep the letter as direct and short as possible (one page is ideal) as companies may ignore overly long letters.Use the law to your advantage. One way to close your letter is by reminding the company of your rights as a consumer. One increasingly recognized consumer right is the right to be heard, meaning that the concerns and interests of consumers must be heard and protected.Reminding the company that you have the law on your side will encourage them to address your concern quickly and satisfactorily to avoid a potential legal battle.
A possible conclusion to your letter could be: “Given that I received a brand new item in a broken/unsatisfactory state through no fault of my own, I expect a prompt and full refund. As a consumer, it is my legal right to receive what I purchased in working condition and, if that does not occur, for my payment to be fully refunded.”

, Dating your letter and including a return address along with account numbers and any other useful information is crucial. If you fail to provide enough information, the company may have no way of responding to you.When signing the letter, write your full phone number, email address and home address below. That way the company will have no excuse to not get in touch with you in the manner that is most convenient for them.

, Formal letters include contact information, a formal salutation and a professional tone.




When closing the letter, write “Sincerely,” “Best Regards,” or a similarly formal statement before writing your name.
Don’t include any postscripts, which are generally only appropriate in informal letters. Also, any information you need to convey should already be in the body of the letter so a postscript should be unnecessary.



, The longer you wait, the less likely the company is to address your complaint. Write and send your letter as soon as you decide you are dissatisfied with the transaction or delivery of products or services.

, You can refer back to this copy when speaking with the company to finalize any agreements.


If you receive a form letter in response, don’t give up. Instead call customer service or whoever you spoke to prior to writing the letter to let them know you are not happy with their stock response and that you would like them to re-assess your complaint. Sometimes companies expect customers to just give up once they receive a form letter, but if you continue to raise a fuss, they will take your concern more seriously.

, If you don’t immediately get the result you want, don’t let your frustration get the better of you. Being sarcastic or angry will only make whoever you are communicating with less eager to help resolve the issue."

Start by introducing your topic.,
Consider mapping out the direction your research paper will take.,
Include your thesis in a clear spot.",How to Write Introductions6," Research papers can come from science or the Humanities, so whatever your topic is about, narrow it down a bit to give the readers of your paper a clue about what part of the sciences or Humanities you'll be focusing on. Some examples could include:


""Dedicated scholars have been studying language and culture in parallel ever since the connection between the two was first established.""
""Throughout the 20th century, our views of life on other planets has drastically changed.""

, If your research paper is complex and deals with a lot of different material, it could be helpful to spell out in your introduction where you research paper will go for the rest of the paper. This will help the reader structure the basic argument of your research paper before s/he reads it, ultimately making it easier to understand.

, Usually toward the end, include a clear thesis that is supported by evidence if possible. Because research papers rely on evidence so heavily, putting this front and center will help bolster your argument.

Think about how the object exists.,
Recollect your past experiences with it.,
Stop thinking of it as an 'inanimate' object.,
Brainstorm by talking out loud ""with"" the object.,
Write in first person, past tense.,
Give yourself a fictional name, or be yourself in the autobiography.,
Write about the experiences it had with its own life.,
Make sure the writing includes dialogue.,
Give it some personality.,
Revise your work.,
Submit your work, to your teacher, or to a publishing house.",How to Write Fictional Autobiographies of Inanimate Objects," Ponder on how the object came into existence, and how it existed all these days. Here, the example of a pencil is used.


Consider if you want to tell the reader about how the pencil was born. Sentences like 'I call the tree in Jacob's garden my mother, because Jacob made me from its branch' go well if you choose to describe how it was born.
If you do not want to do it, you can just let the pencil tell about its experiences without bothering about birth.;
, Perhaps you poked your friend with the pencil, or wrote an amazing story with it.


In the autobiography, the pencil will be writing about its experiences with you.
If no memory comes to your mind, try 'inventing' a memory. For example, you might just invent something like 'I always sat in a neat pencil case because my owner Agatha is a neat freak', even though your pencil case was smelly and dirty! It is fiction, after all.

, Try to put yourself in its shoes, and think about how you would've felt if you had been the pencil.


Give it a name. You can invent a fancy name and surname, or give it a normal name.
Give preference to a made-up name, as it intensifies your object's personality,

, The conversation would be rather one-sided, but you might find interesting answers to the questions you asked it, even if you answer them yourself.

,


Your pencil is old, as it is writing an autobiography, so the entries have to be in past tense.
Make sure that you do not use third person to write, as then it will be a biography.

,

Entries like 'Mary looked after me well, but she always pressed me onto the page as she wrote, thus breaking my lead often' show the name of the pencil's owner.
Exaggerate your experiences. Instead of writing 'John put me in a smelly box', write 'John shoved me into a box with the most disgusting smell imaginable!'. This will give the writing a sort of life

, Let it grumble about how clueless its owner had been, or how a young eraser once cheeked it.


You can also write about the bad times it faced, the mistakes it made, and how it learned from it. This depends on whether you plan to keep the autobiography light and merry, or deep and philosophical.

, The autobiography should look 'real' and convincing, not like you sat down and forced it out.


The pencil can talk to anyone, like it can discuss things with the eraser, or fight with the ruler. Let your imagination go wild!

, You might want to add some wisdom here and there. Your pencil may be old, after all, and is wise! Or you can also show how young and immature an old pencil behaves by writing about unreasonable grumbles, and how it heard a pen saying to a sharpener how bad it is to be living with the pencil.

See if you want to put the pencil as the good character, or as a bad character, or as a normal one.
Include some funny moments, even if you want the autobiography to be rather serious.

, Check for spelling and grammar errors. Make sure that your character is portrayed in the way you want it to be.

Also, check that you write in first person, past tense. Writing in third person makes it a biography, not an autobiography, and past tense signifies the past experiences of your pencil.

, If the work is short, you might make it a part of a collection of short stories."

Make arrangements to print the obituary.,
Read other obituaries.,
Write down the basic information about the deceased.,
Write down some additional information.",How to Write an Obituary2," Before you start writing your obituary, you should make sure that the obituary will be printed in the local paper and you have all the information. Many funeral homes offer a printed obituary in the newspaper as part of the funeral package, so if that's the case, you'll need to call the funeral home if you need more information; if not, you should call your local newspaper. Here's what you need to know:


The cost. Most papers charge by the inch, but the word count can vary based on the paper's font and column width, so you should ask how many words are in an inch.
The deadline. Most papers have a 4 or 5 p.m. deadline for obituaries, though some make exceptions because it's a delicate subject. But be careful about handing in your obituary too long after the deadline, because that may mean that the editors don't have as much time to proofread and finalize your work.
The date it will be printed. You'll want the obituary to be printed as soon as possible so you can not only announce the death in a timely manner but also let everyone know where and when the funeral will take place.
If you'd like the obituary to run in papers other than the local papers, such as national papers if the person was notable, or other local papers in a town where your loved one spent a lot of his life, then you should call those newspapers as well.

, Pick up the local paper that will be printing your obituary and read as many obituaries as you can. This will give you a better sense of what a typical obituary looks like, and will also let you see if the newspaper has a certain style; it can be more formal or more free-flowing than the average paper.


Though there is a format for obituaries, it would help to see if your paper diverges from this format a bit or if it sticks to it rigidly, so you can match your obituary to the other ones you see. You still have some room to write what you want, but if your obituary falls outside the style guidelines of the paper, your work will be heavily edited.

, Before you write your obituary, you should write down some basic information about the person so you know what you'll have to include once you start putting the facts in sentence form. Here are some basic things to include in almost any obituary:


First and last name
Age
Birth date
Residence (city and state)
Partner's name
When and where the funeral, viewing, wake, or memorial service will take place

If you don't know when the funeral will take place yet, you can write the name of the funeral home so people can contact the home for more information. If you plan on running the obituary more than once, you can include this information the next time if you know it then.



, After you've written down the basics, you can write down some additional information about the person that can give more insight into who he was as an individual. Here are some things you may want to include:The names and residences of the person's children.
The names of the person's grandchildren. If there are many grandchildren, you can just say how many there are instead of listing all of their names.
The names of the person's parents. If the parents are deceased, you can say that the person you're writing about is ""the son of the late John Smith.""
Some information about the person's education. You can write the name of the person's high school, college, and even graduate school if it's applicable.
Information about the person's vocation. You can write down the person's profession or even where he worked.
The person's hobbies. If the person loved fishing, then write it down. If he just did it occasionally to pass the time, then it isn't necessary.
The names of any beloved pets of the deceased.
The birthplace of the deceased, or the names of other places where he lived if they were important to him.
Some information or anecdotes that show the person's quirks or personality traits.
Information about how the person died. If the person died in a particularly gruesome way or by suicide, you may want to use your discretion, but if the person died in a major catastrophe, at war, or after battling a long illness, you may want to include it.

"
"
Announce the death.,
Provide biographical information.,
Write additional information (optional).,
Provide survivor information.,
Provide information about the funeral arrangements.",How to Write an Obituary3," The opening is one sentence that gives basic information about who the person was and when he died. You can decide whether you want to mention where specifically the person died and if his family was there. If you do choose to mention the cause of death, then you can do that at the end of this first sentence. Here's what it should look like:(Name),(age), of (residence) died (passed away, or a word with a similar meaning), (date).
Example: ""Sandra Smith, 70, of Santa Monica, died Mar. 12, 2013, with her family by her side."" 


, This paragraph should provide some basic biographical information about the person, such as where he was born, his educational background, and information about his marital life (if there is any). Here's what it should look like:


(He/she) was born (place, date of birth, parents). (Name) graduated from (high school name) and received (name of degree) from (name of college). (He/she) was married to (spouse's name) (time of marriage optional).
Example: ""She was born to the late Samuel and Sally Jones, Apr. 12, 1943, in Springfield, Illinois. Sandra graduated from John Adams High School in 1961 and received a BA in in History from the University of Illinois in 1965. She married the late Jackson Smith in 1966, and they lived together in Springfield for twenty years before relocating to Santa Monica.""


, If you'd like to expand your obituary to include more information about the deceased, then you should do so in the next paragraph or two mini-paragraphs. Try to think of three adjectives to describe the person, and make this come through in your description of the person's life. Rather than saying the person was generous, show how the person demonstrated the charitable behavior. The format for these parts is less rigid since it all depends on what you want to include.
Example: ""Sandra was a librarian until she retired in 2008. She was passionate about helping the students in the library, and about spreading her love for reading throughout her community. She was honored with the Santa Monica Librarian of the Year award in 1995.""
Example: ""She was an avid golfer, and spent most of her Saturday and Sunday mornings at the course with her friends. She loved hiking, biking, and running, and ran ten marathons in her lifetime.""


, You should list the names of the person's children, grandchildren, and other important family members. You should include the residence of these family members and separate the names of each person with a semi-colon. Remember that if there are many grandchildren instead of just one or two, that listing the number is more appropriate.


Example: ""Sandra is survived by three children: Jenny Gray, of Springfield; Mark Smith, of Philadelphia; and Jessie Adams, of Chicago. She is also survived by ten grandchildren and three great-grandchildren."" 


, In the last part of the obituary, you should write the time, date, and place where the service will be held, and let people know if your family would prefer guests to make a donation to a charity that the deceased supported instead of sending flowers. Here's how to write it:


Example: ""Instead of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the Brunswick Homeless Shelter.""
Example: ""A viewing will be held at 6. p.m. Saturday at the Santa Clara Funeral Home. The burial will take place at 1 p.m. at the Santa Monica cemetery.""

"
"
Revise the obituary.,
Ask for feedback.,
Proofread your work.,
Submit your obituary.",How to Write an Obituary4," Once you've put your obituary together, you should read it over to make sure that it suits your needs. Through revision, you'll be able to trim down any wordy phrases, note places where you could add information, and see if a sentence or two could be eliminated altogether.


When you revise your work, ask yourself what your loved one would think of the obituary. Would he feel that you captured who he was and what his passions were?
Make sure that you were honoring the person's life instead of focusing on his death. The obituary should read like a quiet celebration of all the things the person has done and all of the lives that he touched.
Remember those three words you thought would best describe the person. Do those words shine through in what you've written?
Make sure that your thoughts are clearly communicated. Are all of the sentences clear and unambiguous?
Avoid any fancy words that may muddle your meaning. Your obituary should be respectful and simple.

, Once you've revised your work, you should ask for the feedback of another person who knew the loved one well, because this can give you a better sense of what you've accomplished in the obituary. If you're really feeling uncertain about your work, then you can ask for feedback before the revision stage. Here's why getting some feedback can be helpful:


Having another person close to the loved one look at your work can give you a better sense of whether you've truly captured the essence of that person.
Another pair of eyes can also be helpful because another person can help you see if you've forgotten something important, like one of the person's favorite hobbies, or the names of one of his children.

, Once you've revised your work and received some feedback, you should look over your work one more time before you send your obituary to the funeral home. This will help you get rid of any grammatical or punctuation mistakes.


Try reading your work aloud to make sure that the sentences flow smoothly and that there aren't any words that are out of place.


, After you've finished writing the obituary, all you have to do is send it to either the funeral home or directly to the newspaper. You should have the obituary typed, and you should send it in electronic form if this is acceptable. This is a great way to minimize errors and to make sure that your obituary gets to the right place quickly.


However you choose to submit your obituary, you should make sure that it was received promptly.

Know when to write a formal letter.,
Write your address and today's date at the top of the page.,
Write the name and address of the recipient.,
Write the salutation.,
Write the letter.,
Use a complimentary close.,
Fold the letter (optional).,
Address the envelope (optional).,
Write your return address on the envelope (optional).",How to Write a Letter2," Write a formal letter when addressing someone you only know in a professional capacity. This includes letters written to government departments or businesses, instead of a known individual.


These letters should be typed, then printed. You can use any text editing software to do this, such as Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, or Text Edit. If the letter is urgent or the recipient prefers email, you can send an email instead.
When addressing your current boss or coworker, you can be slightly less formal. Email is usually fine, and you don't need an address at the top of the page.

, Write your name and address at the top of the page, on the left. If you are writing a business letter, use the company name and address instead, or just write on company letterhead. Either way, skip two lines and write today's date.


Write out the full date. 19 September 2014 (British) or September 19, 2014 (American) are both preferable to Sept. 19, 2014 or 19/9/14.
Skip the date when writing an email.

, Unless you're writing an email, skip another two lines and write the contact information for the person you're writing to. Write each of these on a separate line:


Full title and name
Company or organization name (if applicable)
Full address (use two or more lines, as needed)

, Skip a line again, then greet the recipient with ""Dear"" followed by their name. You may use the last name, or the full name (first and last), but never the first name alone. Include an abbreviated professional title if applicable.


If you know the job title but not the person's name, you may write ""Dear Health Inspector:"" or a similar phrase. It's usually possible to find the name with an online search, so try that first.
If you don't have a specific contact, write ""Dear Sir or Madam:"" or ""To Whom It May concern:"". These sound a little stiff and old fashioned, so try to avoid it when possible.

, Formal letters should open with a clear statement of purpose. Do not use contractions (write are not instead of aren't), and phrases questions formally (Would you be interested in...? instead of Do you want to...?). Proofread the letter for spelling and grammar when finished, or ask a friend to help you.


If you are writing on official business, keep it short and direct. If you are writing a distant relative or an acquaintance for social reasons, you can be a little more conversational. It's still best to keep it to under a page.

, A complimentary close ends your letter on a good note and establishes a connection with the recipient. Make two hard returns after the last paragraph of the letter, then write the complimentary close. For formal letters, stick to ""Sincerely yours,"" ""Kindest regards,"" or ""Best wishes."" Sign underneath the close, as follows:


For typed formal letters, leave about four spaces between the complimentary close and your typed full name. Print the letter, then sign your name in blue or black ink in that blank space.
In a formal email, type your full name after the complimentary close.
You may use a courtesy title for yourself when you put your name at the end of a formal letter. For instance, a married woman could sign as ""Mrs. Amanda Smith.""

, If you're sending a letter through the post, fold it into thirds. Bring the bottom of the sheet up so that it's two-thirds of the way up the page, and crease. Then fold down the top portion so that the crease matches up with the bottom of the paper. Folding the letter this way ensures that it will fit into most envelopes.

, Find the center of the envelope, both lengthwise and widthwise. This is where you'll write the full address of the recipient, like so:


Mr. John Smith
123 ABC St.
New York City, NY 99999

, If the US Postal Service cannot deliver your letter for any reason, it will send the letter back to the return address at no extra charge. Write it as you would the address of the recipient (listed above); the only change is that you might wish to simply list your last name instead of your full name.

"
"
Decide how formal your letter needs to be.,
Start with a salutation.,
Start the letter.,
Write what needs to be communicated.,
End the letter.,
Send the letter.",How to Write a Letter3," How you write the letter will depend on your relationship with the recipient. Consider these guidelines:


If you're writing to a distant or elderly relative, or a social acquaintance, write a semi-formal letter. If that person has sent you emails before, you may email them as well. If not, a handwritten letter is a safer bet.
If you're writing a friend or close family member, an email or handwritten letter are both fine.

, The salutation you use will depend on your relationship with the recipient of the letter, as well as the formality of the letter. Here are some possibilities:


If you're writing a semiformal letter, you might use ""Dear"" or ""Hello"" as a salutation. Use the first name if that's how you talk to each other, or the courtesy title (Mr or Ms) if not.
If you're writing an informal letter, you can use ""Dear"" or ""Hello,"" as well as more informal greetings such as ""Hi"" or ""Hey."" Follow it with the first name.

, Move to the next line and start writing. If you're writing a personal letter, start by asking after the recipient's well-being. This can be as formal as ""I hope you are well"" or as informal as ""How's it going?."" Imagine the recipient is in front of you; how would you talk to them?

, The primary purpose of a letter is communication. Let the other person know what's going on in your life, including the details. For example, don't just tell your grandma ""Thank you for the gift"" — show her that it means something to you: ""My friends and I spent all night playing the game you sent me. Thank you!"" Whatever the subject is, sharing information should be the focus of the letter.


Know what not to write. A letter written in anger or to solicit pity is probably not a letter you should send. If you've already written such a letter and you're unsure about sending it, let it sit for a few days before you pop it into the mailbox — you might change your mind.

, For informal letters, your close should reflect your relationship with the recipient. If you're writing to a spouse, dear friend, or close family member, you could use ""Affectionately,"" ""Fondly"" or ""Love."" For a semiformal letter, you might find a better match with ""Sincerely,"" ""Regards,"" or ""Best.""


A very old-fashioned close fits into the last sentence. This was originally a formal style, but you can have fun with it when writing a light-hearted letter to a friend. For example, the last paragraph of your letter could read ""I remain, as ever, your devoted servant,"" and then your name.
If you want to add something after the letter's written, use P.S, which means Post Script (""after the writing"").

, Insert the letter in an envelope. Stamp it, address it to the other person, and send it on its way.

Lay out the facts for your creditor.,
Tell them exactly what happened with your payment.,
Apologize profusely for the inconvenience.,
Clarify the status of the problem that caused you to pay late.,
Explain how you will ensure timely payments moving forward.,
Elaborate on how you will get back on track with your payments.,
Remind your creditor of your payment history.,
Show appreciation.,
Sign and mail the letter immediately.",How to Write a Late Payment Letter," In other words, don’t make your creditor hunt down your bill in order to understand what you’re talking about. Right off the bat, state your name, account information, the payment amount in question, the original due date, and any other pertinent information.Demonstrate to the creditor that you are well aware of the situation also and do not intend to avoid the discussion concerning the past due status. Your creditor may receive checks and letters daily, so don’t waste their time by being vague and assuming they know your particular situation.

, If it was completely your fault, suck up your pride and tell them that. If you faced some sort of emergency or crisis, tell them that too. It’s important to be truthful and thorough.If you’re genuine, they might be appreciative and take pity. Be careful not to whine while you’re explaining your predicament.


While you should be thorough, don’t give them more information than they need. For example, they don’t need to know every gruesome detail of a medical issue, or the ins-and-outs of a messy divorce!

, Even if you think your late payment is no big deal, show remorse. If they think you’re nonchalant about the issue at hand, they may not be so quick to show you mercy. By apologizing and taking complete responsibility for the tardiness, you will also show them that you do not take your responsibilities lightly and you will learn from this., For example, if you missed a payment because you lost your job, explain your current employment status. If you had a medical emergency, explain where your health stands. It is not enough to just make the payment you missed— you need to let your creditor know that this will not be a recurring problem., If the issue that delayed this particular payment is not rectified, explain why it will not affect you in the future. If that specific problem has been fixed, make sure you state what kinds of things you will do to prevent late payments moving forward.


For example, let’s say you are sending a payment in late because your car broke down and you had to pay to fix it. You may tell your creditor that your car is fixed, so that particular problem is eliminated. However, you need to explain why these kinds of problems won’t interfere with timely payments again. You can put money aside for unforeseen circumstances, prioritize this particular creditor in the future, etc.

, Inform the creditor about when you will be able to make the payment (in full or a partial payment). Avoid making unrealistic promises; the plan you present to your creditor needs to be one that you can follow through without difficulties. By explaining your plan, you will show that you’ve taken initiative to plan ahead and get your finances in order.

, If you typically pay on time, remind them of that. Creditors deal with customers who pay late regularly, so it’s beneficial to note if making a late payment is out of character for you. Use your good credit history to your advantage to establish that this particular instance is not what the creditor should normally expect from you., No matter what you are sending in payment for, it doesn’t hurt to suck up a little. Whether you’re paying rent or a credit card bill, tell your creditor that you are grateful for the goods or services that they provide. Use this opportunity to show your loyalty to the person or company.

, Send it as soon as you realize your payment will be late or that you will not be able to make the payment until a later date. Waiting until your creditor contacts you about the late payment does not increase the chances of any leniency concerning a reduction of penalties or the likelihood of the creditor not making a negative report to the credit agencies.

Understand the purpose of a vignette.,
Don’t feel restricted to one structure or style in a vignette.,
Remember the one rule of the vignette: create an atmosphere, not a story.,
Read examples of vignettes.,
Analyze the examples.,
Create an association diagram.,
Do a freewrite.,
Ask the six big questions.,
Decide on the style of the vignette.,
Add sensory details.,
Condense the vignette.",How to Write a Vignette," A vignette should express a certain moment, mood, aspect, setting, character, or object. Most of all, it should be short, but descriptive.


In terms of length, a vignette is typically 800-1000 words. But it can be as short as a few lines, or under 500 words.A vignette will usually have 1-2 short scenes, moments, or impressions about a character, an idea, a theme, a setting, or an object.
You can use the first second, or third point of view in a vignette. But most vignettes are told in just one point of view, instead of alternating points of view. Remember you only have a short amount of space on the page for the vignette. So don’t waste valuable time confusing your reader with many points of view.
The vignette form can also be used by physicians to create a report on the status of a patient or a procedure. In this article, we will be focusing on a literary vignette, not a clinical vignette.;
, A vignette is an open form. This means you do not need to write within a certain structure or a specific plot. So, you can have a clear beginning, middle, and end, or you can skip beginnings and endings altogether.A vignette also does not require a main conflict or a resolution of a conflict. This freedom gives some vignettes an unfinished or unresolved tone. But unlike other traditional storytelling forms like the novel or the short story, a vignette does not have to tie up all the loose ends.
In a vignette, you are not limited by a certain genre or style. So you can combine elements of a horror and a romance, or you can use poetry and prose in the same vignette.
Feel free to use simple and minimal language, or lush, detailed prose.

, Because there is limited space in a vignette, its important to show, rather than tell the reader. So avoid inserting backstory or exposition into a vignette. Focus instead on creating a snapshot in the life of a character or in a certain setting.A vignette can also come in the form of a blog entry or even a Twitter post.
Usually, shorter vignettes are more difficult to write, as you need to create an atmosphere in very few words and evoke a reaction from your reader.

, There are several great vignette examples, varying from very short to long. For example:


The publication Vine Leaves Journalpublishes vignettes, both short and long. One of the submissions from their first issue is a two line vignette by the poet Patricia Ranzoni, called “Flashback”: “the softness from dialing the phone/is like lifting the lid to my music box.”Charles Dickens uses longer vignettes or “sketches” in his novel “Sketches by Boz” to explore London scenes and people.The writer Sandra Cisneros has a collection of vignettes called “The House on Mango Street”, narrated by a young Latin girl living in Chicago., Whether the vignette is two lines long or two paragraphs long, it should communicate a certain emotion or mood to the reader. Look closely at how the example vignettes use tone, language, and mood to evoke emotions in the reader.


For example, the two line vignette by the poet Patricia Ranzoni is a successful piece because it is both simple and complex. Simple in that it describes the feeling you might get as you dial the number of someone you are excited to talk to. But complex in that the vignette ties the excitement of dialing a number to the excitement of lifting a music box. So the vignette combines two images to create one emotion. It also uses “softness” to describe dialing the phone, which also connects to the softness of the lining of a music box, or the soft music that plays from a music box. With just two lines, the vignette effectively creates a certain mood for the reader.
In Cisneros’ “The House on Mango Street”, there is a vignette called “Boys & Girls”. It is a longer vignette, four paragraphs long, or around 1,000 words. But it sums up the young narrator’s emotion towards the boys and girls in her neighborhood, as well as her relationship with her sister, Nenny.The narrator uses simple, direct language to describe the separate world of boys and girls in her neighborhood. Cisneros finishes the vignette with an image that sums up the narrator’s feelings.
Someday I will have a best friend all my own. One I can tell my secrets to. One who will understand my jokes without my having to explain them. Until then I am a red balloon, a balloon tied to an anchor.


The image of a “balloon tied to an anchor” adds color and texture to the vignette. The narrator’s feeling of being weighed down by her sister is perfectly summed up by the last image. So the reader is left with the feeling of being held down or tethered to someone, just like the narrator.

, An association diagram is also known as a clustering technique. You will create a cluster or group of words around a theme or idea.Take out a sheet of paper. Write your main topic or subject in the middle of the paper. For example, “Spring”.
Moving out from the center, write down other words that pop into your mind that relate to “Spring”.
For example, for “Spring”, you might write “flowers”, “rain”, “Spring break”, “new life”. Don’t worry about organizing the words as you write. Simply let the words flow around the main topic.
Once you feel you have written enough words around the main topic, start to cluster the words. Draw a circle around words that relate to each other and draw a line between the circled words to connect them. Continue doing this with the other words. Some of the terms may end up uncircled, but these lone words can still be useful.Focus on how the words relate back to the main topic. If you have clustered together several words that relate to “new life”, for example, maybe this may be a good approach for the vignette. Or if there are a lot of clustered words that focus on “flowers, this may be another way to approach “Spring.”
Answer questions like: “I was surprised by…” or “I discovered…” For example, you may look over the clustered words and note “I was surprised by how often I mention my mother in relation to Spring.” Or, “I discovered I may want to write about how Spring means new life.”, A freewrite is a chance for you to let your thoughts flow on a piece of paper. Write whatever comes into your mind and don’t judge what you are writing.


Take out a piece of paper, or open a new document on your computer. Write the main topic at the top of the paper. Then, set a time limit of 10 minutes and start the freewrite.A good rule of thumb for the freewrite is to not lift your pen from the paper, or your fingers from the keyboard. This means not re reading the sentences you just wrote or going back over a line for spelling, grammar, or punctuation. If you feel you have run out of things to write down, write about your frustrations about not having anything else to say about the main topic.
Stop writing once the timer is up. Read over the text. Though there may be some confusing or convoluted thoughts, there will also be sentences you may like or an insight that may be useful.
Highlight or underline sentences or phrases you think may work in the vignette.

, Take out a sheet of paper or open a new document. Write the main topic of the vignette on the top of the document. Then, write down six headings: Who? What? When? Where? Why? and How?Respond to each question with a phrase or sentence. For example, if your topic is “Spring”, you may answer Who? with “my mother and I in the garden”. You may answer When? with “A hot summer day in July when I was six years old.” You may answer Where? with “Miami, Florida.” You may answer Why? with “Because it was one of the happiest moments of my life.” And you may answer How? with “I was alone with my mother in the garden, without my sisters.”
Look over your responses. Do you have more than one or two phrases for a certain question? Is there one question you had no answer for? If your answers reveal you know more about “where” and “why”, maybe this is where the strongest ideas for the vignette are.

, Maybe you want to do a free style vignette where you create a scene or describe an object. Or perhaps you’d like to use the format of a letter or a blog post for the vignette.For example, a vignette about “Spring” could describe a scene in the garden with your mother, among the flowers and trees. Or it could be in the form of a letter to your mother about that day in Spring, among the flowers and trees.

, Focus on the five senses: touch, taste, smell, sight, and sound. Could a certain detail in the vignette be stronger with a description of the smell of a flower or the softness of the petals of a flower?You can also add figurative language to strengthen the vignette, such as similes, metaphors, alliteration, and personification. But use these sparingly and only when you feel like a simile or metaphor will highlight the rest of the vignette.
For example, the use of the red balloon attached to an anchor in Cisneros’ “Boys & Girls” is an effective use of figurative language. But it works well because the rest of the vignette uses simple language, so the image at the end of the vignette lingers with the reader.

, A good vignette should have a sense of urgency. This means cutting out details like what the character ate for breakfast or the color of the sky in the garden, unless they are essential to the vignette. Only include scenes and moments that add urgency, and remove any details that slow down the pace of the vignette.Look over the first two lines of the vignette. Does the vignette begin at the right moment? Is there a sense of urgency in the first two lines?
Make sure your characters collide with each other very early in the vignette. See if you can edit the vignette so you set a scene in the least words possible.

Let all of these inspirations sit inside your mind and work their way around. This is creativity building.;
, Just sit at your computer and write everything down in one go. Let the flow take over and let it out, whatever it is. The important thing is that a computer makes it really easy for you to come back to it afterwards and change things if you want. Rough drafts have a dreadful habit of creating changes for the sake of change until you have shaped something so different from what you started with that it no longer seems what you wanted.

, Have a general feel for how you want them to be but don't fill in all the blanks; leave some mystery for development. Let them surprise you as you fill them out while writing. People in real life do that; so can your characters.

, Nothing set in concrete but some basic guidance posts. If this is too hard, if the end is so amorphous and as yet unplanned, don't bother your head with it. It will come as you write; if you are an intuitive, jump-in-and-do-it type, getting hung up on the ending can bottle up the whole tale. Likely its in your mind somewhere but will wend its way out as the characters and plot develop.

, Lose yourself in it. It's the only way to get a brilliant story if you put your whole heart in to it. Create alter egos and your own little world. Don't write because you have to, write because you want to.

Greet the recipient.,
Reference your connection to the recipient.,
Soften your expressions.,
Be polite.,
Use a subject line.,
Remember to include your reminder.,
Employ concise language.,
Edit out unnecessary information.,
Close the email with a valediction.,
Proofread your email.,
Read your email aloud.,
Have another person look over the email.",How to Write a Friendly Reminder Email," In business situations, you may have to use a standard greeting, like ""Dear so-and-so."" However, more and more, personalized emails are becoming standard. Some email greetings that can help you strike a friendly tone from the start include:Hi John
Hi there
Long time no see
Hey!;
, If you just stick to the reminder, your message might come across as cold. Reference your personal connection to the recipient by including phrases that reflect on your friendship and shared experiences. These might include:How's school been going?
My friend, how have you been?
I had such a great time with you last weekend.
When was the last time we talked, a month ago?
That trip we took together was a blast! We'll have to do it again soon.

, This is especially important for the reminder part of the email. If it's been a while since you've been in touch with the recipient, it may be suitable to offer a light apology or excuse for only getting in touch for the sake of a reminder. Some examples of softened expressions include:

I know it's been a while since we've talked, but I wanted to remind you about...
Things have been so hectic with the new baby, I only just remembered to remind you...
I know you've been busy, so I didn't want to pester you, but I wanted to send a reminder...

, If the reminder is important, it's easy to come across too strong. Keep in mind that the recipient has things going on in their life. Remember to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" and equivalent expressions as well. You might include polite phrases like:Sorry to bother you, but I wanted to make sure...
If you could please reply to this email as soon as you have time...
Thanks for taking time to read any reply to this reminder. I appreciate it.
I'll look forward to your response.

, You don't have to write a clever subject line. Ones that are clear and to the point will be most useful. These will allow the recipient to know the purpose of the email at a glance. Some common options for a friendly email reminder might include:

Checking in
Quick reminder about...
Upcoming trip/event/etc.
Headcount for trip/event/etc., When you're trying so hard to be friendly and polite, it can be easy to leave off something important, like the actual reminder. Put your reminder near the beginning of the email, shortly after the greeting and a brief personal connection. For example:""Hi There,
It's been a while since we've talked, Ben. How're your wife and kids? Mine keep me pretty busy, but I wanted to check in with you about...""
""Hey!
Grandma, I've been meaning to send you a message. Sorry I've been so busy. I just wanted to remind you about our lunch date...""

, It's generally true that polite language uses longer expressions. For example, the phrase ""Work harder"" would be politer as ""It might be a good idea if you were to work harder."" While polite, these long expressions can make the focus of your email difficult to pinpoint.

Use a simplified structure for your email. This might look something like: Greeting (opening) → Personal Connection → Reminder → Valediction (closing), For each sentence and each part of each sentence, ask yourself, ""Is this necessary?"" In some cases, ""necessary"" may mean something as broad as ""It's necessary so my email doesn't sound cold."" Remove unnecessary parts of the email.Generally, adverbs (like ""very,"" ""really,"" ""truly,"" ""extremely,"" and ""definitely"") can be removed to make your message more concise., ""Valediction"" is a fancy word that means ""saying farewell.""Valedictions include expressions like ""Best,"" ""Regards,"" ""Yours Truly,"" and ""Sincerely."" Your signature should follow your valediction. These common valedictions, however, might come across as impersonal. You might try something like:

Your friend
Cheers
All the best
Have a great day
Tag, you're it
Looking forward to hearing from you, Even glancing through your email once or twice quickly will eliminate many simple errors that might have sneaked in while writing it. After you've finished composing, proofread your email for spelling and grammar.

Many email services have a free grammar and spelling checker. The quality of these will depend on your email provider. In some cases, these checkers may not be very accurate.
Remember to check your subject line, your greeting, and your valediction (closing). It's easy to gloss over these and focus on only the body of your email., If you're writing an important email, or if you really want to be particularly friendly or polite with someone, read your email from start to finish out loud. Does it sound conversational? If so, your email is ready to send.Rewrite sentences or passages that sound clunky. Use your best judgement when evaluating this. This will vary from person to person, depending on your style of speaking.

, For important communications, like those intended for business, you may want another person to check the reminder before sending it. If you've written a concise email, this generally takes little time and can help catch even the smallest errors.

Check your online messaging service. Send a message to a friend online asking something like, ""Hey, could you read over a short email I have to send? It'll only take a minute.""
Remember to express your gratitude to anyone who reads over your email. They're doing you a favor, after all.

Start fresh by getting a good night's sleep and have something to eat so you can write for several hours.,
Clear your head so you can approach your work without the frustrations of daily life get in the way of being creative.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Silence your internal editor by giving yourself permission to write without stopping.,
Prepare yourself before you write.,
Work as fast as you can.,
Set a schedule for yourself.",How to Get Into the Flow of the Novel," You can't get a lot of writing done if you're too tired to stay at your computer. You don't want to be forced to take a break while you're still in the flow of your novel.;
,


For most people this means writing in the morning. If that's not possible try meditating, going for a walk or doing some other contemplative activity.
It may help to make sure your home is relatively clean before you start, so you won't be bothered by the fact that you need to do laundry or wash dishes.

, Every time you stop to answer an email, pick up the phone or check your Facebook status, you take yourself out of the flow. If you can't eliminate distractions in your home, take your laptop to a library and work there. Some writers even create short ""writing retreats"" during which they leave home for several days in order to write.

, Most writers are tempted to write a few sentences then go back and rewrite them, taking themselves out of the flow. Do your editing at another time, never during your writing time.

, Conduct research, work out your plot details and make sure you have all the supplies you need, including something to eat. If you have to stop to look something up or run to the store, it's doubtful that you will be able to continue writing afterward.

, Don't give yourself any time to reflect on what you're doing, ask yourself if you're getting anywhere or wonder what you're missing while you're writing. Write as if you have a deadline to meet and you're thousands of words behind. Also, don't stop to consider word choice. For the first draft, always assume the first word is the right word. You can go back and punch up the text later - your goal here is to get as much of your ideas out onto the page as possible.

, Decide which days and times you will get into the flow of your novel. Over time, it will take less effort to achieve flow and you'll be writing more than you ever thought you could.

Research what manga is all about.,
Keep this in mind whilst thinking about reading and collecting manga: you need to understand that there are a LOT of genres, from action to adventure, sports/games to comedy, puppy love (young romance) to sensual romance, yaoi (manga and anime focusing on gay relationships) to yuri (manga and anime focusing on lesbian relationships), horror to mystery, and historical dramas to school life!,
If you are currently earning money, go out and buy manga if you enjoy it (and after your other responsibilities are paid for).,
Read manga series and volumes in order; otherwise you will get confused as to where the plot is going!

,
Read it properly.",How to Read and Enjoy Manga," Use the internet and your local library, and ask people you know who might know about it.;
, Research and buy manga in good book shops or borrow manga from libraries or friends, and find which genres stand out for you!


Some very popular mangas are Death Note, Bleach, One Piece, Fruits Basket, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Naruto, just to give you some ideas.You don't HAVE to read these mangas, but you may want to have a go at reading them!

, If you haven't got the money, then read your friends' mangas or borrow from the library. It is free after all!

,, Proper Japanese manga are 'switched around'. In other words, rather than reading words from left to right, you need to mirror that. Read the manga panels, speech bubbles and thought bubbles right to left, and turn the left page right! This may sound difficult and confusing at first, but once you get the hang of properly reading and understanding manga, it gets easier and easier. Put some trust in that!


Many people, young and old, from just about everywhere in the world, enjoy manga! So don't be afraid to introduce friends and family to manga and anime, and to make new friends who are into manga as much as you are!

Research the news organization.,
Download the appropriate app.,
Go through SecureDrop.,
Stick to public Wi-Fi.",How to Securely Leak to the Press1," Different news organizations use various apps that allow citizens to send them information in a secure and anonymous way. If you already have a news organization in mind that you want to use, find out what service they use.You typically can find this out by checking the news organization's website. Don't use a work computer or search from your own home. Go somewhere with free public Wi-Fi and do your research there so there's no trace of you having visited that news organization's website.
On the website, search for ""leak"" or ""tip"" or ""source."" One of these words should get you to the page that you need.
For example, you can find information about how to leak to the Washington Post by going to https://www.washingtonpost.com/securedrop/. The landing page for leaks to the New York Times is located at https://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2016/news-tips/.;
, Some news organizations use a free mobile app, such as Signal, to send and receive encrypted messages and phone calls. If you need to talk to a journalist, you may be able to use one of these apps.You typically cannot send documents through these services, but you can talk to journalists or send and receive messages regarding document delivery, or other information.
If the service requires you to add the journalist to your phone's contacts before you can communicate with them over the app, add them under a fake name.

, SecureDrop is an online document transfer service used by more than 20 news organizations. This service allows encrypted, anonymous documents to be transmitted from sources to journalists.You also can communicate with the journalist, and they with you, by typing a document and sending it. Once the document has been sent, you can reply from within the service.
SecureDrop only operates on the Tor browser, so you'll have to download that. The process is the same as downloading any other app, and the browser operates just like any other web browser.
Make sure your security settings are set to the highest level before you start using SecureDrop for communications.

, Even though these encrypted services ensure that the information you send can't be opened or read, there may still be a record of the contact itself. For that reason, avoid using the Wi-Fi at home or work, since that can be traced back to you.Find a café, library, or another public place that has open Wi-Fi available. Go somewhere on the other side of town, or that isn't located in a place near your work, school, or any other place you frequent on a regular basis.
If you have to communicate more than once, don't go back to the same place – find a new location for each communication.
If you have to spend any money to get to the location, use cash. Credit or debit cards can all be traced back to you and put you in that location. Leave all electronic devices at home, since they also can be traced.As far as transportation is concerned, walk if possible. Do not drive your own car. If you need to use public transportation, get off several stops before your destination and walk in the opposite direction, then circle back. You may want to take several forms of transportation. Avoid taxis, and avoid areas with modern surveillance cameras.

Create a strong antagonist.",How to Create a Good Protagonist," Coming up with a well-thought-out premise for your story will give you the basis upon which to develop your characters, including your protagonist. In order to know how your characters will develop, what qualities they will have, and how they might change throughout your novel, you need to have a clear idea where your story is headed. When you’re finished, you should compile your thoughts into two or three sentences that give a synopsis of your plot. As you develop your premise, ask yourself:


Which character is the protagonist?
What is the protagonist like at the beginning and how might that change after they face conflict throughout the story?
What is the protagonist’s objective?
What or who will stand in the way of them achieving this objective?
What struggles will the protagonist face trying to accomplish their objective?
What is the result of the protagonist’s actions?;
, You will need to know the characters in your story inside and out so that you can be consistent in their choices and reactions. This might seem daunting, but there are strategies to help you complete this task:


For major characters, work backwards from the time they are first engaged in the plot, or when they face their first conflict or decision. Ask yourself:

What events have led them to be involved at this point in the plot?
What life experiences have shaped their reactions?
Did they do something to cause this event to happen?
How will they move forward?


Perform an “interview” of your characters to unveil the intricate details of their life. In addition to hashing out their physical appearance, dig further into their persona by asking questions that will develop their beliefs and values.

For example, ask questions like, “Do they believe in God?” and “What moments have shaped their life most significantly?”, Ultimately, you want your readers to become invested in your characters. They must be able to relate to them on a personal level. To help your readers relate, create characters that feel like real people and have qualities consistent with this idea.


When you’re developing your characters, consider their backstory, physical description, and how they speak.
Think about their goals, strengths, weaknesses, and fears and what qualities and quirks they have that make them unique.
Make choices for your characters that are consistent with the details you’ve uncovered. For instance, their name must embody their persona., To make your characters believable, demonstrate their persona through their interactions with other characters. After all, we all have relationships in our lives and your characters are no different.


Explain what your characters are thinking about the other characters. Don’t assume your reader already knows.
Allow you characters to challenge their own thinking. For example, instead of simply stating they hate another character, have them question why they hate this person.The best characters not only relate to the world around them, but also to the other characters in the story., All the characters in your novel should be well-developed, but your protagonist should be especially well thought-out. As the driving force in your story, you’ll need to pay special attention to this character to ensure they display qualities that will resonate with your readers and make them care about their fate.

, Your protagonist is the person driving your story. Their dilemma must be central to the plot and they should be the only character capable of solving this problem, or at least the character most capable of solving it.Examples of problems a protagonist might face include:


Completing a mission
Saving a loved one who is in trouble
Answering a question about their past

, Your protagonist must have an internal reason to take risks and make tough decisions. Make their motivation something that every reader can relate to, like an everyday want, hope, or fear.


For example, the need to be loved or accepted is a motivation to which readers can relate.
Whatever is driving the protagonist should be clear to the reader. Your reader should gain a better understanding of the protagonist with each struggle they face., Your protagonist needs to be relatable to every reader so create a character who is unlikely to succeed in achieving their goal. A protagonist that is already identified as a hero is uninteresting and hard for most people to identify with.


An example of a great unlikely hero is Frodo from The Lord of the Rings. Frodo is an unassuming hobbit who is small in stature but not in heart. His success seems unlikely, making his journey all the more interesting to the reader., In general, your reader should feel sympathy or empathy for the protagonist. This means they can see similarities between the struggles faced by the protagonist and those they’ve experienced in their own lives.


Make your protagonist somewhat flawed because real people are flawed and imperfect.
Use your own connection to the protagonist to guide their quest and determine how the reader might connect to them., The fate of your protagonist should be in their own hands throughout your story. This character should be the one making decisions and dealing with the consequences. Keep in mind:


Your protagonist doesn’t have to choose their fate right away. Allowing them to waiver in their decisions throughout the book can create an interesting read.
If they aren’t making decisions that affect their fate, they are not the protagonist, but merely a background character., Though the protagonist doesn’t necessarily have to change throughout the novel, a good protagonist will be given the opportunity to do so.The protagonist can effect change in several different ways:


They should wish to resolve their initial conflict in some way.The reader’s understanding of the protagonist should change.They should be given the opportunity to learn from their experiences and become a better person (though they don’t have to)., Your antagonist is there to create conflict and push your protagonist to question their decisions throughout your story. In the end, a strongly characterized antagonist will make your protagonist look even better when they win. Keep the following in mind when developing your antagonist:


They should be the opposite of your protagonist—a mirror image.
They are not necessarily a villain or someone evil. The personality embodied by the antagonist will directly relate to that of the protagonist."

Email your contact.,
Shut everything off.,
Destroy the device when you're done.",How to Securely Leak to the Press2," If you've decided to send a regular email, you'll have to spend a little money to make sure the information cannot be traced back to you. Your first purchase should be a computer or tablet that you will only use to communicate with the journalist to whom you're leaking information.It doesn't have to be a fancy computer – a cheap machine running Windows is sufficient. Buy a new machine, not a used one, because you don't know what's on a used one. This machine shouldn't set you back more than a few hundred dollars.
Get the information or data you need onto the computer, but do not email yourself anything from your own work or personal email address, and don't log onto any of your personal accounts on this computer. If you do, the computer can potentially be traced back to you.
Do not access your home or work Wi-Fi network using this computer.

, Almost all newer personal computers provide you the ability to encrypt all information on the hard drive with a few clicks. Once enabled, no one will be able to access any information stored on your hard drive without your username and password.On a Windows machine, enter ""encryption"" from the start menu and select ""change device encryption settings."" Choose the ""Manage BitLocker"" option, turn on BitLocker, and follow the instructions from there to set it up.On a Mac, click on ""Security & Privacy"" from your system preferences. Choose the FireVault tab and unlock it with your username and password so you can update your preferences. Then turn on FireVault and follow the instructions.If the dedicated computer you bought does not have an option for full disk encryption, you also can download software that will do this for you. Download a free program such as TrueCrypt or DiskCryptor.

, To securely leak to the press using email, go to a café or other place that has open Wi-Fi available to the public. Look for a location that isn't in an area you normally frequent, and don't go to the same location more than once.Once there, turn the Wi-Fi on the computer and connect to the network. Don't bring any personal devices with you, because they can be traced and you don't want them to show that they've accessed the same network.
Both on the way to the location and once you get there, use cash to pay for any purchases you have to make – do not use your own credit or debit cards, even a prepaid card, because they can be traced back to you.

, Encryption can be set up on any computer and protects your information and data from being read or understood by even the most sophisticated government surveillance technology.You can install encryption software within your email service, as well as on the computer as a whole. Once encrypted, the information is scrambled and cannot be read unless the person has the right key to decrypt it.
""Pretty Good Privacy"" (PGP) is a free encryption service for emails. Go to the PGP website at http://www.pgpi.org/ and download the latest version of the software for your computer. Save the file to your computer, then unzip and install it.
Follow the prompts on the installation screen to finish setting up PGP. You will then be prompted to restart your computer to complete the installation. Once PGP is running, no one can read emails you send without the proper key to decrypt them.

, You don't want to email the journalist from a personal or work email account. A free account from a service such as Gmail will work just fine. Avoid using any name that can be connected to you.The best email address for purposes of anonymity is a series of random letters and numbers.
Do not use a personal email address or any email address that can be traced back to you, as a ""recovery"" email address.

, Two-factor authentication will keep your new email account more secure because it adds an additional step to the log-in process. Most of them send a text message to your mobile phone. Even if someone obtains or hacks your password, they still won't be able to get into your email account.If the email service you're using sends a text message as the second factor, make sure you don't enter the phone number associated with a personal or work phone. You might use the phone number associated with your burner phone.
You can find a list of all websites and email services that support 2FA at https://twofactorauth.org/.

, Once you've got your email address set up, use it to email the journalist the information you want to leak. If you're writing a personal account, avoid giving any personal information that could lead to the discovery of your identity, or your role in the organization from which you're leaking information., After you've finished typing your email and sent it, turn off the Wi-Fi on the computer and close all apps. Fully delete the cache and cookies from the web browser, then shut down the computer.After you've shut down the computer, remove the battery. If at all possible, carry the battery separately from the computer. For example, you might put the battery in your pocket and carry the computer in a backpack.

, If you no longer need to communicate with the journalist, or if you fear you're about to get caught, you must thoroughly destroy the computer so that no information can be pulled off of it.Wipe the device back to its factory settings, using the most secure erase option that is available. Then turn the device off and smash it with a hammer.
Place the pieces in another piece of trash, such as a fast-food snack. Then go out for a walk and throw it away in a public trash can or dumpster well away from anywhere you live, work, or frequent.

Buy a burner phone.,
Go to a random location.,
Turn the phone off.,
Destroy the phone when you're done.",How to Securely Leak to the Press3," If you want to call in a truly anonymous tip to the press, you can't do it from your personal phone, or from work. In fact, you should leave all electronic devices at home when you go to purchase the burner phone.The best place to buy a burner phone is a convenience store or bodega in a low-income part of town. Look for a place that doesn't seem to have surveillance cameras, or has older cameras with footage that gets erased and taped over frequently.
Buy a cheap prepaid phone that has enough minutes to last as long as you need it. Expect to make at least a few phone calls. Pay for the phone with cash.
If you're exceedingly concerned about your security or believe you are being followed, you might want to enlist a trusted friend to buy the phone for you. Don't tell them why you need it.

, To make your phone call, you need to go somewhere that you don't normally frequent. Mobile phone signals can be traced, and the phone keeps records of the wireless networks and locations where it has accessed them.Choose a place where you're not likely to be overheard, and don't turn the phone on until you reach your destination. Again, only use cash for any purchases you have to make along the way.
Do not take any of your personal electronic devices along with you, as the records of them can be used to put you in that location.
Avoid storing the phone number on the phone. Once you call the number and have your conversation, delete the phone's call history.

, After you've finished your phone call, wipe all information from the phone, power it completely off, and remove the battery. Return home by a different route than the route you took to get to the location.If you have to make more calls in the future, do not go to the same location more than once. Try to keep your locations as random as possible, so a pattern cannot be discerned.

, Either when you're done communicating to the journalist, or when the phone runs out of minutes, you have to get rid of it. You'll want to go through the same process if you fear that you're about to get caught.If you believe authorities know what you're doing and are on your trail, you may want to destroy the phone after every call.
To destroy the phone, restore it to its factory settings, wiping all data. Then smash the phone with a hammer, including all chips in the phone.
Disguise the pieces by wrapping them in something else, and throw them away in a public trashcan or dumpster not located near your work or home.

Gather written copies of the information you want to leak.,
Buy mailing supplies in advance.,
Do not include a return address.,
Use an unfamiliar sidewalk mailbox.",How to Securely Leak to the Press4," Make copies of any documents with care. Make sure that any printing, scanning, or downloading you have to do cannot be traced back to you.If you have an extensive number of documents, you might want to consider downloading them to a thumb drive and mailing that instead. You can buy a thumb drive at most any discount or electronics store.
Make sure there is nothing on the thumb drive that can be traced back either to you or to a personal or work computer.

, You need thick manilla envelopes and stamps for mailing. You also may want to invest in a postal scale, so you can accurately determine how much postage will be necessary.Don't go to your usual post office to buy your supplies, and don't order them online. Instead, go to a post office across town to get what you need. Pay for your mailing supplies with cash, and don't give any identifying information to the postal clerk.
Don't get rare or collectible stamps, just get basic, standard stamps. Another option may be to get a pre-paid, flat-rate mailing envelope.

, When you address the envelope, use nondescript, block letters if you're hand-lettering the envelope. Another option is to type up a label on the computer and use that., The envelope will be post-marked, and authorities can use that information to narrow down where you might live or work. For that reason, it's important to use a sidewalk mailbox in some other part of town where you don't normally go.As with any other trips you've made in connection with the leaking of documents or information to the press, do not use any credit or debit cards, or anything else (such as a public transportation pass) that can be traced back to you. Use only cash.
Try to find a mailbox that isn't near or within range of any surveillance cameras. For example, you don't want to use a mailbox that's sitting in front of an ATM, because the mailbox likely can be seen from the ATM's surveillance camera.

Read a light novel.,
Expect to encounter a lot of dialogue.,
Try to cater to more than one demographic.,
Plan out your light novel.,
Set a schedule.,
Write your first draft.,
Maintain continuity.,
Save your writing in a computer.,
Once the document is saved, add the images previously drawn by either yourself or a hired artist.,
Send that work to a publisher.",How to Write a Light Novel," As with any creative endeavour, if you want to get started on writing a light novel, you should read and analyze one first.


Light novels have been released in the United States by Yen Press, Del Rey Manga and Tokyopop (the latter of the three has been defunct since 2006), so pick a light novel (or a series of them) and analyze the writing style.;
, Light novels rely heavily on dialogue, so look at quotes from the characters, and get a feel for the characters' speaking styles. However, keep in mind what kind of audience you want your book to appeal to.


If your audience is Western, don't spend your whole time writing just dialogue and no description. This will easily confuse your average American viewer (though this may be different for readers in other countries). Readers may lose track of who is speaking if there is no description present.

, For example, if you are just writing for avid anime fans, an average American reader (who may not even watch anime) probably won't understand the jokes you lace into the text unless they have prior knowledge of Japanese culture. This is a fatal flaw for many Original English Language ""ranobe,"" as the majority of people will be confused by them, and they won't sell.

, Of course, every great novel comes from an idea, and light novels are no exception. Try a question you want to write about, and one that you feel you can answer. To use ""Haruhi Suzumiya"" as an example, what if the world can be changed by one person and that person just doesn't know it? Make sure there is a point to your plot. And don't forget your characters. Every novel, light or not, has characters (each with their own point of view) as well as a setting, plot and theme.

, Give yourself time to write, but don't force yourself to write when you have no ideas; if you have writer's block, give yourself time to gather your thoughts. Write up a schedule of days when you have free time on your hands, and write your heart out onto the pages, as with any novel.

, Sure, the first draft is full of mistakes and spelling / grammatical errors, but at least it exists, right? Besides, the first draft is just that — a draft. You can always edit it at your own pace, as much as you want. And after constant re-tooling, you have your first chapter. After that, do the same with the remaining chapters, until you think they're good enough to be read, if not published (yet). If you don't think your draft is something that you yourself would pick from a bookstore shelf, then it needs work.

, Continuity is the consistency, as well as the flow, of the light novel when it comes to information, events, or just about anything in your light novel. Make sure you jot down major events in your story to keep for reference if you don't have the time to look back through your book every now and then.

, If you write your ""ranobe"" on your computer using a word processor, then you just need to save the draft. For those writing ""ye olde-fashioned way,"" copy your draft from the paper you used to write it on and save your light novel onto a computer (and proofread using the processor's spell-check).

, These will be mostly without dialogue, as your ""ranobe"" will most likely relay what the characters have said. Add these images in the center of the action, in order to properly illustrate the scene. Save the file.

, If you can, try to publish it yourself if you don't want to go through any sort of legal matters. Just find a self-publishing site such as Lulu, purchase your first copy, and then check for any mistakes. Once you are sure that this is the right layout for your light novel, advertise the book online, and consider finding a retailer to sell physical copies of the work. Retailers only market the light novel for you, so talk up your novel with friends or relatives.

Write a first draft and then revise.",How to Write a Medieval Fantasy Novel," Many medieval fantasy novels, from George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire to J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, draw on real historical events and settings. You may use a known medieval battle, such as The War of the Roses, or a location in medieval times to act as the stage or setting for your novel. You may need to research medieval historical events and locations to get some inspiration for your story’s setting.Keep in mind many medieval fantasy novels use medieval Europe as a backdrop, but this can start to feel cliche if it is done too often. You may want to consider a medieval setting beyond Europe, doing research into other events and locations in medieval history that may work as a template for your novel.
You should try to mix and match different historical events and occurrences in medieval times so your novel does not seem too attached to real life history. You are writing fiction after all, so you can steal, borrow, and tweak from real life settings and events as you see fit.;
, You should consider how the landscape appears to your characters and how your characters interact with the terrain. Is your landscape populated by medieval castles and moats? Does your terrain have a variety of medieval elements, such as markets and brothels? How does nature function in the landscape?The landscape of your novel may also have different areas, such as different cities, towns, and villages. There may be one landscape that is populated by castles and one landscape that is populated with huts or tents.
You should also consider how the terrain affects the weather of a certain area. Perhaps it is very cold and winter all the time in certain areas of the setting and warm and desert-like in other areas.

, It may also be helpful to have a visual representation of your setting so you have a better sense of what it looks like. You may sit down and sketch out a bare bones map of the different sections or areas in your setting, as well as the names of these areas. Use colored pencils or marker to draw different geographical details in your setting, from mountains to rivers to castles to fortresses to villages.


When you are creating names for different areas in your setting, you should try to come up with unique names that are not obvious or one note. Rather than call an area that is cold and wintery “Ice World”, for example, maybe you come up with a more unique name based on the history of the area, such as “Queen’s Ice Pass” or “The Frigid Land”. This will make the name seem more believable and creative., A medieval fantasy novel will likely contain some elements of magic. Your setting may be infused with magical elements, such as locations that shape shift or areas that are protected by a magical dome. Or your setting may only have a small amount of magical elements, such as a magical waterfall or a magical stone, hidden away in a cave. You should consider how magic functions in your setting so you are aware of how it will affect your characters and your storyline.You may also want to determine if you are going to tie in magic to how it was represented in medieval times. Perhaps your setting only contains magic that was available or known in medieval times, or perhaps the magic in your setting is a variation on the magic of medieval times.
For example, witches were actually considered skilled in medicine and healing in medieval times, though they were often feared and demonized. You may then have variations on witchcraft in the setting of your novel., To make your setting feel more believable, you may include medieval weaponry. In medieval times, medieval warfare was often bloody and ugly, with fighters using big pieces of steel to hack at each other. If your setting is going to explore medieval times from a fantasy perspective, you may need to depict the weapons and battles based on what was available at the time. Some common medieval weapons include:Daggers: These were the first useful metal weapons in medieval times and were often used for thrusting or slashing.
Dirks: These are long daggers that were made by cutting down the blade of a sword and were used for thrusting or slashing.
Swords: These were the most common weapons in medieval times, often made of steel and sharpened on both sides. Another variation was the two-handed sword, which was a larger sword that was very heavy and required two hands to wield it effectively in a battle.
Maces: These were weapons made with wooden handles and steel or iron balls at the end. The ball may have had spikes on it. Often, these were used to penetrate hard armor.
Axes: These weapons were made of metal and wood, and came in many variations. Often they were used for thrusting and cutting an opponent.

, You should get inspiration for your characters by looking at real figures that existed in medieval times. This may be wealthy landowners or family houses, as well as typical roles that existed in medieval villages, such as the town blacksmith or the town priest. Using real life figures can help you create believable characters for your novel.For example, George R.R. Martin used the medieval families of the Yorks and the Lancasters in The War of the Roses as inspiration for his own family houses in A Song of Ice and Fire. You can also take medieval historical figures and tweak them so they are fictional representations.

, As you create your characters, you should try to steer clear of cliche characters and familiar tropes in fantasy writing. Rather than have a “dark lord” character who is the source of all evil, you should strive to create “grey” characters instead. These are characters who are not purely evil or purely good, and contain flaws like any other human being. Characters who are flawed and conflicted are often more interesting and engaging than characters who are perfect.As you create your characters, think about how they can be both heroic and selfish in different moments or situations. You may have a main character who is motivated by a good cause or purpose but who must also do awful or morally questionable things to achieve her goal. Or, you may have an antagonist who is selfish and considered evil, but still has the capacity to love his children or experience loneliness and sadness.

, Another common fantasy cliche to avoid is the “one race” idea, where there is no diversity or variation in your characters. This often leads to stale, predictable characters who do not seem relatable or realistic. Instead, you should try to focus on having a variety of character types, backgrounds, genders, and sexual preferences represented in your novel.Avoid creating a non-human race that is all the same, dressing in the same clothing and acting in very similar ways, or a race of humans who all speak with the same voice or have the same mannerisms. Instead, think about how you can distinguish different characters within the same race, group, or tribe. This could be by having different genders wear different clothing or by having each person in a group act in different ways. Maybe different races have different languages and unique ways of communicating.
Another way you can do this is to have the different groups bounce off each other. For example, maybe the non-human race puts a greater value on sustainability and preserving the Earth’s resources. This is counter to how the human race views nature, as something to exploit or use up.

, You can also make sure your characters feel nuanced and distinct by giving each character a personal history. A character’s backstory, such as how they arrived at where they are now in your story, their family history, and their childhood experiences, can all help to create a more unique character.You can also do this by trying to inhabit the perspective of each character in your novel. Rather than write from the third person perspective, where you hover over all your characters like God, try writing in the first person perspective of each of your characters. This will allow you to explore that character’s point of view and give the reader access to their internal thoughts and feelings.

, You can do this by using a plot diagram or by using the snowflake method. Creating a plot outline can help you get a big picture sense of your novel and make it easier to sit down and write.


Your plot outline may not map out the novel completely or contain all the moving parts of the novel. But it should at least notate the rising action, climax, and falling action of the novel. This way, you are aware of what you are writing toward and what your character’s goals are.

, Draw your reader in right away by working on an engaging first line that create suspense and curiosity. Try to keep the opening line clear and easy to understand, but do not give everything away at first. You want to keep your reader hooked, but still guessing as she turns the page.For example, you may refer to the opening line in Stephen King’s The Gunslinger: “The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed.” This opening line is great because it presents a startling image, a man dressed in black in a hot desert, and it introduces the main character of the novel, the gunslinger, in pursuit. The line has action, character, and setting all in one.

, You should also work on a language level to resist cliche, which are phrases that are used so often in common speech that they lose their meaning. If you start to write something and feel as though you have heard it before, it is likely a cliche. You should instead strive to create unique descriptions and unusual details in your medieval fantasy novel.For example, rather than describe a fantastical beast as “different than others” or “a sight to behold”, you may focus on specific details about the beast. You may write, “The beast had thick, brown hair on his arms and legs, with eyes on the palms of his hands and antennas on his head.” This is detailed and paints a startling picture in the reader’s mind.

, To move your novel along, you need conflict and tension. This can come from external forces acting on your characters, such as a raging war or an incoming natural disaster. But there should also be internal forces at work, such as conflict between your characters or conflict within your characters. Maintaining a constant stream of conflict in the novel will propel the story forward and keep your reader engaged.For example, maybe in your medieval fantasy novel there are medieval families who are at war with each other. You may then have two characters who are on opposite sides of the war with the same goal or purpose. Try to place these two characters in a scene together and have them battle, with words or with swords. Then, continue to try to have these two characters interact in various ways throughout the novel. This will ensure there is always conflict brewing in your story.

, Sit down with your map of your setting and your plot outline. Focus on creating a first draft of your novel, writing nuanced descriptions and describing unique, diverse characters. Make sure you ground your reader in your medieval fantasy world so she can get a clear sense of how it feels to inhabit your setting. You should then revise your first draft as many times as it takes for it to feel good enough to share with the world.


You may create a writing plan, where you write a certain number of words a day or hit a certain page count by the end of the week. This can be useful if you tend to procrastinate and have a hard time staying motivated when you sit down to write.
You should also read your writing out loud as you revise so you can determine how your writing flows on the page. You may share your first drafts with others to get feedback and perspective on your work. Be willing to take feedback and constructive criticism, as this will only make your medieval fantasy novel that much better.

Come up with a plot that interests you.,
Try to write it out before you actually draw it so you don't later change your mind and have to draw the whole thing over again.

,
Make sure you know the objective of the story.,
Be sure to know where your story is going, and what the goal of the characters are.,
Once you know where your story is going, try to sum up your story in one sentence.,
Make sure you know exactly where the setting is and the basic knowledge about that place.,
Come up with some characters to populate your fantasy world.,
Try to practice drawing your setting and your characters all interacting together before you begin your manga.,
If you can't get into something, Try to use a manga to make a manga.",How to Write a Manga Comic," It can be romance, adventure, action, comedy or a mix of everything.;
,, This cannot be stressed enough.

, If you don't have an objective, then your story will probably be spiraling into all different directions, and your readers will be completely lost.

, For example, if you summed up a story titled 'Death Note', it would probably be something like, 'A cursed notebook causes a young man, who is being chased by a private detective, to kill criminals of the world.' If you can do this, writing the story will be a breeze.

, If your setting is make-believe, then make sure you think of some history that happened there and some areas around it. If it's a real place like Japan, wiki it and see your results. Use some of that information in your manga.

, Make a protagonist and an antagonist, and state their likes and dislikes, fears, and especially their history. Remember, all characters should be 3-D, not 2-D. What this means is that make the character do things unpredictable. Maybe they have an oddity about them? For example, maybe they're clumsy or have a really bad temper or obsessed with their hair? It's completely up to you. Remember, your characters basically make the whole story. Every story has at least one main character and one person or thing who opposes them, as well as a supporting cast. Give everyone different appearances so that you can distinguish them at a glance. This can be especially useful if you're not that good at drawing. Making characters really challenges your creative side, but can be really fun!

, If you're not that good at drawing, then try to find someone who is. You could write the story, and the other person could draw it out. Many mangas have been written like this, including Death Note. But, your story has to be really good if you want a really good artist. And, also, make sure you do not to suddenly change the plot line or else your artist might get stressed out from all the drawing and re-drawing he/she has to do. And you probably don't want that, right?

, Many people use mangas as a How to Draw manga. Its always good to get into a manga, or into the thought about a manga, before you work. Just don't copy. That would be plagiarism.

Consider writing fan fiction for existing games or television shows or short detective stories.,

Day 3-5 Writing the Climbing Action.,
Days 6 and 7 Writing the Climax.,
Day 8 Writing the Conclusion.,
Days 9 and 10 Patching the Holes.",How to Write a Novel in 10 Days or Less," The reason for this is that you would not have much time for characterization and details, which are essential in writing good novels. Depending on the amount of time you are willing to give, you can produce anything from a short 5000-word story to a popular 50,000-word fan fiction.;
, If you are the type of person who works 9 to 5 every weekday, consider delaying your novel-writing ambitions for a later date. It's better to do this when you are on holiday, or have a long weekend. For even a 10,000-word short story, you need to put in a lot of work-possibly a good 12 hours if you're not a professional writer. Prepare to put aside at least 3-4 hours of your time every day. With that in mind, you are ready to begin.

, You have to PLAN. 95% of writers don't plan enough before they write, leading to anti-climatic endings and abandoned works that have good potential. That is exactly why there is 1 Dan Brown and 1 million anonymous writers who have 1 article on their blog that's never been read. You have to plan. Start by thinking what kind of novel you wish to write. Estimate how long you want it to be. Then come up with a good plot. You can do this by brainstorming on a vanguard sheet. Write down different ideas you want in your story and cut them out, then rearrange the thought bubbles to form a plotline. Remember, a good plot has to have the 4 Cs: Characterization, Climbing action, Climax and Conclusion. If you plan on writing a short story from scratch, make sure you think up each of your characters properly. Write down any character traits you want them to have, and imagine their physical appearance in your mind. That way, it is much easier to describe them. That is why you should start by writing fan fiction: a lot less scene-setting and characterization is required. Now that you have your ideas in place, you should read through the thought bubbles and look for any loopholes. If one idea jumps to the next too quickly, try connecting them with another idea. Remember that you may have many good ideas, but you can never include all of them. For a good plot, you have to sacrifice a potentially good idea or two in order for the story to flow smoothly. If you have extra time after this, you should probably write a 'chapter guide'. Make little boxes on a piece of paper for each chapter you wish to write, and write down in point form what you wish to convey to your reader in each box. If you think your plot is plausible, you are ready to start writing. You can always make little tweaks here and there along the way, so don't spend too long thinking up the perfect plot at the planning stage.

, It is always important to have a good prologue or introduction in your novel. A good introduction must always have a good 'hook' to capture your reader's attention. A good hook always describes the scene in vivid detail. Imagine your reader as a Martian who has never been to Earth before. Paint down each minute detail of the scene through the character's perspective. Emotions are also extremely important. Write down what the main character is feeling. Let your reader identify with your characters. That is the secret to a good hook. When you are done with your hook, move on to characterization. Tell your reader what each character is like. It is always good to give examples. For example, instead of saying 'Professor Jackson is an extremely talented, yet arrogant person,' say 'Professor Jackson glanced at his watch. 8.55am. 'Right on time,' he thought. He never failed to be late for work, just so that he could look for the thousandth time at his countless certificates of outstanding contribution for everything from the discovery of antimatter to atomic structure research. This was to make sure he would not leave out a single one when boasting at the pub later that day.' The show-not-tell technique never fails to work. Also, if you are writing a fan fiction, you do not need to dwell on characterization as the characters are already well-known. Another important aspect of the introduction is to tell your reader the main conflict. Every good novel has a central conflict that the main characters try to solve, and this has to be clear to the reader by the end of the first two or three chapters.

, From the introduction, steadily build up the action to the climax. If you want, you can also focus on and develop the relationship between the characters, although this is not necessary for a short story. Make sure the main character(s) face a few minor conflicts while making their way to the central problem. Remember, a good novel does not have only one climax, but several minor conflicts leading up to the climax. It is important to build up the action bit by bit so that the reader won't lose interest before the climax. Some conflict ideas you might like to consider would be some of the non-main characters being in a perilous situation where the main character has to save them or one of the good guys turning out to be a traitor.

, The climbing action should have led the characters right up to the climax. This is when the main character jumps into action, and confronts the antagonist. Make sure to include lots of details, dialogue and emotions to make this part exciting. Inner emotional conflicts of the main character never fail to work. Remember that this is the final battle, and you have to put a great deal of effort into it. Make sure that you have done proper planning before this. Most writers who haven't planned get stuck here and have to resort to a cheesy ending. That is the last thing you want. Make sure there is a good deal of action. If you haven't been writing much details, this is the time to plonk it all in. Go for it. It's now or never.

, After the climax is over and the main conflict resolved, the main characters can go back to normal. Don't make it overly dramatic, but try to give your story the ending you desire. There shouldn't be too much action, but emotions have to be there. Whether you want to portray those last words and emotions of the main character's lover as she dies from a bullet wound or depicting the protagonist returning to his tranquil home, the emotions have to be there.

, If you've gotten so far without getting stuck, give yourself a good pat on the back. However, don't quit now — you're nearly done! You have to patch up the loopholes for your audience to get a satisfying read. Scan through your story quickly for any grammatical, spelling or punctuation errors you have missed and correct them. Then read in detail, and improve on any areas which you think where more details can be added or redundant portions should be removed. If there are loopholes in the plot, try to patch them up as best as you can. Lastly, get a friend or family member to read through your story and give you any comments. There is always room for improvement, so be humble and make changes where necessary. Proof-read one last time and Ta-da! You're done!

Many emerging artists start on Deviant Art. To sign up for a username, provide an e-mail address and start posting. You can post individual panels from your manga, art of the characters, or publish the manga in its entirety.


Interact with people on the site. Talk to people to get your name out there. Browse other people's art. Leave comments and feedback. The goal is to network so people will come to browse your art.Choose a username that is memorable. Your username should also be something you want connected with you art when you get ready to publish it.;
, Artists and people interested in graphics look up tutorials. Post a tutorial about something you are skilled at. This can be drawing animals, shading, or using a drawing program.Many people don't know how to go from doing one-shot art pieces to full manga. Make a tutorial that explains how you developed your manga.


Tutorials help build your reputation as knowledgeable and helpful. This is a good way to get your name out, but also get people to look up to you.
These tutorials can be posted on Deviant Art, or other social media sites like Tumblr.

, A website gives people a place to go to check out your art and your biography. You can also link to your manga from your website when you get ready to publish it.You may want to post pages of your manga for free to entice readers to buy it. Or, if you have more than one manga, post one for free on your website and then sell another one.


You can pay for domain space or try free sites. Domain space requires a yearly or monthly fee; free sites have ads. Take that into consideration before building one.
Instead of a website, try creating a Tumblr. On Tumblr, people can reblog your work so that you get a wider audience. You can also create links to your social media accounts. Tumblr could be a good way for you to interact with people, take prompts, and build a following.

, Before you start charging for your work, post free web comics. Web comics help get people interested in your art. They also showcase your talent. This helps people want to see more of your art. The goal is to introduce people to your art, make your name known, and have them like your art enough to buy it one day.For manga, you may want to publish panels or pages as a serial. Release a new page or panel once a week. That way you can practice your manga skills and promote yourself as a manga artist.


You can post the web comics on Deviant Art, Drunk Duck, or Smack Jeeves. These three sites are geared towards hosting web comics.
Post the web comic everywhere else, too. Put it on Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, Pintrest, or any other social media site. You want to get your art seen by as many people as possible.
The web comics can be short one shots. They also can be installments of an ongoing manga. Consider drawing fanart of popular media, like movies and television shows.

, Once people know who you are, offer to draw commissions. Charge a small fee in exchange for drawing prompts that people would like to see.


Commissions allow you a chance to make a small profit for your art work. It can also help you gauge interest in your work.
Charge different prices for different levels of difficulty. Full color art with multiple characters will cost more than a black and white sketch.

, You are trying to get your name noticed, but this doesn't mean posting art constantly. Focus on the quality of the art you post. Spend time on it, polish it off, and perfect it before posting. Posting your best work shows your followers that your work is always worth looking at., For an aspiring manga artist, you may want to start by printing your own. This is cheaper than getting a self-publishing press to print it into a book. The money spent will only be materials. This is ideal if you want to give away your manga to promote yourself.


Try a mini-comic. A mini-comic has 9 pages. The size is small, usually 4.25x5.5in. The mini-comic is good for novices who have little experience with publishing manga.
Produce a larger comic book. This book can range anywhere from 25-80 pages. The size can either be 5x8in or 8x11in. This method is good for longer stories.
If you are doing either of these, keep the original untouched. Don't staple it. You want it pristine so you can make copies of it for additional books., There are multiple ways to self-publish your digital manga once it is finished. Programs like Kindle Comic Converter will convert your digital files into an e-book so you can promote it through digital platforms.Kindle Direct Publishing is one platform to self-publish your manga.
ComiXology Submit is another platform for self-publishing digital manga. When you submit to this site, your manga goes through a quality test to ensure that only high quality comics and manga is offered for sale on their website.Kobo Writing Life is an self-publishing e-book site. Signing up for an account is free. They will create an e-pub for you., Multiple presses let you self-publish print books. These presses let you upload your content, choose a cover, and then print copies for a fee. Some presses let you sell online so that people can order a copy from the internet and have it shipped to their home.

Lulu.com is a self-publishing website that allows you to put together affordable print books. For an 8.5x8.5in full color booklet containing 20 pages, the base price is around $13. Then you can sell the book on their website.
Cafe Press lets you self-publish 8x8in hard cover books ranging from 20-60 pages. The price starts at $35.
Other presses, like Doujin Press, only publish manga and comics. Some will publish as little as 25, while other will publish 1,000 copies or more. This might be a route to go if you plan on selling them on your own website or in person.

, Get a vendor table at an anime or comic book convention. Try selling your work there. This is a great way to talk to people about your manga, make connections, and promote your name. However, there is a lot of competition at a convention. Try selling your manga for cheap to encourage people to buy it.


Don't limit yourself to selling your manga. Sell art prints, postcards, or buttons of your art work at the convention. This helps generate business and get people interested in you.
If you don't have the money or time for a booth, give away manga for free. Hand out manga to people at the convention. This gets your art into people's hands. Make sure you have your website in a place people easily can find it so they can visit you., After you self-publish your manga, try to find other artists who will let you advertise in their manga. In return, you let them advertise their mangas in the back of your book. This helps promote your work while helping you make connections with other artists.


Only advertise manga that you truly like. You want to believe in what you are promoting.
Try to advertise in manga that is in the same genre as yours. If you write action-packed adventure stories, don't advertise at the back of a romance manga., Get in touch with your local comic book store owners. Talk to them about allowing you to give away free copies of your manga. You may even convince them to let you sell your manga in their store.


Put up fliers in the comic book store that advertises your manga. Make sure it has your name, contact information, and the address for your website so people can go check out your work.
Leave business cards by the register., Many colleges have manga and anime clubs. There are also local meetup groups for people interested in the genre. Get in touch with these groups. Talk to the members about manga, art, and other similar interests.


See if the club or meetup group would be willing to let you come talk to them. See if they will let you explain your process of creating a manga and getting it self-published. Give away free copies of your manga to the club members so they can read your work and get the word out.

Each individual manga page will start off with a few fields of information, like alternate names, authors, genres, type, rating, etc. Scroll down a little to find a short synopsis. Under that will show the latest discussion threads from the forum about that particular manga. The ""Go to Forum"" button to the right of this will take you to the main forum section for that manga. Underneath this are the manga chapters! They start from the most recently updated, so you will need to scroll down to the bottom of the page for the very first chapter. Once you've chosen a chapter, just click through the pages and read!

, If you still couldn't find what you were looking for, go to http://www.mangafox.com/directory/ by clicking on the ""Manga Directory"" link from the bar at the top. Once you're there, a list of all the manga they have on file should pop up. Clicking on the headers for each column will order the list by that particular field, so you can order the list by title alphabetically, by overall rating, by number of views, by number of chapters and by how recently it was last updated.

, Clicking the ""Option"" button on the Manga Directory page will open up a plethora of ways you can narrow down your manga selection.


Choose from Japanese Manga, Korean Manwha, Chinese Manhua or Any. They generally have different drawing styles, and manwha and manhua are read left to right as opposed to right to left.
Do you have a favourite author or artist? Here you can filter down the selection to include only works by them, if you want.
Narrow down by genre. Hovering your mouse over the name of a genre will display a quick description of it if you're not completely sure what it is. If you click once on the genre name it will include it in your search; twice and it will exclude it from your search and clicking three times will just deselect it again. So, for example: Clicking twice on Drama will completely exclude all manga tagged with the drama genre from your search results.
Filter by year. Different years will have different content and different styles of drawing, on the whole. You can specify that the manga is from a particular year, or that it originates before or after a particular year, e.g. all manga first published after 1995.
Pick your rating. You can do this to choose manga of a particular rating to show up in your search, however instead you could just order the results you do get by rating.
Specify whether you want a completed series or not. Series that aren't completed may have stopped in the middle of the story and will not be updated again. Also with incomplete series, you might have to wait a while before the ending is published. However, the incomplete series are mostly a lot more recent, and it is easy to check for updates using the bookmarks feature or something like the All Mangas extension for Google Chrome. It's your choice.

, Have you ever watched Naruto? In the early episodes, they leave the smallest hints you couldn't even give the main interest at.. and they add it as a part of the story!

Don't do this too much, or the reader won't be surprised!

, Who are they, what is there purpose? Who has fought / challenged them? If your character is innocent, make the villain opposed; the villains should be clever. If your character is clever, still keep the villains how they are. Hey, sometimes the villains might work for someone stronger than them. Add twists to your Anime. Remember, villains make the plot.

Choose an interesting title for your work of literature.,
You're going to need a reliable narrative voice throughout your book.,
Now that you've decided what your narrative will be like, come up with some 'trademarks' and catchphrases that can be inserted in to your book (and its inevitable sequels!).,
Set some rules for your style.,
Now all you've got left to do is actually start writing your book.,
Now, all you need is a story!!",How to Write Teen Literature," Ideally, you'll want certain buzzwords that your demographic can respond to: for the 9-11 market, try ""boys"". For the 11-14s, go for something that suggests a 'social scale'. Mean Girls was inspired by a book called Queen Bees and Wannabes. Your title needs to have lots of 'zing', helped along by clever puns (It's Not Easy Being Mean) or lines from songs.;
, It can give some personality to the work, as your characters may end up having very little. First-person tales are effective and easy to relate to, but be careful not to make the book sound whiny. Third-person allows you to describe multiple points of view.

, Gossip Girl has those lovable sarcastic one-word paragraphs. The Clique separates words in to syllables (ah-dorable!) for those readers who don't know how to pronounce hard words.

, Are you going to describe each and every outfit, or only on certain characters? Which characters do you like, and who do you hate - will you make this obvious when writing? How vivid are you going to be with emotions: ""Mary was sad"" vs. ""Mary felt like a stiletto had just stabbed her C-cups in the middle of a sample sale, and now she'd have to get $50,000 surgery.""

, But first, you need some characters. Don't have too many, but keep a wide variety in order to have the reader interested. Try not to make two characters clones of the other, even if they 'worship' her. Below you'll find character outlines of some popular teen-lit stereotypes.


Firstly, you need The Mean Girl. No book is quite the same without her! There are a few variables, but on the whole, every mean girl is the same. She will have a crowd of adoring minions, her glossy parents will give her anything she wants, and she will repeatedly be, well, mean to anyone that comes in her way. She's a fun character to write, but make sure to give your mean character some unique points. For example, does she have a 'dark past'? Did she used to hang out with losers or even the The New Girl?

The Hot Boy/The Jock is completely necessary in any teen lit work. He will be inhumanly good looking, probably with superhuman strength and have impossibly colored eyes. By way of convention, he will need to be going out with The Mean Girl, but it will be a relationship of convenience rather than love. There are two types of Hot Boys/Jocks: those who are revealed to be lovely, and those who are revealed to be jerks. This dictates which girl he ends up with in the end, but he will never be single. The key when writing about him is how you describe his looks, because this description will be the motivation for many things that will happen in your book. His personality is not too important, and never write from his point of view as he will have nothing interesting to think.

The New Girl is an eternally used device in any book. Think of the possibilities! She is often pure, unscathed, and from a land very much unlike the setting the rest of the characters have grown up with. She too will have her qualities: probably threateningly pretty, and with a heightened sense of moral judgment that differentiates her from her peers. Uniquely, she will be immune to the wanton charms of The Jock but only if indeed he turns out to be a jerk. She is a popular choice for the first-person narrative, and usually the most fully-developed character. Make sure to document her first impressions of your other characters, particularly The Mean Girl, who she will inevitably have some sort of relationship with.

The Sidekick is always a source of amusement to readers, so make sure to have your sidekick be a hilarious but completely hopeless pushover. She will worship The Mean Girl completely, being less beautiful, less intelligent, and overall less interesting. She may, in the occasional book, end up having a good heart, and form a friendship with The New Girl, against The Mean Girl's wishes. When describing her, make her real wishes clear: does she hand The Mean Girl her nail polish ""eagerly"" or ""reluctantly""?

, Keep chapters of a good length, and make sure the book is not too repetitive. You'll want some key turning points in the plot - these will probably involve a cat-fight, kissing/sex (depending on your age group), and mass humiliation for a certain character.

Research wolves.,
Research humans’ opinions on wolves.,
Research wolf fiction.",How to Write Wolf Fiction1," Actual, real wolves. Start with doing research on real life wolves, and not with researching others’ wolf fiction. You can never be sure what is real facts, and what the authors of fiction have made up. To write good, original wolf fiction, you should get to know real wolves and create your own impression of them. Create your own understanding of wolves based on reality.


Watch youtube videos on wolves. There are a lot of really good documentation videos on wolves on youtube, ready to be watched any time. Look for videos on wolves in their natural habitat. One of the best things with learning from watching is that you get a lot of visual information. You can see all the small things wolves do and develop visual impressions that you can later use in descriptions on your own wolf fiction.
Read non-fiction. Read books and articles on wolves. Learn their habits and their biology. You certainly do not have to get into super-scientific details, but you should know of their family structures, most prominent instincts, normal hunting techniques – stuff like that.
Take notes. The mind is forgetful. Take notes of small things which may easily slip your mind or which simply caught your interest. Some examples may be the way cubs lick adults’ mouths in order for them to throw up food for the young ones to eat, or the way a large submissive wolf will hunch over to seem smaller and less threatening. Or perhaps the way wolves whine when they gather for a hunt or some such.;
, Wolves have long lived alongside humans, and they reside in some really old tales. Wolves have come to represent a wide array of things in various cultures. Today, a lot of people hate wolves to the extent of wanting the species extinct, while others seriously love them. Find out why. Research the relationship between wolves and humans. This step might be of less value if you plan on excluding humans entirely from your fiction, but it can still be educating.


Read about mythologies containing wolves. For an example, there is the wolf Fenrir in Norse mythology. The legends say that when he breaks loose of his chains, he shall devour the great god Odin and Ragnarok – the end of the world – thus comes. The people of that culture struggled through cold and dark winters – winters which were hard for wolves, as well. And a hungry, desperate wolf may very well attack an unsuspecting human. It makes sense that the people would come to fear wolves and see them as evil predators of the dark.
Listen to opinions. Hear what the wolf-lovers have to say. Hear what the wolf-haters have to say. You certainly don’t have to agree with any of it, but try to see where each person is coming from and what motivates their opinion of wolves. This can give you inspiration by pointing out a wide range of traits wolves have, that you may not think of yourself.

, Now that you have taken a good look at reality, it might be a good idea to start looking at the wolf fiction already in existence. See what has been done before. This can be good to get inspiration, or find an unexplored area in which you want to set up camp.


Read pieces of wolf fiction that vary as much as possible. Read Jack London’s classical White Fang, and maybe even Call of the Wild (technically the latter is a dog-centered book, but it is a great example of canine fiction). Read an innocent children’s story, read a piece of urban fiction with sexy werewolves for young adults… Try it all!

"
Begin with an aphoristic observation.,
Start with a concise fact.,
Open with a deceptively complex statement.,
Use the first line to establish an element.",How to Write the First Sentence of a Book1," Many classing novels open with a universal truth being mused over by the narrator. For example, Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy begins with the line, “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”Think about what your novel is about. Is it addressing family relations? Personal struggles? A person's capacity to be his/her own downfall?
Once you've narrowed down the larger issue(s) at play in your novel, you can begin to think about that issue in a more poetic way.
Try to arrive at some type of universal truth on your subject. If you can't come up with your own, you can always quote a famous aphorism.
For inspiration or to find a strong aphorism you can quote, try searching online. You might start with MIT's compilation of Hippocrates's aphorisms, which can be found at http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/aphorisms.html.;
, If aphoristic observations don't fit with your narrator's voice, you might try opening with a concise statement from the narrator. Many classic novels open this way, including Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man (""I am an invisible man."") and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (""It was a pleasure to burn."").Think about what kind of personality your narrator has. Delve deep into his biggest triumphs, his greatest struggles, and his ultimate downfall (if he has one).
Put yourself in your narrator's shoes. How might he/she bring a reader up to speed in one or two concise, all-encompassing sentences.
It may be helpful to imagine yourself as the narrator having a conversation with an unseen partner, perhaps over coffee or drinks. What would your narrator say in a moment of absolute truth that would make for a jumping off point in your story?

, Some authors of well-known novels have chosen to begin their books with a simple fact that carries a larger significance. Try to start with an observation that appears simple on the surface, but after the reader has finished the novel it will become clear that this sentence carries a lot more weight than it seemed.This type of opening line may work best if you finish a draft of your novel, then return to rewrite the beginning during the revision process. You'll need to know what happens and how each character develops on the page in order to give a meaningful, complex statement in the opening line.
As you read through the first draft of your novel, think to yourself, ""Where does the key to the main character's psyche, struggle, or ultimate victory lie?""

, A classic strategy for writing the first line of a book is to establish some literary element that will carry the reader into the narrative. You can use the opening line to establish the mood of the book, introduce the narrator's voice (or a main character's voice), or frame the time and place in which the book takes place.There's no right or wrong method here. You may have to play with different establishing elements until you find the one that works best for your book.
Think about what would work best to orient the reader into your book, and go from there.

Decide on a setting.,
Decide on the intellect of wolves.,
Why wolf fiction?",How to Write Wolf Fiction2," This is a good place to start. Determine what world your story will take place in. Is it a our world? Our world with a few changes, or perhaps 3000 years ago? A fantasy world with no humans at all, or a world with humans, elves, orcs and demons? This decision will have a major impact on the life of your wolves.


Currently, wolves are scarce in most parts of the world and human hunters pose a major threat – something you can use in your story to create conflict and tragedy. Perhaps you will want to write the story of a wolf set on taking revenge on humans for what they have done to the wolf species.
In a fantasy world, humans may have such powerful magical skills that they need not fear wolves in the dark winter night. Or the wolves are magical or perhaps even have wings. How might this impact the relationship between wolves and humans?

, Determine how sentient the wolves in your fiction will be. Do they have clear thoughts and speak of the past and the future, just like we humans do? Or are their thoughts without words, but rather full of scents, images and basic urges like hunger?


If you are aiming for werewolf fiction – how does your werewolf character’s mind change when they transform? Are their minds the same, or does it change entirely? Is the mind of an un-shifted werewolf the same as a human?

, Take a minute to think about why you are going to write wolf fiction. Why are the characters in your story wolves? Why are they not humans, tigers or horses? What do you want to show or have said with your story, and how does having a wolf character help in conveying that message? Figure out what the wolf adds to the fiction.

Research wolves: This is extremely important, whether you choose to make it realistic or not.,
Decide your plot.,
Decide how the book is narrated.,
Write the beginning.,
Build on the story a bit more.,
Make the plot clearer after several chapters, or for short stories then start on the plot soon after the beginning.,
Overcome any writers block.,
Write the middle of the book.,
Finish it off.,
Revise.",How to Write Wolf Fiction3," Wolf fiction is best when it has plenty of realistic wolf behavior. Research their diet, fur,and hunting as well as anything else you encounter and you're unsure of.

, Short stories usually are about one significant event. You could write about a wolf's last hunt, for example. A novel is more like a set of events that connect somehow, the best ones have complex lines that surprises the reader yet all fits with each other perfectly. Most mystery novels have that.


Make sub plots, such as two cubs playing tag during an event or little mini story lines that are appreciated.

, Is it a wolf telling the story (first person), the author seeming to tell the story (third person), or even a character using words like ""you"" as if you're a character in the story (second person)? Find which one your best at or stretch your limits. Whatever you do, make sure your enjoy it.

, Many wolf authors start with the main character being born, but you could also introduce the main character doing something else, such as hunting. Or even you could start by introducing the mother for the first chapter/next few chapters and then the character is born or a friend meeting the main character. Add detail but don't add so much that it confuses the reader, more than three sentences of detail is too much. Remember, you need to make the reader comfortable with the book. It's like making a friend, make a good first impression and slowly introduce the book.

, Keep introducing the main character and add a few snippets of what would become the plot. Example: The wolf always wondered what hunting would be like.

, Sub plots can come in between the beginning and the middle and an event or two, big or small is always good as a filler. But make sure you don't bore the reader

, You might want to write another part of the book, such as the end, pretend to "" interview "" a character, introduce a new one or even just read some other wolf fiction such as White Fang by Jack London or Promise of the Wolves by Dorothy Hearst. Remember, give yourself a chance to breathe. You don't have to write 24/7.

, This is where the conflict is and something happens that needs to be fixed. Lace it with suspense as well. The plot needs to come Hard and understandable. Have a few down moments but give the reader enough hope for the end.

, Make it happy but also make room off another book if your willing. The reader needs to feel happy and satisfied with the ending and whole book.

, It was coming and despite the fact many writers dread it, clearing the first draft of all errors and even adding extra chapters or taking away the not needed can be quite enjoyable. You may want to let the book sit for at least a week before revising.

Decide what the poem is about: Poems are usually dramatic such as a hunt, but it could also be a very short story of a wolf making friends or something else.

,
Decide whether your poem is a rhyming couplet ex.,
Write the poem.,
Add to it if desired.",How to Write Wolf Fiction4,", There once was a wolf that was fluffy/It's fur was rather stuffy, A haiku, usually a sentence where one sentence is five syllables, the next seven, the next five a again, ex. The wolf was howling/ it was singing in wolf talk/howl, wolf, howl loudly/ Or another type of poem.

, Make sure the words flow right. Decide if the poem is silly, sad, or beautiful.

, You might want to write a series of poems, maybe they could have to do with a book you wrote or liked. Whatever you write make sure you have fun!

"
"
Choose an inciting incident.,
Decide how to introduce the characters.,
Think about how to orient the reader.,
Put it all together.,
Write the last sentence of the first chapter.",How to Write the First Sentence of a Book2," Most novels involve some type of inciting incident - an occurrence or situation that sets the novel's action in motion. Whether or not the inciting incident takes place in the opening sentences of a novel, the beginning of the book should set up the incident that will propel the remainder of the narrative.An inciting incident should establish the main character's initial, ""surface-level"" problem. That problem will end up setting the stage for the larger issues that the character struggles with throughout the novel.
No matter what the final outcome of your novel will be, the main character should struggle and fail to overcome his initial surface problem. If it were a problem he could overcome with ease, there would be no novel beyond that inciting incident.
Whatever actions the main character (and the supporting characters) takes to resolve the initial problem should be a flawed action. Whether it's a failure of the character's ethics, or simply a circumstance that is larger than she realizes, she must struggle and set up future problems that will be addressed in the novel.

, The first chapter of a novel should at least introduce the main character, if not other characters as well. However, how you introduce that character (and any supporting characters) can mean the difference between a natural progression of events and a jarring intrusion in the narrative.


Don't front-load a character's backstory. If you're giving the character's life history before you've even established the plot, readers will get confused or turned off by the novel.
Remember to make your characters believable. Don't try to write a hero who is always absolutely good or a villain who is always absolutely evil - no one in real life can be defined this way, so your characters shouldn't be either., The beginning of a novel serves as a sort of orientation for the reader. It should seize the reader's attention, drop her (either abruptly or gradually) into the setting and mood of the narrative, and introduce at least the main character.There are a number of ways to do this, and the choice ultimately lies in your tastes and what you think will best set up your story.


Beginning with a description of a scene or a character is a common way to start a novel. But long-winded descriptions can easily bore a reader, especially if she isn't already invested in the novel.
Opening with a piece of dialogue is a good way to introduce the main character and show how she interacts with others (which can be very revealing). However, dialogue can be tricky, and opening the book with dialogue could turn off readers who don't like the way the character speaks.
Many novels begin ""in medias res,"" a Latin term meaning ""in the middle of things."" This means starting the book somewhere in the middle of the action that would otherwise take a few chapters to unfold and build up to., Once you've outlined the main character's personality, the inciting incident, and how to orient the reader in your novel, you'll need to put it all together. This is where you stop planning and start actually writing the first sentence of your novel.


Don't be afraid to try different approaches. Write your first sentence a few different ways (in medias res, opening with description, etc.) and see what feels most natural for you and most appropriate for your story.
Try not to let this step intimidate you. Remember that you can always go back and edit, revise, or cut scenes out entirely - but you can only make changes once you've actually put your pen to the page (or started typing out on the keyboard).

, It may sound strange that starting a book from the first sentence should require an ending to the first chapter. But some experts advise that it can help you stay on track and find some sense of direction for each chapter, including the very beginning of your novel.Think of each chapter as a journey from point A to point B.
Your first sentence, which you now have, is point A. Without a point B in mind, you could end up wandering aimlessly and forget what you intended for that chapter to accomplish.
You can always change the last sentence once you get to the end of the chapter. The point is to give yourself some type of concrete end point to work towards.

"
"
Choose a form.,
Figure out your end point.,
Start writing.,
Keep your perspective in check.",How to Write the First Sentence of a Book3," Nonfiction is a broad genre, covering anything that is not made up. That can include memoir, personal essays, a history book, a cook book, self-help guides, and even travel guides.Before you start writing a nonfiction book, you should have a pretty good idea of what kind of book you're hoping to write.


Personal essays are often reflective/meditative, and can deal with past or current events in your life. An essay should explore a topic or event thoroughly, examining it from all angles and looking past the surface of things.Memoir tends to contextualize a singular event or situation from the past, analyzing it with new insight from the present. Memoirs often address why an event was significant, what it meant at the time for the writer, and why it's important to her now.Instructive books, such as travel guides, self-help books, and cook books, tend to be equal parts research and instruction. You'll need to know what you're talking about (with credible, authoritative sources) and you'll need to be able to tell a reader what to do and when to do it.
History books require extensive research, and often need some type of authority on the part of the author. If you don't have a degree in history, readers may question why you're qualified to write about historical events.

, Just as a novel requires the author to know where her book is leading, so too does a nonfiction book. Without knowing what your narrative is leading up to, you risk rambling aimlessly trying to get there.


Figure out your nonfiction book's narrative arc. What is everything building towards, and what information/details are necessary to carry a reader along to that point?
Break down your narrative into a series of events and the complications that surround each event. For example, one event in your book might be your birthday party, and the complication might be that your parents forgot it was your birthday.
Each action, obstacle, and person described in the book should contribute towards the book's endpoint. If they're not relevant, no matter how interesting they might be, you may need to cut them out., Unlike a novel, you can't just create characters and scenes in your head. Nonfiction requires the people and experiences to be real, and the dialogue should be as true as possible (taking into account the limiting factor of memory). How you decide to begin your nonfiction book should be a natural starting point for the true story you're trying to tell.


Just like a novel, a narrative nonfiction book (specifically a memoir or essay collection) should have some type of initiating incident. You can't make up the incident as you would in fiction, so figure out what event really set your life up for the larger events your book is about.
Starting the book with the initiating incident, or even beginning it in medias res, can hook your reader with the intensity of the actions or tragedy that occurred in your life.
Many nonfiction books begin with what's called a status quo scene: a depiction of what your life looked like before the initiating incident. It's a good way to draw a reader in, because she knows that something will inevitably shake up the way your life is at the beginning and is motivated to keep reading., It goes without saying that a memoir or personal essay collection will be told from your point of view. Everything that happens in the book should have happened to you, and you're obligated to tell those stories as completely and truthfully as possible. However, many people have a hard time keeping their personal perspective in check while writing about real life events. Everyone experiences an event differently, and everyone will have a differing perspective about the details of what happened, so tread carefully as you write about your life and the people/events in it.


Don't write yourself as a hero or a victim. Even if you feel that way, it will be clear to the reader that there are things being withheld, or it might turn readers off altogether.
Remember that you're just like everyone else: a real, living, slightly flawed human being. You're not perfect, and the people in your life are not objectively bad or malicious.
Everything requires balance in storytelling. Even if your memoir is about your troubled childhood, no reader will believe that you were unhappy 24/7, so balance those heartbreaking moments of tragedy with some lighter moments that depict your best days side-by-side with your worst."

Make every sentence relevant.",How to Write the First Sentence of a Book4," Before you begin any writing project, it's important to have a firm idea in mind of what you're writing about. This may sound obvious, but it's an important part of planning out any book-length project.


Know the story you want to tell.
Decide which characters (real life people or invented, fictional characters) are relevant.
Recognize what the crisis is in your story - and every story needs some type of crisis.
Remember that every good story, whether fiction or nonfiction, should include some type of personal discovery/revelation that leads to some kind of subsequent change., Some writers feel that an outline is too restrictive. While that may be true for some people, many writers can easily get off track without an outline. You risk rambling and going on irrelevant tangents, or even forgetting to include some pertinent detail or event. A good outline should include:


a solid understanding of your subject
the narrative arc of your book (what everything is building towards)
the primary setting of each scene
the characters involved (whether real or imagined)
what each scene or chapter is attempting to accomplish (within the context of your narrative arc), Some beginning authors try to make the first chapter a prologue, or spend page after page describing a scene/landscape. Others try to use a false beginning, like a dream sequence that feels real. However, literary agents and audiences alike often feel unsatisfied or even cheated by these beginnings. Instead of relying on tricks or artifice, make every page relevant, engaging, and well-written.Avoid tangential or irrelevant descriptions. Remember the piece of advice Anton Chekhov shared: if you put a loaded gun in a scene, it must go off.Cut down on unnecessary descriptions by omitting needless adverbs and adjectives. If the reader can get an image of what you're describing from the nouns and verbs (and some limited adjectives), an adverb describing the verb is probably unnecessary.Remember the old adage, ""Show, don't tell"" - in other words, depict the scene, person, or action, rather than telling the reader about it.
Remember that not every single landscape, building, person, and action need a lot of showing. Focus on what's important and let the reader's imagination fill in the rest.

Read a lot!,
Find your inspiration.,
Take notes.,
Find out your favorite writing genre.,
Create a conception for your story/novel.,
Create the setting for your story.,
Start writing the different parts of your story/novel.,
Review your work!",How to Write Stories and Novels," Reading different types of literature can widen your knowledge, expand your artistic vocabulary and increase your knowledge.;
, Try to find out what it is that triggers your talent and maximizes it. Try some of the following inspirations:



Time of day. Some people write more efficiently or are inspired in certain times of the day like sunset, sunrise, dusk and dawn.

Season of year. Find out your favorite time of year. Try more at these times.

Fine arts like music, paintings and sculptures can trigger your senses and talents to write.

Places like museums, historical places, ancient landmarks, natural places (like forests and beaches) or even public parks can trigger memories, thoughts and feeling in authors. Try to relax and think deeply when in such places.

Occasions and events like festivals and celebrations can be good times for an author to get inspiration about ideas and concepts. Some authors made their best pieces in the romance of a wedding, some in the tragedy of a funeral.

, Write down every thought, idea, feeling and interesting situation. Quotes, funny sentences and interesting facts or news items are also good to store in notes. You never know when they come in handy.



Store your notes. Do not throw anything away. Select a method of storing your notes like notebooks, computer software or even cartoon/paper cards.

Categorize your notes. Separate ideas from thoughts and thoughts from feelings. Also categorize your notes according to their topic, time and nature.

If you are using paper based storage, try dedicating separate drawers/shelves for different types of notes.
For computer based storage, create different directories and files for the different notes. Use specialized note-taking applications.



Go through your notes every now and then. Some of the oldest notes can come in handy in your newest story/novel.

, There are many genres to choose from, but you can find your own only by trying. Here are some ideas:


Read more about novel genres and learn the differences between them.
Read at least a sample from each genre. This will familiarize you with the genre.
Do not confuse your favorite writing genre with your favorite reading genre. You might enjoy love stories, yet you might be best at writing suspense ones!
The only true test is experiment. Try thinking of stories in each genre. See how far you can go.

, Conceptions are the guidelines for a stories and novels. They summarize the main theme of the story, so try to be as brief as you can.

, The setting of the story/novel is the general environment of the story. This includes:



The time/era/historical period of the story.

The place that the story takes place at. This might be a town, a country, a village or a fictional place or even plane/planet.

Characters of the story. Create a list of the main characters. This include protagonists and antagonists. Give your characters names and personalities. Tie the characters to places and events.

, Stories and novels vary in size from several few pages to volumes of thousands of pages. However, they all share the same basic structure:


An introduction/setting. This does not mean this part come first in the story or is written first. It is the part that introduces the reader to the elements of the story. It gives the user a brief about the time, place, and characters.
A beginning. This is usually underestimated, but adds great value and is an integral part of the story. This is the point in the story when the main events begin to occur. That might be the party that makes the two main characters fall in love. It can be the war that separates two lovers.
A conflict/tie/knot. This is what the story is mainly about. This is usually a mental, moral, ethical, or physical challenge or dilemma. Well the two lovers continue to love each other, well the man stop himself from stealing. It's usually a question you will keep wondering most of the story.
A Climax. This is where the events reach the maximum sophistication. Things are usually rather unclear at this point. Readers must be holding their breath waiting for the results and outcomes of these moments. Major events (like death, disaster and maybe marriage!), decisions (deciding to leave the fiancé, deciding to leave town and deciding to accept a marriage proposal) and the partial/full revealing of hidden information from the reader are all candidates for being the climax of a novel/story.
The ending/resolution. This is usually where all the answers are decided. They might be answered or not, but a clear understanding formulates in the mind of the reader about what this all has been about.

, This is the most important step. Every time you edit and review your work, it becomes better. Sometimes it is hard however to criticize one's self so here are some guidelines.


Start by proofreading. Do your own spell and grammar checks. This encourages you to correct things later on.
Leave a certain work for a while, do some other work and come back to the first. It is sometimes hard to edit works you are currently working on, so detach yourself from the work for a while.
Show parts of your work (never the whole thing) to people you trust. If you gave them the whole thing, they might refrain from telling you the truth thinking that this will hurt you especially when they see the whole work and the effort you've done on it.

Use the Hero's Journey.",How to Write Science Fiction," Science fiction frequently builds on scientific developments that have already captured our public imagination. If you’re struggling to develop a really good story, a good place to start is to turn to current scientific developments. By building on the latest science, you can avoid a lot of the same old cliches and write something that people are really excited to read.


For example, you can follow the Reddit thread called r/Futurology. This is an online forum which follows the current developments of science. The content should give you lots of ideas of what your future world could look like.;
, Getting inspiration from the classics of sci-fi can help you in writing your own work too. Don't shy away from it because you feel like might lead you to be unoriginal: reading from others can teach you a lot about what does and doesn't work in a novel. You can also learn about the way that sci-fi novels usually look or sound, letting you decide to stick with those aesthetics or break free of them entirely.


Good books to read include Dune, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and The Handmaid's Tale.
Try other genres of sci-fi as well. Sci-fi is a very complex genre and includes many sub-genres. You might want to check out hard science fiction, soft science fiction, steampunk, space opera, cyberpunk, and post apocalyptic.

, Science fiction is at its best when it teaches us about the world that we live in now. Sometimes when events are too close, people get too emotionally attached and they struggle to see things rationally. When you package current events in aliens and other planets, the ideas become easier to process and understand. Draw inspiration from current events that are important or interesting to you and tell the story in a way that removes some of the biases that people may have.


For example, the classic sci-fi Dune is really about post-WWII conflict in the Middle East, and told in a way that makes it easier for modern readers to understand the point of view of the desert people.

, You can also build your story off of a message that you want people to understand. This can actually be a really good way to build a book, because it gives you a path and a goal. When your story actually goes somewhere and has a final meaning, something for the reader to take away, it's much more likely to make an impact on them.


For example, maybe you want your readers to realize that grief is a toxic emotion. You could then write a story about how a starship admiral risks his career to redeem the reputation of his wife, who died betraying the Empire, and in turn loses his life instead.

, Science fiction can often look wildly different than the world we know. For many people, they have a hard time following and understanding a world so different from their own. If you want to make a story that resonates with a lot of people, write something that's rooted in the world we know.


For example, your main character might be from an alien race of tree people. However, your character still might emotionally struggle because it cannot find a mate.

, Science fiction, of course, includes lots of fiction. Nothing wrong with that. However, if the science in your science fiction is too far off of what people know about how things work, they won't buy it.It might even come across as poor writing, since sometimes fantastical science in science fiction is used to overcome problems with the plot. Don't give your readers an excuse to find problems with your writing: don't neglect science entirely.


The best example of this is the radio active spider bite. Back when Spider Man was created, people knew very little about radiation. Scientists seemed to be making all sorts of strides and who knew what they could make the substance do next. However, now people understand that if you get a giant dose of radiation, it mostly just kills you at different speeds. No super powers or rapid evolution. Don't write a radioactive spider bite.

, If you are using an alien or other fake language in your story, it can help if you set some basic rules for how the language sounds and works. This doesn't mean you have to full Tolkien Elvish on your book, just that it helps the reader's suspension of disbelief if there is some consistency to the language included in the text.


For example, you don't want to have a phrase like ""br'ack drack kagash met eerk"" and a phrase like ""lae kalai O'oro siita ai"" in the same language. Even though they're fake, they're clearly too different to likely come from the same language (one is heavy on consonants, the other on vowels). This can also ruin the characterization of your language. Think of it like mixing Klingon and Elvish.

, If your story takes place on an alien world or even on an Earth very different than this one, you might want to put some thought into developing the culture of that people or world. When your story looks very similar to modern day, it's easy to just let the reader assume that the culture is much the same. However, if you have aliens making Seinfeld joke, the reader will have a much more difficult time immersing themselves in your world.


Things you'll want to consider include the usual: music, art, what people do for fun, and religions. You might also want to think about politics and history, and how the changes in those areas might have affected race, gender equality, and other social factors that impact daily life.

, One of the main draws of science fiction is the feeling that the reader gets, like they're escaping from the world that they know into one which is more interesting. This means that you'll want to work to create an engaging world with enough depth to draw in a reader.


Think about things like geology, ecology, biomes, cities, countryside, and of course non-terrestrial locations as well like ships and stations. Whatever is best for story. Think about what makes those places tick and the kinds of problems that people might encounter when they exist in an environment like that.
For example, Frank Herbert's Dune is incredibly effective at drawing in readers with the image that he paints of a desert planet. Its vast sands, rocky mountains, giant worms, and subterranean oceans create a magical feeling that makes the plot even more engaging.
Consistency within the environment where your story takes place will also help your story feel more immersive and believable. You wouldn't want to stick Alice's Wonderland right next to the jungle of Apocalypse Now and if you did, you'd want it to make a lot of sense within the story.

, Conflict is one of the most important drivers of a story and there are all types of conflict that you can choose, depending on the kind of story you want to tell. The type of conflict tells the reader a lot about what you see as the important message of the text and what sort of themes they're meant to take away.


One example of type of conflict is Man Against Nature. This kind of story, which might be able a woman getting stranded on an alien planet, is generally about our struggles against all of the normal challenges in our life.
You can find more information about types of conflict here, in Step 2


, Writing a book is about more than just typing up sentences that are technically correct and tell a story. The words that you choose


Choose a narrative point of view. Narrative point of view is who is telling your story. Your options include first person, second person, and third person narrators. This will make the most noticeable difference in how your story reads. It will also play a huge role in what you do and don't share with your readers. For example, a first person narrator will not know what another character is thinking. You can use this to hide information from your audience, so that it can be revealed when needed.
Choose a narrative time. This is whether your story is being told in the past, present, or future. You can even mix within a book, using one for some chapters and another for others (doing this a lot, however, is not recommended). Each poses its own challenges or helps in other ways.
Choose a narrative voice. Narrative voice is how the story is told. Is it told as the narrator thinks it? Is it told through email (since letters are probably out for a science fiction)? Is the narrator reliable or unreliable?

, A writing style is all about the words that you choose to tell your story. Now, most people will do it naturally, but you'll want to look out for sections in your story where the styles don't match. This happens most commonly when you write it over a great deal of time, as you experience different emotions and influences. However you're telling your story, it should be the same all the way across or experience only subtle changes that make sense within the context of the story itself.


Read your story and compare different sections. Is it told in a funny way, like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy? Is it told in a serious way, like Dune? Do the characters talk like they come from a Shakespeare play or do they talk like teens in an 80s movie?

, The structure of a story is how it is told more broadly. The most common way to think of this is like the acts in a play, since many novelists still use this format for writing their own stories. You'll have the first section (where the story is introduced), the second section (where the story is developed), and the third section where the story is concluded. Now, there are more options than that particular structure of course, but that is the most common one.


The structure described in the step is called the ""three act structure"". You can also have two or four act structure, a cyclical structure (monomyth), or a nonlinear story.
So, for example, let's say you want to try the four act structure. This would be very similar to the three act, but between the beginning and conclusion acts, you'd have an act which establishes the stakes and then an act which develops the conflict.

, Pacing is how quickly the important events of the story happen. Pacing is crucial to any work of fiction and is especially key for works of science fiction (which are traditionally longer than most novels, at an average of around 100,000 words). If the pacing is off, the reader can have a hard time staying engaged as it makes the book too slow or too intense for real attachment to the characters to form.


If you struggle with pacing, make yourself a plot chart. Break your story into three acts, then break down each act into three arcs. Each arc is then broken down into three significant actions or plot points. For example, with Star Wars, an arc might look like ""The droids are captured by the Jawa, Luke finds the message from Leia, Luke meets Obi Wan"" or ""Luke sneaks onto the Death Star, Luke saves Leia, Obi Wan is killed"".

, A final tool you can put in your toolbox is the Hero’s Journey (sometimes called Monomyth). This is the theory, put forward by the famous mythologer Joseph Campbell, that all stories are basically the same story. Many good stories do fit into a basic format and you can use this as a skeleton to build off of when your plot feels aimless.


The basics of the monomyth should feel familiar to you. The hero is going about living a normal life when suddenly something changes and they're forced to venture into the unknown. The hero meets a cast of characters, has to endure some trials, but ultimately learns something that they can use to overcome some great challenge. With their task complete, they can return with this new wealth of experience to regular life.

Choose a genre and subgenres.,
Sketch out a general plot.,
Figure out how long it will be.,
Start your story at an interesting time.,
Find an ending that ties up all loose ends.,
Consider your audience.,
Make situations and story similar to the characters' personalities.",How to Write Your Own 'the Big Six' Story2," This can help you start understanding what your story will be about.


For example, an adventure story could feature trips across Guardian realms, with a romantic subplot of Elsa and Jack falling in love, and action in a fight with Pitch.

, Where will your story begin? What happens during the rising action? What about the climax? You don't need to have a perfect idea of what will happen in the story—you can work out the little details as you go—but it's good to have a general sense.

, Will it have chapters, and if so, approximately how many? What are the minimum and maximum word count lengths per chapter (for consistency)?


If you're releasing it one chapter at a time, have a buffer of at least two chapters ready to go.

, Most readers already know the characters—show them that something interesting is going on here. Some writers like to start en media res, or in the middle of the action. Others start with any sentences that poses an unusual scenario. Here are some sample first sentences.


Covered from head to toe in chocolate cream cheese frosting, it occurred to Anna that this was perhaps a bad idea.
No one understood the words Hiccup was mumbling, but his white face and shaking hands made it clear that something had happened.
Anna had tried spinning tops, fancy dresses, architecture diagrams, chocolate chip cookies, and silly songs, but nothing seemed to distract Elsa from the shadows she kept seeing in the hallways.

, The ending should show that the protagonist has undergone personal growth, and it should resolve major conflicts (or leave them open-ended for a sequel).

, What age range are you aiming for? What will they be expecting? What do they like?


Make sure that your language isn't too complex for your audience. When in doubt, use the simplest word.

,


For example, Rapunzel and Anna aren't afraid to dive into a situation, while Elsa's first tendency is usually to run away or negotiate. Thus it wouldn't make sense for Elsa to charge straight into battle while Rapunzel and Anna hang back.
Jack is very adventurous, while Rapunzel is open to adventure. Thus it would make sense for them to befriend each other and go on adventures together.

Mark any sexual or violent themes with a warning at the beginning.,
Consider adding an image to your story.,

, If it's turning into a text wall, it's time to break it up. Similarly, readers should be able to read sentences without getting lost.


Hit ENTER twice after each paragraph to space them out more and make reading easier.

, This will make your story more interesting.

, This way people can avoid it if they are too young, disinterested, at work, or emotionally unable to handle it. If you aren't sure, mark it.


Chapter 1 - WARNING mild sexual themes
Chapter 4 (blood tw)

, Only do so if it is an image you made yourself, or a picture you have permission to use (e.g. a stock photo that mentions that in its terms). If it isn't yours, link back to it so others can get a closer look if they like it.

, Try asking a friend to read it first too.

Send your work to online journals for publication.",How to Write Flash Fiction," You don’t want to waste valuable words setting up a complex backstory or giving a wordy exposition on the scenery surrounding your character. Begin your story at a moment of change; a crucial moment to the narrative. Focus on showing your readers the tension of the scene, rather than wasting words describing why characters are acting a specific way.Your flash-fiction piece should arrive at its main narrative or plot conflict in the first paragraph—or even the first sentence.Don’t leave the readers in suspense; you don’t have words to spare.
For example, open with something like: “The car barreling down the road did not stop at the light, but crashed into the side of a parked van.""
As another example: “Jess walked out into the rain after midnight, thinking of ways she could win back all of the money she had lost at the poker table that night.”;
, By starting in the middle, you’ll indicate to readers that much of the story has already happened before your flash-fiction begins, and that the story may continue after your story concludes. Allow some of the action to occur off of the page, so that you can focus on one important scene and idea. This means that literary devices such as foreshadowing and tone will be important in your flash piece. By focusing on a single scene in a plot or conflict, you’ll allow readers to imagine the rest of the narrative for themselves.
For example, if your protagonist’s childhood is relevant to the story, do not write, “Sarah was born in a bathtub in Kansas City and lived there through elementary school, when her father got a job in Tulsa …” as this level of meticulous detail can bore readers and slow the action. Instead, say something like, “Sarah reflected on her brief and unfulfilling childhood as she waited for a taxi.”

, In a good flash piece, you’ll likely only have room for a single main character. Don’t waste words telling readers about the character—instead, show him or her already in a scene, and let the character’s qualities, personality, and unique predicament unfold throughout the story.Think about the most important change you want your character to experience, and get there in the story as soon as possible.
The same goes for secondary characters (if your story has any)—they should be interesting but not require a lot of setup or explanation. Ask yourself how your secondary characters further the action surrounding your main character, or how they enhance the scene or theme.

, Your story should focus on a single moment or a single scene—it shouldn’t contain the life story of a character, save that for longer forms of fiction.For flash fiction, choose a moment in a character’s life that you can tell a lot about them in, but in a short amount of time.


A good flash piece should only have one theme, one main idea.This means that any “nonessential” themes and ideas need to be cut from the story—otherwise your story may become bloated and lose its focus.
Your flash-fiction piece should also only have one central conflict. To clearly show the conflict and make sure that its importance is clear to readers, make sure your story answers these two questions:

What does the main character want?
What or who (whether circumstances or people) is keeping the character from getting what they want?



, Too often, flash-fiction pieces become an exercise in writing punchlines, or surprising reveals at the conclusion that can feel more like a magician’s trick (ta-da!) than interesting literature. If your story leads up to a surprising or emotional event, present that sometime before the concluding lines.This way, your readers can consider the implications of the story’s climax along with the character.


Also consider introducing a twist at the end of your story. This is a common literary device in flash fiction a twist will leave the reader surprised by the unexpected end of your story. You can include a twist by withholding important information into the revelatory moment., With a flash-fiction story, you have to be extremely concise in your story telling. Long explanations and multiple character development should be saved for longer stories. Most of your sentences should be devoted to developing the main conflict of the short story, not setting up characters’ backstory or describing the scenery.Your ending should be a resolution for the character and, as like with the beginning, make sure that the end is extremely short. A paragraph should do.

, Although you shouldn’t necessarily have a definite “ending” in your last line—in a flash piece this may feel contrived or unnecessary—do focus on crafting a final line that sticks in your reader’s mind. It should take the story in an unexpected direction, or take the reader to a new place that encourages readers to think about the story and its significance.Think of the last line less like a conventional “ending” and more like a surprise or shock to the reader.
You don’t necessarily need a confusing or obscure ending (unless you want one), but it can help to have an enigmatic or evocative last line., Once you have a first draft, go back through and remove as much material as you can without losing the narrative, plot, or characters.Edit everything out of the story that isn’t essential to understanding the setting, the action, or feelings of the characters. Be intentional about every word in the story.You can also remove modifiers that aren’t necessary, such as “very,” “quite,” and “actually.” Removing adjectives and adverbs can also decrease your word count and keep your flash fiction concise.For fiction writers who are familiar with Twitter, practice writing your flash fiction piece as if you were writing a tweet. Remove all inessential words and phrases. Never use a long clause when a shorter one will do.

, As with any type of literary writing, it’s challenging—some would say impossible—to write effective flash fiction if you’re not immersed in the genre already. Find a published flash-fiction collection at your local bookstore, or an online journal that specializes in publishing flash fiction. Read stories, and note their approach to narrative, plot, characters, and economy of language.


Look into online flash fiction journals like: Flash Fiction Magazine, Flash Fiction Online, The Vestal Review, or SmokeLong Quarterly., Writers need other people’s feedback and opinions to improve their own writing. Once you’ve written several flash-fiction pieces that you think show your best work, ask a friend or two to read over your work. See what they say: if friends point out weak spots in your writing, characterization, or plotting, fix the weak sections, and then ask for a second read.


If you have the interest, time, and money, there are many good online writing workshops that will allow you to present your flash fiction to other writers. This process will improve your writing, and develop your ability to workshop and talk about the writing of your peers.
For example, the University of Wisconsin-Madison has a Continuing Studies program which offers year-long online fiction workshops—including workshops specializing in flash fiction—for around $150., Once you’ve spent time writing flash fiction, you may want to consider publishing your work. Online journals are a great fit for flash fiction, since the short format can be read easily on a webpage or literary blog.To find publication venues, talk to literary friends, or do a few online searches. Try searching for “flash fiction online journals.”


Expect rejections—rejection is a part of the publication process for any author, and flash fiction pieces are rejected as readily as any other type of story.

The world of the story should be well-researched and rooted in a real historical time period, with characters who are somehow based on historical figures. However, you can deviate from historical fact in your fiction and lean on historical fact, as you see fit.Good historical fiction writers will have a love for research and history. You should be curious about learning about past historical times, and be interested in imagining life in past times. Historical fiction can take a lot of time to do well, as you will need to conduct research and read historical texts to ensure you are getting the time period right.Though you may think you need a university degree in history to be a good historical fiction writer, this is often not the case. Many historical fiction writers have backgrounds in journalism and newspaper reporting. The skills required to be a successful journalist, such as good researching skills, good attention to detail, and the ability to write with precision and clarity, can also translate into being an effective historical fiction writer.;
, To get a better idea of this genre, you should read examples of historical fiction. There are several well known and respected historical novels, such as:I, Claudius by Robert Graves.

All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr.

Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel.

The Book of Negroes by Lawrence Hill.

The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet by David Mitchell.

, Once you have read several examples of historical fiction, you should analyze and compare them. You can get a better sense of how you will approach historical fiction by first considering how other authors have approached their historical subject matter. You may find you respond more to certain writing or styles as a reader, and decide to emulate this in your own writing.


You may ask yourself several questions about the texts, including: How does the author introduce the historical time period to the reader? Do you believe the historical time period is accurately described, and if so, why? How does the author use physical and emotional characteristics to describe the main characters? What is the central conflict of the story and how is it explored in the novel? Does the author create an ending that is satisfying or unsettling? Does the story feel historically accurate and creatively written? If so, in what ways does the author achieve this?

, Most historical fiction begins with a focus on an exact time period and location. You should consider a time period that you are interested in or curious about as well as a location within that time period that might be interesting to readers. Be specific when you choose a time period and location, as the more specific you are, the more specific your research will be. This will allow you to uncover fascinating historical details about the time period and location that you can then use in your fiction.For example, rather than choose, “20th century, France,"" you may choose “1935, Paris."" Or, rather than choose “18th century America,"" you may choose to focus on “1776, Philadelphia.""

, The first place you can go to for research is your local library. Talk to the reference librarian about your specific time period and location. Ask him or her for possible texts that can help you get a better sense of everyday life in the era.Look for encyclopedias that focus on specific time periods and locations. You can also look up biographies of historical figures who were alive during the time period.
You can read scholarly texts that focus on specific elements of the time period and location, such as what people ate in 1776, Philadelphia or how people dined out in 1935, Paris. You may be able to lean on historical texts that delve deep into the everyday customs and practices of the time.

, You can also see if your local library has catalogues, magazines, and newspapers from the time period and location. Often, libraries will have these resources on microfilm, allowing you to browse through the news stories, trends, and talk of the day.Magazines and catalogues can be a useful way to get a sense of how people were writing, talking, and gossiping during your chosen time period. You can also notice any popular slang or terms from the time period and the more popular products consumed by people during the time period.

, You may need to expand your research practices to discussions with professionals who are experts in a certain time period and location. You can find these experts by searching for the authors of historical texts online or by talking to other professionals in the field. You should then contact them and ask for a meeting about specific details that will help you create a more believable historical world for your story.You should look for experts that are very proficient in a certain aspect of the time period, such as an expert in embroidery in 17th century America or an expert in the origins of horse racing in 19th century Paris. This will then allow you to ask them very specific questions about the time period and get specific answers in return.
You can also ask experts to refer you to other experts they may know, creating a network of experts for you to lean on as you write your story. Using experts for different elements of your story will ensure you are getting an informed opinion and make your story feel more authentic.

, In our current digital age, it may seem more convenient and efficient to search for historical information online. However, you should do so with caution, as information on the internet is not always accurate or vetted by experts in the field. Do not assume that just because information is in an online encyclopedia or has been verified in some way by only one expert, it is correct. The internet can be a good place to get inspired and acquire some basic background information on your chosen time period. But it should not be your sole method of research.You should fact check all the information you get online with scholarly texts and discussions with history experts. Try to verify the information from the internet with other outside sources so you are sure you are using historical fact that you can then transform into fiction.

, You should start by sketching the geography of the setting, from the landscape to the weather. Is the historical setting consist mostly of forest and greenery, with rolling hills and castles? Does the historical setting consist more of a developing metropolis, with monuments, buildings, and townhouses? You can lean on your research to answer these questions and ensure you are creating an accurate historical backdrop for your story.You should try to be specific about the landscape and terrain of your setting. For example, if you are writing about a street in Paris, France in 1935, you may ask yourself: Were there cobblestone streets and row houses or apartment buildings? What monuments might be visible from the street? What were the major landmarks on the street? Where there trees and other greenery on the street or off the street?

, You should also think about how transportation functioned in your setting during a specific time period. Your characters will need to move around in your setting and you should try to be historically accurate about how they did this. Maybe there are horse drawn carriages in your time period and location or a specific make of car that was popular in your time period.You should also consider if there were different means of transportation for different classes and groups. For example, in Philadelphia in 1776, women may not have been allowed to use horse drawn carriages on their own. Or, in Paris in 1935, there may have only been one to two automobile models available to only wealthier individuals and families.

, You should also consider how it feels to experience a day in the setting, using the five senses: sight, smell, touch, sound, and taste. Doing this will allow you to use more vivid and detailed description in your writing, making the historical time period come alive in your story.


For example, you may try describing a day in the life of someone living in Paris in 1935 on a residential street. You may describe the smell of bread from the bakery in the morning, the sound of horse carriages in the distance, the touch of starched sheets, the taste of tea at the breakfast table, and the sight of the sunlight coming into the kitchen.

, You can also lean on visual representations of a location, such as maps, to help you get a better sense of your setting. Maybe you come across a map from the 17th century that you can then use as a visual reference or maybe you find a diagram of a horse drawn carriage that allows you to better depict transportation in your chosen time period. Using visuals can really help you picture what life was like for the time and translate these details into your writing.You may also include a map or other visual representations in your story as supporting material. Your readers may appreciate a map of a time period and location, especially if it is unfamiliar to them.

, During your research, you should look for individuals in history who were interesting and unique for their time. This could be a mistress of a British monarch who proposed sweeping changes to the system, or the village woman who helped embroider the stars on the first American flag. Look for characters who stick out in their time as rebels, renegades, or change makers. You can then use these historical characters as the basis for fascinating fictional characters.You should also consider the historical characters that surround your main characters. Maybe your main character frequented the same circles as famous writers and thinkers of the time. Or, maybe your main character was close friends with a major historical leader.
You may also find historical characters who may have been mere footnotes in history and largely ignored by historians. You could then bring these forgotten characters to life in your fiction and shine a spotlight on their fascinating lives.

, You should also try to focus on historical figures who were in conflict with themselves, with the outside world, or with other individuals in their life. Historical characters who were forced to deal with conflict will often be more interesting and engaging to readers. You can also use their conflict as the main conflict in your story.For example, maybe your story is about a struggling artist in Paris in 1935. The artist may be based on a forgotten artist of the time who struggled with drug addiction and poverty. The artist may also have a conflict with the outside world in that her work was often misinterpreted or ignored by the critics of the day. She may also have a conflict with other artists in her circle, who are becoming more famous and well known than her.
You may also use the historical time period as a source of conflict. Often, unique characters in history stand out for their attempts to go against the status quo of the day or the social norms of their time. A story about a female main character who sewed the stars onto the first American flag, for example, may be interesting because during this time, women were not permitted to vote or to participate in the politics of the day. This may then create a conflict for your main character, as she is not able to actively participate in the political process, even though she desperately wants to get involved and be part of this process.

, You should create character studies of your characters so you have a good sense of their perspective. Your character studies may include physical qualities, such as the character’s appearance and clothing. You should also include emotional and psychological qualities, such as how your character thinks, acts, and perceives others around them. For example, you may have a character study of your main character that reads:Physical qualities: Tall, thin, dark skin, thin nose, wide eyes, with long plaited hair. Has a cleft lip from birth and a scar on her left ear.
Emotional/psychological qualities: Street-smart, no formal educational training, devoted to painting and drawing, obsessed with fame, short-tempered, attractive to men and women, tendency to spend money as soon as she has it on drugs, alcohol, and food.

, Avoid creating one-dimensional characters by giving your characters flaws and imperfections. Nobody is perfect, after all, especially throughout history. Make sure your characters have their own issues and problems, as this will make them more believable and relatable to your readers.For example, your main character may have artistic talent and the ability to leave an important mark on painting. But she may also struggle with drug addiction and poverty, leading her to make some difficult and imperfect decisions to survive.

, You should start the writing process by creating a plot outline so you have a general sense of where your story is headed. You may deviate from your plot outline as you get into the writing. But having a guide can make it easier to dive into the story and get words on the page.


You may use a plot diagram to outline your story. A plot diagram is one of the more common ways to structure your story and consists of six sections: the set up, the inciting incident, the rising action, the climax, the falling action, and the resolution.
Alternatively, you may use the snowflake method. The snowflake method is often used by writers who do not want to follow the more traditional plot diagram, but are still looking for a way to organize their story. The snowflake diagram consists of a one sentence summary of the story, a one paragraph summary of the story, character synopses, and a summary of scenes.

, Many writers fall into the trap of letting historical fact take over their fictional story, creating a story that reads more like a history lesson than a gripping fictional tale. Avoid letting historical fact limit or constrain your ability to tell the fictional story. Instead, use historical fact as a basis for your fictional story and feel free to tweak or adjust smaller details for the sake of your story.Though you should strive for accuracy and fact in your story, you should also be willing to sacrifice historical fact for a good tale. You are writing fiction based on some element of history, after all, and are not obligated to ensure every detail is historically correct. The need for historical fact should never trump your ability to create an engaging tale.

, Cliches are phrases that have become so familiar they no longer hold meaning or make an impact on your reader. You should strive to create descriptions and details that are unique and unfamiliar, as your reader might tune out if your sentences are littered with phrases they have heard before.


It can be tricky to avoid cliche when you are writing historical fiction, especially if it is set in a time period with familiar images and phrases, such as the British monarchy or turn of the century Paris. You may need to work extra hard to ensure your writing does not fall into cliche when describing the setting of your story or the perspective of your characters.
For example, rather than describe a party in turn of the century Paris as “packed to the gills, with a bevy of artists and creative types,” you might describe it with more detail, “so crowded you could only spot the champagne glasses on brass trays, floating over the perfumed heads of every known artist in Paris.”

, Once you have created a first draft of your story, you should sit down and revise it. Historical fiction can take years to write and you may write many drafts. You should be prepared to revise your drafts several times until you have a finished manuscript.Read the draft out loud to yourself. You should highlight any cliches or familiar language as well as any awkward sentences or phrases. Make sure you are historically accurate whenever possible and that you have a good reason for the instances when you deviate from history. You should also ensure your draft adheres to your plot outline. If you deviate from your plot outline, it should be for the good of the story overall.
You should also read the draft out loud to someone else. Get feedback and constructive feedback from them to improve your writing and your next draft. Often, getting an outside perspective on your work can only make it better and more engaging for your readers."

Take the time to imagine your fantasy world and the characters within it. Take notes or write an outline of how your fantasy world works. For example, if you have included supernatural creatures, are there special rules they must live by - like vampires avoiding sunlight. Rules help to give your world structure.;
, If your story isn't set on Earth then it may be useful to draw up maps of your new world which could be included in your finished novel to give your readers a better idea of what it looks like.

, The best fantasy novels make the unbelievable, believable by giving the reader familiar themes that they recognize. Even if your main character isn't human, they must have human problems. For example are they dealing with family feuds, relationship issues or personal problems that your reader can relate to. If they can relate to the problems then they will feel empathy to your character and care about their plight.

, Look at the current bestselling fantasy novels and see if you can find their unique selling point. You can be inspired by them but don't plagiarize your favorite writers. They were published for their uniqueness, so you need to seek your own.

, Do you want your small novel to end up in as a long series? Make a ""mind map"" to get a hold on all the possible outcomes.

, Decide what they look like, how they behave and think. Create them with lots of details somewhere you can check often, because you'll need it.


Creatures such as vampires have been done to death! Or undeath. If you cannot create unique creatures, then at least try to put a new spin on them.

, For an example, you don't want to actually say someone stands up for their friends, but you can put a scene where he or she does it.

, What does your main character want? How will he or she try to get it? Will he or she manage to? What are going to be the problems he or she will be facing?

, Write the way you like better, but keep that style throughout the whole book. No one likes a book that changes in the middle.

, Give your text rich descriptions of places and events, but don't overdo it because, then, your text will get slow and won't flow well.

, This one isn't necessary, but helps you keeping your readers interested. More traditional plot twists include:



Anagnorisis, or discovery- the main character's sudden and abrupt recognition of the true nature or identity of a person or the meaning of an event. For example, a girl finds out that her best friend is just a figment of her imagination, and was never alive in the first place.
Flashback- an evocative revelation of past events. In books, flashbacks are usually italicized, worded in past tense, or told from a younger narrator's point of view. Instead of a flashback, a foreshadowing could also be used.

Unreliable narrator- in the end it is revealed that the narrator has falsified, made up, or greatly exaggerated the story that you've read up until that point.



Peripeteia- A realistic or logical reversal of the protagonist's fortune, whether for good or for worse. For example, the main character of a story, after struggling through an arduous murder case and about to give up, stumbles upon the missing piece of information he needed.

Deus ex machina, meaning ""god out of the machine""- an unexpected, artificial, or improbable character, device, or event that is introduced to resolve the main conflict, or even a side conflict, of the story.
Poetic justice- an ironic ""turning of the tables"" where the character is either rewarded or punished for their actions, such as a sudden death or a compensation.
Chekhov's gun- a character or plot element is introduced early in the narrative. The importance of the character or plot element is not recognized until later in the story. Also known as a ""plant"", or an initial device that is repeated throughout the story.
Red herring, or false foreshadowing- a false clue that misleads the investigators toward an incorrect solution. If the protagonist is misled, then the reader is typically misled by extension.

In medias res, or into the middle of things- the story is began in the middle of the story rather than the beginning; the beginning is revealed through flashbacks. Everything ultimately leads up to a big revelation.
Non-linear narrative- the plot and characters are revealed in a non-chronological order, meaning that instead of beginning, middle, and end, it might be end, beginning, and middle. This will force the reader to piece things together themselves, but not fully understand until a piece of crucial information is revealed at the climax.
Reverse chronology, a form of non-linear narrative- Events are revealed from end to beginning.

These characters need to be interesting and unique. Don't make them perfect - most people don't want to read about two perfect people falling in love.Try writing characters who are from different backgrounds or social classes. Or choose characters that have differing viewpoints about something. This can help you create conflict.
Make sure to give each main character a unique personality. For example, maybe Beth is the owner of a failing ranch who loves horses while Matt is an ex-rodeo star in need of a job.
Keep the focus on the main characters. Most romantic fiction is about the two main characters, not a bunch of minor characters.Ask your characters questions. Who are they? What do they want and why? What would they do if faced with conflict and difficult situations? What were they like when they were younger? Get to know your characters.Many romance stories have a sympathetic heroine and a strong hero.;
, The point-of-view helps you decide how you will shape the story. Decide whose point-of-view to tell the story from, or decide to alternate points-of-view with each chapter.


Decide if one character's story is more important than the other, or if both characters have an equally interesting tale.
Sketch out what will be gained by having both character's points-of-view. If you think you will struggle writing one of the characters, just stick with one point-of-view.

, Before you start writing your short story, novella, fan fiction, or novel, write a 100 word blurb. This is where you describe to yourself what the story will be about. Outline the main characters, the setting, the conflict, and the general mood.


After thinking about it for a few days, write an outline of 1,000 words. This should cover all the important scenes: the first meeting, the initial problem, important conflicts along the way, and the climax. This doesn't detail everything. This is only a skeleton so you can see where your story is potentially going., No romance idea is going to be new. Your job when writing romance is to put your own spin on it. This occurs when you have unique, believable characters, interesting situations, and good dialogue.


Write a story with a familiar trope. Go for: secret baby, forced marriage, blind date, one night stand, amnesia, working together, historical, friends-of-a-sibling, celebrity and normal person, or any other common plot set up you are interested in., Everyone knows the end of a romance: the couple lives happily ever after. What you have to decide is why the reader should care by the end. This is where the conflict comes in. Your conflict creates suspense and anticipation in the story. Effective storytelling centers around writing conflicts. Shoot for 2-3 major conflicts throughout the story. Remember each conflict has to be resolved by the end of the story.


Give your characters a goal. Then think about what is at stake if the characters don't reach these goals.A common romance conflict is something that keeps the two main characters apart. Your story is about the two characters overcoming obstacles to be together.
Another common romance conflict is that the two main characters don't like each other.
Other conflicts can be social stigmas, one of the characters is in a relationship, their jobs prevent them from dating, or one doesn't like the other.Make sure to include both internal and external conflicts. Internal conflicts are based on the characters. This can be based on motivations or personalities, or an emotional situation between two characters. External conflicts are things like misunderstandings, circumstances, or influence of another character., Dialogue in a romance is really important. You need to use each interaction to build the attraction, romance, and sexual tension between the characters.


Make sure your dialogue is gender specific. No matter if you are writing a story about a romance between a man and a woman, two men, or two women, you want your dialogue to ring true for them.
Each character should have a different way of talking. This doesn't mean you should write them with heavy accents, but think about giving each character his or her own voice. Maybe one character talks too much, while the other character holds a lot back. Also think about phrases that each character might say often.
Think about the way people talk around you. Listen to conversations and use that to help with your dialogue if you are having trouble.
Make sure the dialogue is relevant to the plot. Don't have them talking about things that aren't important. Unlike real life, dialogue in a story needs to be purposeful., You want to hook your reader from the first sentence. That means your two main characters need to meet as soon as possible. Don't spend thousands of words giving the reader unnecessary backstory or separate interactions with other characters. This is a romance - get the two characters into the same scene as soon as possible.


Start the story with the scene where the two main characters meet. Just jump straight into the romance., When writing romance, you need each interaction between the main characters to be charged. This may mean using ""exaggerated awareness.""That means that every touch, every look, every word spoken between the characters have to have meaning.


Sometimes both characters are aware of the attraction. Sometimes only one character is aware while the other is oblivious.
Focus on the way the characters look at each other, the sound of their voices, and even their breathing. Body language is really important when conveying sexual tension.

, Romances can be overly dramatic, cheesy, or trite. You want your romance story to be real and meaningful. You can do this by making your characters real.


If you have fleshed out your characters, then their love scenes should carry more weight. You need to show what the characters are overcoming to get to the love scene. What does it mean for these characters with all this emotional baggage to finally give in?, Most good romance stories have some kind of sex scene. When writing the sex scene, you can be as graphic as you want. The thing to remember is that it has to have a point. If it's between your two main characters, you want to make sure it occurs at the right moment.


Are the two characters hooking up, which will lead to disaster?
Is one of the main characters going to have sex with an ex? Or are they upset and going to have a one night stand? Is this sexual encounter going to affect the plot? If it's not, then it probably shouldn't be in there.Reveal something with each love or sexual encounter. You can reveal something that advances the plot, reveal a revelation about a character, reveal hidden emotions, or reveal a change in the character., Every romance has a happy ending, but that's not enough. You need to go through emotional ups and downs with your characters. By the end, you should be rooting for them. When they overcome the problems and get together, the reader should feel satisfied.


Make sure the story ends where it should. If you feel like the story isn't over, then keep writing until you feel satisfied."

Fiction depends on conflict, and that needs to be set up as early as possible. Famous short story writer Kurt Vonnegut once gave this tip: “To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understand of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.”Hopefully, cockroaches won’t eat your story, but if you have several initial chapters of ordinary people doing ordinary things without any challenges or problems present, readers may not see why they’re supposed to care.For example, in the first chapter of Stephenie Meyer’s massively popular novel Twilight, all of the basic conflicts are established: Bella Swan, the heroine, has moved to a new place where she doesn’t feel comfortable or know anyone, and she meets the mysterious hero, Edward Cullen, who makes her uncomfortable but whom she also feels drawn to. This conflict, that she’s interested in a person she’s also confused by, sets the rest of the action in motion.One of the inspirations for Twilight, Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, also sets up a central problem within the first chapter: a new, eligible bachelor has moved into town and the heroine’s mother is desperate to set up one of her daughters with him because the family is poor and needs to marry off the daughters for them to have a hope of comfort in their later lives. The problem of to find husbands for these women will form a major part of the novel, as will the challenge of the mother’s troublesome meddling.;
, To be engaging, your fiction needs clear stakes for its characters. These don’t have to be world-shattering, but they do need to feel important to the characters. Vonnegut once said that “Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.”The main character needs to want something and be afraid (for good reasons) that they won’t get it. Stories that don’t have clear stakes are very hard for readers to engage with.


For example, whether or not a heroine gets to be in a relationship with the person she loves probably isn’t going to be the end of the world for everyone else, but it is something that should be very important for the character.
Sometimes, the stakes literally are the end of the world, such as in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings series, in which the characters’ failure to destroy the One Ring will result in the destruction of Middle Earth by evil. This type of stakes is usually best reserved for fantasy and epics.

, Dialogue needs to sound natural for the characters speaking it. Think about it: When was the last time that you gave your entire backstory in a speech to someone you’d just met? Or recapped everything that happened in a previous encounter, in detail, in a direct address to a friend? Don’t have your characters do that either.


For example, Charlaine Harris’s popular Sookie Stackhouse novels have a bad tendency to spend the first few chapters of every book “catching up” on everything that happened in previous books. The narrator will also frequently drop in to explicitly remind the reader of who a character is and what their function is. This can get in the way of smooth storytelling and distract the reader from engaging with the characters.
There are exceptions to this rule. For example, if you have a mentor-mentee relationship between characters, you may be able to include more exposition in their interactions. A good example of this type of situation is the relationship between Haymitch Abernathy and his mentees Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark in Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games series. Haymitch can explain some of the rules of the Hunger Games and how to do well in the competition in his dialogue because that’s explicitly his job. Even in situations such as this, though, don’t overload dialogue with factual world-building.

, While a lot of fiction proceeds along very familiar lines -- consider how many stories are about heroic quests or two people who initially hate each other but learn to love each other -- you don’t want to lapse into formulaic storytelling. If your reader can predict everything that’s going to happen, they won’t care about finishing your story.For example, you could have a romance novel in which it’s hard to see how the characters will end up happily ever after because of the situations they’re in or their personality flaws. The surprise for readers will be how things do end up working out in the end, despite all appearances to the contrary.
Don’t, however, fall for the “it was all a dream” trick. Ending twists that negate everything about the story that preceded them very rarely work out well, as readers generally feel as though they’ve been deceived or tricked.

, This is one of the cardinal rules in fiction, and it’s also one that frequently gets ignored. Showing rather than telling means demonstrating emotions or plot points through actions and reactions, not through telling your readers what happened or what a character felt.For example, instead of writing something like Yao was upset, which tells, give the character something to do to show the reader what’s going on: Yao clenched his fists and the color rushed to his face shows the reader that Yao’s upset without having to tell them.
Be wary of this in dialogue tags, too. Consider this sentence: ”Let’s go,” said Jenna impatiently.” It’s telling the reader that Jenna is impatient, but it’s not showing. Now consider this sentence: “Let’s go!” Jenna snapped, tapping her foot on the floor. Readers still understand that Jenna is feeling impatient, but you haven’t had to tell them; you’ve shown them.

, This can sound counterintuitive, especially after you’ve just been told several things to avoid doing in your fiction. However, part of writing is discovering your own voice and way of writing, and this means you should feel free to experiment. Just keep in mind that not all experiments work out, so don’t feel bad if you try something new and it doesn’t quite produce what you wanted.

, This may depend on what type of story you want to tell. For example, if you want to write an epic fantasy that spans multiple generations, a novel (or even a series of novels) may work better than a short story. If you're interested in exploring the psyche of a single character, a short story may be ideal.

, All books start from a small idea, dream or inspiration that is slowly transformed into a larger and more detailed version of that same idea. The idea should be something you're interested in, something that’s really important to you; if you're not passionate about it, that will come through in your writing.If you're having issues coming up with good ideas, try these:


Start with what you know. If you’re from a small town in rural Alabama, you may want to start off by thinking about stories you could tell about similar settings. If you want to write about something you don’t know, do your research. Trying to write a mythological story about Norse gods in modern settings could be fun, but if you don’t know anything about mythology, it’s not likely to be successful. Similarly, if you want to write a historical romance set in Regency England, you’ll probably have to do some research about social conventions and the like if you want your novel to appeal to readers.
Make lists of random things: “the curtain,” “the cat,” “the investigator,” etc. Take each word and add a few things. Where is it? What is it? When is it? Make up a paragraph about it. Why is it where it is? When did it get there? How? What does it look like?
Make up some characters. What is their age? When were they born and where? Do they live in this world? What is the name of the city they are in now? What is their name, age, gender, height, weight, hair color, eye color, ethnic background?
Try making a map. Draw a blob and make it an island, or draw lines indicating rivers. Who lives in this place? What would they need to do to survive in it?
If you do not already keep a journal, start now. Journals are amazing helpers when it comes to getting good ideas.

, Cubing asks you to examine a topic from six separate angles (hence the name).For example, if you want to write a story about a wedding, consider the following angles:
Describe: What is it? (A ceremony that results in the marriage of two people; a party or celebration; a ritual)
Compare: What is it like or not like? (Like: other religious rituals, other types of parties; Not like: an average day)
Associate: What else does it make you think of? (Expenses, dresses, church, flowers, relationships, arguments)
Analyze: What parts or elements is it made up of? (Usually, a bride, a groom, a wedding dress, a cake, some guests, a venue, some vows, decorations; figuratively, stress, excitement, exhaustion, happiness)
Apply: How is it used? How could it be used? (Used to unite two people in a legal contract of marriage)
Evaluate: How can it be supported or opposed? (Supported: people who love each other get married to be happy together; Opposed: some people get married for bad reasons)

, You can create visual representations of how elements in your story relate by making a mind map, also sometimes known as a “cluster” or “spiderweb.” Start in the middle with your main character or conflict, and draw lines outward to other concepts. See what would happen if you connect these other elements in different ways.

, Ask yourself what would happen if this character was put into different situations. What would happen if she decides to take a job in Sydney, Australia, even though she’s never left the country? What would happen if she has to suddenly take over her family’s business, even if she’s always wanted to move away? Putting your character in a variety of situations will help you decide what conflicts s/he may face and how s/he could handle them.

, If you want to write about a particular type of setting or event, such as the medieval Wars of the Roses, do a little research. Find out who the major historical figures were, what actions they took, why they did what they did. George R.R. Martin’s famous Game of Thrones books were inspired by his fascination with the English medieval era, but he took his research and made his own world and characters out of it.

, Engaging with other types of creative work can provide you with a springboard for your own. Watch several movies or read several books in the same genre as your story to get an idea of how stories like those tend to progress. Make a soundtrack of music that sounds like something characters in your story would listen to, or how you imagine the soundtrack to the movie adaptation of your story would sound., A good writer is also a good reader and a good observer. Make observations about the world around you that you may want to incorporate into your fiction. Take notes on conversations you hear. Go to the library and read up on interesting topics. Go outside and look at nature. Let the idea mix with other ideas.

, You need to have a solid sense of what your story’s world is like, who lives in the world, and what will happen in your story before you start writing full scenes and chapters. If you have a good understanding of your characters, which you should have after brainstorming, let their personalities and flaws guide your plot.


For setting, ask yourself questions like these: When is it? Is it in the present? The future? The past? More than one? What's the season? Is it cold, hot or mild? Is it stormy? Where is it? Is it in this world? A different world? An alternate universe? What country? City? Province/State?
For plot, ask yourself questions like these: Who is in it? What is their role? Are they good or bad? What flaws do they have? What goals do they have? What is the precipitating incident that made this story happen in the first place? Is there something that happened in the past that could affect what happens in the future?

, Point of view is very important in fiction, because it determines what information readers are given and how readers connect to the characters. Although point of view and narration are very complicated subjects, your basic choices are first-person, third-person limited, third-person objective, and third-person omniscient. Whichever you choose, be consistent.Fiction written in first-person (usually, the narrator uses “I”) can emotionally engage your reader because s/he will identify with the narrator, but you can’t get into the heads of other characters as much because you have to keep the narration to what your central character could know or experience. Charlotte Brontë’s novel Jane Eyre is an example of a novel written in first-person.
Fiction written in third-person limited does not use “I” pronouns, but the story is told from the POV of one character, relating only what they can see, know, and experience. It is a very common POV for fiction, because readers can usually still easily connect with the characters. Stories told this way can focus exclusively on the POV of one character (for example, the main character in Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s short story “The Yellow Wallpaper”) or can shift between multiple characters (for example, the POV chapters devoted to different characters in the Game of Thrones books, or the alternating POV chapters between heroine and hero in most category romance novels). If you do shift between POV, be very clear when this has occurred by using a chapter or section break, or clear chapter labels.
Fiction written in third-person objective limits itself to only what is seen or heard by the narrator. This type of POV is difficult to pull off, because you can’t go inside a character’s head and explain motivations or thoughts, so it can be difficult for readers to feel connected to the characters. However, it can be used effectively; for example, many of Ernest Hemingway’s short stories are written in third-person objective.
Fiction written in third-person omniscient allows you to know everything about everyone’s thoughts, feelings, experiences, and actions. The narrator can go into any character’s head and can even tell the reader things that no characters know, such as secrets or mysterious events. The narrators of Dan Brown’s books are usually third-person omniscient narrators., Use Roman numerals, and write a few sentences or paragraphs on what is going to happen in that chapter.You don’t have to have a hugely detailed outline if you don’t want to. In fact, you may find that as you write your story deviates from the outline you had originally, and that’s natural. Sometimes writers just note what the emotional beat of a chapter should be (e.g., “Olivia is distraught and questions her decisions”), rather than trying to figure out what specific events happen.

, You may want to try pen and paper instead of the computer for the first draft. If you're sitting at a computer, and there's one part that you just can't seem to get right, you sit there for ages trying to figure it out, typing and re-typing. With pen and paper, you just write it and it's on paper. If you get stuck, you can skip it and keep going. Just start wherever seems like a good place and write. Use your outline when you forget where you're going. Keep on going until you get to the end.


If you're more of a computer person, a software program like Scrivener may help you get started. These programs let you write multiple little documents, such as character profiles and plot summaries, and keep them all in the same place.

, If you try to begin by thinking to yourself, “I’M GOING TO WRITE THE NEXT GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL,” you may be setting yourself up for failure before you even get started. Instead, take your writing one small goal at a time: a chapter, a few scenes, a character sketch., One of the biggest problems that beginning writers often have is writing dialogue that sounds like no words that a living, breathing human has ever said. This is particularly a problem for writers of historical fiction and fantasy, where the temptation is to make the language sound elevated and elegant, sometimes at the expense of allowing readers to connect. Dialogue should flow naturally, even though it will probably be more compressed and meaningful than real-life speech.While in real everyday speech, people often repeat themselves and use filler words such as “um” and “uh,” use these sparingly on paper. They can end up distracting the reader if overused.
Use your dialogue to forward the story or show something about a character. While people do have meaningless or shallow conversations all the time in real life, they’re not interesting to read on paper. Use the dialogue to convey the emotional state of a character, set a conflict or plot point in motion, or hint at what’s going on in a scene without stating it directly.
Try not to use dialogue that is too on the nose. For example, if you’re writing about a couple’s unhappy marriage, your characters probably shouldn’t explicitly tell each other “I’m unhappy with our marriage.” Instead, show their anger and frustration through dialogue. For example, you could have one character ask the other what they want for breakfast and have that character respond with an answer that’s not related to the question in any way. This shows that the characters are having trouble listening to each other and communicating effectively without having to have one of them say “We’re not communicating effectively.”

, Your characters should drive the action of your story, and this means that you can’t have a character do something completely out of character simply because the plot requires it. Characters may do things that they wouldn’t normally do if the circumstances are extraordinary, or if it is part of their arc (for example, ending up in a different place than they began the story), but they should for the most part be consistent.For example, if your main character is terrified of flying because she survived a plane crash as a child, she wouldn’t casually take a flight to another state because the plot needs her to go there.
Similarly, if your hero has had his heart broken by former loves and has become emotionally withdrawn, he can’t suddenly decide he’s in love with the heroine and decide to pursue her without reservation. People don’t act that way in real life, and readers expect realism even in fantasy situations.

, After you have the first draft all on paper, take some time off from the story. This advice comes straight from famous author Ernest Hemingway, who said he always took nights off because “if you think consciously or worry about you will kill it and your brain will be tired before you start.”Go to the movies, read a book, ride a horse, go for a swim, dine out with some friends, go for a hike and get some exercise! When you take breaks, you're more inspired when you return to your fiction.

, This advice is also backed up by Hemingway, who insisted that you have to “read it all every day from the start, correcting as you go along, then go on from where you stopped the day before.”While you're reading it, use a red pen to make any notes or corrections you want. In fact, make lots of notes. Think of a better word? Want to switch some sentences? Does that dialogue sound too immature? Think that cat should really be a dog? Note those changes!
Read your story aloud, because this helps you find mistakes.

, If an author tells you that she wrote her entire beautifully plotted, gorgeously executed novel in one go without any trouble, she’s lying to you. Even masters of fiction writing, such as Charles Dickens and J.K. Rowling, write terrible first drafts. You may end up discarding huge chunks of prose or plot because they no longer work. That’s not only acceptable, it’s almost always essential to produce the refined product that your readers will crave., Revision literally means to re-view something, to look at it again. Look at your fiction from the point of view of your readers, not you as a writer. If you had paid money to read this book, would you be satisfied? Do you feel a connection to your characters? Revision can be incredibly hard; there’s a reason why in the writing business it’s often talked about as “killing your darlings.”Don't be afraid to cut out words, paragraphs, and even entire sections. Most people pad their stories with extraneous words or passages. Cut, cut, cut. That is the key to success.

, If something in your story isn’t working, change it up! If it's written in first-person, put it in third-person. See which you like better. Try new things, add new plot points, add different characters or put a different personality on a current character, etc.

, Particularly when you’re just starting out, you may try to use shortcuts to express something, such as overusing adverbs and adjectives to describe how an event or experience feels. Mark Twain offers some good advice on dealing with fluff words: “Substitute ‘damn’ every time you’re inclined to write ‘very.’ Your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be.”For example, consider this sentence from Stephenie Meyer’s New Moon: “‘Hurry, Bella,’ Alice interrupted urgently.” Interrupting is itself an urgent action: it puts a stop to another action. The adverb doesn’t actually add anything to the action. In fact, this sentence doesn’t even need a dialogue tag; you can show one character interrupting another by using an em-dash, like this:
“Sure,” I said, “I was just ab--”
“Come on already!”

, Writers often lean heavily on cliches, especially in early drafts, because they’re very familiar ways of expressing an idea or image. However, that’s also their weakness: everyone has read that a character “lives life to the fullest,” so it lacks genuine impact.Consider this advice from playwright Anton Chekhov: “Don’t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.” This advice also points out the usefulness of showing rather than telling., These are the little things that can get lost while you’re drafting but that readers notice immediately. Your character might have been wearing a blue dress at the beginning of the chapter but is now wearing a red dress in the same scene. Or one character leaves the room during a conversation but is back in the room a few lines later without having been shown re-entering it. These little errors can quickly irritate readers, so read carefully and correct them.

, Sometimes, dialogue can look perfectly fine on the page but sound cringe-worthy when actually spoken by people. Or you may discover you’ve written a sentence that extends for an entire paragraph and even you get lost by the end. Reading your work aloud helps you catch awkward passages and places that have information gaps.

, Go through every line, looking for typos, misspellings, grammatical errors, awkward words and expressions, and cliches. You can go through looking for a specific thing, like spelling errors, and then again for punctuation errors, or try to fix everything at once.


When copy-editing your own work, you will often read what you thought you wrote rather than what you really wrote. If you can, ask someone else to help you copy-edit your manuscript. A friend who also reads or writes fiction could help you see errors that you didn’t catch on your own.

, Most publishers don’t accept short stories, but many journals will accept short-story submissions. Many large publishers will not accept unsolicited manuscripts from writers without an agent, but some smaller publishers are happy to look at even first-time writers’ works. Look around and find a venue that matches your style, your genre, and your publishing goals.


There are many manuals, websites, and organizations dedicated to helping writers find a venue for publication. Writers Market, Writer’s Digest, Book Market, and Writing Worldare good places to start.
You can also choose to self-publish, an increasingly popular option for writers. Places such as Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, and Luluall have guides on how to publish your book with them.

, Follow any guidelines set by your publisher’s submission requirements first. Follow submission guidelines precisely, even if they conflict with information found here. If they ask for 1.37” margins, make your margins 1.37”. (Standard margins are either 1” or 1.25”, though.) Submissions that don’t follow guidelines are rarely read or accepted. In general, there are some rules to follow when formatting a manuscript for submission.


Create a cover page with the manuscript title, your name, contact information, and word count. This should be centered horizontally and vertically, with a space between each line.
Alternatively, place your personal information -- name, phone number, email address -- in the upper left-hand corner of the first page. In the right hand corner, put the word count rounded to the nearest 10. Press enter a few times and then put your title. The title should be centered, and may be put in all caps.
Start the manuscript on a new page. Use a clear, legible serif font such as Times New Roman or Courier New set to 12pt. Double space all text. Left-justify your text.
For section breaks, center three asterisks (***) on a new line, then hit the “enter” key and begin the new section. Start all new chapters on a new page, with the title centered.
On every page except the first, include a header that has the page number, a shortened version of the title, and your last name.
For print submissions, print the manuscript on high quality 8½"" x 11"" (or A4) 20lb bond paper.

, Follow all the submission guidelines to the letter. Then, sit back and wait for a response!

At the end, reveal the motive of the crime.,
Check the story a couple of times and make sure that there are no mistakes.",How to Write Detective Stories," It may be any time, any place, from Ancient Egypt to the future.


Have a thorough study about what happened in any country; any kind of murder,theft or robbery, any kind of strange case known. If the case never closed, you could make it end in any way you please.;
, He or she could be tough, perceptive or patient, or perhaps all three. Being thorough in this step can help you write a believable story based on a complete and well-rounded main character, so some suggestions for things to consider are offered here:


Think of the basics. Male or female? What is the detective's name? How old are they? What do they look like (hair color, eye color, and skin tone)? Where are they from? Where are they living when your story starts? How did they become part of the story? Are they victims? Are they the cause of the problems in your story?
Develop a family for your character. Parents? Siblings? Significant other? Children? Other relations? Sociably problematic groups? A character which may know everything but has disappear... Make it as normal or as quirky as you want!
What kind of life do they live? Are they famous, or are they just starting out? Are they unexpectedly smart? What kind of mysteries do they solve? (Murder, theft, a combination, other kinds?)
Develop their tastes. Favorite sentence to say? What is their favorite color? Place to be? Soft drink? Book? TV show? Movie? Music? Meal? What are they afraid of? How practical are they? Do they wear a scent, and if so, what scent? Strong, soft, nice or not pleasant?
Develop their relationships. Do they have a lot of friends? A best friend? Are they romantic? What first impression do they make? Do they like children? Do they like smokers? Do they like reading?
How do they dress? Do they use makeup or hair dye? How about piercings or tattoos? How attractive are they, and how attractive do they think they are? Is there something they wish they could change, or something they are particularly happy with? How much time do they spend thinking about physical appearance?
Though this may seem like a lot to worry about for a short story, having your characters developed to the fullest is an essential part of writing a good story and to making the character believable.

,


Use Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? questions to get you started: Who committed the crime and who did they do it to? What was the crime? When did it happen (morning, evening, afternoon, dead of night)? Where did it happen? Why did they do it? How did they do it?
Use this skeleton to more fully sketch out a summary of your plot, with as many details as you can think of at this point. By now, plot ideas will be boiling around in your brain. Don't even worry about putting them in order, just write them down somewhere so that you don't forget them later!

, This is an especially important part of your story, so take the time to really develop it fully. Try to describe every single detail so that the reader can picture the crime scene. What does it look like? Is it different by day than by night?.

, Go back and look at the questions you used for forming the protagonist, and develop the antagonist's personality just as fully. In particular, think about their relationship to the protagonist.

, Make sure you have all of your ducks in a row before you begin writing.


Make a list of the suspects. Detail their basic personality.
Do the same for witnesses and any other characters.
Be sure to have in mind how the mystery is solved!

, The detective work must be good. Develop how your protagonist ultimately solves the case, keeping their personality and qualities in mind. Make sure it isn't cheesy or too obvious.

, Start with an introductory chapter or two, to introduce the characters and setting. Then make the crime scene happen.

, For example: ""Annie entered the office. She was a tall woman with thin legs and hands. Her face looks like a diamond..."". Make sure that you give the reader a vivid picture of each character.

, The more suspense you insert into the unfolding of the story, the more interesting the story will be. Make the protagonist get stuck in a couple of impossible-seeming situations and obstacles. Don't make the mystery too easy to solve!

, Be sure the ending is clear on who committed the crime and why, and how it was solved. There is nothing worse than leaving a mystery story extremely confused about what was going on!

, Rewrite as needed, and reword dull passages to make them more interesting. Cut out as many unnecessary fillers as you can. You want your story to be the best that it can be."

A story about the past can make supernatural events and strange characters seem more real to your readers.
Or, you can write in the present but include lots of elements that hearken back to an older time. Bram Stoker includes modern technology and ancient things in Dracula. He describes typewriters and trains, but he also includes vampires and an ancient castle.;
, Settings are important because they help create a creepy atmosphere for your characters. Crumbling buildings, haunted houses, and old castles make great settings for gothic fiction. Your setting should be a place that was once thriving, but has since fallen into decay.


The Overlook Hotel in Stephen King’s The Shining is an excellent example of such a location. The Overlook was once a gleaming vibrant vacation spot occupied by many people, but now only Jack and his family occupy it., Your characters are just as important as your setting, so spend plenty of time developing them. Gothic fictions often feature certain types of characters that may help you to develop your own characters.


Hero or anti-hero. There should be at least one character in your gothic fiction that readers will like, even if he or she has some dark tendencies. Mary Shelley’s Victor Frankenstein is a great example of a hero who is good, even though he creates a monster.
Villain. The villain in gothic fiction stories often plays the role of a tempter, who leads the hero down a dark path. A good villain should be both evil and fun to read about. Dracula in Bram Stoker’s Dracula is an excellent example of an interesting, yet evil villain. He does terrible things (like murdering people), and is portrayed by Bram Stoker as the epitome of foreign corruption that threatened Britain's society at the time. Since this fear of invasion was common at the time 'Dracula' was published, it was a very popular Gothic novel.
Woman in white. Many gothic fiction novels feature a doomed bride character who never gets her happy ending. Elizabeth from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is a good example of a woman in white.Woman in black. Other gothic fictions include a woman in black character like a widow. Miss Jessel of Turn of the Screw by Henry James is an example of a woman in black., Once you have worked out a setting and characters for your gothic fiction story, you will need to figure out what is going to happen to these characters. Like the setting, the plot should show a decline in the hero’s world, relationships, and/or sanity. Gothic fictions usually resolve when the hero redeems him or herself with the help of a loved one.


For example, in Bram Stoker’s Dracula Mina redeems herself with the help of her friends.

, Gothic fiction often features something or someone supernatural. Make one of your characters a ghost, vampire, werewolf, or some other supernatural creature. Or, you could use your setting to create an eerie atmosphere that suggests something paranormal is at work. A spooky castle or house can add a supernatural element to your story.

, Children often feature into gothic fiction and they are usually in danger or in the care of less than capable guardians. Having children in your story who are in some sort of danger will infuse your story with extra tension throughout.For example, young William Frankenstein wanders off and Frankenstein’s monster murders him. , Add intrigue to your story by including a prophecy that has something to do with the character or the setting (house, castle, etc.). Prophecies in gothic fiction are usually incomplete and confusing. A good prophecy should cause your readers to scratch their heads and want to know more.Sometimes gothic fiction stories feature a family curse or secret that haunts them. A curse can also help drive your hero’s actions and even explain some if his or her behavior. For example, a prophecy haunts the family in Horace Walpole’s Castle of Otranto. The prophecy says that the castle will pass from Manfred's line. The prophecy seems to have come true when Manfred's son dies., Gothic fiction stories often include a young woman who is in danger. This young woman may be your central character or your central character’s love interest. You can use this character as a way to influence the emotions of your readers, such as their pity, sadness, and fear. Depict your damsel’s reactions to her situation by telling your readers how she feels, acts, and what she says.Matilda is in love with one man, but another man lusts after he, which puts her in danger throughout the book., Many gothic novels put forth the story that they tell as true or found in a diary. This way of framing the story adds mystery, since it invites the reader imagine that the events of the story transpired.


For example, Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker both use found material framing devices. They present their stories through character letters and journal entries.

, In the beginning of your story, take care to describe your setting and characters who are present in the beginning of your story. Just make sure that you don’t give away too much information in the beginning. Leave some things to describe later, like the villain and other mysterious elements of your story. You can hint at these things early in your story, but don’t give in to the urge to share too much too soon., You can make sure that your story has a high level of creepiness by incorporating plenty of unnerving details. Describe the moon, the howling wind, or a dark corridor to maintain an air of gloom and horror throughout your story. You can also describe the way that your characters are feeling or acting, as well as their facial expressions., Tantalize your readers by only offering them quick glimpses of your villain or a ghost. Hint at the family curse but hold off on explaining it until later in the story., Describe over-the-top emotions like shrieking, cackling, fainting, and sobbing. These moments of hysteria will pull your readers into the story and help keep them entertained., Describe spooky things from the perspective of a character who has gone mad. This approach will intrigue your readers and lead them to question what is happening.For example, Roderick descends into madness in Edgar Allen Poe’s “Fall of The House of Usher.” His decline intensifies the story and makes it scarier. , As much as you might love your characters, good gothic fiction tales usually feature the death of one or more of the main characters. The deaths of your characters do not need to be ultra-gory (although, they can be), but they should be frightening. Use plenty of details to describe the scenery and action of your death scenes.For example, a giant helmet crushes Conrad in Horace Walpole’s Castle of Otranto. Conrad was on his way to get married., Good gothic fiction stories often end with a twist that causes readers to wonder about the events and characters of your story. . The reappearance of a someone who has died is one way to include a twist, but you can experiment with other types of twists as well.Edgar Allen Poe includes twists at the end of his stories that lead readers to question the finality of death. Poe includes one of these twists in “Fall of the House of Usher” when Madeline appears in the doorway and falls on top of Roderick. Roderick had believed that Madeline was dead."

Most works of dark fantasy focus on the frightening side of human nature, with elements of the sublime, the uncanny, and the weird. Unlike the traditional fantasy genre, the heroes of dark fantasy are often individuals who do unsavory or troubling things. This genre aims to entertain readers with psychological twists and turns.Like many sub genres, dark fantasy can be difficult to pin down. Some dark fantasy writers combine elements of horror with elements of fantasy to create a story set in an otherworldly place. Other dark fantasy writers apply psychological elements to a fantastical premise and create stories that are more about dystopia or the apocalypse.
With the prominence of technology in the 21st century, many dark fantasy series are focusing on futuristic elements and modern dystopia. But there are also dark fantasy series that are about a fantastical world other than our own.;
, To get a better sense of dark fantasy as a genre, you should take the time to read some good example texts. Many dark fantasy stories are in the form of novels or a series of novels that focus on the same set of characters existing in the world of the story. For example:The Gunslinger by Stephen King.

Perdido Street Station by China Miéville.

The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe.

Sharp Ends by Joe Abercrombie.

Coraline by Neil Gaiman.

, Once you read through one to two example texts, you should compare and contrast the author’s approach to the genre. You may notice similarities between the writing in the examples as well as other elements of dark fantasy, such as undertones of the sublime, the supernatural, and the weird. Ask yourself the following questions as you analyze the examples:


Does the story focus more on psychological horror or bloody, gory horror? How does the story build suspense and engagement in the reader?
How does the author build the world of the story? Does she use specific language and terms to describe the world? Does she use characters to illustrate how the world works?
How do the characters in the story interact with the world? Do you root for one character in particular in the story? What types of bad decisions do the character(s) make in the story and how does this affect the outcome or ending of the story?
Where there any dark moments in the story that disturbed or thrilled you? How does the author create these dark, disturbing moments without resorting to gore or graphic violence?

, One way to approach world building is to think about elements of our world that you can twist around or use as a jumping off point. You may try reimagining your daily commute to work by flipping one element on its head, like a bus that is upside down or a commuter who is a goblin from another time period. Reality, or the real world, are good building blocks for creating a believable fantasy world.You may also use elements of the world that you find disturbing or troubling and use them as the building blocks for your dark fantasy world. For example, maybe you dislike your office job and translate this dislike into a disturbing world where ghosts work office jobs. Or, maybe you want to examine abortion and use it as a jumping off point for a dark fantasy about a world where women are infertile and second class citizens in a totalitarian regime.

, You may also use a certain historical time period or major historical event as inspiration for the world of your story. Leaning on history can help you to build off of reality and create a world where readers can see parallels with their own history.Maybe you are interested in the Civil War and end up creating a world where the Civil War failed, leading to consequences for characters in your world. Or, maybe you use the bombing of Hiroshima as a model for a catastrophic event that occurs in the world of your story, creating characters who have special abilities due to their exposure to radiation.

, Many dark fantasy novels are “retellings” of myths, legends, and popular stories. These retellings are often done by twisting or turning certain elements of the existing story to make it new or strange. This approach can be useful for building a world that feels eerily familiar to a reader but also slightly off. Adding disturbing elements to an existing story can also present a different take on a familiar tale.For example, maybe you love Disney’s The Little Mermaid. You may then put your own take on the story, choosing a minor character in the tale and making them the main character, or reshaping the story so it is set in an underwater setting full of danger and horror that was not as present in the Disney version.

, Another option is to focus small and limit your world to a small area. This could be an enchanted house, a shape shifting street, or a town filled with misfits and supernatural beings. Sometimes, limiting the scope of your world can actually make it easier for you to focus on the small details and nuances of the setting. You can also have characters who interact with each other often in a small space, leading to a higher potential for drama and conflict in the story.You may also have the setting act as another character in the story. For example, maybe your story is set in a mansion that has supernatural abilities and a mind of its own, creating danger and horror for the inhabitants of the mansion. Or, maybe the small town has a dark secret that they are trying to keep hidden, especially when a newcomer rolls into town asking questions.

, Once you have determined the world of the story or the setting, you should sit down and consider the details of the world. Think about the rules and customs of the world, as well as the traditions and habits of people who live in this world. Consider if there is a governing body in the world and how they exert their authority over their people. These details will help you create a more believable, well rounded fantasy setting.For example, your world may be run by aristocratic families who compete for territory, with customs that require lesser born people to follow these families. You may also have supernatural beings who exist in this world as second class citizens and outcasts, considered lesser than the aristocratic families who rule the people. This hierarchical structure of the world should come into play once your get characters into the setting.
You may also have a dark fantasy world that resembles our world, except for a few strange habits and customs. For example, maybe instead of working in an office, people work in pods connected to a life force in the basement. Or, maybe instead of hopping on a bus, people hop on supernatural animals who act as taxis for humans.

, Another key detail of world building is to consider how people speak and communicate. Many dark fantasy worlds have characters who have their own language(s) and ways of communicating that may be different than our own. Considering this detail will allow you to create a richer and more complex fantasy world.For example, you may decide to have some characters speak English, or your mother tongue, and some characters speak a fantastical language. You may then use an existing language, with a few changes, or create your own language that is only spoken by certain characters or beings.

, One of the joys of writing dark fantasy is that you are able to give your characters unique gifts or abilities. Having a main character who is unique or strange in some way will help to deepen her character and distinguish her from other characters in the story. Your main character may be the only one with these gifts or she may be surrounded by characters who also have gifts or abilities, but use them in different ways. Often, dark fantasy has characters with dark gifts that lead to trouble, conflict, and pain.For example, maybe your main character can communicate with the dead. This ability then leads her to communicate with the spirit of a dead Queen who pulls her into a fantastical world. Or, maybe your character is born half mutant, half human and must struggle to find her place in a world that views humans as lesser than or second class.
You can also use your character's special abilities to create conflict and tension in the story, as she may be able to do things others cannot do or she may be ostracized for her abilities by others.

, It may help you get a better sense of your characters by writing down their physical and psychological traits. This is known as a character profile, where you outline the basic details and traits of your characters in a list or chart form. You can then use the profile to help you better imagine how a character might act in a scene or respond to a conflict.Your character profiles may include basic information on physical traits, such as height, weight, race, eye color, hair color, and any distinguishing features. You may also include psychological traits on your characters, such as their intelligence level, their educational background, their strengths and weaknesses, and their level of self confidence.
You can also use the physical and psychological traits of your characters to create conflict and tension in your story. Having distinguishing features may lead to the character being outcast or highly regarded in the world of your story. Using these features as a character trait and as an element in the plot of the story will allow you to cover two story essentials in one swoop.

, Most dark fantasy novels are driven by a quest or mission, where your characters must face challenges and tests to achieve their goal. Though not every quest needs to be epic in scale or have global consequences, it does need to feel epic to your characters. Setting up a mission for your characters to fulfill will help your story to move forward with intensity and purpose, giving your readers motivation to read on.You may set up an epic mission for your main character or characters, where they must return a sacred object to its rightful place in order to save the human race from extinction. Or, you may set up a more intimate mission for your characters, where they must help a ghost correct a mistake in the past so the ghost can move on. No matter the level of the mission, having a mission in your story will give your story stakes and a deeper sense of meaning.

, Though most dark fantasy focuses on an external conflict, such as a mission, quest, or goal, good dark fantasy also focuses on internal conflict. Your characters should be motivated by internal issues they are dealing with as well as events happening in the world around them. Having this balance will help you create well-rounded, believable characters that your reader can empathize with.For example, maybe your main character is a young girl who can commune with ghosts and is trying to help a dead queen fix a mistake in a past world. Her internal conflict may be that she does not know how to control her abilities and is afraid of not being able to make it back to her present world and her family in the present world. This internal conflict should then interact with her external conflict or ability to complete her mission.

, A story outline can be a useful way to get sense of the big picture of your story. You can also determine what the elements of your story are going to be, from the rising action to the climax to the story’s resolution.


You may decide to use a plot diagram or the snowflake method to make an outline for your story. You may also try using both methods and see if different plot points emerge in your story when you compare and contrast both methods.

, To help get your story down on the page, you may create a writing plan that has a goal word count for each day. You may also place a time constraint on your writing plan, where you need to complete the first draft of the story by a certain date. Having a writing plan can help you stay motivated to write the story and get a draft done.You may start by aiming for 500 words a day, with the goal of writing a 5,000 word draft of a dark fantasy short story within 10 days. Or, if you are writing a longer work, you may set word counts for the end of each week, with the goal of finishing a draft within several months to a year.

, When you are crafting your story, don’t forget to focus on sensory detail and description. This means considering how a character might experience a scene in terms of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Using sensory detail will help the story come alive for the reader, especially if you are using fantastical elements. Describing the smell or sound of a fantastical object or detail will help it seem more real and easier to picture in the reader’s mind.


As you write scenes in your story, think about how your narrator is experiencing a moment. What is she smelling, touching, tasting, hearing, and seeing as she walks around a space or watches characters in a scene? You should use descriptions that explores how it feels to be in the fantastical world, using your characters to access these details.

, Another key element of writing a dark fantasy story, or any story, is to ensure your characters are engaging with the story’s world. This means having your characters respond to elements of the world and comment on their feelings or thoughts about the fantastical world. Stay in the perspective of your characters and try to interact with the world through their point of view. This will help your characters and your fantastical world come alive.


You may do this by having two characters engage in a dialogue where they discuss elements of the world and their own internal conflicts. Or, you may have a first person point of view that goes through her daily routine, allowing you to show readers how someone in the fantastical world gets ready to go to work or commutes to their job.

, Read your draft out loud to yourself or to a sympathetic audience. Note any awkward sentences or unclear descriptions that you can edit and revise. Make sure the fantastical world reads as believable and engaging, packed with sensory detail. Mark down any scenes that feel underdeveloped or confusing.


You should also ask for feedback on your draft from your sympathetic audience. Ask them if they felt the details of the world were clear, and if they felt they understood the perspective of the main character. You may also ask if they have any suggestions on to make the story even more disturbing and unsettling. Pushing the horror element of your story could help it fit more into the genre of dark fantasy.

Decide if the character has any defining physical characteristics.,
Does the character have any symbolic physical characteristics?,
If you want the character to have a particular physical trait, then try to come up with a reason for it that is either defining or symbolic.,
Avoid getting carried away with physical description.",How to Write Descriptions in Fiction2," ""Defining"" is a term to be applied with discipline in writing fiction. If, at a key moment in the story, the character has to reach up for an object on a high shelf, to give it to someone who could not reach it, then their height is a defining characteristic. If they are going to be mocked for their handlebar moustache, then their moustache is a defining characteristic. Although any physical attribute that does not feature in the plot or events of the story is not defining, and need not be defined, it will be more interesting. Try to use a thesaurus to think of better words (e.g.; large becomes huge or great) . Though it will take you longer, you will write like a pro., Symbolic physical characteristics are those which communicate to the reader (and to other characters) something about the personality of the character. If the character is gluttonous you might want to say that they have bulging jowls and multiple chins. If they are dynamic and active you might want to say that they are spry or athletic.

, If you can't, then keep the detail to yourself.

, The character needs to be built up gently, therefore, and with a minimum of physical description, and the reader needs to be allowed to ""get to know them"" through the character's actions and words, rather than through what you tell the reader about the character -- in much the same way as you get to know a real person that you have just met.


Readers do not usually ""picture"" a character when they are reading; they don't imagine all the visual details of the person. They get a vaguer, more general ""feel"" for what the character looks like. Even when the character has an important physical attribute like being very tall, or very blond, or wearing round spectacles, the reader often won't imagine the character like that.
This is because the character's personality is much more important to the reader. The way the reader pictures the character arises more from the reader's memory than from the description given by the author. As the reader gets a feel for the personality of the character, they will start to picture him physically resembling a person or people that they know with a similar personality.

"
"
When you come to write your story, and you introduce the character, you will need to ""establish"" them.,
Try to refer to characteristics and traits obliquely or indirectly:


instead of:
John was tall and thin, and wore his tee tucked tightly into his pants.,
Say what the character is doing when you introduce them, and use that as a way to tell the reader about their personality:


instead of:
John was the anxious sort; he was always worried about trivial things."",
Once you've got your character established, you can add more details about them at your leisure.,
Give your characters room to develop.",How to Write Descriptions in Fiction3," Establishment is giving the reader a firm and recognizable picture of the character, so that next time the character appears you will not have to remind the reader of who they are. You should always try to do this with as little detail as possible. Select a defining and or a symbolic physical characteristic. Select a couple of defining personality traits, and use only those.

, He was always fastidiously neat.
try something like:

John's tight blue tee was stretched down his long, lean torso, and tucked fastidiously into his freshly pressed pants, whose knife-edge creases sharpened his long, thin legs all the way down to his sensible Oxfords

A good trick is to avoid ""was"" or ""is"", and for clothing to avoid ""wear"" and ""wore""



,
try something like:
John stood on tiptoes, just back from the curb, trying to hail a cab with one hand and keep his umbrella over him with the other, all the time watching for the next car that might pass to close and splash dirt over his clean Chinos.

, You don't have to tell the reader everything right away. Just like getting to know a real person, let the reader find out more over time.

, This means that their personality can evolve and change in response to what happens in the story. This can affect their physical appearance (in which case the change may be both defining and symbolic). Think of how the events in the story might affect the character. Perhaps by the end, John will be less obsessed with the neatness of his clothes.

Try working backwards.,

Think about the crime scene.,
Consider clues and the detective work.,
Collaborate as a writing group.,
Establish the genre.,
Choose a perspective.,
Research when necessary.,
Stay on track.,
Use plot twists with caution.,
End on a dramatic note.",How to Write Crime Stories," Most crime stories begin with the crime, and this can be a handy technique for the author as well.Briefly describe an exciting or mysterious crime scene: jewels disappearing from inside a locked safe, a fortune teller found dead in a canoe, or the prime minister's secretary caught carrying a bomb into 10 Downing Street. Ask yourself the following questions, and use the answers to sketch out a rough idea of the plot:


What could have led to this crime scene?
What motivation would cause someone to commit the crime, or to frame someone else?
What kind of person would follow through on that motivation?
Use Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? questions to get you started: Who committed the crime and who did they do it to? What was the crime? When did it happen (morning, evening, afternoon, dead of night)? Where did it happen? Why did they do it? How did they do it?;
, Your setting should be described in sufficient detail that the reader has a clear mental image of the location, whether it's a lady's parlor or a battlefield. Your mystery short story may be set in one room, one house, one city, or around the world; regardless, make sure that you provide a detailed and vivid description of the setting for your mystery short story.


Recognize that the size of the place will influence the development of your story. For example, in a large city or busy public place, you will have lots of opportunities to introduce witnesses. However, in a “locked-room mystery” (one where all the characters seem to be present in the same room throughout the occurrence of the crime), you will likely have no external witnesses, but may be able to draw upon your characters opinions and biases of each other.
Focus on the elements of your setting that are essential to the story. For example, is weather essential? If it is, write about it in great detail. If it is not, only mention it briefly or leave it out altogether. A dark, gritty setting adds atmosphere, and works well with stories centered on organized crime. Setting a crime in an idyllic, ordinary town adds its own kind of chill.

, Create compelling characters. In a mystery, you'll want to make sure each character is both realistic and easily identifiable. Make sure their names are distinct, that each has uniquely identifying features, and that they have ways of acting or speaking that are unique.


Some characters should be potential suspects for having committed the crime (and at least one should actually be guilty of the crime), some should be supporting characters that serve to make the storyline interesting (a love interest or meddling mother-in-law, perhaps), and one (or more) should be focused on solving the mystery.
Well-written characters will have motives for acting in ways that further the plot.Okay, the gritty noir detective or genius investigator is an option, but come up with alternatives or twists.
Make the crime matter personally to the protagonist, to raise the emotional stakes. This could be related to the protagonist's mysterious past, a close friend or family member in danger, or the fate of the town, country, or world., Who is the “bad guy” (or gal) in your mystery short story? To add some extra spice to your story, you may want to consider presenting a few potential villains with suspicious characteristics. This will leave your reader guessing as to who is the real antagonist in your story.Describe your villain well, but not too well. You don’t want your reader to guess right from the beginning of the story who is the culprit. Your reader may become suspicious if you spend a disproportionate amount of time describing one character.
You may want to make your villain someone that has been slightly suspicious all along. On the other hand, you may want to make the revelation of the culprit or criminal a complete shock. “Framing” someone throughout the story is a surefire way to keep your readers hooked to your mystery short stories.
Instead of a villain, consider including a sidekick. Maybe your sleuth has a friend or partner that will help her sort the clues and point out things that she misses.No one says the sleuth has to do it all alone! What if the sidekick and villain end up being one in the same?
Think of the basics. Male or female? What is the detective's name? How old are they? What do they look like (hair color, eye color, and skin tone)? Where are they from? Where are they living when your story starts? How did they become part of the story? Are they victims? Are they the cause of the problems in your story?

, This is an especially important part of your story, so take the time to really develop it fully. Try to describe every single detail so that the reader can picture the crime scene. What does it look like? Is it different by day than by night?.


Present an opportunity for mystery. Create a situation in which a crime can reasonably occur and one that you will be able to reasonably recreate yourself. Did all the power go out in the city due to a thunderstorm? Was a door or a safe accidentally left unlocked? Paint a vivid picture of the situation surrounding the occurrence of the crime that will be the focus of your mystery.
Don’t underestimate the power of the “backdrop” for the crime.An intricate understanding of the setting in which the crime takes place is an important tool that will help when it comes to developing your narrative.
Here are some suggestions for crimes: Something has been stolen from the classroom, Something is missing from your bookbag, Something strange is found on the baseball field, Someone has stolen the class pet, Someone is sending you strange notes, Someone has broken into the Science materials closet, someone has written on the bathroom wall, someone has tracked red mud into the building.

, What kind of clues will you have? How will they be linked to the possible suspects? How will they be processed?


You should include evidence processing skills such as fingerprinting, toxicology, handwriting analysis, blood spatter patterns, etc.
The detective work must be good. Develop how your detective or protagonist ultimately solves the case, keeping their personality and qualities in mind. Make sure it isn't cheesy or too obvious.

, Work together as a group to make your story and your crime scene interesting and be sure you will be able to re-create the crime scene.

, The crime, or the discovery of the crime scene, almost always occurs in the first chapter, but this cliché can be effective.Right away, it establishes the tone of the story, whether that's occult, violent, emotional, suspenseful, or exciting. If your crime story is a whodunnit, the unusual nature of the crime or the hints dropped throughout the scene gets the gears turning in the reader's head.


If you want to write about what happens before the crime, you can go back in time for the second chapter, adding a subheading such as ""one week earlier.""

, Most mystery authors choose a point of view that hides as much information about the mystery as possible, without confusing the reader. This can be the protagonist's first person perspective, or a third person perspective that most sticks near the protagonist's actions. Think carefully before moving to another person's thoughts; it's possible to pull it off, but often adds unnecessary complexity.

, Most crime stories are written for a popular audience, not FBI agents or expert criminals. Your readers don't need perfect realism to enjoy a story, but the major plot elements should be fairly believable. You can find a ton of information online or at a library, but extremely specialized subjects may require asking questions from someone who works in the field, or in a specialized online forum.

, If a scene doesn't relate to the crime or the investigation, ask yourself what it's doing there. Romance, side plots, and long, casual conversations have their place, but they should never steal the spotlight from the main plot and the main characters. This is especially true for short stories, which can't afford to waste any words.

, If you love a good surprise, go ahead and include the astonishing reveal — and stop there. A second plot twist in the same story makes the reader feel cheated, especially if it's almost impossible to guess in advance. Even the most unlikely plot twist should have a few hints sprinkled earlier in the book, so it doesn't come completely out of the blue.


This is especially important for the biggest reveal — whodunnit? — and the wrong choice can ruin a novel for a lot of readers. The villain should either be a suspect, or demonstrate enough suspicious behavior that a clever reader can guess the identity.

, Have you ever read the final, climactic scene of a book, then turned the page to discover a ten page conversation with a side character? Whatever other goals you have for the story, the crime novel's main focus is the crime investigation. When the villain meets a bad end, write your poignant final paragraph and reach the End.

Decide what kind of apocalyptic story it is: before the world ended, while the world ended, or after the world ended.,
Decide why the world ended and how: plague, nuclear war, aliens contact, etc.

,
Decide how your character(s) survived the apocalypse (e.g.,

,, immune). If you don't, you'll leave major holes in your story. If you're writing a story placed before or during the apocalypse, you can use a character's survival method to your advantage by making it the story line.

, If you're going to write about it in the past, then make it obvious your story isn't true.

, Decide how and where your characters end up, either alive or dead, so you can thread a story leading up to this.

, The main story line, as in any story, must be interesting and sensible to readers. Gaps in logic detract from a story's quality.

, Leave the readers with a certain sense of closure (for a single book) or an urge to know more (for a series of books). Be sure to read through and edit your work.

Agents and editors don't take well to book's that are ""for all ages."" If you want to write a bestseller, it's important to have a niche age range in mind.Things like picture books and stories with only a few words are usually for ages 2 to 6.
Middle graders are generally ages 8 to 11. These would be stories targeted at mid-elementary school and early middle school.
If you want to write for very young children, you can consider doing a picture book or a baby book.

, You do not want to go into the market without a clear genre. Many popular children's books are fantasy-based in nature, or feature talking animals. If you want to write a bestseller, fantasy may be a good idea. However, some famous children's books, like Kevin Henkes's Lily's Purple Plastic Purse, feature an animal character that faces a realistic setting. It can be nice to write a children's book with a story children can relate to.Pick a genre that interests you. You're unlikely to stick with a project if you do not enjoy the genre. You're vastly more likely to produce an interesting product people will want to buy if you're passionate about your work.
If you're a lifelong animal lover, for example, think about writing an animal book for children. Include animals as the main characters.

, There is a lot of competition in the world of children's books. If you're going to survive and become a bestselling author, figure out what makes your story unique. What unique experience can you bring to the table? What's a story that only you can tell?Look at what's already out there. Familiarize yourself with the more popular children's stories so you don't produce a replica of an already established work. Try to see where there's room for diversity. Look at what the market is lacking.
Think about your own life, experience, and passions. Maybe there's something unique about you that could help your work stand out. For example, there are lots of children's stories about animals, but how many stories feature a sugar glider? Maybe you own a sugar glider, and could tell a unique story from your pet's perspective.

, Reading as much as you can is a vital part of the prewriting process. Surround yourself with the most popular and prominent works in children's literature. Look into your target age range. Stop by a local library and ask a librarian for recommendations in that range.Pay attention to how the stories begin. Does the work begin with action, dialogue, a scene? How does the author get you interested in the story? What makes the characters compelling right away? Focus on characters. In a children's book, characters may be somewhat simple in nature.
Focus on language. Children's books are often written in very simple prose. They may also make use of things like rhyme, as they're often meant to be read out loud.
Watch how the story ends. What resolutions are made? How have the characters changed? Is there room left for a sequel, or are all ends tied up?

, Children need to be able to become invested in the main character in your book. As you write your children's book, focus on creating a main character with a lot of attitude. A fun, charismatic main character will get children invested quickly.Look at Kevin Henkes's Lily in Lily's Purple Plastic Purse. Lily is cute, charismatic, and excitable. She is a character children can get behind.
Give your character flaws, however. Every story needs a conflict. Lily, for example, is overeager and somewhat temperamental. This is what causes her disagreement with her teacher. Figure out one or two flaws your character can have that will ultimately drive the story's conflict.

, One of the things that makes bestsellers compelling is they present a relatable experience, but find a way to make it extraordinary. Oftentimes, otherwise ordinary settings, like a boarding school or a small town, turn out to be dangerous. Children feel they are being let into the adult world when innocence is removed from a typical setting.Think about Roald Dahl. Much of his stories take place in an ordinary setting that suddenly becomes frightening. In Matilda, for example, a conventional boarding school turns out to be a terrible place for the students. If you're doing a longer children's book, one that's the length of a chapter book, you could think of a similarly unexpected setting.
Think about a setting children are familiar with. For example, you could write about a school. A young child could discover his school is haunted, for example. This takes a setting children are familiar with and adds something a bit scary to it.

, Children face challenges in their day-to-day lives. They must overcome fears, confront challenges, deal with conflicts with friends and parents, and so on. Children want to read a book that reflects the conflicts they face. Think about a conflict you could introduce that your character must overcome.Look at something like the Berenstain Bears series. Most of the books center around a conflict related to young children. In ""The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with Junk food,"" for example, the children learn about healthy eating after a stressful doctor's appointment. The conflict is usually fairly easy to overcome, and helps teach kids a lesson.
Think about a conflict that will get a child emotionally invested in a story. If you know any children, think about the kinds of conflicts they have. For example, maybe your niece Rosa struggled to fit in during Girl Scout meetings. Her friend Harper helped her overcome her shyness by sticking by her side during meetings. You could easily write a fun and relatable children's book based on this experience, focusing on themes like friendship and community.

, Most children's books teach something to children. Sometimes, that message is practical. Children's books sometimes teach things like proper manners, or vocabulary. However, the message can also be more abstract. Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, for example, teaches about appreciating people over products. An inspiring message like this can really help your story resonate with kids.Think about what children need to learn. What did you have to learn as a child? Think about a memorable moment that taught you a lesson. Maybe, after your grandmother entered hospice care, you realized you never valued her enough. Through this, you learned to gain wisdom from past generations.
You can work this lesson into a story. Talk about a young child who learns to value the stories his grandmother told him more, teaching him the importance of history and family.

, If you want to write a children's book, work on getting organized. You should form a writing schedule for yourself. Work writing into your weekly routine, like exercising, doing your dishes, and brushing your teeth.


Clear out a space to write in your home. Clear off a corner of a desk, or pick a spot in your bedroom. You can also write at a local coffee shop. It's important you pick a space free of outside distractions so you can focus on your work.
Schedule time for writing. Think about when you feel most energetic. Some people feel invigorated in the mornings, while others feel enthusiastic later at night. Write during the time of day you feel most energetic.
Set goals each day. You can have a specific word count, such as 100 words per day, or you can write a set number of pages each day. If you do not have time to write each day, set weekly goals. For example, you can promise you'll have 5 pages by the end of any given week.

, Children have a limited vocabulary, so you do not want to use too many big words. You should also minimize excessive language. Stick to simple sentences that convey the basics. Things like rhyming and rhythm can also help. Think of the works of Dr. Seuss. He makes excellent use of rhyme to make his stories compelling to a young audience.


You can use some big words in a story. In fact, children may benefit from learning new words in a book. If you choose to use large words, find a way to explain them. Weave high-brow vocabulary words into your story in a smooth fashion.For example, maybe you can have a character who works very hard at school and is a bit of a show off. He or she could use big words on occasion, and make a point of explaining these words to others.

, Almost all children's books are illustrated. If you're not artistically inclined yourself, team up with an illustrator. The two of you can create compelling images for your story that will make the book aesthetically pleasing.Go to your friends who draw and ask them for advice here. Ask them if they would be willing to work with you. You can also post an ad online, on a site like CraigsList, seeking out illustrators for your book.
Due to modern technology, you are not limited by location. You can find illustrators across the country. You can browse websites where people share their art. If you find an artist you like, reach out to him or her.
Keep in mind a lot of artists will expect payment for their work. Budget for this.

, Much of writing takes place during revision. After finishing a draft of your story, do many, many revisions. Most successful books were revised multiple times before publication.


It's a good idea to have a print copy of your manuscript to revise. That way, you can make notes as you go. Ask yourself if the story moves quickly enough, if the plot is relatable to children, and if the conflict is solved in a rational manner.
Evaluate your writing. Does the dialogue feel natural? Are the characters, settings, and scenes described in a compelling manner?
In addition to major overhauls, watch for easy fixes like grammar issues. When you start sending your manuscript to publishers, it should be free of obvious grammatical errors.

, Children's stories should not be simplistic in nature. Many people think you have to teach a lesson in your story. However, children are complex. Avoid simple lessons. Instead, explore a variety of complex themes. Many children's books explore wide-reaching themes like bravery, war, conflict, and parent/child relationships without explicitly providing their readers with a lesson about such subjects. It's okay to leave ambiguity in your work., You're more likely to land an agent if you build a relationship with fans ahead of time. You can start a website or a blog about your book, and offer promotional materials like sneak previews, character profiles, and more. A lot of modern authors get their start online.You can use free sites like WordPress to create a blog. Work on updating your blog regularly and try to post content that people will share. Readers often respond to easy-to-read content, such as lists.
Create a social media presence as well. Link your blog to your Twitter, a Facebook fan page, and your Tumblr.
You can try starting a YouTube channel, making short videos where you discuss writing, your book, and children's literature in general.

, Networking is one of the main ways people get into publishing. If you get a short piece published in a journal, stay in touch with the editor. If you have an MFA in fiction writing, talk to your professors and colleagues. Attend reasonably priced writing conferences and try to meet agents and publishers.

, It is very hard to get a children's book published without an agent. Many big publishing houses do not look at unsolicited submissions. You will need an agent if you want to write bestsellers.You can find agents online through sites like Writers Market, Agent Query, and Query Tracker.
Write a query letter to potential agents. This should briefly overview your publication history, online presence, and include a brief biography. You should also provide a synopsis of your book. Include a few sample chapters in the envelope you send to the agent.
Follow all submissions guidelines carefully. Make sure you send in your chapters in the manner the agent prefers, following all the guidelines for formatting your manuscript exactly as requested.

, The process to becoming an author, especially a bestselling author, is long and difficult. You will get a lot of rejections from agents and publishing houses along the way, so learn to cope with rejection.Send out work frequently, and to a lot of different places. You're less likely to be stung by a rejection if you have a lot going on. A rejection from one agent will hurt less if you've already submitted to five.
Also, keep in mind rejection is rarely personal. Most authors get rejected a lot, especially early on. Your work may not have been the right fit, it may have been too similar to another title, or the agent simply may not have had time to read it closely. A rejection does not mean you are a bad writer.

Keep the epilogue concise and to the point.,
Read the epilogue out loud.,
Get feedback on the epilogue from a friend or colleague.,
Make sure the epilogue fits the tone of the rest of the text.",How to Write an Epilogue," You should start the epilogue with a clear purpose in mind, as this will ensure the epilogue feels intentional and full of meaning. Decide what the main purpose for your epilogue will be and write with that purpose in mind.Ask yourself, What do I want to explore in the epilogue? What has been left out of the main text that I still want to write about?
You may write an epilogue to provide the reader with some closure, to wrap up loose ends in the text, or to give the reader a glimpse of the future for the characters and the setting. Some writers also use the epilogue to expand on a major event in the text that they did not get to explore in the climax of the novel.
For example, you may decide the purpose of your epilogue is to wrap up loose ends in the text about the fate of the main character. You may then focus on where the character ends up ten years or twenty years after the main action in the text.;
, You should also decide what the key event or events are going to be in the epilogue. Outline the key events so you can get started on the epilogue and compose a draft of it. You may create a short plot outline for the epilogue or determine which events you are going to discuss based on the characters you are going to mention in the epilogue.For example, you may decide you are going to write an epilogue that flashes forward twenty years to tell the reader about what happens to certain characters. You may list these characters and then write several sentences about specific moments that occur to them in the future. These moments could then make up the epilogue for the text.

, You can read epilogues in published works to get a better sense of what works and what doesn’t. You may read epilogues for a play, if you are writing an epilogue for a play, or epilogues written for a novel if you are creating an epilogue for a novel. You may read:


The epilogue in Animal Farm by George OrwellThe epilogue in Atonement by Ian McEwanThe epilogue in The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood, In the epilogue, you may decide to focus on the results or consequences of the high point of the story, known as the climax. Writers will often take this approach if the ending of the story is the climax and the reader is left wondering what happens as a result of a major conflict or moment. You may opt for an epilogue that gives the reader a resolution to the climax so they are left satisfied at the very end of the book.For example, you may have a book that ends with the death of a character. Rather than leave the reader hanging, you may decide to include an epilogue that explores how the death of the character impacted the other characters in the novel.

, You may write an epilogue that provides information for the reader that was not included in the main text as a way to give the reader more. You may focus on information that was withheld in the main text and explore it further in the epilogue.For example, in the epilogue, you may discuss what happens to a character who is ill in the main text or what happens to a character who is pregnant. Try to include information about major characters in the story, as you want the epilogue to feel important and necessary to the reader.

, You may also use the epilogue to do some time travel and let the reader know what happens to the characters and/or the setting of the novel in a future time. You may explore where certain characters end up in the future as well as how their relationships to each other shifts or changes. You may also discuss how the setting of the novel changes or shifts as time goes on.If you decide to jump forward in time, you should try to make the characters’ stories feel realistic. Putting in details that do not seem to mesh with the main text may confuse your readers and undermine the rest of the story. Aim to keep the flash forward details about the characters realistic and nuanced.
For example, you may jump forward in time and explore the dissolution of the marriage of two characters. You may note that one character is now dating another character who played a major role in the main text and that they have children together.

, Some writers will use an epilogue to set up a sequel for the main text. This may be useful if you plan to write a series of books with the same characters or at least one more book in the same world in the future. You may create an epilogue that acts as a kind of preview of what will be to come in the sequel for the book. Or you may end the epilogue on a cliffhanger that leaves the reader wanting more, preferably in the form of a sequel text.For example, you may end the epilogue by having two characters get together and have a child. You may then indicate that the child has special abilities or is in grave danger, and this issue will only be resolved in a sequel text.

, Though you may be tempted to write on and on in the epilogue, try to keep it concise and to the point. Often, epilogues are no more than one chapter long, running around five to ten pages maximum. Avoid an epilogue that is overly long or that tries to cover too much information. Only leave the reader with enough to feel satisfied in some way.You may read over the epilogue once you have a draft of it and consider if there are any sections you can revise or cut down. You may find that you are being redundant or there are details that can be removed.

, Once you have completed a draft of the epilogue, you should read it aloud to yourself and listen to how the words sound on the page. Make sure the epilogue uses the same language and style as the main text so it does not seem out of place. Check that the details in the epilogue are clear and engaging for the reader.


You may also show the epilogue to a sympathetic reader for a second opinion. Ask them if they feel the epilogue adds to the main text and is compelling.

, You should show a draft of the epilogue to a friend or colleague whose opinion you trust. Ask them to provide feedback on your work and give you notes on how you can improve it or make it stronger.


You may show a draft of the epilogue to several friends or colleagues so you can get multiple opinions on the writing.

, You should make sure the epilogue compliments the tone and mood you have already established with the main text, especially if you end the main text on a high note, or a climax. You may adopt a similar tone in the epilogue as in the main text so it flows well and leaves the reader satisfied.Another option is to adopt a different tone that than main text so the reader knows they are reading extra information or content that will complicate their initial thoughts about the ending of the main text. You may do this if you want the epilogue to leave the reader wondering or unsettled.

Read your first draft out loud.",How to Write an Alien Sci Fi Story," Your alien sci-fi story could focus primarily on aliens and their perspective on the world. You may not have any humans in the story and instead, focus primarily on the alien point of view. Or, you may want to write an alien invasion story, where aliens invade the human world.


Some alien sci-fi stories focus on the interaction between humans and aliens. Often, the aliens and the humans in the story are in conflict. Some sci-fi writers use the conflict between aliens and humans to then push the story forward and propel the plot of the story.
Some of the best alien sci-fi will put the aliens front and center, creating aliens who have their own world, rules, and backstory. Often, the aliens will be just as prominent as the humans in the story, giving the reader two different perspectives on a conflict or issue.;
, To get a better sense of this genre, you should read examples of alien sci-fi stories. Several examples include:The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells.

Dawn by Octavia Butler.

The Word for the World Is Forest by Ursula Le Guin.

Dreamcatcher by Stephen King.

Pandora’s Planet by Christopher Anvil.

, Once you have read a few examples of alien sci-fi, you should analyze them. Consider how the author creates the alien world and the human world, if there is a human world in the story. Note how the author builds conflict and tension in the story. You may also compare and contrast a few examples to determine which approaches to the alien world you like better or find more engaging and entertaining.


Ask yourself several questions, including: How does the author characterize the aliens in the story? How do the humans interact with the aliens? How does the story build tension and conflict? Does the ending of the story satisfy your curiosity as reader? Is the ending optimistic about aliens and humans interacting or is it more pessimistic and dark?

, Most alien sci-fi stories take place in either the world of aliens or in the world of humans. There may be some flashbacks that provide detail about either world, but most stories stick to one setting. You may want to decide right away if your story is going to take place in alien world or human world.You may include details of either world in the story’s setting. For example, if your story is set the alien world, humans in the alien world may still remember their own customs and rituals. This would then allow you to show the reader the contrast between the alien customs and the human customs.
You may also decide to have aliens who invade the human world, integrating their customs into the customs of the humans. The aliens may also bring their own rituals and try to impose them on humans.

, Start by outlining the basic details of the alien world, including the biology of their world and the basic infrastructure of their world. Consider several questions when building the physical world of the aliens:Is their world green, lush, and full of other species besides the aliens? Or is it foggy, cold, and dark? Maybe their planet contains multiple eco-systems or only one eco-system that is ideal for the alien race. Perhaps they subsist of a specific crop that only grows in certain areas of their planet.
How do the aliens move around in their world? Do they fly in spaceships or have special clothing that allows them to jump and fly? You should also consider basic infrastructure elements like housing, food sources, energy storage and distribution, waste disposal, and the layout of the towns, cities, or neighborhoods in the alien world.

, Just like humans, the alien race will have their own historical events, such as times of war and times of prosperity. You should write down a history of the alien world to give the aliens some backstory.Consider several questions, such as: Did the aliens crash land on their planet and build it into a thriving metropolis? What were the major events of their history? For example, maybe their world is no longer inhabitable due to a natural disaster or genocide. Or maybe their world is prosperous and the envy of other planets in the galaxy.
You should also think about different races within the alien world, such as aliens who are considered royalty or higher born and aliens who are considered servants or slaves. You should try to have a diverse range of social classes and backgrounds in the alien world, as this will make the aliens more distinct and varied.

, You should also consider the daily life of the aliens. This could include the rituals and customs of the alien world, from how the aliens wake up in the morning to how they worship their god or belief system. Going into these details will help you create a backstory for the aliens and make them seem more believable.You should determine the psychology among the alien world and consider how the rituals and customs in the alien world affects their beliefs and values. Maybe the aliens do not believe in eating other living beings and this means they do not raise animals or beings besides themselves on their planet. Or, maybe the aliens are a matriarchy, where females are in power. This could then affect their attitudes toward male aliens in the alien world.
You may also consider how the aliens procreate, as the sexual lives of the species could be an important factor in their interactions with the human world in your story.

, Your story may involve the world of humans as well as the world of aliens. Because you are writing an alien sci-fi story, the focus may be more on the alien world than the human world. But describing the human perspective can still be useful for building backstory.You should outline the physical world of the humans in your story as well as the history of the human world. Consider if the human world is suffering due to a disease, a plague, a natural disaster, or a man made disaster, such as nuclear war or civil war. Maybe a planet very similar to Earth has been destroyed and become uninhabitable, forcing humans to look at alien worlds to conquer and re settle.
You should also consider the rituals and customs of the human world. Does the human world resemble our current world or does it focus on a specific area of the world? How do the humans use rituals and customs in their daily life? How does the human world differ from our current reality?

, One of the key aspects of your alien characters should be how they look. To make your aliens seem convincing and interesting, you should try to be as detailed about their physical characteristics as you can. Because you are writing fiction, you have the ability to create as many strange and interesting details about your alien characters as you like. Avoid using familiar images or descriptions of aliens and use your imagination.Think about how the aliens walk and move their bodies. You should also think about how their bodies are proportioned. They do not necessarily need to walk on two legs and have limbs like humans. They may have physical characteristics that have evolved due to their world or environment. For example, maybe your aliens have antennas on their heads because they can feel shifts in the wind in their world, allowing them to hunt for food more effectively.
You should also think about whether there are different genders in the alien world and how the bodies of different genders appear. You do not have to be limited by male or female genders. Maybe the alien race has a third gender that is asexual or a combination of male and female genders.

, Avoid creating the alien characters in the shadow of humans and get creative with language, thinking beyond English or other languages found on Earth. You may decide to create an alien language that may then be translated with the help of a computerized device or an implant in the human brain.Your alien race may also communicate in other ways besides language or words. Maybe they use their antennas to send messages to each other or have the ability to communicate through telepathy. Perhaps they use a system of body movements to communicate.

, The humans in your story may also be key characters in the narrative, so you should create humans that are just as interesting as the aliens. Your main character may be a human with a special ability or a unique characteristic. Creating nuanced humans in your story will make it that much stronger.For example, maybe your main character is a human who has been gifted with the ability to read minds. This human is then able to access the conversations of the alien overlords, who have enslaved the human race. This ability could allow the human to save the humans from the aliens and become the hero of the story.

, Once you have sketched out your characters, you should identify the central conflict. Doing this will give the story an end goal and frame the narrative for the reader. It will also allow you to use your characters to build tension in the story. The central conflict may be between your alien characters or between an alien character and a human character.For example, maybe the central conflict of your story is that aliens have taken over the human world because their planet is no longer habitable. This alien invasion may then result in a human hero who tries to fight the aliens with a special ability and help from other humans in his community. Or, maybe the central conflict is that humans have enslaved aliens who have crash landed on their planet. The humans may then try to hide the aliens and experiment on them. This may then result in one alien who tries to oppose his human captors.

, Sit down and sketch out how your story is going to unfold. You may use a plot diagram to make the outline or use the snowflake method. Regardless of which method you use, your plot should have a central conflict and a climax or high point of the narrative. You should also focus on building tension in the story so your reader stays engaged and continues turning the page.


You should also make sure you are keeping in mind how aliens and humans are interacting in your story. The humans and the aliens should be playing off each other, creating tension and conflict as the story unfolds. The interests of the humans should also be in opposition to the interest of the aliens, as this will ensure they are always in conflict with each other.

, Alien sci-fi can be littered with cliches, or descriptions so familiar they lose their meaning or relevance. Cliches like “little green men”, “alien invasion” and “UFOs found in the woods on a foggy night” should be avoided. Instead, try to create descriptions that will feel unfamiliar and surprising to the reader. Whenever you feel a phrase or term is too well known, try to change it so it does not fall into cliche.For example, you may describe the alien species as “having a wide head with bulbous eyes and a pair of thin antennas that twitched with energy.” This description is detailed and clear without using cliched images. You may also describe UFOs as “flying dinner plates” or “gray ships in the sky” and avoid using the term “UFO” altogether to try to make the reader less familiar with the storyline.

, Unlike other genres, science fiction should lean on elements of real world science to create a believable fictional world. Your story should integrate science that contain fundamental science, such as technology, chemistry, biology, or advanced scientific ideas. Your reader should be able to think elements of the story could be possible, at least scientifically speaking.You may want to do research around a specific scientific concept and try to integrate it into your story. For example, maybe your alien race has found a way to time travel using spacetime and the theory of relativity. You may then describe the alien’s approach to spacetime, using the principles of spacetime in science.

, Do this in front of a mirror at home and record yourself as you read. Or, read your draft in front of a sympathetic audience. You can then listen to yourself read the story and note any sentences or phrases that sounded wordy or unclear. You may also solicit feedback from your audience by asking questions about whether they found the story exciting or engaging and where they felt the story dipped in terms of energy and pacing.


You should then go back and edit your first draft. Revise any sentences that sound wordy or unclear. Break up long-winded sentences so they are more concise and to the point.
If there are any confusing moments in terms of plot or character development, you should also clarify these areas in the story. You may need to rewrite certain sections of the stories so plot and character are stronger on the page.

Fictional cities are often essential to the fictional world of a novel or book and they often complement or reinforce the characters and events that occur in the world of the book. Examples include:The fictional city of Basin City or Sin City in Frank Miller’s Sin City.
The fictional city of King’s Landing in George R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones.
The fictional city of Oz (The Emerald City) in L.Frank Baum’s The Wizard of Oz.
The fictional city of The Shire in J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit.;
, Once you have read through several examples of fictional cities, you should take some time to consider what makes the examples so effective. This will help you get a better sense of how to write about your fictional city.Most fictional cities are described using a map drawn by the author or by an illustrator working with the author. Examine the maps provided of the fictional cities and notice the level of detail that is put into the maps. For example, the map provided in J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit includes the names of places in the language of the novel as well as major landmarks and structures in the fictional area.
Look at the naming of the areas or streets in the fictional city. The names in a fictional city can carry a lot of importance, as the names come to symbolize certain aspects of the world of the book. For example, the naming of “Sin City” in Frank Miller’s Sin City graphic novels indicates that the area is known for its sinful inhabitants. The name tells the reader something about the area and what to expect from the characters that live in the area.
Note how the author describes the city. Does she use certain descriptions to characterize the city? In The Game of Thrones by George R. Martin, for example, King’s Landing is described as dirty and smelly, but it is also the seat of the throne. This descriptions creates an interesting contrast for the reader.

, Though it may seem easier to set your story in a real city, building a fictional city allows you to use your imagination and really delve into the possibilities of fiction. Your characters need a place to work and interact, and creating your own city frees you up to add elements from several different areas or parts of the real world.Creating a fictional city will also allow you to use elements of a real city you know well, such as your hometown, and twist them around so they become fictional. If you are very familiar and comfortable in a certain real life area, you can then use what you know and change them slightly to create a fictional world.
Creating a fictional city will also improve your writing overall, as the more believable your city is in your book, the more believable the world of your book will be to readers. Making a convincing fictional city will strengthen your characters as well, as you can shape the city to fit with the actions and perspectives of your characters.

, Another option is to use a real city you know well, such as your home city, and add fictional elements to the city so it is not quite real. The advantages of this are that you likely know your home city well and can use it as a template for fictional elements in the city you would like to explore. You can also take physical landmarks or areas in your home city and change them based on your imagination. This way, the fictional city feels real to you in some way.

, The name of the city is one of the most elements of a fictional city. The name may be repeated often in your story by your main character, other characters, and in your descriptions. You should think of a name that has resonance and feels purposeful.You may choose a name that feels generic and sort of “every small town” if you want your story to have a more universal feel to it. A name like Milton or Abbsortford, for example, does not tell readers too much about the town other than it is likely small and in North America. Avoid using a name like Springfield, as this immediately makes readers think of the Simpsons, which may not fit with your story.
Consider a name that fits the region or area where your fictional city is located. If your city is located in Germany, for example, you may select a German name or a German term that could also function as a name. If your city is located in Canada, you may select a Canadian city that exists and change the name slightly to create a fictional name.
Avoid names that seem obvious, such as Vengeance or Hell, as the reader will be alerted right away to the meaning behind the name. The use of obvious names can be effective if the town acts in contrast to the name. For example, a town named Hell that has the nicest, most pleasant townspeople.

, Now that you have a name, you are going to need to think about the history behind the city. Creating a historical record of the city will help the city to feel more believable to your characters and to your readers. You should answer several key questions about your city, including:Who founded the city? This could be a lone explorer who stumbled on the land or Native peoples who built up the city piece by piece using basic tools. Think about the individual or individuals responsible for founding the city.
When was the city founded? This can help you get a better sense of the development of the city, as a city founded 100 years ago will have a denser history than a city founded 15 years ago.
Why was the city founded? Answering this question can help you better describe the city’s past. Maybe the city was founded through colonization, where a foreign explorer claimed the land and colonized it. Or maybe the city was founded by people who discovered empty land and built it up on their own. The reasons for the city’s existence will help you get a better sense of your characters, as they may have personal ties and connections to the city due to how the city was founded and why it was founded.
How old is the city? The age of the city is another important element. An older city may have city planning details that have been preserved, while a newer city may have very few old buildings and an experimental approach to city planning.

, Is the city nestled in the mountains, surrounded by forest? Or is the city located in the desert, surrounded by sand dunes? Your city may be more urban, with a large population and a skyline of buildings and office towers, or your city may more small town, with a mid to small population and a few major streets. Focus on how a stranger to the town might view the city, including the vegetation, the terrain, and the landscape.


You should also think about the climate of the city. Is it hot and humid or cold and dry? The climate may also depend on the time of year when your story is taking place. If your story takes place in the middle of winter in a fictional town located in Northern California, for example, it may be warm during the day and cooler at night.

, The demographics of the city means the type of individuals that make up the city in terms of race, gender, and class. Though your city may be fictional, there will likely be variations in the demographics of the city. You should include details about the demographics, as this will make the city feel more believable.Consider the racial and ethnic groups in your city. Are there more African American individuals than Latinos or Caucasians? Do certain ethnic groups live in certain areas of the city? Are there areas where certain ethnic groups are not allowed or feel uncomfortable being in?
Think about the class dynamics in your city. This could mean a character who is middle class lives in a certain area of the city and a character of an upper class lives in a more lavish or expensive area of the city. Your fictional city may be divided by class, with certain areas off limits to all classes except for one class.

, It can be helpful to have a physical representation of the city, even if you don’t have the best drawing skills. Make a rough sketch of the city, including major landmarks and the homes where your main characters live as well as where they work.You may also notate landscape details, like a mountain range that borders the city or sand dunes that protect the city from the outside. Try to add as many details as possible, as this will help you build a more convincing fictional world.
If you have a friend who is talented at illustration, you may ask them to help you draw a map of the city in more detail. You can also use online resources to help you build the map. Use a program like Photoshop, for example, to cut and paste images from the internet to create a map or a physical representation of the city.

, Now that you have the basics of the city down, you can start to add some local color. Consider the unique or interesting elements of the city that makes it worth reading about. This could be haunted areas of the city or famous ghost stories that haunt the city. Or, this could be legends about the city that are shared and passed around by characters.You should also think about what the town is known for, according to the outside world. Maybe the city is known as the center of commerce or has one of the most renown sports teams.
Consider what locals love or enjoy about the city, as this will make it feel more unique. What are the hotspots and cool hang out areas in the city? What are the locals proud of in terms of their city and what are they ashamed of or afraid of in their city?

, While it can be tempting to get very in depth and detailed about your fictional world, it is also important that you focus on specific details that are an essential part of the overall story. The city should serve your characters and your story, not the other way around. Home in on certain areas in the city that are used by your characters and spend time developing these more fully.For example, maybe your character spends a lot of time at the private school located in the city center. Take the time to think about small details of the school, from how the building appears within the surrounding area to the school colors and the school mascot. Focus on the area around the school and the layout of the school, including classrooms and areas your character spends a lot of time in.

, A big part of creating a believable world is making the reader feel like they are actually experiencing the city, from the smell of the garbage to the noises on the street. Create descriptions that draw on sight, taste, smell, touch, and sound to help your city come alive.For example, maybe your city has a polluted river that runs through the area. Think of how it smells as you walk by the river. Have your characters comment on the stench of the river and the way the river looks or sounds.
Your story will likely involve several locations or settings that recur. Focus on using the five senses to describe these recurring settings well, as this will help the world of the story feel more convincing.

, Your reader will be aware she is reading fiction and will likely accept a lot of strange and imaginative elements of the city. But it may be useful to also include elements of real life in the city. This will help your reader feel more grounded in the city as your story moves along.For example, your characters may spend time in a dense urban area in the city. The area may be populated with strange creatures and monsters but it may also have elements you may find in a real life urban area, like buildings, streets, and alleyways. Having real life details and imagined details together can make it easier to build a believable world.

, Once you have a more detailed understanding of your fictional city, it can be helpful to write your characters into the setting to see how they interact and move around. The fictional city should support your overall story and your characters should be able to access elements of the city that are necessary to move the story forward.For example, if you have a character who needs to access a magical portal in the middle of the city to time travel, you should make sure the magical portal is described well in the fictional city. The magical portal should contain enough detail to be believable and your character should interact with it in an interesting way. This will ensure your fictional city is supporting your character’s needs and goals.

, A big challenge when writing about a fictional city in a story is avoiding obvious moments of description, where you put a description of the city in a character's voice to give the reader information about the setting. This can feel like the writer is trying to ""talk"" through her characters in a way that may feel obvious and forced. You can side step this issue by using the voices of your characters to inform the ways in which you describe the fictional city.


Place your character in a situation where she has to walk around or interact with a certain section of the city. Or, have your character use a facility in the city that then allows her to describe how it feels to use the facility. This will give you the opportunity to have descriptions of the fictional city through the perspective of the character, which will feel more believable and convincing to the reader than simply telling the reader about the facility.
You should also have your characters treat the more fantastical or strange elements of the fictional city casually and in a straightforward manner. If your fictional city is located under water, for example, a character who has lived in the city for a long period of time may not be surprised that he has to get in his submarine to visit with his neighbor. You can describe the character getting into the submarine and programming it for it's destination in a casual, every day kind of way. This will signal to the reader that submarines are common in this fictional city and used as a form of transportation without having to directly tell the reader that this is the case.

Go back, reread, and revise.,
Edit your work.,
By now, your writing is just about perfect.",How to Write Young Adult Fiction," Practice writing short stories, like experiences from your own life. Use plenty of description, vivid words, and exaggeration. Make the short stories interesting. Try different writing styles, like poetry, nonfiction, fiction, persuasion, descriptivism, etc. Read the classics to get an idea of what it takes to be a master. Write a lot, but don't feel forced to write all the time. Creativity comes naturally, and so do thoughts in writing.;
, This isn't a very good ""step"", because you can't force this, so wait for it to come naturally. Your writing should be different, and should stand out. Are your sentences short and to the point, or long and descriptive? Are your story plots complicated or simple? If you can answer these types of questions, you know you've got a good style going on.

, What would a ""young adult"" (aged from about 13-20) like to read about? What did you like to read at that age? What do kids of that age read now? Take some time to look at old Young Adult Fiction favorite topics- vampires, werewolves, school stories, witches, wizards, and teenage romance- you get the idea. Try to pick one that could be popular, but hasn't been worn out already. Make sure you love it, too!

, Male or female? Regular or supernatural? Think about what they look like, where they come from, how they speak, whom they love and hate, and how everything blends and form the character that you have skillfully created. In your story, you don't have to reveal everything about the character, or provide explanations. All people are a little mysterious, but most aren't too mysterious. Don't make them people in your story- make them people, people who can live and think and reason, just like us!

, Find fascinating settings for the stories to take place in. Come up with a problem, which is the main things that keeps the story moving. You can make it complex or simple, but don't make it disappear that easily. Find a solution (but only if you want, maybe your problem doesn't have one.) Make sure that your characters change in some way and there is a message/moral to the story. What's the point of writing if it doesn't mean anything?

, Break the writing up into manageable sections or chapters, so it doesn't get too tedious. Make your writing pop- don't leave the reader after a chapter not wanting to go on. Add mini cliffhangers after chapters and major cliffhangers after parts. Keep on changing up what's going on and make the plot transitions smooth.


It's common to hit roadblocks at this step and fall into despair. Don't worry; this is completely normal for any writer - professional or first-timer. When this happens, step away from your work. Take a walk or get moving on the treadmill. Then approach your story with a refreshed mind.

, This means serious, hard-core revising, with taking out sections and putting in sections, choosing better words to use, and changing weird parts. Ask someone else to read it and help you pick out awkward parts. Ask many people to help you!

, Fix those annoying grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. Use a computer or a friend to help you.

, Look at all the way you've come: before, you were a little confused. Now you've learned to write well, chosen your topic, wrote the story, and fixed the story. It is now time to share it with the world! Go on, don't keep it to yourself!

You can look for scholarly texts online at the library and ask the reference librarian for assistance with finding research books about this historical event.You can also look at magazines, newspapers, and catalogues from the time period at the library. The library should have these texts on microfilm so you can scan through them and get an idea of the fashions, trends, and discussions happening during the time.
Your library may also have a Civil War section where there are texts that focus on different aspects of the Civil War. Check with the reference librarian about a section or grouping of research books that focus on this historical event.;
, You can get a lot of the human elements of the Civil War by reading personal documents written by soldiers during that time. Many soldiers kept diaries on the front and sent letters to loved ones. You can use these documents to get into the mindset of a Civil War soldier and of someone waiting for a soldier to come home safely.You can find a cache of letters and diaries by Civil War soldiers online through the U.S. National Park Service (NPS).You may also be able to access personal documents through a Civil War historical society.

, Depending on where you live, you may be able to get in touch with a Civil War historical society in your area. You can then ask them if there is going to be a Civil War reenactment coming up. These events are a great way to see how soldiers used weapons during the Civil War as well as how they dressed, how to interacted, and how they used other tools in camp during the war.These reenactments are also a great opportunity to experience the sensory details of being in a battle during this time, from the sound of cannons and muskets firing to horse-drawn ambulances rumbling on the ground.
Civil War reenactments often occur on special holidays to commemorate war heroes, such as Veteran’s Day or Memorial Day. You may also be able to find out more information on the dates of the reenactments from your local Civil War historical society.

, You should also reach out to the experts to get a better sense of what life was like for soldiers and civilians alive during the Civil War. You may be able to locate experts through your local Civil War historical society or through a Civil War museum in your area.You can also look up experts online and contact them with specific questions about the Civil War. Try to contact experts who specialize in a certain aspect of the Civil War, such as Civil War weaponry or the role of women during the Civil War. This way, you can get detailed information about the topic.

, If possible, you should consider trying to follow the path of the historical figures of the Civil War by doing some of their daily chores and practices yourself. You may volunteer at a Civil War reenactment or at your local Civil War historical society so you can get some hands on experience.You may try to do some of the domestic work of the time period, such as tend a stove fire all day, do embroidery, and use an outhouse. You may also dress in some of the clothing of the period to experience what it felt like to get dressed during this time period.
You may also practice using weaponry from the time period to get a sense of what it was like to fight during the war. If possible, it may be useful to also visit the sites of some of the battles of the Civil War, many of which have become monuments, to get a better sense of what it was like to walk through the site and fight on it., You can also get a better idea of the genre by reading popular examples of civil war historical fiction. You can then compare and contrast these texts, looking at the approach their writers took to address the material. You should also note the narrative style and tone of each text. Example texts include:Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker by Jennifer Chiaverini.

The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara.

My Name is Mary Sutter by Robin Oliveria.

The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane.

, Much of the American Civil War happened on the battlefield or around the battlefield. Your story will likely involve at least one battle scene or several battle scenes. You may choose a particular battle and focus on researching the details so it appears historically accurate and convincing on the page.You can read through a detailed list of Civil War battles to get a better sense of which battles were pivotal for certain groups or companies of soldiers through American Civil War Story. There were thousands of small battles during the war but many of the major battles are listed and documented.
You may also choose a well known Civil War battle, such as the Battle of Palmito Ranch in May 1865, the last battle of the Civil War. You may then focus on the details of the battle and place your characters in this battle as the setting for the conflict and the major events.

, You should also consider what civilian life was like during the Civil War and use the domestic space as a setting for your story. Maybe you focus on how women and older people who did not fight in a battle lived.As the war escalated, many civilian areas became battlegrounds, forcing civilians to go into hiding or leave to become refugees in another area of the country. This means that they have have domestic lives that were then interrupted by the war. You could describe the contrast between these two settings.
You should also consider how the Civil War affected the North and the South of the country in different ways. Individuals who lived in the South were often refugees or casualties of war and did not maintain a domestic way of life for long.

, When you are building your historical setting, you should try to always use details and description that invoke the senses. Consider how a room smells, looks, feels, sounds, and tastes to your characters. Using sensory detail will immerse your reader in the world of the story.For example, you may describe a battle scene based on how it felt to trample through mud and blood, and how the mud and blood smelled to soldiers during the battle. You may also describe how food rations tasted to soldiers who hadn’t eaten in days and the sound of cannons firing from across the battlefield.

, You should lean on the fascinating history of the Civil War and the historical figures of the time to create characters. You may focus on a soldier from a certain town or area or civilians who survived as refugees during the war. You could then use their historical backstories to create characters for your fiction.You may decide to focus on lesser known figures of the war, such as the African American soldiers who fought in the conflict or the enemy soldiers who lived in prisoner of war camps. Or you may decide to look at the war from the point of view of a spy for the enemy.You may also focus on a civilian woman who is away from her soldier lover during the Civil War or you may use historical figures like a known General or high ranking officer.

, Make sure you strive for accuracy when you create characters for your historical fiction, as readers are more likely to buy into a story that feels well researched. Often, the facts can be even more entertaining than fiction. Try to strive for accuracy and realism in your writing, especially if you are using existing historical characters as models for your fictional ones.For example, if you are writing about a character who is a soldier in the war, you would not include details about weaponry that did not exist during the Civil War, like handguns or grenades.
You should also try to strive for historical accuracy when you are writing about civilian life, where individuals lived in towns or villages without running water or electricity. Do not include details that do not fit the time period, as this will signal to your reader that you have not done enough research about life during the Civil War.

, You should also sit down and create character studies of your characters so you have a better sense of their backstory. You may create character studies for all of your characters or for several key characters, including your protagonist, your antagonist, any love or friend interests, and any supporting characters. An example character study may look like:Physical characteristics: Female, short, plump, wide nose, big eyes, with long plaited hair. Scar on her left hand from a musket shot gone wrong.
Emotional characteristics: Smart, strong, self-sufficient, ability to use a musket and other weaponry, a desire to fight for her country.

, Begin the writing process by creating a plot outline. This will give you a general sense of where your story is going to go. You can deviate from the outline once you get into the writing. But having an outline as a guide can make it easier to get into the writing and start generating words on the page.


One option is to use a plot diagram as your outline. A plot diagram contains six sections: the set up, the inciting incident, the rising action, the climax, the falling action, and the resolution.
Another option is to use the snowflake method. The snowflake method is often used by writers who do not want to follow the more traditional plot diagram, but are still looking for a way to organize their story. The snowflake diagram consists of a one sentence summary of the story, a one paragraph summary of the story, character synopses, and a summary of scenes.

, You should consider centering your story around a major event in the Civil War or several historical events during this time. Your story is about life during the war, after all, so it should feature events during the war that caused major issues. You can then have these conflicts create problems for the characters in your story.For example, you may write a story about a young woman from the South who tries to disguise herself as a man and fight for her country. You may then center her story around a known brawl on the battlegrounds that occurred in camp or around a gathering of soldiers at a banquet that occurred during the war and use the event to show her character in action.

, Though you should always try to be historically accurate in your writing, you should also remember that you are writing fiction. You do not need to follow the history completely when you are writing your story. You may decide to deviate from the history of the Civil War for the good for your story and as a way to generate more conflict for your characters.For example, in your story about a woman trying to fight as a man on the battlefield, you may realize that there were physical exams in place to prevent such a thing from occurring. You may then create a distraction or a way out of the exam for your character, allowing her to somehow get away with enlisting as a woman.
Though this may not be historically accurate, it does help to further your plot and your story. For this reason, it may be worth doing.

, Cliches are phrases that have become so familiar they have lost their meaning. You should try to push yourself to come up with original descriptions and details that will seem unfamiliar and surprising to your reader.For example, rather than describe the sound of cannon fire as “vibrating with a loud boom”, you may go for a more unfamiliar description, as “tossing the ground like an earthquake” or “vibrating like the trembling hand on the trigger of a musket.”

, You should take the time to read the draft of your story out loud. Listen for any awkward sentences or cliche terms. Highlight them for revision. Make sure you are certain of the historical details in your story. If you are unclear about any of the details, you should go back and do more research to ensure you got it right.


You may also read your draft out loud to a trusted reader for a second opinion. Be willing to accept feedback and constructive criticism, as this will only make your story stronger.

",How to Write About Fictional Deaths,";
, Is it crucial to the plot? Do you have a good enough reason? Are you just getting rid of this person because they are starting to irk you? If the latter is the case, then take into account that this is not a good enough reason. Try to figure out a plot reason.

, This needs to be decided well in advance. If you do not know how this would work, then look it up. No details here, but things that you're unsure of can be easily found on the net.

, Don't kill people too early in, unless it is essential. Lots of deaths in the beginning turn some people off. On the other hand, this can warn the reader if your book is bloody or dark.

, Will people be there to witness it? Will people only find out after it happens? How will the other characters take this?

, Think of what genre you are writing, and whether you want to describe the death happening. If you're writing drama or horror, then detail is only expected. However, don't over-do it. We seriously do not need to know that much. Too much gore is a major turn off for many.

, This does not necessarily include the whole story, just anything that pertains to it. If you want to write the part where they are catching butterflies in the beginning of the book. Edit the book. Whatever. Just try to forget about it.

,, This is important, especially if the person knows the plot or has been with your story from the beginning. If they're crying (this is, of course, relative. If these friends has never cried in your presence or cried during Ella Enchanted, find different friends to read it), then go with it. You've done well. If not, ask them what you can change.

Many scholars consider the epic works of Homer to be among the oldest examples of Greek tragedy, in which great heroes like Odysseus are faced with a series of misfortunes. But perhaps the most well-known tragedies are those penned by William Shakespeare, such as Hamlet or Julius Cesar, in which the hero almost invariably dies after tremendous suffering and misery.


Greek tragedies tended to address a single topic and its plot, while English tragedies (including the works of Shakespeare) usually have multiple storylines that are tied together through shared loss and suffering.For a comprehensive collection of tragic works, consult your library, or search online. Many scholars and literary critics publish their own listings of what they consider the most important/influential works of literature.;
, Though every tragedy is unique in its characters and plot points, there are some basic tropes of tragedy that tend to apply to all literary works in the genre. A tragedy generally involves either a tragic hero (often a person of great social importance), who suffers some great downfall and/or death as a result of some significant action or inaction, or the scapegoat (a person of low social importance), who is involuntarily thrust into tragic circumstances beyond his/her control.Most tragedies will have some or all of the following character types:


protagonist - the lead character, who is almost always a tragic hero
antagonist - any person or thing against which the protagonist struggles (often a villain, but not always)
foils/counterparts - side characters, often associated with the protagonist or antagonist, who reveal or complicate some key aspect(s) of the main characters
stock characters - often used to exaggerate or expand on some characteristic that arises in the rest of the tragedy
narrators/chorus - not necessarily present in every work of tragedy, but an important part of certain works, often used to communicate directly with the audience

, Nearly every tragedy has a tragic hero at its center. In early Greek tragedies that hero was often a god, but as the genre grew the tragic hero came to include war heroes and even royalty or political figures. The general rule for tragic heroes today is that the character must be morally strong and essentially admirable to the audience.The tragic hero must experience some type of downfall (known as the ""hamartia,"" or ""tragic error""), often as a result of that character's hubris (often thought of as pride, though it also includes overstepping one's cultural/ethical limitations).
The tragic hero usually experiences some sort of insight or recognition of his tragic fate (called the ""anagnorisis""). At this point he knows that there is no going back, and that he must let the tragic fate before him play out.
Above all else, the tragic hero should be pitiable. This is because he is destined to experience a downfall, and an audience would cheer or feel a sense of relief when a villain experiences misfortune. The true tragedy of a tragic work is that anyone could experience the sort of suffering that happens to the hero, and his downfall should purge the negative emotions of the audience.

, Just as every tragedy will feature unique characters that fall into a standard ""type,"" so each plot may be unique and original, while still falling into a common formulaic structure. The essential elements of every tragedy include:


exposition - the essential ""background"" information, which may be delivered all at once in the beginning of the play or throughout the dramatic piece via dialogue and/or soliloquies
conflict - the tension that arises as a result of some conflict, usually between either character vs. self, character vs. character, character vs. environment, character vs. natural forces, or character vs. group
climax - the point in the play in which tension cannon be reversed and events must turn towards one of two outcomes
resolution/denouement - the unraveling or release of tension, often through the death of one or more characters in the play

, The plot structure of a tragedy typically relies on one of three types of plot. Those plot types are:


climactic - tension builds toward a single point (climax) before the resolution, usually through a linear structure comprised of causal actions
episodic - often composed of numerous short, fragmented scenes involving many characters and numerous threads of action to highlight various aspects of humanity
non-sequitur - inconsistent events involving existential, often under-developed characters engaged in something relatively meaningless, meant to highlight the absurdity of existence

, Tragedies have traditionally been written and performed as plays. This dates back to the earliest tragedies, which were part of a Dionysian ceremony in which performers dressed as goats to reenact a hero's suffering or death.However, tragedies can also be written for a reading audience instead of a performance audience, which means novels/novellas and even young-adult fiction can all be classified as works of tragedy.Which mode of storytelling you choose will depend on both your areas of strength/comfort as a writer and the nature of the story you'll be telling.
If you're equally experienced (or equally inexperienced) in both fiction and drama, try to choose a mode that fits your desired story. It may be easier to devise a storyline first without imposing the format of a play or a novel on your idea.

, Once you have a firm grasp on the nature of tragedies and their basic structural components, you'll need to create a basic outline of your plot. The plot of your tragedy will be the basic events and occurrences which will take place in your work. It should be about some basic idea, though ultimately the idea should come across through plot and character, rather than being simply ""about"" that idea.In other words, your story should mean something without coming right out and telling the audience what the story literally means.


If you are basing your tragedy on an existing myth, you'll be somewhat bound to the events of that myth, and will not be able to significantly deviate from the main plot points within that myth without your audience losing interest. You may, however, be able to radically reinterpret a myth whose outcome is vague or ambiguous.Alternately, you may wish to create your own storyline from scratch, in which case you will not be bound by any canonical characters or events.
Choose a plot that will help you tell the story you feel compelled to write. Don't think of the plot as a restriction. Instead, think of it as a lens through which you can write about some struggle or aspect of humanity.

, Once you have a basic story idea, you'll need to outline the plot for that story. The easiest way to do this is to write out a few basic aspects of your story, so that you can further develop those aspects and arrange them into a coherent storyline. A good place to begin is by outlining the following parts of your tragedy:


motivation - why the protagonist and antagonist do what they do in the story
basic structure - the overall events that make up your story, and the sequence in which those events occur and/or initiate other events that will take place
outcome - what will ultimately happen to resolve your story
subplots - any sub-story lines you'd like to complicate your story or further challenge your characters

, Now that you've come up with a story and mapped out the basic structure of your plot, you'll want to create the characters who will act out your tragedy. You'll need the basic characters found in most tragedies, including a protagonist, antagonist, foil characters, and stock characters. At this point, you won't need to actually write dialogue for the characters, but you should be thinking about how they will play out on the page or on stage. You can keep track of these ideas by writing out a few sentences or a paragraph of notes on each major character.


Think about what kinds of characters would fill the roles created by your story.
Consider the relationships between each character. If they interact at all, or have any kind of knowledge of one another, they should have a clear and unambiguous relationship with one another. Common relationships typically fall into romantic, parent/child, sibling, friends, aggressor/victim, rival/adversary, boss/employee, or caregiver/receiver dynamics.Remember to include a tragic hero. At this point you should decide what his general downfall will be, and what choices he will make that will lead him to his fate.Consider making the characters question themselves, others, or their relationships with one another. You may also want to give them strong opinions, and use those opinions to further develop each character's personality and role.Your characters should be realistic and human enough to be likable and relatable, but because you're writing a tragedy, you may want to make one or more of the characters somehow superior to humans. This can take the shape of exceptional heroism, great wealth/power, or it could mean that one or more characters are actually super-human (gods/goddesses, magicians, etc.)., By now you should have come up with a basic premise, outlined the series of events that will tell that story, and created characters to enact those events. Once this is complete, you'll need to expand your plot into a full, functional story. Depending on where your strengths lie, this may be the easy part for you, or the extraordinarily difficult part of developing a story.


Focus on the details. Details are what bring a story to life, but you also have to be careful not to weigh down your story with useless trivialities. When in doubt, think of the Chekhov's Gun principle: if you're going to include something (like placing a gun on stage), it must be relevant (for example, the aforementioned gun must be used in some significant way).Make things more complex. That could mean simply adding some type of plot twist, but a more effective way to complicate the story would be to develop something really interesting and compelling about some of the main characters. That way they become more three-dimensional and in turn more human - remember, no living person is ever as simple as they might appear in a character description.Think about the ways in which each character changes throughout the course of your tragedy. If any of the main characters emerges unchanged (other than, say, a villain who will never feel remorse for his actions), your tragedy is not developed enough.Let your characters be emotional. Don't make them unrealistically emotional, but ensure that as they suffer on the page, their suffering is apparent and acknowledged by the audience.

, You should already have a general idea of what will happen to the tragic hero and what series of events will lead to his fate. But as you go through the process of writing your tragedy, you should expand on that series of events and weave elements of the hero's demise throughout the book or play. This is the central element of a work of tragedy, and it requires consistency throughout the manuscript and sufficient time to develop and unfold on the page (or on stage).If the hero's tragedy involves revenge, the reader/audience should understand the reasons for that revenge from the first few scenes or chapters. For example, in Shakespeare's great tragedy Hamlet, the audience is introduced to the ghost of King Hamlet in Act One, Scene One, and knows that his death will be a significant aspect of the play that follows.
All of the important characters who are relevant to the hero and his downfall should be introduced fairly early on in the tragedy. The play/novel should begin by giving expository information or contextual clues to explain the hero's situation, and should begin setting up the hero's rise to hubris and eventual downfall from the very start.

, Simile and metaphor have historically been tremendously important to any successful tragedy. They give further meaning to the words on the page or the actions on the stage, and they allow the reader/audience to feel involved in the story by deciphering your comparisons and reading into the ""bigger picture"" of your work.Metaphors are comparisons between two things, while similes compare things using the words ""like"" or ""as"". All similes are metaphors, but not all metaphors are similes.An example of a metaphor would be, ""Her eyes shine into mine."" The reader knows that a character's eyes do not literally emit light, and it's clear the author meant that a character has bright, captivating eyes.
An example of a simile would be, ""As she cried, her eyes glistened like stars."" Again, the reader knows that the character's eyes are not literally similar to a celestial body, but simile and metaphor both lend a poetic quality to the language used in a piece of writing.

, Scenes are the bread and butter of a tragedy. They are the framework in which everything happens, and each scene should have a clear beginning, middle, and ending that also contributes toward the overall storyline.


Every scene should have a basic buildup, action, climax, and resolution/wind down., As you expand on the plot, if you find yourself wondering whether the plot is meaningful enough, think about ways to raise the stakes.For example, if someone is afraid that her husband will be kidnapped and murdered, make it clear to the reader why that would be tragic. Has she lost someone important to her in the past? In the world you've created, would she be able to survive as a widow? All of these questions will make a difference between the audience thinking ""That's unfortunate that her husband died"" and ""This is a tragic event that will probably lead to her own death.""


Tragedies are full of horrible, disastrous events. Make it clear that the upsetting things that happen to your characters are horrible beyond the surface-level shock.

, Just as every action must have an equal reaction, every tragedy's tension must have a resolution. You simply cannot leave critical events unresolved or end a tragedy without everyone's lives changing (usually by falling apart) in some way. All loose ends must be resolved, anything set in motion during the tragedy should come to pass, and the horrible things that happened in the play should lead to meaningful suffering/loss/death.Let the resolution of tension lead into a natural ending place for the story. The plot will suffer if the story continues for any significant length after the tension has resolved, because there will no longer be any stakes driving the story or affecting the characters.

, Like any piece of writing, your tragedy will need to undergo a revision or two once it's finished. This may entail providing further details to develop a character, filling in plot holes, and adding/removing or re-writing scenes as needed. You can revise the manuscript yourself, or ask someone you know and trust for an honest evaluation of the manuscript.


Give yourself two to four weeks after finishing the manuscript before you attempt to revise it. It can be difficult to distance yourself from your work after only a few days, and because the story is still fresh in your mind you may overlook certain things that wouldn't make sense to an outside reader.
Try doing a read through before you sit down to make any actual changes. Just take notes on any sections that are confusing, underdeveloped, or unnecessary/irrelevant without stopping to revise. Then you can decide how to remedy those issues once you've gotten all the way through the manuscript.
As you read and revise, ask yourself whether the story makes sense as a whole, whether the plot is compelling/engaging, whether it flows smoothly or feels choppy, and whether the stakes are high enough for the characters involved to elicit an emotional response from your readers/audience.Think about the impact the final product will have on your readers/audience.
Remember that the tragic hero should be a likable character with good, desirable qualities whose demise results from his/her own choices, whether those choices are actions or inactions. Will your hero's downfall ultimately cause the readers/audience to feel pity and fear? If not, you may need to make significant revisions to your manuscript., Once you've hammered out the larger issues within the manuscript during the revision stage, you'll need to do a thorough editing of the entire work. This may include checking spelling, ensuring subject-verb agreement, correcting for tense agreements, and taking out any ""filler"" portions of the manuscript.


Make sure that the way you choose your words and phrase your sentences is precise and meticulous. Cut out any unnecessary words (""filler""), confusing words/terms, and poorly-constructed sentences.Avoid repeating the same words needlessly. It comes across as sloppy or weak. Instead, find new and interesting ways to say what you're trying to say.Resolve any run-on sentences and any sentence fragments in your work. These can be confusing for readers/audience members, and may be difficult for actors to speak."

Think about the aftermath.",How to Write a Story About a Hero," A good starting place is either the plot or the hero. Once you have these two things, create more characters. Give your hero a family, friends, and some enemies. Include details. What are your characters' names? How old are they? What are their hobbies? What was their past like?
, Where does the hero live? Where does he/she travel? When does this happen?, Introduce the hero. What is his/her personality? How are they physically? What does he/she look like? Where does he or she live? Is he/she clever, strong, considerate...? Tell as much about him/her as possible. wut

, Has anybody in his/her family died? If so, how? What is their reputation? Do they travel a lot? Are they rich or poor? What does the hero think of his/her family?, They should spend a good chunk of the story trying to reach this goal. The task will usually benefit many people, not just the hero., They should help the hero and be or become his/her friends. They should play an important role in the hero achieving his/her goal., This enemy will usually be the villain of the story. The hero's goal will often be to defeat this enemy or to stop them from doing something bad. MAKE SURE THIS ENEMY WORKS FOR YOUR STORY! If you need someone who is completely evil for your story, go ahead, but if all your story needs is a bully, all you should have is a bully. Don't overdo it., Achieving their goal won't be easy. What do they have to do? Travel long distances? Fight the enemy or his/her supporters? Add as many things as you want to., If somebody they care about dies, think about his/her reaction. They won't get over it in just a few days. Keep this in mind as you write., This usually ends with the villain/enemy being defeated or redeemed, but it's your story, so you can have it end in any way you want, even with the villain/enemy winning., If the hero wins, he/she will usually be respected and admired. If the enemy wins, what happens next? Will there be a sad ending? Will the hero's friends kill the villain/enemy? Or will the enemy/villain win leaving room for a sequel?"

Think about the kind of fairy you want to write about.,
Find out or make up their name.,
Create a plot.,
Figure out the setting of your story (when and where it takes place).,
Get writing!",How to Write a Story on Fairies," If you have ever heard of Summer and Winter fairies, you can write about them; or you could write about fairies of elements such as Water, Wind, Fire, Wood, etc. You can do a quick Google search on fairy legends and folklore for more inspiration (or go further than Google and Wikipedia, if this subject really interests you). Take bits and pieces of the fairies you come across that you like. Go to the library to see how other authors have written their fairies before you.;
, A good place to start looking for names is their element or theme. The name ""Pearl"" might fit a water/sea fairy, ""Breeze"" for a wind fairy, or ""Sparks"" for a fire fairy. These fairy names are all fairly simple; don't be afraid to think outside the box! Keep in mind that their name doesn't necessarily have to be based on their element, but it is a good starting point.

, Transformation stories can go anywhere- a human turning into a fairy, or vice versa. Or the plot could be more complicated- two fairies fall in love, one has a curse that turns the fairy into a human, the fairy-human dies, and the two characters can't be together. (These are only ideas to get you started-- the possibilities are endless.) Write the story that makes you want to write; when that doesn't work, write because it's the story you want to read.

, Time and place play a very important role in your story: they set the stage for your characters' lives. Try to think about what your favorite place is, or what era you're fascinated with. If it's a setting that can be researched, research it! It's important to make fictional stories as believable as possible, and getting your facts straight wouldn't hurt.

, Write as much as possible, whenever possible. You never know which idea is the one you keep at for years and years until it's a full story. It's a good idea to keep a note pad with you at all times to write down anything that strikes your fancy; ideas, like fairies, are hard to catch and even harder to keep.

However, in comedic writing, humor is often based on situations. Before you start writing out the storyline for your work, it may be helpful to consider where your story might take place and how you can derive humor from that setting.Try to be original in choosing your setting. Readers may be turned off if it's a setting they're too familiar with, as it may feel like the story has been recycled.
For short stories, it's best to stick with as few setting changes as possible. Aim to work within just one setting, but don't exceed two.

, A plot is the most important component of any story. Plot is simply what happens in the story, who is involved, and how that series of events unfolds.Most compelling stories have a beginning, middle, and end. Across that timeline there is a source of rising tension, a climax (breaking point of the tension), and an unraveling of tension that leads into the ending.
Think about what the source of tension/drama will be, and try to work that tension into the specific setting you've chosen for the story.
Consider how the source of tension can work with that setting. Perhaps the setting might heighten the tension, for example, or create a comedic situation by way of contrast with the location where the events unfold.

, Every story needs interesting, realistic characters. A funny story needs interesting, realistic characters who either have funny qualities or who find themselves in funny situations.How you depict the characters may depend on their personalities and circumstances within the story.
For example, you might depict a bumbling ""idiot"" character who stumbles into funny situations, or a sarcastic character who thinks he knows it all and realizes that he doesn't know anything about his own circumstances.
Make sure your characters are realistic and believable. A good character should have feelings/opinions and should be capable of reacting to his or her situation in realistic ways on the page.Think about what kinds of characters could make your setting funny, or vice versa. All the elements of your story (setting, plot, and characters) should ideally work together, either by mixing well or by creating funny and unexpected contrasts.

, As you plan out the humorous aspects of your short, funny story, it may be helpful to pull together things that you find funny from every aspect of your life. It can be personal, political, cultural - whatever you find funny, jot down notes on the story (the actual plot), the situation (what your story is actually about - for example, the dynamics of friendship), and why you find it funny.Try keeping a notebook of ideas and inspiration. Write down funny things you see and hear, or any ideas that come to mind.
Don't be afraid to draw on humorous elements of your own life and your friends' lives.
Your funny, short story doesn't need to be 100% autobiographical, but incorporating bits and pieces of awkward or funny situations from your own life can bring a sense of personality to your work.
Keep up on current events. You may not end up writing a story about world news or celebrity gossip, but you may find inspiration or even ways to directly draw plot elements from real events that are culturally relevant.

, Comedy requires a certain level of honesty on the part of the comedian. The same is true of writing, so it makes sense that you should be honest with yourself as a writer of short, funny stories. Before you sit down to write your story, you should have a firm sense of what you think/believe about the world so that your humorous observations and writing in general can stem from that element of yourself.You wouldn't tell a political joke to your friends without taking some stance on the matter, so why try to be unbiased in your written humor?
Don't be so abrasive that your humor would alienate people who disagree with you, but make sure that you at least know where you stand on certain issues so that you can find the situational humor in them.

, If you're struggling to write a short, funny story, it might be helpful to seek outside inspiration. Inspiration can come in many forms, but the best ways to get inspired for a project like this involve immersing yourself in funny stories (both written and visual).Read funny stories. You can find stories by searching online, or by checking at your local library or book store.
Watch funny movies and TV shows. Though it's not the same format as you're working with, you might still get some inspiration.
As you watch and read things that entertain you, try to analyze the humor.
Think about why you find certain things funny, consider the ways an author or script writer might have crafted those humorous elements on the page, and look for ways to adapt that style of humor to your own writing.

, If you intend to incorporate actual jokes into your writing, you should familiarize yourself with how comedians construct their jokes. You don't need to include jokes, but it's important to do it right if you're going to do it at all. A joke should be unambiguously funny and shouldn't require the reader to dwell on the joke in order to find it funny. Ideally, your joke should elicit laughter as soon as your reader finishes reading it.


If you intend to deliver a punch line, make sure it goes at the end of the joke. Otherwise it might confuse readers and leave them wondering what the funny part is supposed to be.Try putting together a list of two things that go together, then add a third seemingly unrelated thing. This is called the Rule of Threes.The third thing you list should be where the humor comes from. It may be funny because the third thing doesn't match the others, or because the third thing highlights some type of truth.
As an example, you might say something like, ""My doctor thinks I'm losing it. He told me his recommendation is to get more fresh air, get more exercise, and stop calling him at 3:00 AM asking what's wrong with me.""

, It may sound strange to suggest that a funny story should use humor sparingly, but too much humor can ruin a story. You don't want to cram the humor down your readers' throats; it should be funny without feeling like a comedic attack.Remember that a funny story should still have a functional plot with realistic characters and dialogue. You can't have a funny story just be joke after joke the whole time.
Let the humor stem from the setting, characters, and situations, or some combination of them. If you're trying to cram too much humor into a story (even a funny story), it can make your writing feel like a corny gimmick.

, In any story, you'll want to let the reader know who is involved, where the story takes place, and some hint of what the story is all about. This is true of funny stories as well, but with the added element of humor. Don't leave your readers guessing at anything for long, or they may not continue to read your story.The beginning of any short story should establish the setting and at least one character.
Describe where the action is taking place, but try to make that description relevant. Find ways to draw tension and/or humor from the setting as much as possible.
Think about how and when the humorous elements of your story will unfold, and try to at least hint at them from the onset of the story.
Remember that a short story's beginning should set something up, whether it's tension, a source of humor within the story, or something that will be vital to the story at a later point.

, The middle of a story is where things typically get complex. In a short, funny story, the middle should also provide a decent amount of humor, or at least a strong setup for something funny that is yet to come in the story.Your story's middle section will probably be the longest. Make your words count by making things get interesting for one or more characters in this section.
Tension should complicate the lives of your most important characters and form the basic arc of your story.Tension often arises from conflict, usually between the protagonist and another person, himself/herself, nature, technology, society, or God/gods/goddesses.
You may want to incorporate humor that's derived from the tension, or you may choose to deliver humor as a sort of comic relief that accompanies the tension so that it doesn't get too serious.

, When writing in short form, you won't have a lot of space on the page for long, drawn-out resolutions. Things need to get wrapped up in a timely manner, and the humor should really come through at this point (especially if you used the middle section to build up the humor).Tension should unravel fairly quickly. The humor may stem from this unraveling, or it may accompany it along the way.
Aim to be concise with your ending. Remember that while you're working within the frame of a short, funny story, you may have to trim things down to their essence.
Try to keep the story's ending a paragraph or so at most, and make sure the reader finds some sense of humor and relief by the last sentence.

, Now that you have realistic characters, you'll need to make them speak in realistic ways. A good sign of strong writing is that the readers can hear the dialogue and not think to themselves, ""This is a work of fiction.""Think about the way people talk with one another. Read your written dialogue out loud and ask yourself, ""Do people actually say things like that?""
Good dialogue should push the narrative forward. Avoid being redundant or stating the obvious.
Strong dialogue shows a lot about each character's personality (including how he/she interacts with and treats other people).
Don't bog down your dialogue tags (the actions that accompany spoken lines) with details. For example, instead of saying, ""'What should we do?' he asked, staring nervously and compulsively at the ground, careful to avoid her eyes,"" try something simple like, ""What should we do?"" he asked without lifting his eyes from the ground.""

, This is one of the most difficult aspects of writing short stories. On the surface, you might think writing a longer form (like a book) would be more difficult than a short story, but a good short story must accomplish the same tasks as a longer book within a short amount of space. Everything needs to come together by the end, and on top of everything else your short, funny story needs elements of humor.You may have grand ideas about a subject for your story. However, you need to remember that when you're writing a short, funny story, you're limited on space.
Don't leave your idea unexplored or unfulfilled. Make sure your story fully analyzes the subject/idea you write about by the ending.
You can always trim down nonessential elements and words to make a story shorter.
You'll know that the idea has been fully explored when you've said (either directly, or indirectly by depiction) everything you need to say about it.
For example, you'd need a lot of space to adequately cover the complexity of human relationships. But you can capture a moment between two people and write about some aspect of friendship (like forgiving your friends for saying/doing hurtful things) within a short, funny story.

, It may be difficult to approach writing a short, funny story if you're not familiar with writing shorter works. Whether you choose to condense a longer story or expand a brief one, make sure that you focus on the most important elements of that story as you write it.Some people prefer to write a longer story and then shave it down. This ensures that the story is complete.
Other writers prefer to start small and expand as needed. This can make brevity more easy to work with and save you the stress of deciding what makes the final cut.
There's no right or wrong way to craft a short, funny story, so go with whatever feels more comfortable to you.
Whichever approach you take, make sure your story is complete, your ideas and characters are well-developed, and the humor is delivered in a satisfying way.

, The worst thing you can do when you revise a story is to jump into revision immediately after you've finished writing it. You need some time away from the project so that it's not so fresh in your head, and (ideally) so that you're not so attached to every detail of the story.Give yourself at least a week or two between finishing the story and revising it. If possible, try to give yourself a month to really put some distance between you and your story.
Consider asking a trusted friend or relative to look at the story. Ask him/her to be honest and critical, and emphasize that you want to know what isn't working and why.
Looking at a story with fresh eyes will help you see more errors that you might have missed. When the story is fresh in your head it's easy to fill in the gaps with what you know, and you may not realize that that information isn't addressed on the page.
Giving yourself some time before revising will also make it easier to cut things out. You may be in love with a scene, but after setting it aside for a few weeks, you might realize that it isn't as relevant as you thought it was.

, What was the point of your funny story? Were you trying to highlight a real social situation? Address some aspect of human nature? Draw humor from personal situations/experiences? Whatever your intentions, it's a good idea to refresh that intention in your head before you proceed with the revision process.By having your original intentions for the story in mind, you'll know what you had hoped to do with the story and will be able to assess whether you accomplished that goal or not.
Think about whether the tone matches your intentions, as well as the overall events of the story.

, This is an important part of why you should approach the story after setting it aside for a period. When you've just finished writing a story, you're less likely to catch any issues that might otherwise confuse a reader. However, if you've given yourself some time, you should notice your mistakes.


Confusion may arise from the content of the story (or lack thereof), or it may result from a missing or poorly executed transition. Transitions should bridge one scene to the next, one chapter to the next, and so on.
A good transition wraps up the previous scene and gently guides the reader into the new one.
An example of a transition between two scenes might be something like, ""He watched her walk silently into the night until she faded into darkness. The next morning he kept looking towards the horizon, but he knew she'd be halfway home by then.""
You may want to ask a friend to read through your story and look for anything that's confusing or doesn't make sense.

, Editing should be considered a separate step from revision. Revising your story involves rewriting parts as needed and trimming out things that don't work. Editing, on the other hand, mostly involves fixing your line-level mistakes.


Look for spelling errors, grammar/syntax errors, run-on sentences, sentence fragments, punctuation errors, and any weak lines of dialogue.
Use the spellcheck function on your computer, or ask a friend with strong editing skills to take a look at your story.
Try reading the story out loud. Sometimes hearing a mistake out loud can help you catch it better than just reading it silently on the page.

Romantic love - frequently love between two individuals with little or no previous knowledge of each other-the most common. Individuals who have known each other for a long time can be romantic too.
Unrequited love (love that isn't returned)
Forbidden love (love that can't be. For reasons of the universe, acceptance, etc.)
Family love (love between family members)
Love between friends (romance between two individuals that had a previous, unromantic relationship).


, Decide whether your main character is male or female. More importantly, start to consider their personality. If it helps, draw out a list of their likes, dislikes, habits, and personality traits. Describe how they feel toward the person they love, and what they would do to keep that person safe, make them happy, etc.

, Add in details, make sure your story line makes good sense, and that it progresses clearly throughout the beginning, middle and end.

, Remember that the plot can always change while you're writing.

, But remember that it's still a work of fiction, and if its too realistic, readers may become bored.

, Hang out with your crush, significant other, friend, and/or family member before writing, and include some of the ways you two interact with each other. Watch romantic movies/shows, or read romantic books to get some ideas. Do not copy and paste, as this is plagiarism and it is illegal in some circumstances, cheating in many situations and immoral in general for anyone to pass someone else's work off as their own.

, When writing with a romantic love theme, use really romantic lines. Reading books and watching movies with the same type of romance you are writing about will help you with creating lines that fit the romantic settings.

, This is to let the readers feel the pain of the character who is not being loved back. Writing in vivid detail about how a broken heart feels can suck a reader in immediately. If you want, make a way for that love to be rewarded in the end.

, A good story often involves conflict. This doesn't always mean that there has to be a villainous character, but your characters shouldn't breeze through the story without some sort of hardship or situation they must overcome.

, Many people often think that it's supposed to be that way. Maybe mix it up where one of the lovers leaves for a while. Even set it up for a sequel!

, Some people just do better letting their creative juices flow. Just think about a good story that'd pull at someone's heartstrings!

Think of what your story will be about, and what genre.,
Brainstorm your setting and time period.,
Ask yourself, ""Who are the characters going to be?,
Write all of this down.,
Make a drawing.,
Listen to music.,
Try the Power Writing method.",How to Write a Short Story or Paper," Will it be explanatory, informative, fictional, fantasy, horror, realistic fiction, historical fiction, medieval, romantic, or comedic? (keep in mind that you can also combine elements such as adventure and horror in one, or romance and comedy to make a romantic comedy.);
, Is it in the Roman Era? Is it in Great Land, and goes back to the ""ancient"" times, like ""Beowulf"" or ""Grendel""? You can use stories such as these for examples or check out your local bookstore or library to find some simpler tales like Hansel and Gretel. Make a chart/notes of where these time settings are, and then use those notes/chart to get some more ideas.

, What are there names, and what are they like? Do they suffer from mental illnesses? Are they boy or girl? Where do they work? Do they live with people? Who? How many people? Where? What do they live inside of? Is it a box, a trailer, an RV, a van, an apartment, a house, a castle, a haunted house, a mansion, a bustling city block complex, or even just a modern day, regular sized house?

, Try this method:


Write down all of your preferred locations, types, and time periods for this house. (Include size, too!)
Graph them on a sheet in lines. (E.g; haunted house would be in the type of house line, next to it the size, then the time period.)
Circle the ones you like best. You could even mix something as ridiculous as a spaceship in a yard by a bunch of houses in the 1700s! Let your imagination run wild!

, Characterize and customize your character! (Consider using the Sims.)

, This will set the mood for your writing. If it is about a sorrowful person, listen to fun songs such as ""Pain"" by Three Days Grace or Opera music. If it is about a serial killer, or the scene is about murder, then you could listen to stuff such as ""Bodies"" by drowning pool, or even Opera music. (Seriously, though, you could use opera for just about anything!.)

, This has been used at many schools, and it was proven that more students had better organization, and so their AIMS testing scores on writing increased from low to high.


P1. Your P1s are the main part of the whole Power writing. The P1, the heading of the whole thing, states your main idea, or what you are talking about or describing in a few words or a phrase.
P2. Next, you have three P2s (or more) which describe the main idea. For example, if your P1 was ""My Favorite Desserts,"" then you might have Tiramisu or ice cream as a P2.
P3. The Power three's describe the P2, and come right after it. So now, after Tiramisu (P2), you would write ""P3"" and then write how it tastes, how it looks, how it feels, how it smells, etc.

It is the foundation for the characters’ motivations, the setting, and the action. One of the best ways to come up with a premise for a scary story is to think about what scares you or revolts you the most. Tap into your fears of losing family members, of being alone, of violence, of clowns, of demons, or even of killer squirrels. Your fear will then come across on the page and your experience or exploration of this fear will also grip the reader.Focus on creating a story that feels personally terrifying to you.


The fear of the unknown is one of the most powerful devices for a good scary story. People fear what they don’t know., Think about different scenarios in which you might experience some of your greatest fears. Think too about how you would react if you were trapped or forced to confront these fears. Make a list of “what if” questions.


For example, if you fear being trapped in an elevator, ask yourself, “What if I was stuck in an elevator with a dead person?” Or, “What if the elevator mirror was a door into an evil world?”

, Use the setting to limit or trap your characters in the story. Restrict your character’s movements so he is forced to confront his fear and then try to find a way out. Think about what kind of confined spaces scare you, such as a cellar, a coffin, or an abandoned town. Where you would you dread or fear being trapped in the most?

, Look at a normal, everyday situation like taking a walk in the park, preparing lunch, or visiting a friend. Then, add a terrifying or bizarre element. You could come across a severed ear during your walk, cut up a piece of fruit that turns into a finger or a tentacle.


Or, add a twist to a familiar horror trope, like a vampire who enjoys cake instead of blood, or a man trapped in a dumpster rather than a coffin.

, Check out the local section of your newspaper or go online and scroll through the day’s articles. Maybe a burglary in your neighborhood took place, tied to a larger string of burglaries in another area of the city. Use a newspaper story as a springboard to create a story idea.Another way to generate story ideas is to use writing prompts. These could be as simple as writing a suspenseful story about staying at a haunted hotel. You might use a prompt about an important party gone wrong or an envious friend who begins to act strangely towards you. Use the prompts to generate a story idea you connect with.

, To create a good scary story, you need to have characters who are relatable to your readers. The readers must empathize with your character(s) based on the character’s desire or internal struggle. The more your readers empathize with your characters, the closer their connection to the story will be.You’ll need at least one main character and, depending on your story, the following additional characters:


Villain
Other supporting characters (family member, best friend, love interest, etc.)
Minor characters (postal worker, gas station attendant, etc.)

, When you are beginning to develop your characters, you need to work out who they are, what they do, as well as their motivations. Make your character distinct with a certain character trait or tick. This will also help you be consistent with the details. Make lists for every major character that include the following information, and refer to this list while you’re writing:


Name, age, physical description (include height, weight, eye color, hair color, etc.)
Personality traits
Likes and dislikes
Family history
Best friend and worst enemy
Five things the character would never leave home without

, The “stakes” of a character in a story is what your character has to lose if they make a certain decision or choice in the story. If your reader doesn’t know what is at stake for the character in the conflict, they cannot fear loss. A good horror story is all about creating extreme emotions like fear or anxiety in the reader.


Be clear about what will happen if the character does not get what they want. The stakes of the story, or the consequences if the character does not achieve their desires, is what drives the story forward. The stakes also build tension and suspense for your reader.

, Go for the strange when developing your villain. Instead of making a person or creature “normal,” make this character a little off. For example, think about Dracula. He doesn’t have a mouthful of “normal” teeth; instead, the reader is told that he has two sharp, pointy teeth., Most horror is about fear and tragedy, and whether or not your character is capable of overcoming their fears. A story where good things happen to good people is heartwarming, but it will likely not scare or terrify your reader. In fact, the tragedy of bad things happening to good people is not only more relatable, but it will also be full of tension and suspense. Give your character challenges and make some bad things happen for him or her.


The tension between what the reader wants for the character and what could happen or go wrong for the character will fuel the story. It will also propel your readers through the story.

, Have your character respond with the wrong move, while convincing themselves they are making the right move against the threat.However, don’t go overboard with these mistakes or bad decisions. They should be believable and not merely stupid or inane. For example, don’t have your character, a young babysitter, respond to a masked killer by running outside into the deep, dark woods.

, Once you find your premise, your setting, and characters, create a rough outline of the story. Follow a story structure such as the one suggested in Freytag’s pyramid to create your outline. The key elements include:Exposition: Set the scene and introduce the characters.
Inciting incident: Have something happen in the story to start the action.
Rising action: Continue the story, building excitement and suspense.
Climax: Include a moment that holds the most tension in the story.
Falling action: These are events that occur after the climax.
Resolution: Here, the character solves the main problem.
Denouement: This is the ending in which the characters resolve any remaining questions.

, The most effective scary stories use description to show the reader how the characters feel in a story. This helps the reader feel like he is stepping into the main character’s shoes and identifying with this character. In contrast, when you tell the reader exactly how to feel by describing a scene flatly and obviously, the reader will feel less connected to the story.For example, consider these two ways of describing a scene:

”I was too scared to open my eyes, even though I heard footsteps coming closer.”
“I wrapped the blankets tighter around me and let out a sick whimper. My chest was tight, my stomach rotten. I would not look. No matter how close those shuffling footsteps came, I would not look. I would not, I would…not…”The second example gives the reader more of an insight into the character’s physical feelings.

, Allow the story to get more suspenseful as it goes on. For an effective suspenseful story, you need the reader to feel empathy and concern for the characters, and you need impending danger and escalating tension. Hint at the story’s direction and possible climax by providing small clues or details. You might briefly mention a label on a bottle that will later come in handy for the main character. There might be a sound or voice in a room that will later become a sign of an unnatural presence.
Another effective way to build tension is to alternate from tense or bizarre moments to quiet moments. Allow your character to take a breath, calm down, and feel safe again. Then, amp up the tension by re-engaging the character in the conflict. This time, make the conflict feel even more serious or threatening.

, As you craft your story, use the foreshadowing storytelling device. Foreshadowing is when you give a hint that something will happen in the future.The reader should be able to find clues of the outcome or story goal. Foreshadowing also makes the reader anxious that the consequence will occur before the main character can succeed.

, Force yourself to describe what’s happening with words that evoke emotion in the reader. Don’t rely on words that tell your reader exactly how to feel. For example, avoid these words in your writing:Scared, scary
Terrified, terrifying
Horrified, horror
Afraid
Frightened

, Like any genre, horror has its own set of tropes and cliches. Writers should avoid there if they want to create a unique, engaging horror story.Familiar images like a deranged clown in the attic to a babysitter alone in a house at night, are some of the clichés to avoid. So are familiar phrases like “Run!” or “Don’t look behind you!”

, Too much gore or violence can have a desensitizing effect on the reader. If the same pools of blood keep happening over and over again in the story, the reader will grow bored. Of course, some gore or violence can be useful for setting a scene, describing a character or providing action. Use gore or violence in a spot in the story that is impactful or meaningful, so it can punch your reader in the gut, rather than numb them or bore them., Raise the stakes and give your characters more than they can handle. Pile on the problems with minor battles, small losses, and small wins. The suspense will build up to a climax and before the reader realizes it, the characters are in grave danger., Allow your character realize how to solve the conflict. The revelation should be the result of a build-up of details in the scene or story and should not be jarring or feel random to the reader., The climax is a turning point or crisis in the story.The climax in a horror story might be a danger or threat to the character’s physical, psychological, emotional, or spiritual well-being.In Poe’s short story, the climax of the story occurs at the very end. Poe applies more and more pressure to the narrator by having the police visit him. He uses the narrator’s internal struggle to keep his cool and achieve his desire of getting away with murder to create a climax. But by the end of the story, the narrator’s guilt pushes him over the edge and he reveals the body under the floorboards.

, A good twist in a horror story can make or break the story. The twist is an action that the reader doesn’t expect, such as a character that we thought was a hero is actually a villain.,, The very end of your story is the time to wrap up loose ends. But scary stories often don’t tie up loose ends. This can be effective because it leaves the reader wondering about certain things. Did the killer get caught? Does the ghost really exist? Leaving the reader hanging can be a good plot device, as long as the reader isn’t confused by the ending.


While you want to create a satisfying ending for the reader, you also do not want to make it too closed and settled. The reader should walk away from the story with a lingering feeling of uncertainty.
Consider if the ending feels like a surprise or an obvious answer. The key to suspense if not to answer the dramatic question too soon. Poe’s short story ends on a high note because the outcome of the narrator’s dilemma is revealed in the last line of the story. The suspense in the story is sustained until the very end.

, Once you complete a first draft, read over the story or read it out loud. Focus on areas that do not feel fast-paced or engaging enough. Cut down on long scenes. Or, think about how a longer scene benefits the overall story, adding to the suspense.Sometimes, readers may be aware of the answer or ending to the dramatic question upfront. But they may be willing to read the story until the end because the lead up to the ending is engaging and suspenseful. They care enough about the characters and the story to read about the events that lead to the climactic event.

, Before giving your story to anyone to read, proofread it carefully. Catch spelling and grammatical errors. This way, your reader will be able to focus on the story, instead of getting distracted by misspellings or misplaced commas.


Print out your story and comb through it carefully.

, Let others read your story. This can give you a good sense of how others react to what you’ve written. Ask for feedback on specifics about the story, such as:


Characters: Are the characters believable? Do they engage in action that is realistic?
Continuity: Does the story make sense? Does it follow a logical order?
Grammar and mechanics: Is the language readable? Are there run-on sentences, misused words, etc.?
Dialogue: Are conversations between characters realistic? Was there enough (or too much) dialogue?
Pacing: Does the story move along at a good pace? Do you get bored in certain areas? Do you think too much happens too quickly in other areas?
Plot: Does the plot make sense? Does the character’s objective make sense?

, Remember, this is your story. It’s full of your own ideas, and you don’t need to take anyone else’s suggestions. Sometimes, people who critique the written work of others may try to put their own stamp on the work. If the suggestions are good ones, then incorporate them. But if the suggestions don’t seem to make sense for your story, discard them.

Do some research about cases and mysteries. You could look into any kind of murder, any kind of strange case known. If the case never closed, you could make the end any way you please.;
, You can even make yourself the detective of your own story. Answering all of the following questions may be unnecessary, but being thorough in this step can help you write a believable story with a complete and rounded main character.


Think of the basics. Male or Female? What is their name? How old are they? What do they look like (hair color, eye color, and skin tone)? Where are they from? Where are they living when your story starts? How did they become part of the story? Are they victims? Are they the cause of the problems in your story?
Develop a family for your character. Parents? Siblings? Significant Other? Children? Other relations? Sociably problematic groups? A character which may know everything but has disappear...Make it as normal or as interesting as you want!
What kind of life do they live? Are they famous, or are they just starting out? Are they unexpectedly smart? What kind of mysteries do they solve? (murder, theft, a combination, other kinds?)
Develop their tastes. Favourite sentence to say? What is their favorite color? Place to be? Soft drink? Book? TV show? Movie? Music? Meal? What are they afraid of? How practical are they? Do they wear a scent, and if so, what scent? Strong, soft, nice or not pleasant?

Develop their relationships. Do they have a lot of friends? A best friend? Are they romantic? What first impression do they make? Do they like children? Do they like smokers? Do they like reading?
How do they dress? Do they use makeup or hair dye? How about piercings or tattoos? How attractive are they, and how attractive do they think they are? Is there something they wish they could change, or something they are particularly happy with? How much time do they spend thinking about physical appearance?
Though this may seem like a lot to worry about for a short story, having your characters developed to the fullest is an essential part of writing a good story.

,


Use Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? questions to get you started: Who committed the crime and who did they do it to? What was the crime? When did it happen (morning, evening, afternoon, dead of night)? Where did it happen? Why did they do it? How did they do it?
Use this skeleton to more fully sketch out a summary of your plot, with as many details as you can think of at this point. By now, plot ideas may be boiling around in your brain. Don't even worry about putting them in order, just WRITE THEM DOWN somewhere so that you don't forget them later!

, This is an especially important part of your story, so take the time to really develop it fully. Try to describe every single detail so the reader can picture the crime scene. What does it look like? Is it different in day and in night? What are the differences between the first and the second crime scene? What are all of the details of the crime? You may want to write out a first draft of this scene so that you get the basic idea.

, Go back and look at the questions you did for the protagonist, and develop their personality just as fully. Especially think about their relationship to the protagonist. A good antagonist will enrich the story and give it lots of thrill and suspense.

, Make sure you have at least most of your ducks in a row before you begin writing.


Make a list of the suspects. Detail their basic personality, using some of the questions in step 1.
Do the same for witnesses and any other characters.
Be sure to have in mind how the mystery is solved!

, The detective work must be good. Develop how your protagonist ultimately solves the case, keeping their personality and qualities in mind. Make sure it isn't cheesy or too obvious.

, Start with an introductory chapter or two, to introduce the characters and setting. Then make the crime scene happen.

, (eg. Annie entered the office. She was a tall woman with thin legs and hands. Her face was shaped like a diamond...). Be sure to give the reader a vivid picture of each one.

, The more suspense you put, the more interesting the story will be. Make the protagonist get stuck in a couple of difficult situations and run into some obstacles. Don't make the mystery too easy to solve!

, There are plenty at your library, or if you are seriously taking up mystery writing, you should acquire a good collection of mystery books. Perhaps your librarian will have a list of recommendations, or you could find some online.

, Be sure the ending is clear on who committed the crime and why, and how it was solved. There is nothing worse than leaving the reader extremely confused about what was going on!

, Rewrite things as needed, and reword things to make them more interesting. Cut out as many parts as necessary. Be ruthless! You want your story to be the best that it can be.

Brainstorm.,
Plan your novella.,
Revise your plans with the help of your peers, parents, and / or teachers.,
Create a conflict.,
Begin writing with the above outline in mind (for example, introduction to include setting and characters, conflict establishment, crisis leading to rising action and climax).,
Try freewriting, whether by typing or writing in longhand.,
Find the right pace for your story.,
Revise the story with suggestions from readers.,
Publish the story.",How to Write a Novella," Use mind maps, graphic organizers, Venn diagrams, journals, and/or any other method that helps you develop and organize your ideas. Think about all genres (e.g., horror) of stories you might enjoy writing. At this stage, don't throw out an idea for any reason, just jot it down somewhere to play with (or not) later. You could think about plot lines, characters, a setting, or even a title.


If you prefer, write about something else entirely, just to avoid staring at a blank page / screen, but don't forget about your main project. On the other hand, you never know — that ""experiment"" could very will find its way into this or another story of yours.

, If a traditional outline is not the way your mind works, try a tree structure, free notes, pictures, index cards, or even a wiki to collect, arrange, and rearrange your writing. For ideas and templates for organizers see http://www.eduplace.com/graphicorganizer/.

, Once you have some basic ideas, review the ideas and connect them to the plan. You can always adjust the plan throughout the process. Put them in order, rearrange them, think of more, and take out or set aside scenes or ideas that don't seem to belong.

, Virtually all fiction, in order to have some structure, is based on a conflict of some sort — two worlds collide. Time-honored structures include these:


Fantasy versus Reality
Man/Woman/Creature versus Life
Man/Woman/Creature versus Man
Man/Woman/Creature versus Nature
Man/Woman/Creature versus Him/Herself
Man/Woman/Creature versus Society
Man/Woman/Creature versus God
Country versus Country
Race versus Race
Person versus Illness
Fish out of water (perhaps a variant on man/woman-versus-nature).
Coming of age (a variant of man/woman versus him/herself).
Boy meets Girl
Girl meets Boy
Nature versus Nature
Magic versus Person
Person versus Magic
Religion versus Politics
Child versus Adult
Adult versus Child
Opinion versus Opinion
Religion versus Science
Science versus Religion
Teacher versus Student
Student versus Teacher

, Remember, you need not start writing at the beginning of your story, and you need not start the novella at the beginning of the story. In fact, giving the reader a glimpse of what lies ahead (known as foreshadowing) is a great way to create suspense and momentum right away.

, Write to be creative, write anything at all to get started and warmed up. Play with your theme or genre by including something in the background such as music, videos, video games, sound effects and photographs, to get a feel for it.


Try to turn off all the filters, both in your software and in your mind, for the first draft, and quit being afraid of ""messing up"". One way to do that is to write as much as you can, as fast as you can. If it comes out badly, you can always revise and edit it later, or shelve it entirely and try again. Get the ideas down first.

, Since a novella is a shorter work, you might not explore every detail along the way, nor write a grand and sweeping epic following your characters' entire lifetimes. Use the shorter length as an advantage to focus your story and make it more powerful, more intense. At the same time, don't gloss over too many specifics. Include enough detail to make it believable, specific, and concrete.

, You may want to start the process the minute you are done writing. On the other hand, you may want to give the work some time to cool, so that you can look at it with fresh eyes. Either way, give the editing process the time it deserves, even if it's not as much fun as the initial writing process was. When you're ready, have somebody else take a look at it and comment on it for a detached and fresh perspective.

, This could consist of anything from handing a copy to your mom to self-publishing on the web or an on-demand (vanity) press (see external links), to submitting the work to book or magazine publishers. Even if you think small, having an audience in mind for your novella will make your story better.

But like crafting a good joke, crafting a good horror story has been done many times by the masters of the genre.Though your story may not appeal to all readers, or elicit cries of terror, there will likely be at least one reader who will respond in horror to your story.

, Familiarize yourself with the genre by reading effective examples of horror, from classic ghost stories to contemporary horror writing. As famed horror writer Stephen King once said, to be a real writer, you have to “read and write a lot.”Think about ghost stories or urban legends told around a campfire when you were a kid or as well as any award winning horror tales you read in school or on your own. You may want to look at specific examples like:


“The Monkey’s Paw”, an 18th century tale by William Wymark Jacobs about three terrible wishes granted by a mystical monkey’s paw.
“The Tell-Tale Heart”, master horror writer Edgar Allen Poe’s psychologically disturbing short story of murder and haunting.Neil Gaiman's take on the nursery rhyme of Humpty Dumpty in “The Case of Four and Twenty Blackbirds.”You’d be remiss not to read a horror story by arguably the master of the genre, Stephen King. He has written over 200 short stories and uses many different techniques to scare his readers. While there are many lists of his greatest horror stories ever, read “The Moving Finger”or “The Children of the Corn” to get a sense of King’s style.
Contemporary writer Joyce Carol Oates also has a famous horror story called “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?” that uses psychological terror to great effect., Choose one or two examples you enjoy reading or find interesting in terms of how they use a certain setting, plot, character or twist in the story to create horror or terror. For example:


In King’s “The Moving Finger”, King takes a premise: a man who thinks he sees and hears a moving human finger scratching a wall in his bathroom and then follows the man closely over the span of a short period of time as he tries to avoid the finger, until he is forced to confront his fear of the finger. King also uses other elements like a Jeopardy game and a conversation between the main character and his wife to further create a feeling of suspense and dread.
In Oates’ “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?”, Oates establishes the main character, a young girl named Connie, by providing scenes of her daily life and then zooms in on one fateful day, when two men pull up in a car while Connie is at home all alone. Oates uses dialogue to create a sense of dread and allows the reader to experience Connie’s growing sense of fear of the threat of these men.
In both stories, horror or terror is created through a combination of shock and dread, using elements that are possibly supernatural (a moving human finger) and elements that are psychologically disturbing (a young girl alone with two men).

, Tap into your fears of losing family members, of being alone, of violence, of clowns, of demons, or even of killer squirrels. Your fear will then come across on the page and your experience or exploration of this fear will also grip the reader.Make a list of your greatest fears. Then, think about how you would react if you were trapped or forced to confront these fears.
You could also take a poll of what scares your family, friends, or partners the most. Get some subjective ideas of horror.

, Another approach is to look at a normal, everyday situation like taking a walk in the park, cutting up a piece of fruit, or visiting a friend and adding a terrifying or bizarre element. Such as coming across a severed ear during your walk, cutting up a piece of fruit that turns into a finger or a tentacle, or visiting an old friend who has no idea who you are or claims you are someone you are not.Use your imagination to create a horrifying spin on a normal, everyday activity or scene.

, One way to create a situation that will induce terror in a reader is to restrict your character’s movements so they are forced to confront their fear and then try to find a way out.Think about what kind of confined spaces scare you. Where you would you dread or fear being trapped in the most?
Trap your character in a confined space like cellar, a coffin, an abandoned hospital, an island, or an abandoned town. This will create an immediate conflict or threat to the character and set your story up with immediate tension or suspense.

, Maybe your character is a werewolf who doesn’t want to hurt anyone on the next full moon so they lock themselves in a cellar or room. Or maybe your character is so fearful of a severed finger in the bathroom, he does everything to avoid the bathroom until the finger haunts him so much he forces himself to go into the bathroom and confront it., Because horror hinges on the subjective reaction of the reader, the story should work to create several extreme feelings in the reader, including:


Shock: the simplest way to scare the reader is to create shock with a twist ending, a sudden image of gore or a quick moment of terror. However, creating fear through shock can lead to cheap scares and if used too much, can become predictable or less likely to scare the reader.
Paranoia: the sense that something is not quite right, which can unnerve the reader, make them doubt their own surroundings, and when used to its full effect, make the reader doubt even their own beliefs or ideas of the world. This type of fear is great for slow tension-building and psychological horror stories.
Dread: this type of fear is the horrible sense that something bad is going to happen. Dread works well when the reader connects deeply to the story and begins to care enough about the characters to fear something bad that is going to happen to them. Inspiring dread in a reader is tricky as the story will need to do a lot of work to keep the reader engaged and involved, but it is a powerful type of fear.

, Stephen King argues there are several key ways to create a feeling of horror or terror in a story, which can then create different reactions from the reader.Using gross out details like a severed head tumbling down a flight of stairs, something green and slimy landing on your arm, or a character landing in a pool of blood.
Using unnatural details (or fear of the unknown or impossible) like spiders the size of bears, an attack from the living dead, or an alien claw grabbing your feet in a dark room.
Using terrifying psychological details like a character who comes home to another version of him or herself, or a character who experiences paralyzing nightmares which then affect their sense of reality.

, Once you find your premise or scenario, your setting, determine which extreme emotions you are going to play on, and decide the types of horror details you are going to use in the story, create a rough outline of the story.


You can use Freytag’s pyramidto create an outline, which begins with exposition of the setting and life or day of the character(s), moves into the conflict of the character (a severed finger in the bathroom, two men in a car), shifts upward into rising action where the character tries to solve or work against the conflict but meets several complications or roadblocks, reaches the climax, and then falls downward with falling action, into the resolution where the character is changed, shifted (or in the case of some horror), meets a terrifying death.

, Do this by introducing clear details and descriptions of the character’s routine, relationships, and point of view.Determine the age and occupation of your character.
Determine the marital status or relationship status of your character.
Determine how they view the world (cynical, skeptical, anxious, happy-go-lucky, satisfied, settled).
Add in specific or unique details. Make your character feel distinct with a certain character trait or tick (a hairstyle, a scar) or a mark of their appearance (an item of clothing, a piece of jewellery, a pipe or cane). A character’s speech or dialect can also distinguish a character on the page, and make them stand out more to the reader.
Once your readers identify with a character, the character becomes a bit like their child. They will empathize with the character’s conflict and root for them to overcome their conflict, while also realizing that this rarely happens.
This tension between what the reader wants for the character and what could happen or go wrong for the character will fuel the story and propel your readers through the story.

, Most horror is about fear and tragedy and whether or not your character is capable of overcoming their fears. A story where good things happen to good people may be heartwarming but it will likely not scare or terrify your reader. In fact, the tragedy of bad things happening to good people is not only more relatable, it will also be full of tension and suspense.In order to create conflict in a character’s life, you need to introduce a danger or threat to the character, whether it's a moving finger, two men in a car, a mystical monkey’s paw or a murderous clown.
For example, in King’s “The Moving Finger”, the main character, Howard, is a middle aged man who enjoys watching Jeopardy, has a comfortable relationship with his wife, and seems to live a decent middle class life. But King does not let the reader get too comfortable in Howard's normal existence as he introduces a scratching sound in Howard's bathroom. The discovery of the finger in the bathroom, and Howard's subsequent attempts to avoid it, remove it, or destroy it, creates a story where a seemingly normal, likeable man’s life is interrupted by the unknown or the unreal.

, Once you have established the threat or danger to the character, you will then need to have your character respond with the wrong move, while convincing themselves they are in fact making the right move or decision against this threat.Its important to create enough motivation for the character so their bad decision feels justifiable and not merely stupid or unbelievable. An attractive young babysitter who responds to a masked killer by running not to the telephone to call the police but outside into the deep, dark woods is not only a stupid character move, it also feels unbelievable to the reader or viewer.
But if you have your character make a justifiable, though flawed, decision in response to a threat, your reader will be more willing to believe and root for that character.
For example, in King’s “The Moving Finger”, Howard initially decides not to tell his wife about the finger in the bathroom because he believes he may be hallucinating or confusing the scratching noise for a mouse or animal caught in the bathroom. The story justifies Howard's decision not to tell anyone about the finger by playing off what most people who tell themselves if they witnessed a strange or bizarre event: it wasn't real, or I'm just seeing things.
The story then justifies Howard's reaction by allowing his wife to go into the bathroom and not comment about seeing a moving finger by the toilet. So, the story plays with Howard's perception of reality and indicates that maybe he did hallucinate the finger.

, The “stakes” of a character in a story is what your character has to lose if they make a certain decision or choice in the story. If your reader doesn't know what is at stake for the character in the conflict, they cannot fear loss. And a good horror story is all about creating extreme emotions like fear or anxiety in the reader through creating extreme emotions in the characters.


Fear is built off of understanding the consequences of an action for a character or the risk of their actions. So if your character decides to confront a clown in the attic or two men in a car, the reader will need to be aware of what the character could lose as a result of this decision. Preferably, your character’s stakes should be extreme or major, such as loss of sanity, loss of innocence, loss of life, or loss of the life of someone they care about.
In the case of King’s story, the main character is afraid that if he confronts the finger, he may risk losing his sanity. The stakes of the character in the story are very high and very clear to the reader. So, when Howard does finally confront the moving finger, the reader is terrified of how the outcome is going to create a loss for Howard.

, Readers can either be confused or scared, but not both. Deceiving or manipulating your readers through foreshadowing, shifting character traits, or a revelation of a plot point can all work to build suspense and create anxiety or fear in the reader.Hint at the horrific climax of the story by providing small clues or details, such as the label on a bottle that will later come in handy for the main character, a sound or voice in a room that will later become an indication of an unnatural presence, or even a loaded gun in a pillow that may later go off or be used by the main character.
Build tension by alternating from tense or bizarre moments to quiet moments where your character can take a breath in a scene, calm down, and feel safe again. Then, amp up the tension by re engaging the character in the conflict and then making the conflict feel even more serious or threatening.
In “The Moving Finger”, King does this by having Howard freak out about the finger, then have a relatively normal conversation with his wife while listening to Jeopardy and thinking about the finger, and then attempt to avoid the finger by going for a walk. Howard begins to feel safe or assured that the finger is not real, but of course, once he opens the bathroom door, the finger seems to have grown longer and is moving much faster than it was before.
King slowly builds tension for both the character and the reader by introducing the threat and then having it overshadow the rest of the story. As readers, we know the finger is a sign of something bad or possibly evil, and are now in a position to watch Howard try to avoid, and then eventually confront this evil.

, A good twist in a horror story can make or break the story, so its important to create a twist ending that ties up many of the loose ends in the character’s conflict but still leaves one major question up in the air to tease the reader’s imagination.While you want to create a satisfying ending for the reader, you also do not want to make it so closed and settled that the reader walks away without a lingering feeling of uncertainty.
You could have the character experience a moment of realization about the conflict or about how to solve the conflict. The revelation should be the result of a build up of details in the scene or story and should not be jarring or feel random to the reader.In “The Moving Finger”, Howard's moment of realization occurs when he figures out that the finger may be a signifier of an evil or wrong in the world. He asks the police officer, who is there to arrest him after noise complaints from the neighbors, a final Jeopardy question, in the category of the “inexplicable”. “Why do terrible things sometimes happen to the nicest people?” Howard asks. The police officer then turns to open the toilet, where Howard stored the slaughtered finger, and “wagers it all” before opening the toilet seat to look at the inexplicable or unknown.
This ending leaves the reader wondering what the officer sees in the toilet, and if the finger was real or a figment of Howard's imagination. In this way, it is open ended without being too surprising or confusing for the reader.

, Like any genre, horror has its own set of tropes and cliches that writers should avoid if they want to create a unique, engaging horror story. From familiar images like a deranged clown in the attic to a babysitter alone in a house at night, to familiar phrases like “Run!” or “Don’t look behind you!”, cliches are tricky to avoid in this genre.Focus on creating a story that feels personally terrifying to you. Or, add a twist to a familiar horror trope, like a vampire who enjoys cake instead of blood, or a man trapped in a dumpster rather than a coffin.
Remember that too much gore or violence can actually have a desensitizing effect on the reader, especially if the same pools of blood keep happening over and over again in the story. Of course, some gore is good and likely necessary in a horror story. But make sure you use gore in a spot in the story that is impactful or meaningful, so it can punch your reader in the gut, rather than numb them or bore them.Another way you can avoid cliches is to focus more on creating a disturbed or unsettled state of mind for your character, rather than images of gore or pools of blood. Pictorial memories often don’t stick in a reader’s mind, but the effect of these images on a character will likely create a lingering creepiness for the reader. So aim not for you reader’s imagination but for a disturbance in your reader’s state of mind., Go through the first draft of your story and look at sentences where you have duplicated adjectives, nouns or verbs. Maybe you have a preference for the adjective “red” to describe a dress or a pool of blood. But adjectives like “ruby, russet, crimson” can add texture to the language and turn a conventional phrase like “a red pool of blood” into a more interesting phrase, like “a crimson pool of blood.”


Get out your thesaurus and replace any redundant word use with synonyms to avoid using the same words or phrases over and over again in the story.
Be sure to make your language use and word choice fit the voice of your character. A teenage girl will likely use different words or phrases than a middle aged man. Creating a vocabulary for your character that fits their personality and perspective will only add to their believability as character.

, You can do this to a mirror or to a group of people you trust. Horror stories began as an oral tradition of spooking someone around a campfire, so reading your story out loud will help you determine if the pace of the story is building steadily and gradually, if there is enough shock, paranoia, or dread, and if your characters make all the wrong decisions until they are forced to confront the source of their conflict.


If your story is dialogue heavy, reading it out loud will also help you determine if the dialogue sounds believable and natural.
If your story contains a twist ending, gauging your reader’s reaction by watching your audience’s faces will help you determine if the ending is effective or needs more work.

Do not make it too bizarre or grotesque.,
Focus on personality.,
Incorporate symbolism.,
Develop the antagonists.,
Use imagery and flawless descriptions.",How to Write a Love Story," Uniqueness is like salt. Just enough can perfect a dish, but too much can ruin it and make you regret even making it. Creativity on the other hand is fine. But save the fear factor for your horror stories, unless you can work the violence seamlessly into the romance.

,


Do not match personality. There can be some similarities between the two lovers, but don't overdo it. If they are too similar, the reader will began to regard them more as siblings or close friends than lovers.
Anger, rivalry, and love? Both anger and love take a lot of passion and in the end they can spawn off each other. In the beginning stages of your story do not be afraid to let them loathe each other, just subdue the fire before it escalates.
Combinations. We have all heard of the epitome of ""unique"" lovers: mean/hotheaded guy and nice, plain girl or vice versa, and smart guy and empty headed but cool girl or vice versa. Try to go beyond that. Make two lists of all the personalities you can think of, one for the girl and one for the guy. Then chose a random trait from each list and see if can make a story off that.

, Symbolism is a difficult art to master, but if you can represent your characters' love through a material object, the readers will enjoy it. A common example is a rose, but try to venture into some more unique objects. Think of why your characters love each other and focus in on those reasons; maybe you can come up with the ideal symbol.

, What do an envying ex, a malicious villain, and feuding parents have in common? They are all classic examples of the romantic equivalent of an antagonist. An antagonist can provide strife, angst, and even comical relief. They are very rewarding and enjoyable to create. Who doesn't want to make the perfect villain?

Use poignant words that capture emotion and your reader’s heart. Describe the surroundings with the uttermost detail.

"
Create a strong, engaging description.,
Start at a pivotal plot point.,
Introduce a compelling narrative voice.,
Start with an unusual set up.,
Write to your audience.",How to Write a Hook for a Book1," One of the more effective ways to craft an opening line for your book is to start with a description that is engaging and will leave your reader asking questions. You want your reader to be in a state of wonder and pique their curiosity so they have no choice but to turn the pages of your book to find out more.For your first line, you can use a strong, interesting description to describe an image of your main character in action. For example, the first line of Joseph Heller’s novel Catch-22: “Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice.”This is a strong opening because the main character is introduced to the reader right away, he is placed in a setting, and he has an issue he has to deal with.
You can also start with a description of the setting of your book. For example, the first line of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit: “In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.”This is a strong opening that introduces the setting to the reader and the titular hobbit of the novel.;
, You can also create a first line that introduces the reader to a pivotal plot point, starting right in action. This will allow you to hit the ground running and get the reader invested in the plot of the story right away.For example, the opening line of Kate Morton’s The Forgotten Garden: “It was dark where she was crouched but the little girl did as she’d been told.”This is a good hook opening line because it places the reader in the action, creating a situation that suggests danger or fear for the “little girl.”

, You can also start your book with a narrative voice that is unique and compelling. This is especially effective if your book has a first person narrator, as the narrative voice can really propel the story along. You can also use a compelling third person voice to act as the narrator who introduces characters in an engaging way.For example, the opening line of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: “Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.”This is a third person narrative voice that has attitude and color to it, drawing readers into the story.
The first line of Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita is another good example, as the novel begins: “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins.”Right away the reader is prepared for a unique narrator who is not afraid to embellish, entertain, and disturb.

, You can also draw your reader in by creating a situation for your characters that is unusual or strange. This could then intrigue the reader enough to continue on with the story and see how the characters deal with the unusual set up.For example, the opening lines of Nick Hornby’s novel Juliet, Naked: “They had flown from England to Minneapolis to look at a toilet.”This first line pulls the reader in right away and sets up a strange, engaging situation.

, You can create a strong first line by focusing on what your audience would be interested in reading about first. Try to picture your ideal reader and consider how old they are, what they are interested in, and what type of writing they might enjoy. You can then use this ideal reader and write a first line just for them.For example, if you are writing a book with a reader who is young adult, you may start the story with a young adult in mind. Consider what details or moments you might include if you were writing for a young adult.
This may also be a useful tactic if you are writing a hook for a book that is non-fiction, as you may consider what fact, anecdote, or moment in the history you are writing about would most spark your reader’s interest.

"
"
Recognize the purpose of the hook.,
Use the active voice.,
Address the main plot.,
Focus on character and action, rather than theme.,
Read the hook out loud and revise it.",How to Write a Hook for a Book2," The hook for your book is different from a synopsis or a plot summary in that it should not reveal the entire plot of the book or provide too much detail about your book. Instead, the hook should capture what your book is about in one to two sentences total.Your hook should grab your reader’s attention in 30 seconds and act like the elevator pitch for your book. Having a strong hook in your book proposal or in the marketing material for your book can make it seem more attractive to an editor or a literary agent.
Your hook should also explain how your book is different from the other books that are currently available. If you are writing in a specific genre, the hook should also tell your reader how and why your book is different from the other books published in that genre.

, You should always use the active voice in your hook as well as active verbs so your hook feels immediate and engaging. Avoid the passive voice and passive verbs as this can make your hook seem dull, stale, and not all that memorable to readers.Most hooks for a book are written in the present tense, rather than the past tense, to make the hook feel more active to the reader. You should try to always use the present tense to describe the action in the book.

, Your hook should also include the main plot or the issue at stake in the story. Try to address the main conflict or crisis in a few words, using bold and descriptive sentences. Do not try to explain the crisis. Instead, simply describe it.You should use engaging nouns in your hook to describe the main plot. Avoid too many adjectives or adverbs. You want the hook to be descriptive, but not long-winded or too full of descriptors. When in doubt, simple is better for the hook.
Make sure you do not reveal the ending of the book in the hook, only the main plot. The ending of the book should be included in your synopsis of the book, not in the hook.

, It may be tempting to simply describe the main themes of the book. But this can end up sounding too generic and familiar. Avoid describing themes and instead focus on your characters and the action of the book.You can try the following formula to create your hook, using character and action: “When happens to , they must to .”
For example, the hook for J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone could be: “When a Dark Lord murders a boy wizard’s parents, he must train for the battle for his life to save his friends and the wizarding world.”

, It may help to read the hook out loud once you have created it to hear how it sounds. Notice if there are any awkward phrases or vague nouns that you can replace with more interesting, active nouns. Make sure the hook is in the present tense and does not reveal the ending of the book.


You can then revise the hook so it is more concise and to the point. Your hook should be no longer than one to two sentences and should leave the reader wanting to read your book in full.

, Give them all habits, flaws and backgrounds. Even if you do not use them in the story, even minor characters should have a biography. They should have recognisable traits such as chewing on fingernails, or talking to themselves. Give them a personality basis are they cold, caring, obnoxious, good at heart but grim and cold on the outside. This will help you determine many things like their looks, biography, and other things. Feel free to break from stereotypes. Not every hero is handsome or beautiful, not every soldier is grim and uncaring. The best characters do not fit a mould.

, The plot can start out with an average person who is entranced into the fantasy side of your world. Like Eragon finding Saphira's egg in the Spine, or Frodo receiving Bilbo's ring. The strength of your world architecture and character building should spark a storyline. As if someone stumbles on a strange necklace in the forest and the character becomes a target of an evil king or evil spirit who has minions to do their bidding.

, It should start out with an Expository, where your character and a day in his average life is told, then the problem is introduced. Then the problem gets worse, like his town is burned. Then serious, as he sets out for revenge. Then you reach a climax like a fight against a minion. Minions are best, because if the main character wins and then the story ends. High fantasy was made to spread into a long series.

, Then 'link them' together. When JRR Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings, he had no idea who Strider would become when he wrote the scenes at Bree.

, Like Rand Al' Thor is as a stubborn farm boy who comes to change to an iron willed leader against the Shadow. Change should not be quick. Their loss of attachment to the old life should take a book or two.

, In addition, always put obstacles in the way of your character. It gets boring after a while if the main character is mindlessly going after the villain and killing minions now and then. Maybe a friend is captured, he decides to help defend a village against the villain, he seeks a mentor, or maybe even, THEY are captured. That would help with step five.

Share your work!",How to Write a Fable," Because the moral is the center of a fable, it’s often helpful to begin outlining your fable by determining the moral. The moral of a fable should relate to or reflect on a culturally pertinent issue that will resonate with many people.


Some examples of famous fable morals to help inspire you include:

""Like will draw like.""
""The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.""
""Advice prompted by selfishness should not be heeded.""
""Fine feathers don't make fine birds.""
""Strangers should avoid those who quarrel among themselves.""For a complete listing of the morals of Aesop's Fables and links to the stories in which they appear, go here.;
, The problem is what will drive the action of the fable, and it will be the primary source for the lesson to be learned.Because the nature of fable is to convey culturally-relevant lessons and ideas, the central problem works best when it’s something to which many people can relate.For example, in ""The Tortoise and the Hare,"" we are are quickly introduced to what will be the central problem or conflict of the story when two characters decide to hold a race.

, Determine who or what the characters in your fable will be and what traits will define them.


Because fables are meant to be simple and concise, don’t aim for complex or multi-faceted characters. Rather, aim to have each character embody a single human trait and keep the characters within those specific limits.As the characters will be the primary vehicle for the fable’s moral, choose characters that will most clearly relate to that moral.
In ""The Tortoise and the Hare"" the characters are, as the title indicates, a tortoise and a hare. Because a tortoise is easily associated with things that are slow-moving and the hare with things that are swift, the characters already have what will be their key traits in the story built-in.

, Though the kind of animal or object you choose for your character will have objective traits built-in, as above, you'll also need to craft the subjective qualities attached to those traits.


In ""The Tortoise and the Hare,"" the tortoise's slowness is associated with level-headedness and persistence, while the hare's swiftness is associated with rashness and over-confidence.
There are a number of classic archetypal characters used in fables that are broadly recognized and associated with particular human traits. Choosing two characters with opposing traits is often useful in setting up a clear conflict for the story.Some of the most common archetypes and their characteristics include:

The lion: strength, pride
The wolf: dishonesty, greed, rapaciousness
The donkey: ignorance
The fly: wisdom
The fox: cleverness, trickiness, cunning
The hawk: bossiness, absolutism
The hen: conceitedness
The lamb: innocence, shyness, Where will the events of the story take place? As when choosing the moral and the problem, choose a setting that will be simple and recognizable to most people.The setting should also lend itself to the characters and their particular relationships.
Try to make the setting simple but vivid--it should be a place readers can easily recognize and understand, which will save you having to explicitly lay out the details of the surroundings.
For example, in the well known fable of the tortoise and the hare, the setting is simply a road through a forest, which sets the stage for the action (a race down the road) and lends itself to the kinds of characters in the story (woodland creatures).

, The resolution should be satisfying as well as relevant to the other components of the story, including the characters, their relationships, and the setting.


Consider how the characters will resolve the conflict and how that resolution will support the lesson and moral to be taken from the story.
For example, in ""The Tortoise and the Hare"" the resolution is simple--the hare, in his rashness, loses the race through the forest to the persevering tortoise.

, Once you’ve sketched out the main components of the story, begin fleshing them out.


Establish the setting and the relationship of the characters to the setting, which should be an easily recognizable place that's directly tied to the events of the story.

, Present the conflict between the characters in enough detail that the conflict or problem is clear and begs for resolution.


Be sure to move efficiently from a causal event to its effect. Don’t meander away from the point of the story.
Everything that happens in the story should be directly and clearly related to the problem and its resolution/moral.
Work on making the pacing of the fable quick and concise. Don’t waste time with unnecessarily elaborate descriptive passages or meditations on the characters and their surroundings.
For example, in ""The Tortoise and the Hare,"" the plot moves quickly from the initial challenge to the race to the hare's mistake and then to the tortoise's victory.

, Dialog is a key component in conveying a character’s personality and perspective, so rather than explicitly describe a character’s traits, use dialog to illustrate those characteristics.Be sure to include enough dialog among the characters to illustrate the relationships between them and the nature of the conflict they face.
For example, the two characteristics of the tortoise and the hare are established as level-headed and calm on the one hand, and boastful and rash on the other, as we can see through the tone of their dialog: ""I have never yet been beaten,"" said he , ""when I put forth my full speed. I challenge any one here to race with me."" The Tortoise said quietly, ""I accept your challenge."" ""That is a good joke,"" said the Hare; ""I could dance round you all the way."" ""Keep your boasting till you're beaten,"" answered the Tortoise. ""Shall we race?"", After showing the nature and details of the conflict, begin moving the story towards its resolution.


There should be a clear and direct relationship between the characters’ actions, the development of the problem, and the illustration of the moral/resolution.
Make sure there is a resolution to every aspect of the problem previously established and that there are no loose ends.
Referring again to the fable of the tortoise and the hare, the resolution comes when the boastful hare races ahead and then stops to take a nap, while the level-headed tortoise simply plods along, eventually passing the sleeping hare and beating him to the finish line.

, When the plot of the fable has resolved itself, set out the moral or lesson of the story.


In fables, the moral of the story is typically stated in a single, pithy sentence.Aim to state the moral in a way that summarizes both the problem, the resolution, and what should be learned from that resolution.
The simple moral of the tortoise and the hare, for example, is, ""After that, Hare always reminded himself, ""Don't brag about your lightning pace, for slow and steady won the race!"" It encapsulates both the mistake--being lazy and arrogant from over-confidence--and the lesson to be learned--that slow and persistent will win over quick and careless.

, The title should capture the spirit of the overall story and should also be enticing enough to catch the reader’s attention.


It’s usually best to save this step until you’ve written or at least outlined your story so you can ensure that the title you choose will reflect the story overall.
You might choose something basic and descriptive, in the tradition of Aesop's Fables (eg, ""The Tortoise and the Hare""), or choose a slightly more creative or irreverent title like ""The True Story of the Three Little Pigs"" or ""The Eyebrow Story.""

, Read back through your fable in its entirety and verify that all the pieces are in place and work in harmony.


Watch out for places where the fable may be overly wordy or complicated. The nature of fable is a simple, concise story that doesn’t mince words or lapse into purple prose.
Verify that each piece--setting, character, conflict, resolution, and moral--is clearly established and easily understandable.

, After you have nailed down the story’s content, go back through your fable again, this time focusing on sentence-level issues of grammar and clarity.


For a guide to making sentence-level edits, go here.
Recruit a friend or colleague to read over your text. A second set of eyes is often key to catching errors.

, Once all the finishing touches are in place, it’s time to get your work out to an audience.

, The best way to generate ideas about what the future in your story should look like is to do research about what things are like today. Often times, the best futuristic fiction offers worlds that are possible projections of our future based on the potential consequences of current scientific, environmental, and political trends.Since you’re writing about the future, focus on what seems cutting edge. Look into recent developments in science, space programs, and technology. Consider what is happening to Earth’s environment or what scientists project will happen in our future solar system, galaxy, or universe.
You can also research current social and political trends and conflicts, such as struggles for women’s empowerment, economic inequality, or rising tensions among world superpowers.
You can narrow the scope of your research by focusing on the trends that interest you most or by deciding what topic it is that you would like to offer some commentary on.

, If you’re particularly taken with a specific scientific development or theory, why not use it as your inspiration? Think about a world in which the theory has become reality or a promising scientific development had been fully realized.For instance, if you’re interested in physicists’ Many Worlds theory, write a story in which you make that abstract theory come to life by depicting a multi-dimensional universe.
If you’re keen on robotics, you might want to imagine what Artificial Intelligence will look like in the future, when we have completely automated lives.

Polish up worthwhile simple comics.",How to Write a Simple Comic Strip," The images you include while writing your simple comic need to be sketches that give the impression of action while taking as little time from the development of your story as possible. Your goal isn't to realize an artistic masterpieces, it's to write a simple comic. If you’re an artist, this may mean you’ll need to go against your natural inclinations and de-emphasize your attention from the image to the story.


Identify the relationship between characters in the scene. The feelings one character has for another will dictate how that character treats the other. These feelings will also motivate dialogue between your characters, and will set the tone in the narrative text. Narrative test is usually plaintext offset in a box at the top, bottom, and sides of a panel.
Prepare to spend time tweaking your dialogue and narrative text. If you decide to develop this simple comic into a fully-fledged one, you’ll need your text trimmed to the most direct, most significant expressions. Too much text in a comic can ruin the image-to-text balance or negatively impact a comic’s aesthetic.
Choose a focal point for you to write about. Your sketched images should centralize around some kind of action or interaction, otherwise known as the focal points of the scene. You'll write the text of the comic around these major events in the form of narration and dialogue. These focal points could be a comedic bit, like a gag or pun, could be a dramatic point of interest, like an archaeological find or scientific discovery, could be tragedy, like a story of star-crossed-lovers or a fall from grace tale, or many other varieties. You’ll want to express this idea compactly on a single page or two of panels.;
, Some strips won't get any more mileage than a single strip. These ""one-off"" simple comics don't need to go anywhere or have a long involved plot. Simply achieve your goal of your comic, like delivering a punchline, and begin a new simple comic when you're through. For episodic simple comics, you'll have to consider the plot of the strip. This way you can do things like connect ending panels so they lead into the beginning panels of the next comic.


In some cases, you might find that a simple one-off comic is deeper or more interesting than you first imagined. In this case, you always develop your simple one-off into a more complicated story by adding preceding or following strips to it.

, This will influence how you approach the drawing background and characters involved in your story. Whichever style you decide upon, you’ll need to be able to sketch in it. You’re not developing a detailed artistic vision with your simple comic, you’re writing it likely to flesh out an idea or sharpen your skills. This should be reflected in your artistry.


Do some rough practice sketches on a spare piece of paper to get in the flow of the style you have chosen. Some examples of comic styles you might employ are: Japanese manga, noir, cartoon, western, or basic. Basic style is where you use simple shapes, like squares, rectangles, and circles, to block out a scene.
Plot out the distribution of your panels. While you’re getting into the flow of your style, you should draw a miniature rectangle on a blank part of the page to represent the piece of paper you’ll be drawing your simple comic upon. Draw lines inside this rectangle to indicate where you’ll break the page into the panels that will make up the scenes of your simple comic. Apportion your page breaks wisely – your simple comic should only be a page or two long., This is going to the be most detailed work you do in your simple comic. By developing the images of your characters here, you’ll have a more definite idea of how these characters will occupy and move through space when you’re sketching their motion in the panels of your simple comic. This sheet will also serve as a reference for your sketch work when you start writing your simple comic.


Give your character a specific style or costume. You might not want to devote too much time to facial features and expressions, these can be developed later. A costume, however, will influence how the figures move through the scene, tools that the figures have, the dimensions of the figures, and how the costume interacts with the environment.
Develop the narrative of the character. In plaintext below each character, write names, jobs, physical details, and notes on personal history. You might want to adopt the tone your scene will take while writing these details. For example, if you are trying to write a dark, noir style, you might describe a character as, “Jack Smith, detective to the rich. The only clean man in a dirty world, though at five-foot six inches, he doesn’t exactly cut striking figure. His trench coat is known in many seedy venues, but his reputation remains untarnished."", On your practice sheet, alongside your style practice, you should begin sketching the setting of your comic. You’ll need to decide on where the events of your simple are taking place. This could be a warehouse, a school classroom, a library, a jungle, a spaceship or numerous other places. Remember, the goal here is not developing the artistry of the setting. In writing your simple comic, your setting is simply a vehicle to help you develop the idea, plot, or situation motivating your simple comic.


Use shading to loosely define the depth and perspective of your setting. For example, if your setting is in a building, you’ll likely need shadows in the foreground and on the walls to either side of the panel to give the illusion of depth to the room. Simple shapes, like ovals, squares, circles, and rectangles, can simulate boxes, control panels, barrels, buckets, refrigerators, mountains and more.
Use organic, connected strokes to create the illusion of vegetation in the background. You should use the same approach to large organic creatures like aliens, giant animals, monsters, and so on. Organic shapes are usually more fluid, so smooth strokes can effectively give this impression. Adding basic shapes, like a triangle on a square to simulate a head with a snout, can be added to smooth lines to further define the shape., You’ll need to capture your plot in one to two pages. It should be compelling and central to the simple action you sketch in the panels of your simple comic. To help you focus your plot, you should identify the key points of your simple comic. Some examples of these would include: conflict (physical), conflict (emotional), man vs. nature, good vs. evil, a pun, a euphemism, a fall from grace, and so on.


Choose the major plot points for your simple comic. Do you want references to these plot points throughout the comic? Or would your comic benefit from the surprise reveal of a plot point at the end? Your comic might work best if you start with your plot point in the beginning and use it to motivate the events of your panels.
Judge the effect your plot will have on your characters. Since you’ve already developed your characters a little bit and have a working understanding of who they are and how they work, you should be able to judge how your characters will react with regard to the plot. Your characters might support the driving force of your story, or they might resist it. This is where your story begins taking shape.
Write down key words and phrases that you find central to the idea of your simple comic. You could pull these ideas from phrases you’ve heard throughout the day. If that doesn’t work, try opening the dictionary and pointing at the page at random. Use the word you selected as a central word for your simple comic. You should also begin jotting down central tidbits of dialogue you want to use. A simple comic about a warrior might have a hero yell, “Cur, have at ye!” These will help you develop your simple comic., Your simple comic should be no more than two pages long for the purposes of practice or idea development, though you may want to use a long-draft simple comic for roughing out more complete comic ideas. Refer to your practice page and the panel distribution you drew there. Using this as your template and a pencil, break your pages into panels that depict the action of your scene.


You might use size your panels according to the importance of the events contained in the panel. For example, the punchline of a comedic comic might take the bottom half of a page, while the top half, where the set-up of the joke occurs, could be split into three panels. For beginners, you might want to start with the classic four panel approach. Simply divide your paper into four quarters, creating four scenes for each page.
Many comics utilize a simple ""strip"" format where the panels tell a linear story from the start on the left to the finish on the right. This style is still popular in print media, like newspapers and magazines.
Use thick lines when sectioning off the panels of your pages. You don’t want these lines to be confused for the sketch work you add when you put character-shapes and background images in your panels. You can also use different shapes or outlines to convey emotion or sensation in your panel. For example, a character getting shocked might have his panel bordered with a zig-zag line., You’ll want the setting firmly in place before you start adding characters to the scene. The background will influence how the characters move through your panel, so you should start with this as the first building block for the art in your simple comic. If you need more space for characters later in your comic writing, you can always erase some of the background to free up space. After all, this is only sketch work.


Remember to incorporate important tools or features that are part of the setting. It would be strange if one of your characters was suddenly holding a sword with a dialogue bubble coming from his mouth with the words, “I’m king Arthur!” Instead, if you show the sword in stone in the background followed by a picture of a man holding it with the same speech bubble, the image is much more coherent. Some setting features you might want to keep in mind: switches, weapons, doors, large furniture, character props, humor props, and so on.
Include local features to set the tone. If your comic is taking place on a foreign planet, you might draw three moons in the night sky to immediately give the reader of your simple comic that impression. Similarly, a city could be indicated by a few rectangles for buildings and a circle on a cylinder for a fire hydrant.
Use layers to give the impression of distance. Your simple comic won’t have the depth of a fully developed artistic vision. You can still add triangles in the far background for mountains, some long arcs below the mountains to give the impression of foothills, and a flat foreground for the characters to stand upon to add depth to your setting., Since you already know your plot, you should know roughly how your characters are going to play out the scene. Your characters will either be confronting each other or some other plot point, and around this interaction you’ll write the substance of your comic. This substance is conveyed through character dialogue bubbles and narrative text, which is usually plaintext offset in a regular square box at the top, bottom, or sides of a panel.


Your characters might interact with each other directly, or they might set off a chain of events that influence each other. The distribution of the characters in your panels will depend upon the plot you have decided and how the characters taking part in the action.
Use your character sheet to help you sketch each characters’ movement throughout the setting of your simple comic. If your characters are in a swamp, you’ll likely need to show their clothing trailing behind them in swamp muck. If your characters are in the snow, their costumes might drag a vague pattern behind them. Remember, your goal here is broad strokes. The scene and the characters of your simple comic are a prop to help you write the comic., Now that you have your background and characters in your panels, your stage is set and your players are ready for the story. You need to write the text of your comic in the remaining space on the page. This will describe the action and convey the emotions in your simple comic. Take a look at your list of key words, phrases, and dialogue that you came up with while working on the plot of your simple comic. Use these as the foundation upon which you build the rest of the scene.


Narrative text should convey all the important information left out of dialogue. For example, you might start a scene with the narrative text, “Jack Smith had a chip on his shoulder all his life. And now it was time to settle that score.” Below the box surrounding that narrative text could possibly be a scene with a character saying, “I’ll show them all!” In this way, you can use a mix of narrative text and dialogue to tell the story of your simple comic.
Take into account characters’ distribution in the scene when coordinating dialogue. A character standing in the foreground will appear closer than one situated in the background. You might express this in your text by making the dialogue text of the near character larger than that of the far character.
Trim your text down to the bare necessities. You only have so much space on the page, and overloading it with text will make your comic less comic-like and more like a novel. To prevent text overload, you might want to limit the space allowed for the text of each panel to a third., Your final panel may be a cliffhanger, or it could be the end of the scene, but you’ll need the panel to convey a sense of finality. You might put the words, “The End” somewhere in the lower right hand corner of the page as a visual cue to readers that your simple comic is finished. You could also use a thicker than normal borderline for the panel to give the sense of a hard stop to the scene.


You could also turn your simple comic into a series of simple comics. If you really like the idea you’ve been developing, you could write “To be continued” or “Stay tuned” to indicate you intend to issue another simple comic of the same series.

, You never know when you're going to find a diamond in the rough among your simple comics. A strip that you intended to use as practice might turn into a popular strip in its own right! If you think a particular simple comic, or series of simple comics, has merit, you should:


Clean up your linework
Ink your drawings
Colorize your panels
Add it to your portfolio or get it published

"
"
Decide your time period and location.,
Develop your future world.,
Consider what technology will be available.,
Characterize your future society.,
Think about politics.,
Describe the environment.,
Make sure your vision is cohesive.",How to Write a Futuristic Story2," As a starting point, you should figure out where and when you would like your story to take place. It could be on Earth or on another planet altogether. It could be tens, hundreds, thousands or maybe even millions of years in the future.Remember, not everyone has to live on a spaceship or consort with aliens for your story to be futuristic.
Make your decisions based on what kind of story you would like to tell about the future. If you’re projecting a time when humans have evolved to be bodiless, you might want to set it further in the future than if you still include humans who look much like they do today.

, To write a credible futuristic story, you have to start by creating your future world. In fact, the story itself should arise from your world. Now that you have the basic wheres and whens down, it’s time to start figuring out the details. The more detailed your world is, the more people will believe in it as they are reading.Start by considering what makes your future world different from today and what things are the same. Then, delve into the details of how your future’s technology, society, politics, and environment are structured.
Take notes about each of these categories. Not all of them may come up in your story, but it will help you to fully imagine the world you’re introducing to readers.
If you know lots of particulars about your world, you can sneak in concrete details related to them that will make your setting seem more real to readers.
Keep in mind that your decisions about how to characterize a future world should be driven by what sort of commentary you want to offer about the present. If you think Artificial Intelligence is a positive thing, for example, then you can start by imagining a utopian world in which the human race has been replaced by AI.

, Decide if your future will be more or less advanced technologically than today. Imagine what technological developments may have taken place between now and then. Remember to consider not only big-picture changes, like the ability to time travel, but also what kinds of tech people will be using in their everyday lives, such as modes of transportation or communication., Now, consider what the inhabitants of your future world will be like. What will they look like? What species will they be? Map out the norms you imagine for their general family structures, occupations, and lifestyles.Seemingly mundane details, such as what people eat and drink or what their houses are like, will go a long way towards establishing a compelling future world.

, Besides ruminating on your future’s social norms, you should take time to imagine what its political system looks like. How are territories recognized or divided in your world? Do nations or countries still exist or is there a significantly different geopolitical arrangement? What sort of government(s) exist in your world, and who holds political power?, What does the natural world look like in your future? Think about its weather or climate and landscape as well as its flora and fauna.


For example, if you’re setting your story on a future Earth, you might consider which species have evolved and which ones have gone extinct. You could make predictions about how the climate has altered and which land masses are now covered in water.

, There should be an internal logic to how your world is imagined. When your audience is reading the story, all the concrete details included in it should make sense to them and check out with one another.For instance, if people have evolved to communicate telepathically, they probably wouldn’t still be using mobile phones.

"
"
Don’t make the connections to the present too explicit.,
Be careful how you write about technology.,
Avoid potential historical blunders.",How to Write a Futuristic Story3," While the present should serve as a source of inspiration for your futuristic story, you don’t want to date it by making it speak too directly to current events. If you do, your future will get stale pretty quickly. Offer commentary without limiting it to a specific historical moment.For instance, if the characters in your story exactly mirror specific historical figures, such as Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, then the narrative and its commentary will not extend much past the present day.

, The pace of technological innovation is so rapid that it’s difficult to keep up. Lots of tech is obsolete within a few years of its development. Hence, if you describe the future technology in your book in too much detail, especially if your projections are based on where we’re at today, it’s bound to feel retro pretty quickly. Instead, focus on describing what the technology does rather than on the specifics of how it looks or works.You don’t want to describe screens and wires when those elements may become a thing of the past.
Instead, leave some gaps as to the details to let your readers’ imaginations fill them in accordingly.

, If your story projects an event, society, or character that was supposed to happen in the distant future but has already taken place in the reader’s present, the text will feel dated. Hence, it’s a good idea to resist including “first,” “lasts,” and “only's” in your futuristic writing.For example, if your story is about the first humans to land on Mars, that’s a reality that could happen sooner than you think. If one of your characters is the first female president of the US and you set the story a millennium from today, your premise will seem somewhat obsolete when there is a woman president.

Decide on events for your story.,
List some events and put them in order.,
Write a rough draft.,
Edit the rough draft with a pen or pencil.,
Complete the final copy.",How to Write a Fictional Story About Horses," If someone who knows a lot about horses reads your story, you want them to get the sense that you know what you're talking about. Read up on horses online and at your local library. If you can, spend some time observing real horses and interacting with them. If you can't get to a place with live horses, watch videos with horses to get a sense of how they move and behave. You should know some horse words such as hand, furlong, martingale, etc, and something about horse colors and breeds.;
, The names can say something about the horse's character. For example, a horse named ""Flame"" might be wild and rebellious, maybe a stallion, and likely bay or chestnut colored. Think about why the horses in your story act the way they do. What were they like when they were young? Who were their parents? How do they act around people? Around other horses? How do people or other horses perceive them? Try to have horses in your story with a variety of different personalities. No one wants to read about a bunch of horses who all act the same. Try to make your horses stand out from the ""herd"".

, While humans are not always essential in a story about horses, they are frequently present. They should be just as fully developed as characters as the horses are. Since your story is going to focus on horses, think about how your human characters react to them. Does the person have a favorite horse? A least favorite horse? Is she an experienced rider or a novice? Did she grow up around horses or did she live in the city until now?

, Obviously, your setting will be determined by the kind of story you write. It can be a stable, a farm, a riding school, the wild plains, a secluded wilderness island, or just about anywhere you might find horses. Get as specific as you can. What other animals live on the farm? Cows? Pigs? Emus? How many horses are at the riding school and how many people attend it? Does your setting have secluded trails through the woods or wide open space as far as the eye can see?

, List the characters, both horse and human, as well as the setting, and some specific details about them. For example:



Hudson (horse): Clydesdale, bay, old, smart

Danielle (girl): 14 years old, blond hair, owner of Hudson
Start to think about how the different characters may react to each other and what conflicts might emerge. You may also want to draw pictures to help you visualize the story.

, Some possible conflicts include:


An orphaned foal struggles to survive in the wild.
A band of wild horses are brought to live on a farm.
A horse is purchased by a cruel owner.
An old horse and a young rider must learn to work together.
A group of people acquire a wild horse and try to tame it.

, The events should relate to the main conflict in your story. For example, if we have a story about wild horses coming to live on a farm, some events that could happen are:


A headstrong mare gets loose and runs away.
The foals like the humans, but worry about losing the respect of the lead stallion.
The humans try to ride one of the horses for the first time.
The horses confront the emus over their grain greediness.
One of the horses is ill and the humans must nurse him back to health.

, Write some notes about each one you will include.

, Keep in mind that you are still in the planning stage, and this is not the final copy. Don't worry about spelling and punctuation yet.

, Correct spelling, punctuation, grammar, and any other errors you made. it may help to use a bright color so you can see what you changed.

, You may wish to type it, or you can simply write the story on paper.

Use humor with intent and purpose.,
Play with cliches.,
Follow the rule of three.,
Use language in a humorous way.,
Give your characters funny dialogue.,
Read the book out loud.,
Show the book to others.,
Revise the book.",How to Write a Funny Book," To write a funny book, you need a story idea that could come across as funny to your readers. You may create a story idea that is so absurd, it’s funny. Or you may place your characters in a situation that is humorous. Crafting a funny story idea should be a fun, silly exercise where you consider what you find funny and try to use these elements in your book.For example, you may use your own funny experiences to write a story that is funny. Maybe you had a humorous entrance into the world, complete with a premature birth in the back of a moving bus and a mother who didn’t know what to name you, so your name was “Baby” for the first few weeks. Use funny moments in your life as inspiration for an original funny book.
You can also create a situation that is so absurd it is funny, forcing your characters to deal with a funny situation in your book. For example, maybe your book is set in a dystopian future where people cannot lie. This situation can come across as absurd to your reader and force your characters to deal with being honest all the time.;
, You can also imbue your main character with funny attributes or a funny perspective on the world. This could then help your book come across as humorous to your readers. Perhaps your main character is quirky and strange, with a funny perspective on life. Or maybe your main character always seems to land in absurd situations, leading to moments of humor.For example, maybe your main character is socially awkward and does not know how to approach others, especially at parties. But they always seem to end up going to parties anyway.

, You can come up with a story idea that is funny and entertaining by taking a classic story and twisting it around. Think of your favorite fairy tale, for example, and then add a humorous twist to it so it becomes funny or absurd. Consider a plot line you have read before and adjust it or add to it so it becomes fresh and new to readers.For example, you may take the fairy tale about sleeping beauty and twist it so it becomes more humorous. You may make the sleeping beauty a hyperactive beauty who cannot get to sleep, no matter how much her prince kisses her. Or you may have the sleeping beauty actually turn out to be an old maid who has been waiting so long for the prince, she has aged several centuries.

, You can generate funny story ideas and funny character ideas by reading books that are considered humorous. Reading books marketed in the humor genre can also allow you to get a sense of the types of stories that are considered funny by publishers and editors. You may read several examples, including:Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris

Bossypants by Tina Fey

Hyperbole and a Half by Allie Brosh

The Sellout by Paul Beatty

, To write humor effectively, you should be selective about how you use humor in your writing. Try not to have every line in a passage or a chapter be a joke. Instead, put humor in your writing with intent and purpose. Be specific so your reader is pleasantly surprised by a joke. This will ensure your humorous writing does not come off as formulaic or predictable.For example, you may try to keep the number of jokes in your writing to one to two a page so your reader has time to enjoy the other aspects of your writing besides just the humor. You do not want to come across as a comedian to your reader, especially if you are writing fiction that is supposed to be funny but also tragic and poignant.
You may also vary the types of jokes you use in your writing so the reader feels you are writing with intent and purpose. You may play with cliches in one passage, and then use humorous language in another passage so your reader is constantly surprised and amused.

, One way to add humor to your writing is to play around with cliches, or phrases that have become so familiar they have lost their meaning. You may take a cliche and adjust the ending of it so it is not what your reader expected. Or you may invert or twist around a cliche so it comes across as new and fresh to your reader.For example, you may take the cliche, “Where there’s smoke…” and then adjust the ending so it is funny and strange. You may write, “Where there’s smoke, there’s our protagonist, Sandra Dee.” You could then continue to play with cliches in your story about Sandra Dee, the budding arsonist.
You can also expand a cliche so it has more depth and humor to it. For example, you may take a cliche about “a mother’s life is her children” and discuss how protective you really are as a mother. You may use parallels to a mother lion in the jungle protecting her cubs and your tendency to bite at anyone who insults you or your children in any way.

, Comedy tends to follow the rule of three, where you set up a pattern and then misdirect readers so they are surprised and amused. The rule of three requires pairing two like ideas together and then adding a third, off the wall idea. This allows you to set up your reader with certain expectations and then throw them off with something strange and funny.For example, you may have the sentence: “Being happy is simple: Eat well, fall in love, and take happy pills when it all comes crashing down.” This sentence uses the rule of three, where you have two ideas that are entirely expected and a third idea that is not at all what one would expect.

, You can give your writing more personality by using language in a funny way. Embellish a story so it is funny and over the top on the page. Use language that surprises your reader so they are always kept on their toes, unsure of when the next laugh will hit. Do not be afraid to go for the big joke in your writing, as this can lead to big laughs.You can use language to get your reader laughing by putting funny words in your writing. Many people find words that have a “k” sound to be pretty funny, from “Cadillac” to “quintuplet” as well as words that have a hard “g” sound, such as “guacamole” and “gargantuan.”
You can also use language that is over the top and embellished so your reader realizes the absurdity of a situation.
For example, if you are telling a story about how you almost crashed into your parent’s house, you may use describe it as, “I flew through the sleepy, suburban streets at a record breaking pace. I was way past my curfew and so worried about the pissed off look on my mother’s face when I bounded through the front door that I didn’t realize I had already arrived at my parent’s house. Headlights first into the rose garden.”

, You can also write a funny book by giving your characters dialogue that is funny and snappy. To do this, you can include comparison jokes in your dialogue, particularly in the dialogue of your main character or characters. Having your characters trade jokes back and forth can lead to some funny passages for your reader.For example, you may go for the funniest metaphors you can think of. You may try to compare a feeling or a situation to the most absurd image and then put it in your character’s dialogue.
You may have your character say, “I would rather floss your cat’s teeth than go out with you.” And you may have another character respond, “Great! My cat has abnormally large molars so make sure you get those while you're at it.”

, Once you have finished a draft of your book, you should read it out loud. Read it out loud to yourself and notice if you crack up at your own writing. This may be a good indication that your book might be funny to others.You can also read the book out loud to others, such as a friend or a family member to see if they laugh or find your writing funny.

, Perhaps you bring your funny book to a writing group and get feedback from others on whether it is funny or if it needs some work to get there. Or maybe you have a writing partner that you exchange work with so you can both critique each other and make your writing that much funnier.Accept feedback from others on how you can make your book funnier and push the humor a little more. It will only make your book stronger.

, Once you have received feedback on your book, you may be ready to revise it and polish it until it is at its best. Adjust any dialogue that comes across as forced or awkward instead of funny. Add in language that is more embellished and humorous so your writing comes across as funny. Remove any sentences that do not add to the humor in your book."

Consider interesting joke material.,
Research topics for different situations and audiences.,
Try to avoid controversial topics that might offend someone.,
Consider your joke structure.,
Write the set up and punchline.,
Heighten the joke’s surprise factor.,
Add tags or toppers.,
Practice your joke.,
Consider your audience.,
Add gestures.,
Be confident, relax, and improvise if you need to.",How to Write a Good Joke," Writing about topics that interest not only you, but also your intended audience is an important component of ensuring that people will find you and your jokes funny.


Consider the types of jokes or comedians who make you and your friends or colleagues laugh. Having an idea of jokes that elicit laughter will point the way to finding optimal joke material.
It’s a good idea to think about material for different situations and audiences so that you can tailor your jokes to them. For example, a joke you deliver to break the ice at a job interview (“How much does a polar bear weigh? Enough to break the ice!”) will not be the same as a joke at a family party (“What did the cake say to the knife? You wanna piece of me?”);
, You'll want to tailor your jokes for any place or group of people you might encounter. This way, you’re more likely to have people understand your joke and laugh at it. Tailoring the material also ensures that you are less likely to offend someone. For example, a joke delivered to a group of medical professionals isn’t necessarily appropriate for a group of historians or political scientists.


Topics such as current events, celebrities, or even yourself (known as self-deprecating humor) make excellent joke material. You can find funny material for jokes in almost every situation.For example: Public figures and their behavior often find themselves the butt of jokes. Comedian Chris D’Elia joked of singer Justin Bieber ""You have it all: except love, friends, good parents and a Grammy.""Newspapers, magazines, or even situations in your own life make excellent joke topics. For instance, you could make a joke about having a “black thumb” with plants: “I bought a cactus. A week later it died. And I got depressed, because I thought, Damn. I am less nurturing than a desert.”Watching famous comedians deliver their jokes during an act is another good source of material. It will also show you how to effectively deliver a joke.

, There are certain topics that are taboo and probably aren’t good material in most situations.


Jokes about topics such as race and religion are likely to offend many people. While it might be acceptable in some situations, such as among family members, to make off-color jokes, it’s best to leave controversial topics off the table for other forums.
If you’re unsure about if your topic or joke will offend someone, it’s best to err on the side of caution and leave it out.

, There are a couple of different ways to write and deliver jokes including the traditional set up and punchline, one-liners, or short stories. One liners can be an extremely effective format. Comedian BJ Novak made the simple and effective, if tasteless, one-liner: “Battered women: sounds delicious.”Novak’s joke plays on two elements you can incorporate into your material: surprise and twisting word meanings. It’s also a traditional set up and punchline type of joke.
Jokes as a short story are another effective method. However, remember to keep them short! A good example of a joke wrapped in a short story is: “There was once a young man who, in his youth, professed a desire to become a ""great"" writer. When asked to define ""great"" he said ""I want to write stuff that the whole world will read, stuff that people will react to on a truly emotional level, stuff that will make them scream, cry, wail, howl in pain, desperation, and anger!"" He now works for Microsoft writing error messages.”, Every joke, no matter what structure you use, has a set up and a punchline. The set up and punchline will sometimes contain elements of surprise based on assumptions, twisting words, or playing on ironies. Remember ""less is more."" As you prepare your set up and punchline, remember that you will want to tell your joke in as few words as possible. Avoid unnecessary details and phrases.BJ Novak’s joke “Battered women: sounds delicious” and the joke “What did the cake say to the knife? You wanna piece of me?” are examples of jokes that demonstrate the “less is more” strategy. Any other details would have caused the jokes to fall flat.Your set up should be one or two lines, or a few lines for a story. It prepares your audience by creating an expectation and giving them the details they need to understand the punchline. The joke about the dead cactus is a good example of this. The comedian sets up the joke with the lines “I bought a cactus. A week later it died.”The punchline is the “funny” part of your joke that will make people laugh. It builds on the set up and is only one word or one sentence. It often reveals the surprise, irony, or word play to your audience.Again, the dead cactus joke is a good example of a short and funny punchline. After setting up the audience with the details of his plant cactus, the comedian tells us: And I got depressed, because I thought, Damn. I am less nurturing than a desert.” .”, Elements such as familiarity, exaggeration, and irony will enhance your joke.


A good example of exaggeration and irony is the story about the young man with great aspirations. Most listeners will expect that he fulfilled his wish to write “stuff that people will react to on a truly emotional level, stuff that will make them scream, cry, wail, howl in pain, desperation, and anger!"" through novels or short stories. Instead, the surprise is that “He now works for Microsoft writing error messages.”, Tags and toppers are additional punchlines that build upon your first punchline.


You can use tags and toppers as a way to get extra laughs without writing a new joke or needing to set up any material.For example, you could add a topper to the short story by saying “In fact, he’s the one screaming, crying, wailing, and howling in pain the most.”

, Before you tell your joke to friends or any audience, practice delivering it.


You'll need to find the joke funny for your audience to feel the same! If you don’t find the joke funny or somehow off, revise it until it works for you.

, Before you tell one of the jokes you've written, think about who your audience is. This will help guarantee that they understand your joke and increase the likelihood of laughter. A group of elderly people probably wouldn’t get the joke about Justin Bieber because he is a young pop star with a very young fan base.


You're less likely to offend someone if you know your audience. For example, it’s probably not advisable to tell the joke about “battered women” to a women’s group.

, Think about what facial expressions or gestures will enhance the set up and punchline(s). Drawing pictures is another effective method to help your audience understand your joke.

, These visual cues will do the same for your audience and make them more likely to laugh.


If your audience doesn’t laugh you can make a joke about that or move on to other material. You can always revise the joke for future use.
Remember that even the best comics have jokes that fall flat. John Stewart, Jerry Seinfeld, Bob Newhart and others aren’t funny all the time.

This could be the fear of losing a friend, a fear of heights, a fear of clowns, or even a fear of velcro. You can then tap into this fear and explore it as an idea for your story.Use your fear as material for a story about something scary or revolting. Consider how you would react as a character if you were forced to confront these fears.
Another option is to ask family, friends, and partners what scares or revolts them the most. You can then use their fears as an idea for your story.;
, You can also take a normal, common situation like going for a stroll in the park, preparing a meal, or visiting a friend and add a terrifying element to the situation. Use your imagination to add a horrifying spin to a normal, everyday activity or scene.For example, maybe you come across a severed ear during your morning stroll in the park or perhaps a vegetable you are cutting up for dinner turns into a finger or a tentacle. Get creative and consider how you can skew or twist around a situation that seems commonplace.

, You can also limit or trap your main character in a setting that is terrifying and scary. Restricting your character’s movements will allow you to build tension and terror in the story using setting.Consider a confined space that scares you or frightens you. Ask yourself where you would dread or fear being trapped in the most.
Maybe you trap your character in a confined space like a coffin, a cold dank cellar, an abandoned police station, an island or an abandoned city. Trapping your characters in a scary setting will introduce fear into the story right away and create immediate tension and suspense.

, You can also start your horror story by focusing on character development. You should strive to create a main character or several main characters that are distinct and detailed. You may create a character study for each character so you can get a sense of how they live, how they think, and how they might react in a conflict. You can do this by determining several key details or aspects of each character, including:The character's age and occupation
The character's marital status or relationship status
The character's view the world (cynical, skeptical, anxious, happy-go-lucky, satisfied, settled)
Any specific or unique physical details, such as a physical trait like a certain hairstyle, a scar, or a certain style of dress
The character's speech, dialect, or language spoken around others

, Horror hinges on the reader’s reaction to the material. You can create extreme emotion in the reader by giving your character an extreme emotion that they then have to struggle with over the course of the story. Emotions like shock, paranoia, and dread are all strong emotions that can motivate a character to take action or have intense internal thoughts.Making your character experience an intense shock, like the death of a loved one or the loss of a job, can also create a conflict for your character. This can then lead the character to make decisions they would not make if they were not in shock or dealing with the aftershock of a major event.
You can also give your main character a dose of paranoia, or a sense that something is not quite right. This will make the character suspicious and view things from a skewed perspective. Paranoia is also great at unnerving your reader and making them also doubt their understanding of the events happening in the story.
Another option is to give your main character a sense of dread or a feeling that something bad is going to happen. Dread can help to build tension in the story and keep the reader on edge.

, Once you have a clear story idea, you should create a plot outline so you have a general sense of where your characters are heading in the story. The plot outline can act as a map or guide for your story, though you may end up deviating from the outline if inspiration strikes as you write the horror story.


You may use a plot diagram to create the outline. The plot diagram will have six distinct sections, forming the shape of a triangle, with the climax at the top of the triangle. The six sections are: the set up, the inciting incident, the rising action, the climax, the falling action, and the resolution.
You can also use the snowflake method to create the outline. You will do this by creating a one sentence summary of the plot, followed by a one paragraph summary of the plot, and then a spreadsheet of scenes.

, The first line of your story should raise questions in the reader’s mind but also ground the reader in the story. A good opening line will tell the reader what the story is about, have a distinct voice or point of view, and a hint of characterization.For example, you may decide to write a story about your fear of velcro, set in a dystopian world. You may have the following opening line: “Sara tried to sit still while the men tightened the velcro straps around her wrists, squeezing her eyes shut to block out the terrifying sound.”
This opening line introduces the main character, Sara, and places her in a scene where she is experiencing fear and discomfort. It also raises questions in the reader’s mind, such as who are “the men” and why is Sara being strapped down? These questions will keep your reader engaged and willing to keep turning the page.

, Try to start your story in scene, where your character or characters are moving, interacting, or doing something. Starting in a scene with action will engage your reader right away and hook them in so they are encouraged to keep reading. It will also help to ground the reader in the story and help them to feel carried along by the story.Try to place your main character in a scene where they are in distress or unsettled in some way. This will introduce the horror element of the story right away.
For example, you may open your story with a scene where your main character is being strapped into a device. You may then describe how it feels for your character to be in the device and her thought process of trying to escape the device while her captors try to keep her strapped down.

, You are writing a horror story after all, so do not be afraid to introduce terrifying or unsettling details within the first paragraph of the story. By the end of the first paragraph, your reader should know the setting and the conflict. Your reader should also have a good sense of terror or fear by the end of the first page of the story, as you want to evoke strong emotions from your reader.For example, you may try to include gory details like blood, guts, mucus, brain matter, or saliva in the first paragraph of your story. Try to use the gory details sparingly and a little at a time so the story does not feel cliche or familiar.

, Your horror story should also include a main conflict, where your main character is spurred into action in some way. The main conflict of your horror story should appear within the first several paragraphs or the first one to two pages of your story. Having a conflict in your story as soon as possible will keep your reader engaged and help to build tension in your story.For example, you may have a main character who is trying to get rid of a ghost in her home. This could be the main conflict that you introduce in the story right away. The rest of the story could then be about her attempt to get rid of the ghost in her house without getting hurt or harming anyone in her family.
If you decide to withhold the conflict from the reader until later in the story, you should have a good reason for doing this. Withholding information should only be done intentionally and for the benefit of the story, as your reader may get confused or lost without this information.

, You should also try to always use the active voice in your opening section and throughout your story, rather than the passive voice. The passive voice can end up making your sentences sound bland or dry. You want to create sentences that are engaging and dynamic to your reader, with a lot of action and forward momentum.For example, rather than start your story with the line: “The straps are cold on Sara’s skin as the men strap her into the chair,"" which is passive and confusing, you may start with: “Sara feels the straps, cold and metal, on her skin as the men hold her down in the chair.” The second sentence uses the active voice and places the subject of the sentence,“Sara,"" next to the verb in the sentence, “feels.”
Using the active voice does not mean you are limited to only using first person, present for your point of view. You can still use the active voice in the past tense, using third person or second person.

, You can get a better sense of start your horror story with a bang by reading example beginnings from popular, well known horror stories. Use these openings as a model or guide for your own story. Examples include:


The beginning of “The Tell-Tale Heart” by Edgar Allen Poe: “True! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?”The opening lines tell the reader right away that the narrator is unsettled, very nervous, and possibly mad. It is a great opening that puts the reader on edge right away and prepares them for an unsettling story.
The beginning of “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?” by Joyce Carol Oates: “Her name was Connie. She was fifteen and she had a quick, nervous giggling habit of craning her neck to glance into mirrors or checking other people’s faces to make sure her own was all right.”The beginning lines are deceptively simple but they introduce the main character, provide her young age and gender, and characterize the main character as possibly vain and naive. These lines prepare the reader for a story about the main character that is flawed and possibly susceptible to outside influence.
The beginning of 1984 by George Orwell: “It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.”This beginning line is well known and admired for its ability to cram all the craft elements of the story in one sentence. The reader is grounded in setting and set up with an unsettling image, a day that is bright and cold. The clocks striking thirteen also feel like a bad omen and sign of misfortune to come.

, Once you have written the opening of your horror story, you should read them out loud to hear how they sound on the page. Note if the opening lines feel unsettling or disturbing. Check if the opening lines contain plot, characterization, setting, and voice.


You may also read the opening lines out loud to a trusted friend or peer to get a second opinion. Ask your listener if they find the story creepy, disturbing, or horrifying. Be willing to take constructive criticism and feedback about the opening, as getting a second viewpoint on the beginning can make it stronger.

, Often, cracking the beginning lines can make it easier to then write the rest of the story. Once you have created a satisfying ending to your horror story, you should go back and revise the beginning. This will ensure your beginning still fits with where your story ended up.You should consider if the beginning section flows well with the rest of the story. You should also adjust the beginning to reflect any changes to your character or your setting that you made later on in the story. You want your beginning to feel like a natural start to the rest of the story.

, You should also read over the beginning section to ensure it is not confusing in anyway and that it is easy to follow for the reader. There is nothing worse than an opening section that does not make sense to a reader, as they may get so frustrated they stop reading any further.


Make sure the character voice in the beginning section matches the character voice in the rest of the story. You want a consistent character voice throughout your story so it feels cohesive.

Keep at it, editing, re-editing until you feel that everything you want to say or feel is in the book.,
Look at your pages.",How to Write a Book As a Teenager," Experiences that you might have gone through and places you might have visited. A friend perhaps, or a relative, or even a special pet. Maybe even a place you have wanted to visit, or a place that you have already visited . If you want to write fiction or sci-fi, start off easy; maybe a fantasy set in your state or province? Or maybe the sci-fi takes place on Earth in one hundred years.;
, Would it be about one person only? Or a pet? Or would it include others? Where would you want the book to start and end?

, But along the way they just...get...bored. This is where you add the magic! There's no way your character can go back to her old life now; she HAS to go through to the end!

, Since you are a teenager, you might want to write about your teen experiences, desires or things you always wanted to do or see. You can write about your pet, or your friends, just do not write their real names. Give everyone a made-up name, and don't use them too realistically. Use a single trait or physical appearance, because you never know if you might accidentally use them in an unflattering way.

, The book has to end, and you have to know or think about how it might or could end. Sometimes, just because you plan an ending, does not mean that the storyline will actually lead to that ending. However, it is just someplace that, at this time, you want the story to lead to. Feel free to change the story as much as you want.

, Start typing more information into each section. Sit quietly and just let your thoughts and memories guide you, and it will. Keep writing until you suddenly stop. Then read back what you wrote. You might be surprised to see a good part of a book coming to life. It's always good to know about 100 times more stuff than you'd actually use; that means that if you ever feel like writing 99 more books after this one, you can do it without doing another speck of research.

, Then have someone else read it and give you input. But remember; there is such a thing as too much editing.

, You have just written a book.

, Otherwise known as the Writer’s Market, this book is published annually and contains thousands of listings for writers who are looking to sell their work. These listings include magazines, newspapers, greeting card companies to name just a few. Every listing includes all the details you need about what the publication is looking for, submission instructions and pay rates.


Look at the magazine listings that interest you and start submitting small fiction pieces. Once you get your feet wet writing what you know, you can expand your horizons and write fiction pieces for magazines and other venues that don’t particularly interest you, but that pay well for freelance articles.
Don’t dismiss literary magazines. These specialty magazines usually don’t pay very much, but you can add publication of your pieces to your resume and still earn a little money.
Hone your sense of humor. Many periodicals are looking for humorous pieces, and these short pieces usually pay well. Look at every venue as an opportunity. Maybe you wouldn’t consider writing an article for Cat Fancy magazine because you don’t have a cat, but do you have a funny story to tell about your neighbor’s cat?

, Scrutinize them every month and get a feel for what types of articles the editors favor. Deduct the cost of the subscription from your freelance writing business.

, Adhering to the submission guidelines will save you time and aggravation:


Look at residency, gender and age requirements first. Strange as this may sound, there are publications that will only accept submissions from residents of a particular state or country, or articles written by women, minorities, or people in a certain age group. Restrictions like these are also common in writing contest guidelines.
The periodical may not accept submissions, or they may accept submissions only during certain times of the year. They may accept submissions after you have sent an inquiry.
The guidelines will specify what type of story the periodical is seeking. Don’t make the mistake of submitting an article about romance if they aren’t looking for pieces in that genre.
Strictly follow their word count specifications. Don’t submit a 2,000 word article when they have a limit of 300 words.
Be clear about their pay scale, if they have one. Some periodicals pay a flat rate, some pay by the word and some don’t pay at all; your reward is seeing your name in print.

, Search for writing forums on the Internet and join in. It’s a form of networking that could lead you to new writing markets to explore. You will most likely pick up some great writing tips as well.

, Start small and keep it simple in the beginning. There are books and websites available to walk you through the process. You can serialize your own novel or blog. You can also learn how to make your website earn money for you through advertisers. Last, but not least, your work may come to the attention of editors or agents who might otherwise never see it.

, If you have a storehouse of unpublished articles, sift through them to see if you can find an angle in any particular story that can be adapted to fit within a magazine’s guidelines.

, Don’t let a sloppy typo cause your submission to be tossed aside.

, Some periodicals will accept submissions through agents only. Search online for websites that list literary agents. Narrow your search for agents that specialize in fiction and short stories.

, This isn’t counterproductive; some contests reward winners with new computers; it’s not cash, but it’s also not money out of your pocket when you have to replace your aging laptop.

, Aim to submit at least 3 articles every week. Set aside at least 1 hour every day to research new markets. but reserve some time every day to work on your pet writing project.

This is your race and your creation, so you have complete control - maybe add on a tail or extra arms if that is what you want. There are no limits to what you could create!


Choose a theme: Is your race an elegant, peaceful race, or are they brutal monsters?;
, This doesn't have to be religious beliefs. Do they have free or strict gender roles? Do they believe their rulers are the descendant of some divine being? The things they believe in will greatly shape the mentality of the race. There's no such thing as an entire race being all evil or all good. You can however make it so that another species believes they are all evil because of certain events in the past which created this stereotype.

, Are they exceptional fighters? Can they use certain types of magic? Are they always bad tempered, etc.? How can they be killed? This is essential to identify, especially if your race will be at war with another race at any point in your story.

, Does your race have any close relatives? Was there interbreeding that caused a mixture of races? Is one race descended from another?

, How did they come to be as they are? Were there any defining aspects of their history that have shaped the way they are now?


Build a culture for your race. How did they make their weapons? What do their homes look like? What did they do for entertainment?

, Do they all live in one specific place, or do they live all around your world? If there is one place where your race lives, it can help if you draw a map of the race's territory.


Have they been here for ages, or did they migrate?

, Don't be afraid to slightly change a race that has already been thought up and give it a slightly different name, just make sure to make it yours. For example, an elf could be a desert elf or a low elf. If you have created a completely new and different race and can't think of a name for it, consider using a foreign word that translates to a trait in your race. Many names for races have been chosen in this way.

, This can help to give a clear physical idea of what you're working with. If drawing isn't your forte, another option can be to write out a physical assessment on your new race to help give an overall description.

, It isn't as easy as you may think. Every book starts with an idea. Something that works is imagining a really good beginning, asking questions about it, and sort of working out a plot line to go along with it.

, Write out a good beginning. Choose select parts in the plot to lay out in detail. Have fun! This is meant for you to be interested in.

, Your plot line may change as you get deeper into the story. New characters may appear, and alter the plot. This makes the book more exciting. Listen to music as you write, but make sure it's set to the mood of the book. No Solid Gold Oldies in the toughest, most suspenseful scenes.

, You are sending a message to your readers by what your characters do and say. Make sure that your main character has a theme and a purpose. It's good to surprise your readers, but don't keep releasing a steady flow of hidden secrets about your main character. Especially if you're writing first-person, make sure that the readers can relate to the person whose mind they are sharing.

, This can be hard. If you leave off at a loose end and start on another completely different story, chances are you will never return. A chained habit of leaving off like this is the worst pitfall. If you absolutely cannot let go of an idea, see if it will work well in the story you are writing.

, A horrible disease! Relax. Don't lose interest in your book. Just turn on some music. Imagine scenes from your book like you're creating a movie preview or music video. Try to bring up something new to get your readers' interest re-awakened. It will re-awaken yours, too!

, Don't get stressed. When your book is finished, send it to a publisher. Try to get involved, but don't get in it for the money. You're the author; you want it out there because it's YOURS and YOU made it. Take pride in your work! Let a close friend read the manuscript. Then get it out for the world to see.

Find a good conflict.,
Don't kill off any main characters yet.,
Bring your character to life.",How to Make a Superhero," Some characters have ""nuclear"" powers, which means that they've come in contact with some kind of substance that has given them super-human powers. This was especially popular during the 1940s in the ""Golden Age"" of comics, when nuclear technology was on the rise.


Daredevil, Spiderman, Hulk, Flash, and Dr. Manhattan are good examples of these kinds of powers.;
, Some characters have ""alien"" powers. Here, objects or abilities have been given to your hero from other worlds. These stories and powers tend to be expansive and intergalactic, giving your hero the ability to fly between worlds and do things that break all the rules of being a human. Sometimes these heroes will even look like aliens, or be transformed in some way.


Superman, Silver Surfer, and Green Lantern are examples of this kind of hero.

, Some superhero characters have superpowers that arose from other ""natural"" circumstances which resulted in powers that are beyond those of regular humans. Genetic manipulation, evolution, and other factors might play into these kinds of powers. Magic might also be an important part of these abilities.


All of the X-Men, Captain America, John Constantine (Hellblazer), and Aquaman are good examples of this kind of character, who gained or learned their powers biologically.

, In some comic books, the heroes might not have any superpowers at all. Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Batman are characters with no actual superpowers, other than their smarts and sweet gear. While these characters are often independently wealthy enough to pay for all the sweet armor and gadgets they use, it adds a unique humanity to the characters.

, Most of the traditional superpowers have all been divided up already. Start thinking of unique, creative worlds in which strange things might be considered superpowers. Who says your Superhero's power can't be that they have a key for an arm and live in a world that is a hallway of locked doors? In general, new superheroes are rarely guys who fly around with capes and have a name that ends in ""man.""

, All superheroes come from somewhere. The background story of superheroes gives us a lot of information about those heroes. Who would Superman be without the destruction of Krypton? Who would Batman be without the death of his rich parents?


Where does your hero come from?
Who were your hero's parents?
How did your hero gain powers?
What does your hero do for a living?
What was your character scared of as a child?
Who are your character's friends?
What does your character want?

, Now comes the fun part. A superhero's look and uniform are the thing that will set him apart from all the other heroes. Superheroes have to look cool, and ready to do battle with evil. Think of a few colors and specific clothing items that will mark your character.


Let the uniform match the abilities. If your superhero has Superman-like abilities, they probably won't need much in the way of protective gear or fancy gadgets.
Many characters wear masks to help protect their secret identity. In general, capes are Golden/Silver age traits for a hero, but it's still possible to get away with one.
Come up with a symbol. What mark or badge will your character have to let people recognize them instantly? Think of Superman's ""S"" and the symbol on Green Lantern's ring.
Some comic book heroes don't always have full uniforms, just little things that help you identify them. Think of Wolverine's hair and sideburns.

, Just as important to the story of a good superhero is their alter-ego, or secret identity. A superhero is cool, but the alter-ego is where your superhero comes to life. What does your hero do when they're not swooping in to save the day? Who are they as real people? That's where great characters are made.Good superheroes need to struggle. Clark Kent is a perfect alter-ego for Superman, because he can't do anything right. And the Kryptonian named Kal-El would probably struggle to get everything right on his new Earth home.
In some cases, your hero's secret identity might come from the origin story. Maybe your character is a trash collector who gets superpowers after discovering some radioactive waste in the garbage. His secret identity might be his original job, collecting garbage., Superheroes aren't all good. Good heroes and good stories contain tension, which you can only get if your hero has something to struggle against. Character flaws are an essential part of any good character, superheroes included.


What does your character want?
What keeps your character from getting what they want?
What is your superhero afraid of?
What makes your superhero angry?
What is your superheroes weakness?

, Now that you've got a series of good traits, abilities, and flaws built up for your character, it's time to pick an iconic name. Superheroes should have memorable names that will make for good titles for comic books. Pick one that matches your character's backstory and powers.Not all superheroes need to have names that end with ""man."" John Constantine, Swamp Thing, and Wolverine are all great examples of superheroes that have different sorts of names.

, Superman needs Metropolis. Tank Girl needs the post-apocalyptic version of Australia that she rides around in. In what world does your Superhero live? What are the dangers and the threats that this world poses to your hero? To regular people? Good stories come from the place your hero lives.


What are the problems in your world? Your nuclear garbage collector might be right at home in Brooklyn. But, the might the story be more interesting if he's picking up garbage on Mars Outpost 7, where food and water are in short supply, gangs run the streets, and trash is plentiful. Get creative.

, Who does your superhero have to fight against? A group of enemies? Or a single, arch-nemesis who plans evil in your hero's town? From the Joker to Doctor Octopus to Magneto, good villains are just as important to a comic book story as a superhero.


Think of opposites. If your superhero is a nuclear-powered garbage collector, maybe his arch-nemesis would be the evil surgeon, who lives in an incredibly sterile lab and never goes outside. But he plans crimes from inside the secret laboratory.
Enemies don't necessarily have to be people. Every Batman doesn't necessarily need a specific Joker to do battle with.

, Superhero stories need more than just heroes and villains. There need to be some regular people in the middle of the action, to help give the story some stakes. Commissioner Gordon, Pa Kent, April O'Neil, and Uncle Ben are all examples of great characters who motivate and influence superhero characters in comics.


Think about a love interest for your superhero. Will your hero be able to share his secret identity with his love? Will his love get in the middle of the conflict? There's all kinds of places you can go with a superhero lover.

, What brings your superhero and his arch-nemesis together? What happens to cause drama and tension in your world? Depending on how you've answered all of the following prompts, you can do any number of different things to find a conflict for telling a good superhero story.


What must your hero do, specifically, to stop the evil from happening? What's within your garbage collector's power to keep the evil surgeon from taking over Mars Outpost 7?
Think about what your hero's arch-nemesis wants. What makes them evil? Lex Luthor, one of Superman's big enemies, was a greedy business man always on the lookout for ways to earn a buck. The Joker finds humor in crime and violence, where Batman seeks to defend those who have injustice done to them.

, One of the great things about coming up with comic book-style superheroes is that you don't have to ""end"" the stories. Keep them going into the future. Comic books are serialized, which means they just keep going and going, into the future, for as long as you want. Batman stories have been told since the 40s.


Think of ways to add more layers to your superhero stories, like an onion, instead of just starting them and ending them.

, Superheroes make great character for comic books, movie scripts, and even fan-fiction short stories. If you want to bring your character to life outside of your imagination, start writing down your stories so other people can experience your hero in action.

Design a character, not just ""a lesbian"" or ""a trans boy."",
Read from the community you wish to represent.,
Carefully consider your character's development arc.,
Map out your character's strengths.,
Remember the diversity of people under the LGBTQIA umbrella.",How to Make a Fictional LGBT Character1," Before deciding on your character's sexuality, identity, and relationship status, you'll need to decide on the basics of your character. What's their name and how old are they? What is their appearance? What's their role in the story? Keep in mind that your character defines their sexual orientation—the sexual orientation doesn't define them.


Your character should have a personality that is just as nuanced as the personalities of the straight and cis characters.;
, What are their lives like? What are their struggles, their goals, the things they are grateful for? Which characters do they say are done well, and why? Which stereotypes do they hate? What advice do they have for you? If you take time to listen to the community, you will understand them better.


Try sending out a message asking for advice on social media. You may get some great tips!

, What lesson do they learn? What is their major flaw, and how do they overcome it (if at all)? If they are the main character, facing this problem head on will mark the climax of the story. This may or may not be related to their gender identity. For example:


Lane suffered bullying in childhood, and their dad died in a traumatic car accident. They are afraid to open up to anyone. With the help of their boyfriend, they begin sharing more. The climax is when they finally agree to sing karaoke at a party, only to forget the lyrics. Lane learns that failure is okay, and people can be more forgiving than they know.
Dijon lives life according to social norms, working hard and studying medicine like his mom wants. He slowly learns to listen to his own desires, and accepting himself as asexual is part of this. The climax is when he announces to his mother that he is going to the state university to study engineering, not med school, because this is what he wants.
Bayta is trans and bisexual, but this isn't very important to the story. Her character arc is about accepting herself as Autistic and learning to ask for help.

, What are they good at? What positive contributions will they make to the plot? How do they help others? Give your character some real strong points, and readers will be reminded that LGBT+ people are talented and worth having around.

, Everyone is unique, and different people will have different experiences. Tailor your character's past and present to the demands of their story and their personality. There are thousands of ways to be bisexual or transgender or gay, and none of them are bad or wrong.

Now go out there write the story and have fun killing a loved character.",How to Kill off a Hero or Other Character," It sounds simple, but there can be multiple heroes. Maybe you want to kill off the secondary character, or kill the villain but then have the hero die unexpectedly. Multiple deaths can add unpredictability, all though don't over do it. Also, a secondary character death can add just as much emotion without completely uprooting the plot - it could create grief and stress for the hero or major characters. However, readers can empathize with the hero during a secondary character death, but they do some grieving themselves when a hero dies. Even a mystery death, where your hero disappears. You don't want to kill a character that nobody likes. You want to invoke emotion, and that's easier to do when your readers like the character that dies, it's the sad truth. However, killing off a major plot contribution (like a villain) may result in your heroes' success, goal, and could, possibly, end the story, so be careful with your choice.;
, Do you want the scene(s) to be humorous? Tragic? Heartbreaking? Surprising? Heroic? Romantic? Scary? You'll need to take this into account when you write the scene so that the voice and tone of the novel matches what you want the scene to be. Remember that you have to think of the effect it will have not only on the reader, the other characters, but also on the novel. It would be pointless to kill the main character's sister if they only ever spoke once, and had no effect on the current situation.

, Do they sacrifice themselves for the greater good or for a friend or lover? Does a side-kick die and save the hero? Are they dying of a terminal illness and commit suicide? Do they just commit suicide because of a mental illness? Does the villain callously murder them? Are they killed by accident, or by mistake? Are they going insane? Are they 'infected' and another mercy-kills them? Do they give up and die quietly, or fight to the end? Does the hero know that they are risking their lives? Are they in a dangerous situation to begin with, or does the death come out of nowhere? Will someone come back to life? This can also affect how readers will perceive the death scene (ie. a suicide would be sad, but a vicious murder could make the readers angry at the killer). Again, remember the effect you want, and where the death will lead your novel. But keep in mind it should make sense to the plot, also, don't make your character die in a way that is not like them. If a character is very emotionally stable, suicide is a bad option.

, Start with a relatively ordinary setting, explain what happens, build dramatically, and boom! That person dies. Add an outline of the aftermath and take note if any other plot developments bloom.

, The death of a character changes the plot throughout the rest of the book and it mixes it up. It's great for the thrill factor, but killing off a character might make it more difficult to write so make sure you are certain before you kill off the character. Also make sure you don't need that character in any of the future scenes.

, Don't make the imminent death obvious, but you might want to drop some clues.

, You can really play off of the readers' emotions, specifically if you're going for raw emotions such as grief and tragedy. Write about all of the characters' reactions, even the minor ones. You can add a lot of characterization. Remember you don't have to have each character react massively straight away. Perhaps one of the characters seem not to be effected by the persons death but later on has a break down.You could also change a way in their behavior and schedule.

, Don't have a character say something like, ""Well, I guess the moral is that we should be more careful with Kryptonite next time."" One way this can be done is with the use of symbolism-- just don't make it blatantly obvious!

, Do they recover at all? Do other deaths result from this one - suicide, or a villain taking advantage of the shocked community? Maybe a huge other plot development will occur - Was the sacrifice for nothing? Could the death have been avoided? Is the death anyone's fault? Do they feel guilty? This can also just be the opinion of one character.

, If your story is a fantasy, perhaps they are reincarnated, or communicate through their soul, or even come back to life as a mythological being. Maybe someone travels back in time to prevent it. Perhaps it was all a mistake and they weren't really dead! (Be careful with that one, it can become cliched, and can be very over-written). Sometimes its better not to overuse these because it can make the readers feel cheated. Another thing to consider is, if you plan on bringing someone back into the story from the dead, is that characters death truly needed? While the death of a character has great effect, an un-needed death could actually ruin the novel.

, Happy Writing!

Understand sexuality.,
Decide on your character's sexuality.",How to Make a Fictional LGBT Character2," Before writing a character who has a different sexual orientation than you do, make sure you have an understanding of sexual orientation and how one sexuality is differentiated by another sexuality. For example, asexuality isn't celibacy - it's lack of sexual attraction, and asexual people can still be in romantic relationships. Do research on the sexuality that you want your character to be.

, Lots of people aren't just ""gay"" or ""straight""—there are many gray areas. Decide on your character's sexual orientation, and if you wish, their romantic orientation—which is who they're romantically attracted to.



Gay or lesbian characters are attracted to only people of their gender identity. Gay men would be attracted to men, and lesbian women would be attracted to women. Keep in mind that the word ""gay"" can be used to describe a girl, but the term ""lesbian"" can't be used for a boy.

Bisexual or pansexual characters are attracted to most people. The difference between bisexual people and pansexual people is that bisexuals are viewed as not being attracted to people outside the gender binary, whereas pansexuals can be.

Asexual characters lack sexual attraction. This doesn't mean that they aren't interested in relationships, sex, or anything with a romantic air to it (i.e., aromantic)- it simply means that they don't find people sexually attractive.
The difference between a character's sexual orientation and their romantic orientation is that a character can be sexually attracted to one gender, but romantically interested in another. For example, a character could be sexually attracted to men, but romantically attracted to both men and women. Likewise, a character can be asexual and still be romantically interested in other characters.

Understand gender identity.,
Decide on your character's gender identity.,
Design your character.,
Understand common misconceptions.,
Consider how they have adapted.",How to Make a Fictional LGBT Character3," Gender identity is often confused with biological sex, but they are not the same thing. Biological sex is what sex organs a person was born with, while gender identity is the gender that a person identifies as and wishes to be addressed by. For example, a person could be assigned female at birth, but have a male gender identity and would be referred to as a boy. In this case, he would be referred to as a transgender boy. A transgender girl would be someone who is assigned male at birth and identifies as female.


There are different gender identities than just cisgender (non-transgender) and transgender. A person can be agender, meaning they identify with no gender; bigender, meaning they identify as two genders simultaneously; genderfluid, meaning that their gender identity shifts between genders, and some people just don't care about gender identity!
Gender identity and sexuality are two different things, and they do not correspond. There are many transgender boys who like boys, and many transgender girls who like girls. Just because someone is transgender doesn't mean they automatically like one gender - sexuality and gender are not related.
Crossdressing does not mean your character is transgender, as crossdressing is just that - crossdressing. If a male character is wearing a skirt, he's crossdressing. If a character assigned male at birth is wearing a skirt because she identifies as female, she's transgender.

, Your character's gender identity may or may not be important to the story. Regardless, if you're writing a character with a different gender identity, you'll need to choose their gender identity.



Cisgender means that a character identifies with the gender that corresponds with their birth sex - in other words, someone who's female identifying as a girl would be cisgender.

Transgender means that a character identifies with a gender that does not correspond with their birth sex. For example, a male-sexed person identifying as female would be a transgender girl, and would be referred to as a girl.
A character that is agender doesn't identify with gender labels. This doesn't mean they're completely androgynous, however!

Bigender isn't limited to just male and female. A character can feel both like a boy and like no gender at the same time. These characters tend to pick their preferred gender pronouns (PGP's), and some choose to be referred to as ""they"".
Someone who is genderfluid can alter between feeling like a boy, a girl, genderless, or bigender. These characters also tend to pick preferred gender pronouns, and can also be referred to as ""they"".

Demi boys and demi girls only partially fit onto the gender binary.
There are also more obscure identities which you can research.

, This is a little bit more tricky than just designing a character who isn't straight, since you will need to decide on your character's gender identity, and therefore, their sex. Their DNA influences their body and shape, as well as their voice and some other characteristics not immediately seen by the reader.


Consider if and when they were able to have access to hormones and other treatments. A twenty-year-old who started estrogen two months ago will look different from a twenty-year-old who transitioned at age five and had puberty blockers.
Without puberty blockers, puberty can be quite traumatic for trans people. Even if they have since gotten hormones and look great, they will probably have many bad memories.

, There are many misconceptions about transgender people that cisgender people come up with. Common ones to be ruled out are:



It's just a phase!: While some people explore around with gender identity in their childhood and teens, just because they're young when determining their gender doesn't mean it's something they'll grow out of or decide isn't them.

Transgender people are just gay!: Transgender people can be gay, but gender identity and sexual orientation don't correlate!

Bigender/Genderfluid/Agender isn't real!: Gender identity is a spectrum, not a binary. There's more to gender than just ""male"" and ""female"".

Don't all trans people have surgery/take hormones?: Many transgender people are not comfortable with having surgery or taking hormones. Even if they are comfortable with it, other factors can make it impossible to have hormones/surgery, such as health problems, financial issues, or unsupportive/unsafe environment.

, Living in a cis-centric world is difficult for a trans person, especially depending on how accepting the environment is. What tricks have they developed to stay safe? How do they cope? What have they faced in the past, and has it impacted their ability to trust others or feel safe? Common issues faced include...


Public restroom safety
Picking ""male"" or ""female"" on documents
Street harassment
Trying to look ""presentable enough"" to avoid discrimination (When? How much? Are they a bad person for doing this?)
Cruel family members
Mental health issues, suicidal thoughts
Discrimination

Recognize the stereotypes that exist.,
Remember the difference between sexuality and gender expression.,
Choose your words with care.,
Make your LGBT+ character a character in their own right.,
Recognize that same-gender couples are, on average, just as sexual as mixed-gender couples are.,
Avoid killing off your LGBT+ character.,
Name the sexuality or gender identity.",How to Make a Fictional LGBT Character4," The LGBT+ community is very diverse, and people who share a sexuality or gender identity could be very different from each other. Watch out for stereotypes, because these can undermine your ability to write a three-dimensional character. Here are some common tropes:Feminine gay man, gay man who only serves to be a girl's sidekick
Masculine lesbian
Promiscuous, sly bisexual/confused bisexual
Frigid or evil asexual
Transgender person who is deceptive or a freak

, Liking men does not make one feminine, and liking women does not make one masculine. Fiction is filled with gay men who love shopping and detest football, and tough lesbians who play rough sports. Recognize the stereotypes and work on making your character original.


Of course, there are some feminine gay men and some masculine lesbians. If you are writing one of these characters, make sure that you are giving them plenty of unique and multilayered traits too, so that they are more than a caricature.

, Some terms have been used in degrading and dehumanizing ways, and can be very hurtful and alienating to LGBT readers.It can also suggest to readers who aren't in the know that it is okay to use these words to describe someone else. Use compassion when selecting words, and be aware of how this affects the message you send to your readers.


Always have the narrative refer to a transgender person as their correct gender (the gender that they want to be referred to as), even if others are misgendering the character.
If you have a character who uses these words, make it clear in the narrative that this character is being hurtful. For example, if somebody calls Laquisha a ""d*ke,"" show how this upsets her, and/or have someone stand up for her.

, Some writers use LGBT+ characters as one-dimensional plot devices, used to further the development of straight and cis characters.


This doesn't mean your LGBT+ character shouldn't teach other characters anything, simply that there should be more to them than only this.

, There is no need to fixate on sex (unless you are writing erotica), nor do you need to avoid showing the characters doing anything more than holding hands.If all the mixed-gender couples are kissing when the bell tolls for New Year's, let the same-gender couple kiss too. They can have the same romantic opportunities.

, Killing gay, bisexual, transgender, etc. characters is an old plot line often meant to show that the character is ""too good for this sinful earth"" and other characters should have treated them better. However, this pattern can send an unfortunate message to LGBT+ teens: that suicide is the most common and sensible option.


If your story absolutely requires killing an LGBT character, make sure that there are other LGBT characters who survive and have bright futures ahead of them.

, Tell readers that Lana is bisexual, not just confused, and Richard is asexual, not broken. Labeling their identity can help readers who share the identity feel validated, and help readers who don't have that identity learn and empathize more. You may even have a reader or two who realizes they have that identity thanks to your story.

Identify the vampire.,
Ward the vampire off.,
Decapitate the vampire.,
Attack it with other objects.,
Spray the vampire with holy water.,
Bring the vampire into sunlight.,
Equip your hero with the appropriate tools.",How to Kill a Vampire1," Your audience needs to know that your character is a vampire. You can state it outright, or, if you want to be more subtle, give clues so your reader (and maybe your characters) can discover the vampire. If you want to build some mystery and suspense (always a good idea with vampires), it is better to show the character is a vampire rather than stating outright.Feel free to ignore certain rules. To make your work stand out, you can ignore or modify certain character traits of the vampire. Unpredictability can be a good thing in fiction. Just make sure you explain these to your audience at some point.If killing the vampire is integral to the story, there must be a way of killing it. If the vampire is the hero, and can't die, then there is little suspense. If the vampire is the villain, then you have given your heroes an impossible task, and the story will only end in failure.;
, Your character may not need to kill the vampire right away, especially if he is the main villain. You will want your hero to be able to keep the vampire away while he looks for what is necessary to kill it. Some of these actions include:Holding holy objects, like a cross or Bible. Vampires are evil creatures, so the generally reject sacred items. Similarly, vampires resist sacred places, so churches and other religious buildings can be safe spaces. These do not have to be exclusively Christian, so symbols from Judaism, Islam, and other faiths can work. It is important to remember that the symbol itself is not as important as the faith of the person using it.
Spreading small grainy items like salt or sand. Traditionally, vampires will obsessively count objects they come across, so something small that you can drop in large amounts can delay your foe. Fine grains like oats or rice will also work.
Similar to fine grains, vampires may also count the knots in a fishing net. Hanging one over doors and windows will buy some time if a vampire tries to enter.
Having certain plants. Vampires resist plants that generally symbolize new life, such as roses, holly, or hawthorn. Other traditions use plants such as buckthorn, juniper logs, blackthorn, or rowan. Your character can have these around the home, or carry them around.

, One good way to kill a vampire (or any other creature) is by cutting off its head. In some genres, the mouth is then stuffed with garlic to prevent the vampire from coming back., There are certain objects, like bullets or wooden stakes, that can be driven into a vampire's heart or chest, that will kill it.Wooden stake. There can be something special about the wood (from a particular tree, or shaped into a holy object like a cross), or it can just be a sharp piece of wood. Some vampire stories in modern day settings use everyday wooden objects like pool cues and coat racks.Like some of the wooden stakes, in many cases there is something special about particular bullets that will kill vampires. They can be silver bullets (as with werewolves), or blessed by a priest to be sacred objects.

, Vampires are evil creatures, and may not react well to sacred objects. Spraying them with sacred water can scald or burn vampires. You'll have to decide if the vampire need to be doused in it, or just a splash will do., In some traditions, vampires need to avoid the daylight, or else they will turn into dust. In other works, vampires move around in broad daylight without any problems.If you decide to make sunlight fatal, remember that most of your action with the vampire will need to take place at night or in dark areas.

, The characters killing the vampire need to be able to accomplish the task, so they need a way to acquire necessary items. If they need holy objects, your characters may need access to a church or priest. If their weapons require a certain type of wood, those trees should grow in your setting.

Discuss your methods with other role-players.,
Bring garlic bulbs.,
Carry a wooden stake.,
Carry holy water.,
Have other vampire hunting tools.",How to Kill a Vampire2," Both the vampire and the vampire-slayer characters should discuss the ""fight"" and ""kill"" scenes in advance to make it appear more realistic, and to ensure that nobody gets hurt.

, One of the most effective ways of killing a vampire (or any creature really) is decapitation. After cutting off the head, you then stuff the mouth full of garlic.Since you won't be cutting anyone's actual head off during role-playing, having the garlic around is a good way to demonstrate that you can kill vampires.

, Driving a wooden stake into a vampire (sometimes, but not always, through its heart) is a traditional method to kill vampires.You can decide if there is something special about the stake you are using, such as if it came from a certain kind of tree, or has been blessed by a priest. Just be careful you don't actually stab the other person.

, For role-playing or fancy dress, simply find a little bottle and pour in some water. Perhaps for added effect, add in a bit of glitter to give it a ""special"" effect. Not all vampires are killed by holy water, merely repelled, so you'll want to know how your vampire player will react., If you are portraying a vampire hunter, or vampire killer, you can carry other objects with you that won't kill a vampire, but can slow it down These include:Holy objects, like a cross or Bible. Vampires are evil creatures, so the generally reject sacred items. These do not have to be exclusively Christian, so symbols from Judaism, Islam, and other faiths can work.

This creates the possibility that your vampire could die when one of these splinters pierces its heart., The explosive won't necessarily kill the vampire, but the flash could produce enough light to cause the vampire to disintegrate., If the vampire doesn't like light, but you are stuck in the dark, you may be able to use technologies that generate powerful lights.An ultraviolet laser can use concentrated UV rays that create glare. Even more useful to the would-be killer, the glare also prevents the victim from seeing the direction of the beam. This means you can attack from any angle.
A flashlight or battery-powered lantern can be effective if the goal is to use brightness. A military-grade flashlight is probably preferred, but you'll have to decide how powerful or concentrated the light will need to be.

, Because the cross is more important for symbolic reasons, an item or setting that looks like a cross (such as the shadow of a windmill in the film ""Brides of Dracula"") can defeat a vampire.

Identify the problem.,
If your problem is that you don't know what should come next, it may help to sit down and write an outline of your story, from beginning to end.,
If you are uninspired or bored with your own book, it could be that you are becoming too accustomed to your book.,
If you are stuck for weeks on one part of the book because it doesn't sound professional enough for you, stop erasing.",How to Finish Writing Your Book," Writer's Block is commonly caused by one of three things. Either you don't know what to write next, you're uninspired, or you aren't satisfied with what you write and end up erasing it.;
, First write a non detailed skeleton including only important parts of each chapter- ex: Chap One: 1)Marsha discovers her husband is having an affair 2)She divorces him & moves into a new apartment. 3)Marsha and Ken meet for first time. Continue this outline until you've outlined your entire book. Next, add a paragraph of detail into each part of the outline. Refer to this outline as you write.

, You know all the twists and turns, so none are exciting to you anymore. This problem can be easily solved. Take a few weeks to a few months away from writing. During this time, do not think of your book - imagine that it doesn't exist. When the time is up, pick up your book and read it again. Everything should seem new and interesting, and you'll be as excited as you were on the first day of writing!

, Do not edit it. Move on to the next part and complete the book. When you are finished, you can go back to these problem parts with a fresh perspective, and you would no longer be wasting time worrying over one part when you've got half a book to write.

Put yourself in your character’s shoes.,
Decide what drives your characters.,
Outline your plot.,

Consult a thesaurus.,
Use adverbs as well as adjectives.,
Try a vocabulary list.,
Show, don’t tell.,
Use your characters’ actions to illuminate their emotions.,
Avoid using the passive voice.,
Integrate body language.",How to Describe and Express Feeling in a Story," This simple thought exercise is critical for identifying what your character is feeling, how those feeling might manifest themselves, and how to convey those to other characters in your work and to the reader.


Empathy - the ability to understand another’s feelings - is the crucial element in putting emotions into words. You need some idea of what your characters are doing, and why, in order to vividly describe them.;
, Knowing (or creating) a personality and story for your characters aids you in expressing their feelings.


Do they seek revenge, or perhaps forgiveness? Are they relentlessly optimistic? This informs your word choices for the narrative of your story.
To that effect, you can develop a backstory or character personality notes. Keep them handy on a separate page or a note card. The level of detail depends on how important the character is for your story. The protagonist will require more detail than a bit character.
Character notes for a hard-bitten detective, for example, might include information like, “Orphaned at a young age, and has a soft spot for children.” “Resists emotional intimacy.” “Suffers, quietly, from PTSD.” “Skilled at hiding his fear while on the job.”, Having at least some idea of how your story will progress and end enables you to attribute the right emotions, at the right times, to your characters.


It isn’t necessary to have every detail identified before you write, but plot twists and major events can have added emotional resonance if you can plan your character’s emotional journey alongside their physical one., How you choose to present your story, generally in the first or third person, will dramatically affect what sort of perspective the reader has, and thereby, what emotions they can plausibly be aware of.


First-person narratives, told by the main character, offer great opportunities for introspection on the narrator, but necessarily limits the reader's knowledge of other characters' thoughts and feelings to what the main character perceives.
“I stared at the suspect, searching for some hint of weakness. I was desperate: I needed a confession, and fast, if I was going to find the missing girl before it was too late.” In this case, the narrator can only guess at what other characters are thinking and feeling.
Third-person narratives offer more flexibility, and the reader can be made aware of as much, or as little, as you want them to know. You can choose if the reader only knows what the main character does, or you can expand it as far as you like. Just be consistent.
“Detective Slade watched the suspect carefully, desperate for something he could exploit to gain a confession. The suspect sat, stone-faced, equally determined to give the police nothing that could be used against him.” In this example of third-person narration, the reader has “limited omniscience” - that is, they are aware to some extent of the thoughts and feelings of more than just the protagonist.
Once you’ve chosen a point of view, develop the feelings and emotional state of the characters, focusing on what the reader will be aware of., This helps you identify both synonyms, to avoid repetition, and antonyms, to provide contrast.


Repeating the same few words can be off-putting for your readers, and more importantly, may not fully express the feelings you want to convey. Having access to a wide variety of vocabulary options gives you the flexibility to tell your story with style. Your character might be “happy,” “cheerful,” “optimistic,” “playful,” “effervescent,” or any number of synonyms.
Antonyms - that is, the opposite of a word - are also useful for describing feeling. Look for ways to use indirect antonyms to expand your vocabulary. For example, the antonym of “happy” is “sad,” while an indirect antonym might be “depressed,” “blue,” or even a colloquialism like “down in the dumps.”Be sure to use a dictionary in conjunction with the thesaurus. You’ll need to make sure the word fits the given meaning and context.

, They provide crucial context and modification for what your character is doing, saying, or thinking.


Adverbs - descriptors that modify verbs, usually ending in “-ly”, provide useful context for what your character is doing.“Jane slammed the door” leaves her motivation unclear. Adding an adverb clarifies things efficiently. “Jane accidentally slammed the door.” , If you’re struggling with where to start, it can help you find a word that’s close to what you want, and you can use a thesaurus to expand from there., Bring your narrative to life by using action, character descriptions, and other context.


Your character’s feelings will be emphasized by the context, rather than being clumsily pointed out. Don’t tell the reader that “Sam was nervous.” Show them that “Sam paced back and forth in the waiting room, pausing only to wipe his brow. He looked up quickly each time the doors open, wondering each time if it would be the doctor with some news.”

, This can be a particularly effective way to demonstrate how a character feels, especially when writing in the first person, where the narrator is not aware of their thoughts.


“Tom was angry” is far less convincing than “Tom clenched his fists and his jaw, and appeared to be struggling to suppress the urge to punch someone.”, Active language better expresses both actions and emotions.


Passive voice constructions, built around “to be” verbs, often do not make the source of an action clear. Sometimes that can be useful, but generally active language makes for better reading. “The ball was kicked.” Who kicked the ball? Use active voice, with adverbs, to convey action and emotion. “Sam savagely kicked the ball.”
“Susan was saddened when her vase was broken” leaves too much ambiguity. Instead, use active verbs. “Megan, in a fit of pique, deliberately pushed the urn off the mantle, smashing it on the floor below. Susan’s heart broke along with it.”, People show their emotions through expression, stance, and many other physical forms, so be sure to include that on the page.


Describe things like facial expressions, perspiration, shaking or twitching, and posture. These often give physical form to emotions that are obvious in visual media, but require careful attention to convey in writing.
For example, you could show disgust with terms like “gag,” “flinched,” “grimaced,” or playfulness with terms like “nudge,” “wink,” or “waggle eyebrows.”"

Include a strict and possibly demented overseer.,
Create your 'Big Brother'.,
Create a clear class division.,
Create tension.,
Throw in a bunch of devout believers in the state.,
Show subtle evidence of lies created by the government, for example, a 'factory' which is apparently used to create clothing has deliveries of books by night which are then burnt, leading to a faint cloud of ash and smoke in the morning.,
Insert some dreary weather or atmosphere.",How to Develop a Dystopian World," Dystopian worlds generally involve a government, regime or individual which restricts its citizen's rights and monitors their lives in what is called a totalitarian state. So, assuming you live in a fairly liberal country, just list all the rights you know you have, for example: A right to an education, a right to travel, freedom of speech etc, and revert them all. For some of the rights, for example, the right to an education, limit it to the upper class or the wealthy. That way there is scope for an interesting character in the lower classes.;
, As with '1984' by George Orwell, there is a mystical figure whom the citizens of Airstrip One (Britain) trust completely. A sort of Supreme Leader, this person will lead your controlling totalitarian government as its one and only head. Make them reminiscent of Stalin, Kim Jong Il, Pol Pot or even Hitler, all of whom lead (or in Kim Jong Il's case, still lead) totalitarian governments. These frankly terrifying figures, when woven into your own Supreme Leader character, will give the reader a chilling sense of familiarity.

, Show the politicians at the top and then the lower classes, to which your protagonist could belong. Give some examples of how the upper class is exempt from some of the hardships of the lower classes. This will show how unfair their society is.

, Maybe start it off with an execution. Add cameras. Lots of them. Show that these people are monitored non stop. An execution, particularly public, would show how the government keeps their people under control. This would kick the story off with making the reader feel uneasy, which is what you want. Make sure the protagonist of the novel has a certain way to act so as not to be thought of as acting 'suspiciously'. Make sure there are police forces/armed forces and lots of them. Drill home that there is a constant danger to this world.

, If there are a lot of people who believe completely in the power and authenticity of the government, it will make it even more risky for your protagonist to stray from the social 'norm'. Make sure there are a few people who your main character is not sure of, whether they are another clone of the state's ideologies or whether they too are straying and breaking the rules. This will increase the tension, suspense and danger.

, Make sure your protagonist can easily associate themselves with the lies, as they are unlikely to go out their way to find lies in such a dangerous world where they are monitored closely. Another example might be that your protagonist has a son/daughter who brings home a book on history, which has only the history of the government in it and lies about its establishment.

, It's always good to make your world a bit more miserable than in real life. Start off with a rainy day or a cloudy day. Make sure you describe the buildings as a bit old, tiles from the roof slipping, the walls damp. Make the lower class's living conditions bad. Exhibit the power of the state through their better living quarters and brighter colors.

Come up with the general setting of the story.,
Create your main characters.,
Create a plot, including the entire route that they will take as they journey through their region.,
Write your story's first draft.

,
Edit, revise, proofread.,
Release your story.",How to Write Pokemon Fanfiction," Decide on which region you want it to take place in.


If you want to create an entirely new region, you may. However, this poses a whole new set of challenges, including creating gym leaders, a new professor, new towns, cities, routes, and notable places, fakemon, etc.;
,


Will they be trainers, coordinators, breeders, gym leaders, something else? Will they be just starting out on a journey or already accomplished trainers? Keep in mind that the trainers do not have to be human. You can write fanfiction about wild Pokémon, too, including Mystery Dungeon Teams.
Be sure to flesh out their traits realistically, human, or Pokémon.

, (Keep in mind that not all Pokémon fanfiction has to be a journey fic. In the Pokémon world, adventure can happen without even leaving the main character's hometown).


Does your plot involve an evil team? (Team Rocket, Team Magma, Team Aqua, Team Galactic?) If you are creating an entire region from scratch, will you be using one of these teams, or creating a new one? Be sure to add a twist to it, as fanfictions involving Teams are common.
If your main character catches any Pokémon, which ones does he/she catch, and where? Be sure to map out any Pokémon that your trainer will catch. Planning ahead is important! You should probably have each Pokémon be caught in different ways- some joining the team voluntarily, some being traded for, some being caught in the normal way, some being caught by accident. Though it might seem fun to have your main character capture a bunch of uber-powerful Pokémon that just happen to be your favorites, this rarely makes a good story. Your trainer should always have a balanced team--but as the fic goes along, your team should get stronger accordingly.

,, Ask for advice from friends.

, Due to copyright issues, you will never be able to officially publish your work. However, you can feel free to put it on any website, preferably one dedicated solely to fanfiction or Pokémon, so that others can read it. Fanfiction.net is a website dedicated to fanfiction.

Make it clear that they respect each other.",How to Lead Up to a Kissing Scene in a Book1," They might flirt a little, blush, and act differently (shy, awkward, gregarious, or however they respond to crushes). They may find themselves grinning or blushing because of something the other character did.;
, Maybe she feels a twinge of sadness when she hears that he won't be at the party, and she isn't quite sure why. Or he's walking in the woods and his thoughts keep drifting to her.

, When they have scenes together, readers will be able to see what makes their relationship work. Show how they interact with each other—being silly, facing crises, working out problems, et cetera. This will build their relationship and make it clearer why a kiss is a good idea.

, In a positive relationship (budding or otherwise), two characters will support each other and treat each other with compassion. Show that they will help each other through the bad times and cheer them on when things go well. Let them be there for each other.


Ryan skips basketball practice to watch Maria in the school spelling bee. He is ecstatic when she wins and Maria realizes how much she matters to him.
Jessica never met LaBron's mother. But when LaBron calls in tears, saying his mom is at the hospital, Jessica drops everything she's doing and drives over as quickly as she can.
When Amy goes missing, Keesha helps search for her. Keesha finds her at her thinking place, listens compassionately to her frustrations, and encourages her to come back home because her parents are worried.

, In a solid relationship, both partners care about the other's feelings, like the other person for who they are, and always get clear consent before kissing. The partners should be equals.


If someone consents to a kiss, they may talk about kissing (""So are you going to kiss me?""), lean in close, smile, bite their lip, and use other nonverbal signals to show they want a kiss. Someone has not consented if they were completely passive (e.g. looking uncertain, not realizing the other person wanted a kiss) or if they were crying or actively resisting.
If this isn't a good relationship, then maybe they don't respect each other. Maybe he acts possessive and controlling, she doesn't respect who he is and wants to change him, or he kisses her without getting clear consent first.

It's pouring out, and Roseann didn't bring her umbrella. David shares his with her. He tells a joke and they laugh.
Javier and Roberto attended the same wedding. Roberto asks Javier to dance. Javier is mesmerized by the lights, the music, the twirling couples, and Roberto's smile.
Lindsay ran off to a hill after their fight. Jake came to apologize for hurting her feelings. She cries, he cries a little too, and she apologizes also. They agree to communicate better.

, Either by accident or on purpose, they end up gazing into each other's eyes. The moment slows down, and you may choose to describe the little details here. One may caress the other, or lovingly notice a feature (looks, smell, touch, etc.). Both characters realize that they want to kiss.


Roseann trips over a curb, and David catches her. Suddenly her face is very close to his. And she isn't about to complain.
The slow dance ends and Javier and Roberto gaze into each other's eyes. Warmth floods through Javier's chest as he sees the tenderness in Roberto's face.
Lindsay places her hands on Jake's shoulders, pushes back his hair, and tells him she loves him.

, One or both characters lean in and their lips meet.


How much detail you use depends on the characters and your audience. A book for preteens probably won't go beyond a ""soft, brushing kiss."" An adult novel may describe exactly what they are doing with their tongues.

, How do they pull away—does the kiss naturally end or are they interrupted? How does each character feel about the kiss? Do they smile, blush, decide to kiss again?


If they are new to kissing, they may be embarrassed or even shyly run away afterwards.
If the nature of their relationship is unclear, they may need to talk about it.

Set the scene around more important details.,
Keep the kiss quick.",How to Lead Up to a Kissing Scene in a Book3," For a brief kiss, the kiss isn't the important part—it's the character interactions, the plot progression, or other details.

Mrs. Rivera is going on a business trip. Mr. Rivera kisses her goodbye before he is left with the kids.

Study some of your favorite fictional stories and their movie adaptations.,

Decide on a good opening.,
Come up with a good ending.,

Give your main character a black moment, when she seems to have lost it all, when the enemy seems sure to win and there's no way to survive the upcoming ultimate battle.

,

Weave in other characters, subplots and story elements.",How to Develop Fiction Plots1," Every story, no matter what it's about or when it was written, is adapted for film in the same way, with specific events that happen at specific times;
, Write that sentence down and keep it where you can always see it.


This 1-sentence description is borrowed from the film industry, where it is called a logline. Knowing the logline will keep you from getting so bogged down in interesting characters and situations that you forget what your story is about.

, The first scene in a movie transports the audience in their imaginations from the theater to the world of the movie. In a book, the opening intrigues readers so they will commit to reading the rest of the story.


Introduce your main character, who will go on the journey, fight the ultimate battle and be changed by the experience.
Show your main character in his daily life, and make sure he is unhappy. If he's happy, there's no reason to go anywhere or do anything, and therefore nothing to write about. Another way to force the main character out of his life and into your story is to destroy his happy life.
Don't spend too much time on the opening. You want only enough to give your reader a good idea of who your main character is before you jerk him out of normal life and into your story. The sooner you do this, the happier your readers will be.

, Filmmakers want the audience to leave the theater misty-eyed and satisfied that whether the main character ultimately triumphed or failed, all is as it should be. In your story, the reader should get to the last line and sigh with that same satisfaction.


Your main character should return to normal life, though not necessarily the life she was living at the start of the story. In many stories the character leaves her old life behind and begins a new one in which she is happier.
The ending, called the denouement (DAY-noo-mahn), is shorter than the opening because you don't have to introduce your characters or your setting. Once the main character survives the ultimate battle, theater audiences start gathering their coats and purses. Readers are no less impatient to see things wrapped up.
As you build on your story, you need to make sure that all subplots are wrapped up in the denouement as well.

, This is the live-or-die moment for your main character, when it seems that there's no way to win unless the he does something that he has not been capable of doing before. In a movie, this is the scene that has the audience on the edge of their seats, worried that the main character might lose everything he cares about or even die.


The ultimate battle doesn't have to be an actual, physical battle against an enemy. It can be any sort of battle, even one that occurs only within the character's own mind as he decides to change his life in order to get what he needs. Keep in mind that this may not be what the character wants.
Give your main character a reason to fight the ultimate battle. It must be very important so he doesn't quit and go back to the life he was leading before the story started. However, it doesn't have to be important to anyone but him.
In this battle, as in everything that comes before it, the main character must be the one who takes the action necessary to succeed or doesn't take action and fails.

,, Then make sure that he doesn't have most of them when the story begins. This includes physical things like weapons, allies and clues, as well as nonphysical things like courage or mercy.

, At the end of each challenge, there will be a period of calm while the main character reacts to the outcome and prepares for the next one.


At first the challenges will be easy, and the main character will win. But at about the midpoint of the story, the main character will start losing. In a movie, this point is easy to find because it's where the audience stops cheering for main character and starts worrying about her.
Study the list you created of the things your main character needs to win the ultimate battle. Have him acquire things or learn things after each challenge so he is missing only the most important one when he gets to the ultimate battle. He must find this last thing within himself just before he's defeated.

, All these must serve the main character on her journey from who she is at the opening of the story to who she is at the end.

If you already have an idea of who you're going to write about, then you can watch episodes about that pony- or, if you're making an OC, you can watch episodes that help you out with certain character traits! If you ever suddenly feel uninterested in your original plan, you don't have to go through with it. After all, there's always room for improvement.;
, You can find them on fimfiction.net, fanfiction.net, or other sites. Just remember to read what you're going to write about or what you think may be a good idea- but don't plagiarize! No one likes it when you copy, but you can ask permission by the author of a fanfiction you like to say that you were inspired by their fanfiction. Most people won't mind.

, If you sit down to write and then suddenly realize you have no idea what you're doing, you might end up feeling discouraged and quit writing your fanfiction before it begins.


If you want to include your shipping pair, do so, but make sure you know the characters well enough to keep them in character when you're writing.
If you want to write about your headcanon, make sure all the kinks are worked out. But make sure you know what you're writing about- or make something up as you go along!
There are no rules in writing, only suggestions. If you are going to come up with your story as you go, make sure you proofread it at the end to make sure that everything makes sense.

, You should think about the character you're writing about. Is it a main character in the show? A background pony? An OC? If it's a main character, you may have to do a little more research within the show if you get stuck on their personality, but the more you postpone actually writing, the less likely it's going to be done. So if you have a plan, stick with it.

, There's always room for improvement, but there's also time to fix it in the end.


If you're writing one chapter at a time on a fanfiction site, then your readers can give you criticism. If someone says something cruel, don't let it discourage you. If someone suggests a way to improve your writing, take it as constructive criticism and let it help you gain some perspective on what you're writing. Never be afraid to accept suggestions!

, Instead, try to focus on descriptions or dialogue to do the exposition for you, but make sure if it's dialogue that it sounds like something two ponies would actually say to each other.


For example, if both ponies know that Nightmare Moon has returned, would they say to each other, ""Hey, Quill, how is it going?"" ""Not good, Storm. We both just saw Nightmare Moon return and trap Princess Celestia in the sun, and it is clear that Twilight Sparkle and her friends can do nothing.""
Also, make sure the dialogue doesn't excessively use the character's names. The characters know who they are, so make sure they use the names in a normal amount.

, At the end of a chapter, you can leave a cliffhanger- or if it's not an adventure story, perhaps a romance, make sure there is still a conflict- perhaps one of characters is too shy to talk to the other because they have a crush and they're shy. Just don't make it a cliche- having the main character's crush suddenly become hopelessly in love with someone else, and they start dating is an example of a love triangle.


If you want to use this sort of story, make sure you do it in an original way. Maybe the character on the wrong end of the love triangle tries to find a way to stop them from being in love with each other and finds a spell to do so. Or maybe the main character finally confesses their love and is met with shock. Then what happens?
MLP might be a little cheesy, but you don't need the climax to be mundane. Even cheesy episodes can be battle related, and as can be your fanfiction. If you don't want it to have a lesson about friendship, it doesn't have to- remember, this is your fanfiction, so do whatever you want to do.

, Endings can be tricky. Make sure you know all loose ends so you can tie them- or keep it a cliffhanger so you can write a second one. Don't feel any pressure to write a sequel if you don't want to, though- sometimes sequels can be hard to do as well.

, If you haven't, then jot down the things you could've done better or you wish you had done and either revise it and find a place for those things, or if the story already feels crowded with what it has, you can just leave those things out and put them in another story.

, If you don't feel comfortable posting your story anywhere, you don't have to. It's all your decision. Some people can just write for themselves or their friends. Maybe you can open your own private blog for your fanfictions that only you and your close friends can read.

, If you do want to post your story, you can post it on any fanfiction site if you haven't already. Be ready to face critics, but know that those who are giving you polite criticism are the ones who care about your story and not the ones who are blatantly rude.

Link up with other fanfic writers.",How to Write a Fanfiction," Fanfiction is always based on an existing work of art. You are essentially making a story that expands or otherwise alters existing fiction. The mediums you might choose from are endless. Fanfics have been written about books, movies, television shows, video games, and just about anything else with a narrative base and a fandom to admire it. You should pick a fictional universe you already feel closely to. Common choices for fanfic are Star Wars, Harry Potter, and a number of anime shows.


The choice of universe you choose to base your own work on will have the largest impact on your story and the way it turns out. Certain universes also favour certain approaches in fanfic. It's important to note however that your choices as a fanfic writer are limitless. You can do anything you want to the source material, even if that means transforming it into something else entirely.;
, Most fanfiction tends to be based on a science-fiction or fantasy-themed universe, like Harry Potter or Star Trek. These are great to base fanfics off of because they offer huge universes with an endless amount of storytelling potential. Look online and read up everything you can about the given universe. Even if you're planning on breaking free of the established canon with your fanfic, it helps a lot to know the rules before you break them.

, The best ideas you'll get for your work will be inspired by the source material itself. With that said, it still helps to see what other fans have done with the same ideas. Using a website like Fanfiction.net, take a look through some fanfiction that matches your on source material.Read some stories people have written. Most importantly, get a grasp of the ways in which people use and adapt the source.


In looking for fanfiction to read, you may get the looming impression that a lot of fanfiction lacks for quality. Being part of the fanfic community means acknowledging that not everyone is at the same level of skill. Most fanfiction is amateurish, and a lot of it frankly isn't worth reading. It takes patience to find the great stuff.

, Because fanfiction is so diverse and open-ended, it helps to make some rules up for yourself before you go into writing it. Is your story going to be big or small? While some fanfictions can become as long as books, the majority tend to be fairly short. However, there is a lot of debate amongst the community as to how long a perfect fanfic would be.Certain lengths and styles fit topics better than others. In the end, your length will be decided in the actual writing process, but it's a good idea to keep a prospective scope in mind before you put the pieces together.


The shortest fanfics are called ""drabbles"".These are usually between 50-100 words long. It is surprisingly challenging to tell a story in such a small space, so it may be a good place to start if you want to test your skills without the time investment.
So-called ""fluff"" pieces are short and light-hearted. They tend to be less than 1000 words and deal with a mundane aspect of a character's life.
More involved fiction can be hundreds of thousands of words long. These tend to be the fanfics that people give most attention to, assuming they're fuelled by a plot that justifies the length.
Fanfics don't need to be conventionally narrative or prose either. You can write your fanfic as poetry, or write up a tableau of a character's mental state during a given scene.

, All fanfic is based on speculation. Whether you decide to write a sequel for the work or an alternative history, everything is based on that first ""what if"" question. What if a certain character died (or didn't die) at a certain point in the story? What do you think happens after the credits roll in a movie. These are the sort of questions you should be asking yourself in the early stages of planning a fanfic.


Explore the source material more if you are having a hard time finding a creative starting point. Failing that, look into more fanfic. It can be inspiring to see where other people have gone with it.
Some writers even write themselves into a fanfic, where they interact with the characters themselves. A character meant as a stand-in for the writer is known as an ""avatar""., Crossover fanfiction refers to a genre of fanfic that combines characters from different fictional universes together. Like chemistry, the possibilities become virtually endless when you decide to mix two different things together. There tends to be a lot of very bad crossover fanfiction around, in large part due to the fact that it takes far more tact to harness multiple universes at once. However, they offer a lot of amazing opportunities to a prospective writer.An example for one crossover might be putting the characters from Star Wars in the Star Trek or Mass Effect universes.
It is recommended you try your hand at a crossover fanfic if you're torn between writing about two or more different universes for your next fanfic.

, Because fanfictions are incredibly diverse, it's a good idea to figure out where you will stand relative to the rest of it. Some fanfiction will run amok with the source material to the point where it has no resemblance to the original. Others will try to create a true-to-form expansion of the original. Generally speaking, no matter where you go with it, the strongest fanfics at least retain the spirit of the source original.It's a good idea to consider the concept of ""canonicity"". Put simply, canon states whether something 'is or isn't' in a fictional universe. Portraying Star Wars' Han Solo as a swashbuckling rogue may be true to canon for example, but writing that he is a fan of the 90's sitcom Friends would certainly not be canon.

, A proper outline can mean all the difference when it comes to writing a fanfic. While you may brush an outline as too ""work like"" for something that's ultimately supposed to be fun, knowing where you want to go with your writing can help minimize writer's block and make a more fluid product in the end.Many pieces of fiction use a similar dramatic arc. It may be broken down as such:


The beginning. A beginning should set up the setting reasonably well, as well as establish the motivations and stakes of your central characters.
Opening conflict. Something will often happens that sets a hero on his quest. This often (but not always) is the doing of the antagonist. The rest of the story will involve the protagonist trying to set things right again.
The story's middle. The middle of a story may be seen as the meat of a character's quest. This is where the story's world is fleshed out, character relationships are kindled and strengthened, and the stakes are gradually raised.
The low point. Before the story's resolution, there is usually a point where the character is at his most dire moment, where everything seems lost. You can probably think of many films that match this trope.
The resolution. A climax wherein the protagonist triumphs. It usually comes shortly after the hero's lowest point, and takes the momentum to the very end. There is occasionally a denouement (falling action) afterwards where it shows the aftermath of the final conflict.

, With an outline now in place, you'll have a visual reference with which to see how well your plot actually works. Before you sit down to writing, it's a good idea to browse over the material you already have and see if you can trim (or expand) anything. Originality tends to come through in the editing process, where you ca cut out the things that don't match your own vision. Keep in mind that a plot is arguably the most important thing casual fiction has going for it. Even if your writing skills themselves aren't the sharpest, you can still get a reader's attention if you're telling a great story.

, Assume from the start that whoever's reading your fanfic is going to have as much of a knowledge of the source material as you do. Giving them information or description at the start is not going to pull a reader in. Instead, you need to give action that's going to get them interested in reading more.In the case of fanfiction, description is helpful, but there's a tendency to overdo it.Keep your descriptive writing compact and effective.

, If you ever run into writer's block or find your progress slowing down, it does a lot to return to your source material and enjoy it again. While you should be referring to the original if you're trying to stay true to canon, you should still be looking to your source material in the case of major revisions. Good fanfic is fuelled by a love of the source every bit as much as natural creative talent, so making a habit of returning to enjoy the original work is a healthy habit to start.


At different stages of your own writing process, you can get a better grasp of how your work matches (or snubs!) the tone of the original by returning to it. Given the thought you'll have been putting into writing your own fanfic, it's quite likely you'll have a more discerning eye for the source material.

, While settings and story can be changed with more liberty, readers are not going to like it if you are changing the characters themselves. A character is much more than a visual appearance, and while your creative instinct should have the final word in all cases, you may as well have been writing a different name where theirs should go if you're making them do something they wouldn't do from the start.Keep in mind that this is different from consciously trying to rework your characters.


One example where radical character changes work is in the case of 'mirror universe' fics. Generally inspired by the Star Trek alternate universe episode, you could write a fanfiction that takes place in a mirror universe, where characters are an evil twin version of their official selves. Adding a beard or goatee to your characters to signify their evilness can be fun, but isn't necessary.

, The creative juices only really get flowing if you're putting yourself into the same project every day. Writing is a sure case of this, as you need to be thinking about what you're writing on a regular basis. Pick a time to write each day, and do your best to match it. It could be during your lunch hour or after work. Making a consistent habit of writing will ensure your story builds up quickly. Before you know it, you'll have a considerable piece of work to call your own.


Many writers find listening to music that fits the tone you're going for is a good idea. For instance, if you're writing a Star Wars fanfic, listening to a John Williams score might put you in the right mindset for it.
Most fanfics are less than 1000 words long, but it is recommended you try to go for something longer. Longer stories give more opportunity to explore characters, themes and settings.

, Editing is a necessary part of any kind of writing. If you want your fanfic to be taken seriously, rest assured you'll have to go through this process as well. Read over what you have and see what you can do to improve it. Remove parts of the work that don't matter, and add what you can if you think something needs clarifying.


Showing your work to a friend early on can help. You can get his feedback before you invest the time in editing it. It is possible he'll be able to tell you specifically which things could use polishing.

, Writing fanfic is going to be a learning experience. It's quite likely you'll gain skill over the course of writing it. However, it's important from a reader's standpoint that the work feel relatively consistent, whether in terms of tone or general writing quality. If you think your work has changed considerably over the course of your fanfic, taking some extra time to edit the earlier parts up to par can make all the difference.

, Fanfiction has an extensive and devoted fanbase. There are a range of communities you can post your material on. Arguably the best-known and recommended of these is FanFiction.net.The website has an exhaustive list of different categories, genres and crossovers your work may fit into. Make an account and find the matching category for your work's source material.


Quotev and Wattpad are alternatives if you're looking to publish your story in additional places.It is recommended to publish your story on multiple sites if you can, as this will maximize your story's exposure.
There are certain websites that specialize in fanfiction from a particular source. If you're looking to read or write fanfic from the Harry Potter universe for example, there is at least one website specifically dedicated to it., As a general rule, fanfiction should not be written with the intent of having it published commercially. Copyright protects unlicensed individuals from taking advantage of a creative property. However, publishers are beginning to warm up to the idea of publishing works of fanfiction.Although your choice of publisher will be limited to the one with the appropriate creative license, getting it accepted by them may actually stand the chance of turning your work into series canon, provided it doesn't conflict with established canon.


For fanfiction writers with commercial aspirations, you can remove any trademarked names and ideas in your story and replace them with original content. Some bestselling 'original' fiction, like E.L James' Fifty Shades of Grey and Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga, began as works of fanfiction.
If the book you're writing fanfiction for is common domain, it may be published without any name changes as long as your work is only based on the original works that are common domain.

, If you're starting to get serious about your creation you can do no better than to talk to other fanfiction aficionados. Sites like FanFiction are perfect for it. Not only will they be able to give you helpful tips and advice on how to improve your craft, they'll also probably help promote your work if they like it enough.As a general rule, if you offer feedback to someone's work, the chances are high you will receive feedback in return.


It should go without saying that you'll receive the most helpful feedback from writers that are fans of the same source material you are using.

Also make sure the time lines match.;

Limit your summary to one paragraph at most.,
Give a preview if you have the space, such as a brief quote from your story.",How to Write a Fanfiction Summary," Once your story is complete, read it again and try to determine your main theme. Any major pairings, battles or dilemmas should be included in the summary if possible.;
, If someone reads a summary with several misspellings or incorrect grammar, they will assume that the fan fiction is also typed in a similar way and not even bother to check out the story. Therefore you should keep it to proper English. Make sure you do not type in all caps.

, That way your readers won't get any nasty surprises. It is much better to use ten characters in a brief warning than to get a flame the next day. If you cannot list a warning in the summary, you should list it in the first chapter. There is no excuse for posting triggering material without warning. Warnings include ""AU"" (meaning ""alternate universe""), ""Abuse"", and things of that nature.

, If you've ever turned a book over, it only has about half a page of a summary. Remember that the average book is usually much longer and deeper than the average fan fiction. Therefore, the summary for a fanfiction should be shorter than that of a book. An average is about 150 to 277 characters. Some websites, such as Fanfiction.net, will not let you go over that amount of characters.

, Often people will want to read it more if they actually see a bit of your writing! You may also have a quote that sums up the whole story well. If you do, use it, as such quotes can make great summaries.

People, animals, backgrounds, and props are excellent subjects to begin with. By familiarizing yourself with the shape and structure of general items, you'll find it easier to draw your comic strips, especially since you'll be making less mistakes.

, Choose catchy names for them. Experiment with all types of characters, not just ordinary people. Try super-humans, aliens, or inanimate objects coming to life. Additionally, animals make excellent companions because they can mimic or enlarge certain characteristics that you want the main character to portray. For example, you could have an owl with a large head for a brainy girl, a dog with a frown for a grouchy man, or a hyena with a cheesy smile for someone who always sees the funny side of life.


Practice drawing your characters. Play around with different body positions and facial features. By establishing their basic structures and main faces, you'll be able to draw them with more confidence.
Dip deep into your character. After selecting their name and personality, fill up their skeleton with extra details. While you may not reveal all of their quirks to your audience, their personal details will help them feel more real to you. This will help you connect to them, and you'll be able to bring them to life in your comics

, Once you establish a basic plot, write down the main story with additional details. Scribbling down your characters' dialogue will also be useful. Also, adapt your jokes for the age group that you intend this comic for. For example, complicated jokes will be more appropriate for teenagers or adults rather than young children.

, Determine its structure, as well as the size of the boxes that will be containing the characters and their story. Use stick figures or quick drawings to figure out the basic skeleton of your comic. Do not worry about doing your best, as this is a rough draft.

, Be sure it blends with the subject of your comic. Avoid choosing popular or dull names; otherwise, people will be reluctant to read your work. If you have trouble thinking of one, surf the Internet for suggestions or read other people's titles for inspiration.

, A ""good copy"" is the real version of your comic where the details and colors are completed. This step should be finished once you have established a basic structure of your comic. Sketch out the characters and their surroundings, being sure to add detail to your drawings. Once you are satisfied with the drawings, go over them with black ink for a professional look. To color the comic, you can either scan it into the computer and digitally color it. Otherwise, you can use special color pencils or markers.

, Ask them to read it and give you a critique. This will help you to gauge how funny and successful your comic is, which will guide your future comic-making.

, Continue practicing and creating new comics. You may consider publishing your works in the future.

",How to Write a Believable Pregnancy Fanfiction," It's a good idea to make a list of all possible pairings that could result in pregnancy before you pick which one(s) you're going to use. Make sure the two characters are compatible mates and not just two characters that you think who have cute children. If your chosen fandom lacks compatible males or females, you may need to add an OC.


It's okay for more than one character to be pregnant.
For plot twists, try out ""pregnancy confusion"". Perhaps pregnancy tests were mixed up, and some girls think they're pregnant when they are actually not, and the girls who actually pregnant are wondering what's happening. Maybe one girl is faking because she wants her boyfriend to not dump her (but handle this scenario with caution, as this is considered abuse in real life).;
, How will the mother feel when she finds out? How will the father feel? Does she even know who the father is? Will being pregnant keep her from doing her job? How will this affect the lives of others? You may want to make a chart of all possible effects of her pregnancy.

, In many fanfictions, the girl wakes up one day and suddenly she's pregnant. Any fanfiction written like this makes it sound like the author never passed health class (if you haven't studied this in health class, then you probably are too young to write one of these). There are typically four ways for your character to get pregnant:


She's in a committed relationship and they have been trying for a while.
She had a one night stand, and/or her birth control failed.
She has a disease or condition that caused her to have a low fertility rate and didn't see birth control as being necessary.
She was raped. However, if your character was impregnated by rape, put a warning at the beginning of the fanfiction that your story contains rape or rape mentions.
In other fanfictions, the character can get pregnant through magical means. Make sure this makes sense for the story, though - a character getting pregnant in Harry Potter through magical means is more realistic than in Warriors, for example.

, Does she take a pregnancy test? Does her doctor tell her? Does she miss her period? Is she wounded in battle and the medics find out while using their equipment to check her wounds?


The ""morning sickness"" method (where the pregnant character throws up in the morning and then ponders over the cause of it) is an ""easy out"" for many, but in real life, not all pregnant people experience morning sickness. This tactic in stories is also extremely overused and gives away your character's pregnancy for many readers. If you want the pregnancy to be a surprise to the story, avoid the ""morning sickness"" giveaway.

, Chances are, if you're writing a pregnancy fanfiction, you have never given birth, so it's important to put in as much research into this, as you would a school project. Research the basics of pregnancy, the effects of pregnancy on the body and mind, possible complications (if you want to write a complication), and how one needs to care for their pregnancy to keep the baby healthy.


Research the effects of pregnancy after the parent has given birth, too. Nobody loses all their baby weight right when they give birth, and if you want your fanfiction to be accurate, you'll need to learn about what people would do to care for babies after birth in that time period, too.
Be aware that some descriptions of pregnancy and childbirth can be quite disgusting. Prepare yourself!

,


Is she ready for a baby?
How does pregnancy affect her, aside from just the baby bump? (Morning sickness? Hormones? Strange food cravings?)
What does she look like in all three trimesters?
Does she have any trouble giving birth?

, This will be especially important if you intend to write sequels where the child is older. Decide on the basics of the child - what do they look like? What's their assigned sex? Do they have any problems during the birth?


Make sure that the child resembles the parents, but is not a 50/50 mixture of their traits. Genetics are complex; two people with brown hair can have a blonde child, and a family of tall people can produce a short child.
Similarly, don't base the child's personality off of a mixture of the parents'. It's true that many traits can be passed from parent to child, but make sure you're giving the child plenty of qualities that are unique to the child.
If you're dealing with characters who have powers, you could go in a lot of directions. Maybe the child inherits a parent's powers, only weaker. Or because they're half human, the powers don't show up at all.
If your character is half-human or otherwise multiple species, how will they take on traits of either species?

, Many aspiring fanfiction writers try to make their story different from other pregnancy fanfictions out there. Be wary not to make any of these scenarios turn into a pitfall of your story.

Take care when writing a ""male pregnancy"" plotline. Usually, male pregnancy stories involve a cisgender man getting pregnant and they have no clue how. However, this can disappoint a lot of readers, since it's considered lazy writing. Give the character a reason for their pregnancy (such as alien abduction) and an explanation as to how they've gotten pregnant (a rare genetic mutation).

Not all men are cisgender, and a transgender man could actually get pregnant if he hasn't undergone surgery to remove his female reproductive system. However, if you choose to write a transgender character for a male pregnancy story, be very cautious to research transgender identity so you don't portray transgender people inaccurately.
Do not make an intersex character for the sake of a male pregnancy, as this is not only inaccurate, but can be offensive - especially if you use insensitive terms to refer to intersex people.



Be sensitive with disability and birth defects. It can seem like a good way to give the story a plot twist, especially in future sequels, but if you write it poorly, you may upset readers - whether it's because of the accuracy issues or because they're disabled themselves.
Dramatic birth scenes may intrigue readers, but they can also be written terribly and disappoint readers. Don't try and make the scene too interesting, or it'll fall flat on its face. Very few birth stories involve ten complications at once.

You could then base your comic on this event, using you and your best friend as characters in your comic.;
, You may be inspired to create a comic strip to address a current event or issue you feel passionate about, such as abortion rights or raising the wage gap for women. Look through your local newspaper or read the national news and use your comic strip to address a current issue that you feel you can address in a creative way.You may also have personal experience with a current event or issue that you want to use as the set up for your comic. Perhaps you have personal experience with abortion or are a refugee and want to address political issues around refugee status through your comic. Tapping into your personal take on a political or social issue can make the comic feel more intimate and engaging.

, This could be an existing comic book character, like Superman or Wonder Woman, that you then use as a model for your own version of a hero. Or, you may be inspired by a character on your favorite television show or in your favorite movie. Riff off existing characters to create your own comic strip idea and characters, adjusting or improving on the existing ones.You may notice that there are certain characters or concepts missing from comics, such as female superheroes that are of color, or characters who are queer. You could then use an existing comic character and adjust the character so it better represents a certain group that is missing from mainstream comics.

, If you are still stumped for ideas, you may want to review several examples of comic strips. Examples include:


“Zorphbert and Fred”, a kid friendly comic about two aliens who disguise themselves as dogs.“JL8”, which focuses on Superman, Batman and other popular super heroes when they are children going to elementary school.“Calvin and Hobbes”, a popular adult comic about a young boy and his friend, a talkative tiger.“Cyanide and Happiness”, another popular comic for adults that explores current events and age old issues with a dark sense of humor., A comic strip is typically broken into squares, or panels. The characters and setting are then drawn in the panels. You will need to have at least one panel to create your comic, but there is no limit to how many panels you can include.


Some comic strips, like the popular adult comic “Bizarro”, use only one panel to tell a story or create a joke. You can also create a comic strip that uses one long panel, with lots of characters and text.You may decide to start with a three panel comic, where you have three panels to tell a short story or a joke in your comic strip. Limiting yourself to three panels can help you to get a better sense of your story and keep the joke in the comic short and punchy., If you are trying to create a funny comic strip, you may decide to use the gag-a-day structure. This structure is good for jokes that are self-contained and not part of a larger storyline. Many comics use the gag-a-day structure, as it is short, easy to plan out, and fun to draw. This structure may be ideal if you have never made a comic strip before and would like to try your hand at a self-contained comic.Most gag-a-day comics consist of three panels: the introduction, the build-up, and the punchline. This structure is very similar to the structure of telling a joke, which is why many gag-a-day comics are funny or humorous.
An example gag-a-day structure may be:

Panel 1, Introduction: “My cat has a secret life,” Character says.
Panel 2, Build-up: “I think it consists of searching for catnip, rubbing against my furniture, lounging on every spot in my house…”
Panel 3, Punchline: “And scolding foolish humans who try to guess what she’s up to.”



, If you would like to write a comic strip that is more storyline based, with many characters and a storyline that spans a longer period of time, you may want to use the three act structure. Many storyline comics will have a story arc and characters who develop over many panels or periods of time. Using the three act structure can help you get a better sense of your story as a whole.The three act structure consists of three acts. These acts can occur over multiple panels or even multiple comic strips, which may become part of a comic book.

Act 1 is the “Beginning” section, where information is given to set up the story or provide context.
Act 2 is the “Middle” section, where your characters try to achieve their goals and deal with conflict.
Act 3 is the “End” section, where your character changes or shifts in some way and there is a resolution to the conflict.



, Many comics start with character and expand out to the structure and the premise. Try to describe your characters in detail so you have a good sense of them once you sit down to draw your comic.You may have a good idea for a fun character who is going to be the main focus of the comic or several characters who will interact in the comic. Or, you may use yourself as a character in your comic as well as individuals you know well, or use completely made up characters.
Consider the key attributes and traits of your characters. Are your characters all the same age, gender, or color? Maybe one character is a grumpy old man or a beautiful witch. Maybe you have two characters that appear the same physically but have different perspectives on a subject.
Write down physical details of your characters, from their hair color to eye color to the clothes they are wearing in the comic. You should also write down personality traits of your character, describing your characters as happy, upset, angry, confused, or argumentative.
It may also help to sketch out your main characters on a piece of paper. Try to be detailed in your sketches and include the key attributes of your characters in the sketches.

, Maybe your main character can read minds or glows in the dark. Perhaps your character has the gift of infinite wisdom or is immortal. Imbuing your characters with unique features will help them stand out and make them interesting.You may decide to have one character who is “normal” or has no special abilities and one character who has a cool, special ability. You could then have these two characters bounce off each other and explore their differences or use their differences as the punchline of a gag in your comic.

, Some comics have elaborate and detailed settings, especially superhero characters. But some comics are more character focused and do not pay much attention to the setting. The characters may use props or objects in the comic but interact on a blank white background.You may decide to have a more character focused comic, with very little setting in the background. Or, if your comic is more world focused, with an elaborate storyline, you may include details of the setting. If your comic is set in medieval times, for example, you may have backgrounds of castles, rolling hills, and lush vegetation.

, Drawing the comic by hand can take more time, but it will also allow you to get a hands on experience and be creative. To draw the comic, you will need the following supplies:Standard 8 ½” x 11” white paper
A pencil and a black pen
A ruler
A stapler
An eraser
Colored pencils, pens, or paints
A foam board 20” x 30” x 3”
An X-ACTO knife
Wite-out or correction fluid
If you decide to use a computer, you can use a computer program to create the comic. There are online comic generators you can access as well as sketching computer programs that you can access on your computer., Use the foam board to make a template so your panels are the same size and shape. You will then trace the template on the white paper to create your panels.Start by measuring a 10” x 5” (25 x 12 cm) rectangle on the foam board. Then, use the X-ACTO knife to cut out the rectangle. Make sure an adult does the cutting, as X-ACTO knives can be a hazard for small children.
Then, use the ruler to measure a half-inch (1 cm) inside the edges of the rectangle and cut out another rectangle that is 9 ½” x 4 ½” (24 x 11 cm). You should have a ½” (1 cm) wide frame, which will act as your template.
Place the template lengthwise on the piece of white paper and use it to create the panels. If you are doing a three panel comic strip, for example, you will use a pencil to trace the inside border of the template on the paper three times, including a small amount of space between each panel.

, If your comic strip is going to have text in it, you may want to use the ruler to create a grid for the text in pencil. Once you have placed the text in the panels, you will then erase the grid so the text appears straight and spaced out evenly.Starting at the top of the panel, lightly trace horizontal lines about a quarter-inch (.5 cm) apart with a pencil. Make enough lines to fit your text. This will be based on how large you write the text and how much text you are including. If you are not sure how many lines you will need, you can include extra lines and erase them later.
Repeat this in each panel that is going to have text so you have lines to refer to when you put the text in the panels. Once the text is in the panels, you can add word bubbles to them.

, Using your structure for the comic strip as a guide, draw in your characters, setting, and any props. Do this in pencil with a light hand so you can erase and fix any mistakes. You can also go over the pencil with pen or marker once you are done to make the lines more permanent.Some comics will put the text bubbles in the panels first, before they put in the actual text. This is done because that way, there is enough space in each panel for the characters, the setting, and the text bubbles. You can decide if you want to add in the text first, and then the text bubbles or do the text bubble first.
If you write in the text first, using the grids, make sure you leave enough room around the text for the text bubbles.

, Once you have all the elements in your comic strip, you should erase any pencil marks, creating a clean comic in marker or pen. You can then add color to the comic strip using colored pencils, marker, or paints. Use the pen lines as guides so the color does not bleed into each other or overlap.To color the comic strip, you should outline inside the pen lines first and then color in the details. Try to use the same colors in each panel for consistency. For example, if a character's shirt is green in the first panel, make sure it is green in the second and third panels.
You may decide to use surreal colors to add some interest to your comic. For example, making the sky purple instead of blue and making your main character a magical creature who has red skin. This kind of approach to color is a great way to add some unique elements to your comic. Just make sure you keep the unique elements consistent throughout the comic so it appears consistent and well put together.

Think of a short, visual story to translate from your head to the page.,
Draft out the plot of your story in paragraph form.,
Create round, flawed, and exciting characters.,
Introduce a problem, fail to solve it, and then resolve the problem with a surprise to create instant plot.,
Whenever possible, convey information visually instead of through dialogue or exposition.,
Using your drafts and paragraphs, create timelines for the action and characters in your story.,
Fill in the dialogue, workshopping it with friends to make it realistic.",How to Write a Comic Book1," Comic books are a blast because they merge written words with cinematic images, blending the best of both novels and movies. Remember this when considering stories -- you want something with big, fun images and visuals as well as a fair amount of conversation and dialogue. While there are no wrong ideas, some things to keep in mind include:



Keeping stories visual: A long passage where a character is musing or thinking may be hard to express in comics, though not impossible. Similarly, a conversation story in only one room is likely better suited for a short story, since you don't have many pages of new visuals.

Streamlining the story: More characters, locations, and action is great, but it significantly increases the workload on the illustrator. The best comic books tell their stories quickly and efficiently, using both dialogue and visual cues to keep things moving.

An Artistic Style: Truly great comic books have art that fits seamlessly with the tone of the writing, like the dirty, water colored V for Vendetta, compared to Marvel Civil War's bright, cartoonish, and action-packed comics. If you're an artist, this may be easy. But even writers should think about the type of story and artwork they love. What kind of mood does it strike, and how can your story do the same?;
, Just start writing, not worrying about form, content, or how it will look on the page. Once you have your idea down, get the pen flowing. Put the characters or idea in motion and see what happens. If you throw 90% of this away, that is okay. Remember the advice of writer and animator Dan Harmon, who claimed that the first draft is 98% terrible, but the next one is only 96% bad, and so on until you have a great story. Find the 2% that's awesome and build off it:What characters are the most fun to write?
What plot points did you find yourself most interested in exploring?
Are there things that you thought were good ideas that you just can't write? Consider ditching them.
Talk this draft over with some friends to get advice on what they love and how to go forward.

, Characters drive plots in almost all great movies, comics, and books. Almost all comics are the result of a character who wants something but is unable to get it -- from villains trying to rule the world (and heroes trying to save it) to a young girl looking to figure out her complex political environment (Persepolis). The fun of any comic book, whether about super heroes or average Joes, is following a character's trials, tribulations, and personal flaws as they try to accomplish their goals. A great character:



Is round. Has both strength and weaknesses, just like anyone else. This makes them relatable. We don't like Superman just because he saves they day, but because his awkward alter-ego Clark Kent reminds us of our own awkward, nervous days.

Has both desires and fears. Great characters want something they can't have, and this conflict makes your story. It is no mistake that Bruce Wayne, the Batman, is deathly scared of bats -- just like he is scared of failing his city and parents. This makes him far more relatable than a weirdo in a cape.

Has agency. Whenever a character makes a choice, make sure it is the character deciding to do it -- not the author forcing the character to do it because ""the plot needs it."" This is the quickest way to lose your audience., If this sounds too simple, it is. But it is the genesis of all plot. You have your characters, and they have a problem (The Joker is on the loose, the Avengers broke up, Scott Pilgrim got dumped). They decide to fix the problem, and fail (The Joker escapes, Captain America and Iron Man start fighting, Scott Pilgrim has to fight 7 exes). In a triumphant final push, your characters finally prevail (Batman defeats The Joker, Cap and Ironman usher in peace, Scott Pilgrim gets the girl). These are your major plot points and you can play with them however you want. But knowing these three stepping stones ahead of time will save you a lot of writing headaches.


""First act—Get your hero up a tree; second act—throw rocks at him; third act—get him down."" -- AnonymousMake life hell for your characters -- it makes the payoff more rewarding.
You can always play with this structure, and you should -- don't forget that (spoiler alert) Captain America gets assassinated shortly after peace is brokered in Civil War. But this moment is great because it plays off the three-act structure, even as it breaks it with a second, surprising climactic moment.

, Say, for example, you have a character who needs to turn a paper in or they fail their class. You could have the character wake up and tell their mom ""I need to turn this paper in or I fail."" But this is simple and unrewarding to the reader. Consider a few ways to tell this same plot point visually:


A page of illustrations where the character frantically runs through the door, down the hall, to the office, and then finds it ""Closed.""
A sign on the wall labeled ""Final Papers Due TODAY!"" that the character walks right by when leaving class.
A single shot of every other student turning in papers, with your character alone at the desk writing furiously, or with his head in his hands.

, Try to be really methodical about this, boiling down each plot point and action into it's essential moment. Think of these as each page of the comic book -- you want the story to be progressing with ever flip of the page.


What is crucial in each scene? What moment or line of dialogue pushes each scene into the next.
In any storytelling form, each scene must end in a different place than it began for the readers, plot, and/or characters. If not, then the whole book is just spinning it's wheels!

, Finally, once the story and characters are in place, it's time to nail down the dialogue. The trick is to make each character sound as human as possible, but there is actually an easy way to do this: have humans read out each character. Invite over 1-2 close friends and read through the dialogue like a script. You'll hear instantly when people can't quite get the words out or sound unnatural.


There is nothing that says you can't write dialogue first, either! If you like play-writing or screenwriting, you may be more comfortable drafting out scenes in dialogue as opposed to timelines.

Figure out your audience.,
Brainstorm.,
Research.,
Warm up.,
Once you've warmed up, (you'll need to be in a 'mode' as some call it to write a lot) take those ideas you jotted down during brainstorming and think about them.,
Now, the anticipated moment has arrived.,
In the middle of writing, if at any point you feel you need to catch yourself up with the characters, re-watch the show, re-read the book (or maybe part of it) or re-watch the movie.,
Do a word count.,
Write.,
Edit your work.,
Finally, put it all together in your best form with font and such, and you are D-O-N-E.

,
Publish it...kind of.,
If you cannot publish (There is a 90% chance it won't be in stores), you can still print and give to family and friends!",How to Write a Fanfiction Novel," Stories for adults are much different than stories for 10 year-olds, say. This is an important factor, as it can help so you know not to describe too many battle scenes and such if you are writing for kids to read when/if they read it.;
, This is the perfect way to go. Think about the characters. Think about the setting. Think about the book/show/movie's main plot and how you could maybe incorporate bits from that. Jot down any ideas- stupid or not. Who knows? Maybe making one of the characters get sick turns out to be a good component!

, Sometimes Brainstorming needs a little help, and we can do research for that help. Watch a few episodes, read the book, or watch the movie if you haven't recently, to refresh that mind of yours. You're going to need a BIG idea instead of a plain one.

, Writing a novel takes patience. It can take weeks- sometimes even months to do it! So warming up means- yes, you may write one shots- writing just snip-its and bits from the show.

, It seems we are lugging the actual writing of the novel out far, but it is all worth it in the end. Think, think, and sleep on it.

, Write! Write like crazy. But don't forget to use your ideas and not just write down 'gibberish'. Don't worry about mistakes- this comes later!

, You never really want to be OOC (Out Of Character)

, Now it may seem like you need to write as many Microsoft Word pages as a book. But don't worry! There's a solution to this madness, it seems. If you want to know how many 'book pages' your writing is, take the word count and divide it by 250. This is a simple way to figure it out! 250 is about how many words there are on a smaller novel. Of course, unless you are Gail Carson Levie or Rick Riordan, you might want to start small in the way of novels. 100 to 300 is a nice area to aim for, in the way of pages, of course., Most authors write their novel in a month, maybe two or three.

, Finally, it's time for the step that annoys most writers. Edits. Now this time editing can very well vary. If you wrote a novel, say, around 150 pages long, it will take less time than someone who wrote 300! And some writers write in more mistakes than others- who knows where you might fall under that line, but don't let it get in your way. If it's bugging you, sending to a friend for opinions is also a very helpful state- you can see what someone else thinks, other than your mom or dad who always say nice things!

,, Publishing it is not very likely- fanfiction is most times never published because the books are always under copyright- same applies for movies and shows. But Fanfiction.net is always an option! (Not exactly for 300 pages, though.)

, Who knows? Maybe they might just want to share it and share it- this seems like publishing for the world! It also gives great feelings in your stomach.

Use a mock-up to test out your ideas, style, layout and pacing without sinking too much work into the idea.,
Create several timelines: one for what should be shown to the reader in the story, what action needs to occur, where character development will go, etc.,
Divide a blank page into panels for your story.,
Using your timelines as a guide, fill in the panels with either descriptions or sketches of what action should be seen, and what dialogue should be heard.,
Keep your script page and graphic page side by side as you work.,
Hire an artist, or finish the work yourself, once you're happy with the mock-up.",How to Write a Comic Book2," A ""mock-up"" is basically a sketch of the entire comic book, page by page. They don't have to be detailed as the bigger issues layout. Instead, figure out how many frames or lines of dialogue fit on each page, where do you want any ""special pages"" (like full-page frames), and will the format of each page be identical or change depending on mood? This is where you start merging the words to the pictures -- so have some fun.


If you're not artistically inclined, you don't need to worry about hiring an artist just yet. Instead, just focus on the basics. Even stick figures can get the point across and help your visualize the final book.
While this is ""only"" a mock-up, you still must take it seriously. This will be your blueprint for the final project, so treat it like a sketch for a painting and not some throwaway practice run.

, Other timelines will need to be made for each character, so you know what their life has been so far, where it is going, etc. These will help you keep the pages and stories straight, visualizing where each character needs to be at each portion of the book.

, Keep in mind pacing, so if your main character has just discovered the bones of a monster in her backyard, the reader gets to have a nice big picture to look at and take their time viewing.

, Remember that dialogue is actually seen in a comic book, so it literally needs to fit in each box. Try not to jam too much at once.


That said, some comic books choose to let the dialogue balloons spill into other frames, creating a somewhat looser, chaotic feel.
For longer monologues or speeches, consider connecting the speech bubbles together from frame to frame. The same person is giving the same speech, just with different action underneath.

, Many professionals will use two pages, one for the script and one for the pictures. Remember, the trick of comic books is your balance between words and visuals, and this is easiest to see side-by-side. You can tick off each caption and frame as you work.


For example, the script might go: ""Spiderman is swinging down the streets and spots 2 police cars chasing a yellow sports car. caption1: Hmm it's strangely quiet today... caption 2: Uh Oh.. guess I spoke too soon!"" Then on the other page would be the picture of Spiderman swinging down the street and the two blank caption spaces.

, If you've been diligent about clean professional work, you might be able to turn the mock-up itself into the book. Otherwise, get to work on the actual thing, using your mock-up as the guide. Sketching, inking, and coloring a comic book is a serious undertaking. But it is also a ton of fun.


If you're getting an outside artists, send them the script and ask for samples. This helps you see if their visual style is right for you.
Illustrating a comic book is a topic worth it's own tutorial, as it is a challenging and exiting art form.

Consider starting a free web comic to build interest and buzz.,
Make a ""hit-list"" of comic book and graphic novel publishers with work similar to yours.,
Submit samples of your work to your target publishing houses.,
Consider self-publishing and marketing your book yourself.,
Understand off the bat that the world of publishing is not always easy or fair.",How to Write a Comic Book3," The internet age gives you endless opportunity to market and publish your own work that should not be discounted. In many ways, shorter internet comics have replaced physical comics books as ways to build towards the inevitable graphic novel, which is usually all of the strips collected in one book. Even better, use your web comic to expand on the stories or characters in the book, enticing viewers to buy the ""real thing.""


Getting up on social media every day, even if only for 20 minutes, is essential to build some traction online and get potential readers.
If you can point to a large follower list, on any platform, publishers are more likely to see and like your work. Having followers tells them there are people already who want to buy the book.

, Look up the authors and publishers of your favorite comics, leaning towards ones with a similar tone or subject as your comic. Be sure to branch out, too -- this list cannot be too big! Remember that, while working for Marvel or DC would be a blast, it is very rare for first-timers to get picked up by the big guys. Independent and smaller presses are a much better bet.


Get contact information, including email, website, and address, for every company.
If applying for graphic novels, be sure to check if the publishing house has a specific division for graphic work, or if they take all submissions the same way.

, Head online and see if the house accepts ""unsolicited submissions,"" meaning you send them the work even if they don't ask. Read all the rules and guidelines, then send in your absolute best work. You won't hear back from everyone -- but that is why you keep the list as big as possible.


Any cover letters or emails should be short and professional. You want them reading about the story, not about you!
Make sure artistic samples are included with the story.

, It's a daunting proposition, but it is very doable. While printing in full-color is expensive, you can always stick with black and white. Furthermore, you get creative control over the entire book, allowing you to make sure your vision gets onto the page unfiltered.To self-publish a comic book, simply create a PDF from the pages using Amazon Self Publish or a similar site.

, There are so many manuscripts that hit the desks of publishers that many are thrown out without being read. This isn't to discourage you -- many amazing books get through, too! -- but rather to prepare you for the hard work ahead. Having a book you love and feel proud will make the slog of publishing much, much more bearable.


Don't forget that even the most famous authors were rejected 100's of time before success. It may hurt now, but working through it separates published comics from unpublished.

Comprehend Redrom Transgressions.,
Comprehend Blackrom Transgressions.",How to Understand Homestuck Quadrants," The Homestuck term ""Quadrants"" refers to the type of romance experienced by the web comics main non-human species, the trolls. This is because, unlike us humans, they have four different types of romantic experiences. Their romance can be viewed as one giant square that's divided in half vertically, and then in half again, horizontally.;
, The first and most important division between the quadrants is between what is known as Redrom and Blackrom. Redrom, or Red Romance, is feelings based off primarily positive emotions, similar to the human concept of love and friendship. Blackrom, or Black Romance, is the opposite, and based off primarily negative emotions, such as rivalry and competition.

, The second division is between the concupiscent and conciliatory quadrants. Concupiscent quadrants are the ones that are viewed as more romantic and play a leading role in reproduction, whereas conciliatory quadrants focus on more platonic relationships that have other roles that you'll see later.

, The first quadrant and is the redrom concupiscent romance known as Matespritship, denoted by the symbol of the heart, <3. This quadrant is the most similar to normal human romance, as it is based off positive emotions and plays a role in reproduction. However, human love and a trollian flushed relationship still have their differences. While the romantic feelings of humans tend to be based around adoration, sometimes idolising the person of their affection, matesprits usually pity their partner instead. Matesprits feel sorry for each other and want to be of help.

, The second quadrant is the redrom conciliatory romance known as moirailegiance, denoted by the symbol of the diamond, <>. An easier viewpoint for humans on this romance is the idea of a Soulmate, but in a more platonic sense, being conciliatory. Trolls are a somewhat violent race by nature, but some are more so than others. In the case a more tempermantal troll were to have a fit or go on a rampage, it would be their Moirail's responsibility to pacify them for the safety of everyone else. Those who enter a pale relationship do so wanting to make themselves better people, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses.

, The third quadrant is the blackrom concupiscent romance known as kismesistude, denoted  by the symbol of the spade, <3<. A very common misconception of caliginous relationships is that they hate each other and are in a constant state of trying to kill their kismesis. This is not true. The caliginous feelings that serve as the base for a kismesistude are more similar to a rivary, trying to outdo and one up their partner. However, leaving it at that is a major simplification, as many other factors and emotions play into the nature of a kismesistude. Some of these are respect and admiration. A troll will dislike their kismesis, and want to prove that they're better, but why? They see that the receiver of their caliginous feelings could potentially be better than them, and they feel the urge to disprove that, to their kismesis, to everyone, but most importantly, to themselves. Without that sense of competition, a kismesistude would fall apart quickly, leaving bitter disappointment in its wake.

, The foruth and final quadrant is the blackrom conciliatory romance known as auspisticism, denoted by the sumbol of the club, c8<. This quadrant is probably the hardest for humans to grasp, as it is the only form of romance not subject to universal rules of infidelity, meaning any given person could be involved in any number of ashen relationships, and it is the only form of romance involving three parties. As was previously mentioned, trolls are a violent race by nature, resulting in many bickerments and quarrels, some of which result in blooming caliginous feelings. However, if a caliginous relationship was born from every argument, it would present widespread blackrom fidelity. This is where auspistices come in. When two trolls begin to show feelings marking the start of a kismesitude, and auspistice can step in and separate, or auspistise, the two. They may do this for a number of reasons. Maybe one or both of them already have a kismesis. Maybe that particular pairing would be disastrous for everyone around them. Maybe the auspistice has a caliginous crush on one of them. For our current intents and purposes, their reason doesn't matter. Think of it as two school children arguing over something, like a toy or a pencil. When a teacher, parent, or peer steps in to break them up, trolls would say that they are acting auspistice.

, That's all four quadrants. The confusing part is trangression. In troll society, it is not uncommon for partners to switch between quadrants. If left unchecked, it can result in chaotic infidelities, but if all goes well, transgressions can lead to beautiful emotional experiences.

, Transgressions are most commonly seen between the concupiscent quadrants, Matespritship and Kismesistude, as this is where the more torrid and unpredictable emotions lie. Very rarely do two parties have requited flushed/caliginous feelings for each other; usually, one person will have a caliginous crush while the other harbors flushed emotions. In this case, one party's feelings will usually flip to match the other. Sometimes, their feeling will flip ack and forth, sometimes in harmony, sometimes in discourse. If either involved party has both a kismesis and a matesprit, this can result in ocasional concupiscnet infidelities until one of the pairs flips to match the other. Under very rare circumstances, all involved parties will have both concupiscent quadrants filled, and flipping in perfect unison. This rare and beautiful multi-person relationship is known as a Quadrangle. When person A and B's relationship is flushed, B and C will be calignous, C and D will be flushed, and D and A will be caliginous, and vice versa when they flip. A Quadrangle is the picture of a perfectly balanced romance in troll society, but it is also very delicate, as a single brief infidelity can shatter it.

, Another common, though not as intricate, transgression is between the two redrom quadrants, Matespritship and Moirailegiance. Similar to the concupiscent transgression method, one party will have flushed feeling whilst the other has pale. Unlike a concupiscent transgression, however, two Moirails tend to both have pale feelings at the start of the relationship. Though this rarely happens, one moirail may begin to feel flushed emotions for the other. This change of heart can culminate in one of three ways. The first possibility is person A's flushed feelings going unrequited for too long, so they go back to pale. Another is person B learning about and being disgusted by person A's desire for a matespritship. The third is person B realising and returning the flushed feelings, resulting in a matespritship, though this is the least common. Transgressions from flushed to pale are equally uncommon, and progress the same, only in reverse.

, Though transgressions between the two blackrom quadrants, Kismesistude and Auspisticism, are certainly not as intricate as concupiscent transgressions, they are considerably more common. If two people are in a caliginous relationship for a while, and the kismesitude begins to wreak havoc, and auspistice will step in. This is exactly like the previously explained ashen relationships, only the third party acting after the disastrous relationship became canon, or official. However, it is unfortuately quite common for ashen relationships to trangress into caliginous as well. If the party acting auspistice has little interest in the role, or doesn't perform well enough for any reason, they will be forced out of the quadrant while the other two presume to become kismesis.

Know the difference in ""standard"" comic book sizes.,
Note that some comic books have been published in magazine format.,
Get larger bags and boards still for treasury-sized comics.,
Choose the form of plastic that best meets your needs.",How to Size Your Comic Books for Proper Storage," The earliest comic books of the Golden Age contained 64 pages, enough to support 4 or 5 adventures within their covers. As the cost of paper gradually increased, the number of pages was reduced to 48, which accommodated up to 3 graphic stories, and then to 32, which usually meant a maximum of 2 stories. Also, while comic books consistently kept a height of 10 1/2 inches (26.7 cm), their width narrowed from the Golden Age dimension of 7 3/4 inches (19.7 cm) to a Silver Age width of 7 1/8 inches (18.1 cm), then widened to 7 1/4 inches (18.4 cm) in the 1970s and 1980s before narrowing to 6 7/8 inches (17.5 cm) in the 1990s. Bags for regular comics are thus broken into the following sizes:


Golden Age: 7 3/4 x 10 1/2 inches (19.7 x 26.7 cm). This size accommodates Golden Age comics from 1943 up to Silver Age comics published in 1960.
Silver Age: 7 1/8 x 10 1/2 inches (18.1 x 26.7 cm). This size accommodates some late Golden Age comics published in 1951 as well as Silver Age comics published as late as 1965, including annuals and 80-page giants published during that period.
Regular: 7 1/4 x 10 1/2 inches (18.4 x 26.7 cm). This size accommodates comics published after 1965, including the late Silver Age and Bronze Age comics of the 1970s to mid-1980s.
Current: 6 7/8 x 10 1/2 inches (17.5 x 26.7 cm). This size accommodates comics published since 1990.
As there is some overlap in years in the above list, be sure to measure your comics horizontally and vertically before purchasing bags and boards for them.;
, Although most comic book series have been published in 1 of the sizes described above, some comics have been published in larger magazine formats, particularly from the late 1960s into the early 1980s. Bags and boards are available for these magazine comics in these sizes:


Magazine: 8 1/2 x 11 inches (21.7 x 27.9 cm). This size will accommodate Warren Comics titles such as ""Creepy,"" ""Eerie,"" and ""Vampirella,"" and Curtis' black-and-white adaptations of Marvel titles such as ""Conan, the Barbarian"" and ""The Rampaging Hulk,"" as well as issues of Mad Magazine.
Thick Magazine: 8 3/4 x 11 inches (22.2 x 27.9 cm). This size will accommodate the color comic ""Heavy Metal"" as well as issues of ""Playboy"" and other men's magazines.

, Treasury comics are larger than magazine-sized comics used for reprints, such as DC Comics Famous First Edition reprints of the Golden Age comics featuring first appearances of its major characters, Christmas story reprint anthologies from both DC and Marvel, and special issues such as DC's ""Superman vs. Muhammad Ali."" Treasury sized bags and boards measure 10 5/8 inches ( cm) across by 13 1/2 inches ( cm) high.

, Comic book preservation supplies are available from your local comic shop or from an Internet retailer. Comic book bags are made of any of several kinds of plastic: polypropylene, polyethylene, and Mylar. Polypropylene and polyethylene run cheaper than Mylar, but typically must be replaced every 3 to 5 years, along with the backing board, so the comic remains preserved. Mylar, in contrast, does not need to be replaced as often, but not all dealers carry Mylar bags in all sizes.

Buy older comics from the discount bin.,
Look for sales on comic books.,
Attend comic shows and conventions.,
Look for comics in less-than-mint condition.,
Buy in bulk.,
Subscribe.,
Go digital.",How to Save Money on Comic Books," Most local comics shops feature bins where you can buy older comics for prices such as 25 cents to $1. These comics are, on average, from 10 to 20 years old. You can also find older comics at used book stores.


Part of the reason these comics run cheaper is that so many comic books were published during the 1980s and 1990s, when collecting comics started becoming popular. Publishers produced large numbers of comics, hoping to capitalize on the craze, and while these comics will eventually appreciate in value, they won't have the value of rarer comics that date back to the 1930s and 1940s.;
, Local comic shops often hold sales. You can keep abreast of such sales by subscribing to your shop's email newsletter.

, At a comics show or convention, you'll often find a dealer's room where a number of comics shops and collectors have tables. Although some dealers may deal in older, rarer issues that will cost you more money, other dealers are looking to unload their overstock, and it is here you can find the best price deals.


There is usually an entrance fee to attend a comics show or convention. Some of the smaller shows, however, allow you to enter for free if you bring the convention ad with you, and they will also offer you a free comic book upon presenting the ad. Usually, you can get on the show's mailing list just by attending a show and registering at the front door, or you can also do so online.

, Unless you're collecting mint-condition comics and keeping them in bags, your comics will degrade in condition as you read them. For that reason, if you collect comics for their stories and artwork instead of monetary value, buying comics in less-than-perfect condition lets you follow the stories without spending as much money as you would on brand-new, mint-condition issues.


Note that many of the comics available in the discount bin are in less-than-perfect condition themselves.

, Just as you can get bulk discounts on grocery and household items at warehouse stores, you can often save money on comics by buying in bulk as well. You can buy in bulk in any of several ways:


Some comics publishers and distributors bundle several issues of the same comic, or issues of different comics featuring the same character, together. The cost is often less than the total cover prices of each individual issue in the bundle.
Some comic book collectors may choose to sell large portions of or their entire collections due to financial difficulties or just to clean house. Depending on the comics in question, you can often strike a deal to buy a large number of comics for less than the cost to acquire them individually.
Some comics shops may let you buy multiple copies of a single issue in bulk at a reduced rate per issue. You can then get together with other bulk buyers to trade duplicate issues with them for other issues you each want.

, An overlooked way of saving money on comic books is the fact that comic books are magazines and can be subscribed to like other magazines. If there are a few titles you particularly like, subscribing to those titles will ensure that you don't miss an issue and usually save you roughly the cost of 2 issues in a year's worth of comics.


Check with the actual publisher for details of subscribing versus buying at the comics store. Subscription arrangements are common with mass-market publishers such as DC and Marvel, but many not be available, or offer as big a savings, with smaller, independent publishers.

, In addition to proprietary digital formats from comics publishers, many older comics are available online as compressed files of scanned digital images. Publishers' proprietary formats require the use of a proprietary digital image reader that usually requires a subscription fee, while the compressed image files can be read with any of a number of image readers available as either freeware or shareware, and the issues are usually free. Also, proprietary comics are usually stored on servers provided by the publishers, while compressed-file digital comics can be downloaded and stored on your hard drive.


Be aware of the legality issues involved with compressed-file digital comics of issues that are still under copyright. Most publishers consider this to be outside ""fair use"" even when such issues aren't sold.

You can also search for specific strips you want to read, or search by a theme. Another way to find the strips is in your local library. You can either look in the archives of newspapers for the comic strip section, and read whichever strips you can find, but in some libraries they have books of the strips. These are collectors editions of the strips organized by the dates they were released. If you look on the website of your local library, you can reserve the book you want to read, and collect it when it is ready to be picked up. Sometimes you can find them just by browsing (they are normally kept in the kid's section), but the guaranteed way of getting the book you want is by reserving.;
, You can find these popular items on websites such as eBay (www.eBay.com), Gumtree (www.Gumtree.com), and other websites like these.

Look at your local show or the Ekka website for more details. Also, at garage sales you can pick up second-hand items if you know what you're looking for. Most items at garage sales are cheap, and once they have been cleaned up a bit, they can look as good as new. When you go to these sales, be on the look-out for any Snoopy items and do not be afraid to go rummaging through the various boxes full of unwanted items.
If you want an item for a cheaper price than the one that is listed, you can bargain with the owner. But beware, don't bargain too much or the owner may get grumpy, and sell it to a different buyer.

By looking at some examples of published political cartoons you can get a good idea of the common elements, themes, and ideas behind this type of cartoon.


Political cartoons aim to illustrate a certain issue and represent a viewpoint regarding it.
Political cartoons generally make use of simple artwork to get their point across quickly and cleanly.
Most political cartoons aim to illustrate perceived problems or defend political positions.;
, The focus of your political cartoon will be the message. Political cartoons focus on a certain issue, either attacking or defending it using various artistic elements. Think about what you want to say and how you might want to say it.Consider the issue you want to cover in your cartoon.
Think of what you want to say about the issue.
Imagine how you might represent the issue in your cartoon.

, A common technique that political cartoons make use of is symbolism. Symbols are images that represent larger ideas and can be a direct way to include big or complex ideas in the space of your cartoon.


Elephants and donkeys are good examples of commonly used symbols to represent political parties in the United States of America.
Eagles are used to represent the United States of America itself.

, Political cartoons often make use of exaggeration when including well known public figures. Exaggeration is most commonly used when including a caricature of a political figure, highlighting unique physical features that they might possess.Exaggerating a persons features can help make them more recognizable.
You can use exaggeration to make someone appear in a certain light, depending on the message you want to send.
Generally, caricatures are used to make fun of someone or their message.

, Most other forms of cartoons and art don't make heavy use of labels. However, political cartoons include labels to increase the impact of their message, making the narrative of the cartoon clear. Try including labels on figures or things that might otherwise be unclear as to what they represent. Using labels can be a good technique to make the message of the comic clear.
Although labels are acceptable in political cartoons, try not to overuse them.
Label only important aspects in your comic.

, One technique that political cartoons often make use of is the analogy. An analogy is used to relate one concept to another, often in an attempt to make an issue or message more understandable. Consider using analogies in your comic to help your readers see the issue from another perspective.


Think in terms of “like”.
For example, international disputes about borders could be like children arguing on a playground about who owns the slide.

, Once you have your message in mind and have settled on the elements you want to use to express it you can begin to create your comic. Creating a basic layout for your comic will allow you to get a feel for how it will look visually and how well it conveys your message.Think about how best to use your space.
Ask yourself what elements are most important. Give them most space and attention in your layout.
You might find that some original ideas don't fit or are cluttering the comics intended message. Consider removing these extraneous elements.

, After you have decided the rough layout of your comic you can begin to sketch the outlines that will make up the completed comic. Don't worry about forming the lines perfectly as you will be able to improve them as you work. Take your time and enjoy creating the cartoon that you are designing.Start outlining with a pencil, allowing you to make changes later on.
Once you are happy with how the sketch looks begin to clean up your lines.
Clean you lines up by either making them bold or by erasing any rough areas and drawing them smoothly.
It's okay to make some last minute changes and add some finishing touches.
If you are happy with how your comic looks you can finalize your lines using black ink.

, Many political cartoons make use of dialogue which is featured in what is called a speech “bubble” or “balloon”. These “bubbles” hold the text in an empty white space, allowing the audience to clearly read it. Draw speech “bubbles” and place your text inside of them now to represent any dialogue you wanted to include.Speech bubbles are generally smooth and oval shaped, with a triangular extension that points towards the person speaking.
You may also want to use thought bubbles. Thought bubbles are like speech bubbles but appear as small clouds, holding your characters inner dialogue within them.

, If your comic calls for color you can add it after your lines have been finished. Adding color can be a great way to make your comic stand out and may even allow for further symbolism or messages to be conveyed. Think carefully about which colors you might want to include and take your time when adding them.


Colors can carry meaning. For example, the Democratic party of the United States uses blue.
You can use any coloring tools you feel comfortable with including colored pencils, ink, or even crayons.
You may also consider scanning your black and white image into a computer and digitally coloring it.

, If you aren't confident in your artistic abilities you can still create your own political comic. There are many digital tools that can help you make your idea for a political comic a reality. These services are found both on-line and as software with some requiring a fee and others being free.


There are many programs that allow you to create a comic using digital art, much like you would with a pen and paper.

Give your hero humble beginnings.,
Allow his future to be predicted.,
Send your hero on a journey.,
Create a hero that is “in development.” An important element of an epic hero is his constant development.,
Give your hero an opponent.,
Return your hero back home.",How to Create an Epic Hero1," It is an important aspect of successful epics for your audience to connect to your hero. This can be accomplished if you give your hero humble beginnings. A hero’s journey must be one of development. If you start your hero’s journey at a low point, he has space to develop his strength, cunning, courage, and even to discover his inherent nobility in time, over the course of his great journey., Many times in epic tales, the future or fate of the hero is prophesied early on. This lends an air of both grandeur and urgency to the hero’s story. In many cases, this prophecy is that sends the hero on his journey. Consider including a prophecy of your hero’s fate., An epic tale always revolves around a journey. Your hero must travel far, see the world, and fight for good. Something big must often occur to send your hero far away. This could be a prophecy, a storm, a war, or some other emergency. Figure out what sends your hero on a journey as well as where he goes., At the top of an epic tale, we are usually presented with a humble but likable character, who is faced with a great task. Through the hero’s inevitable journey, he learns many things about himself (often his true origins, true strength, or even special powers) and proves himself to be worthy and great. Keep this aspect in mind as you work to create your epic hero., Each hero (or protagonist) must have a counterpart (or antagonist). Each good guy must have a bad guy to interact with. You can determine many characteristics of your hero by first visualizing his negative match. Your hero and your villain will share opposing characteristics, often acting as a kind of mirror for one another., All epic tales are cyclical in nature. In the conclusion, your hero must return to where he started, now changed by the journey. Determining the way your hero evolves, whether he succeeds or fails in defeating his challenge and/or opponent (heroes usually succeed), and the manner in which he returns home will tell you a great deal about your hero.

Research the disability in question.,
Build empathy with disabled people.,
Remember that disability does not solely define a person.,
Avoid tokenism.,
Avoid trivializing disability.,
Don't stress out too much.",How to Depict Disability in Fiction," Really understand any condition before you write about it. Do not base your knowledge on fictional media, such as movies or television shows, as often these are inaccurate. Even if you think you really know or understand a condition, you may be surprised to find how little you really do. Of course, if you have direct understanding of a disability, such as yourself or someone close to you, or someone you can get to know, that is the best research available.


For example, not every autistic person will be like the character in ""Rain Man,"" for instance. Most autistic individuals do not possess remarkable mathematical ability. Some are affected less dramatically, and some far more severely. Autism is different for everyone, and this is the case with most other disabilities.
Some people who need a wheelchair may need to use it at all times, while others can use a cane or even walk on a good day. Some people are in wheelchairs due to neurological diseases, accidents, birth defects, and a number of different reasons. Having a working understanding of the disability will be essential to building and depicting your character. Things you should research include:
Effects of the disability. For example, being blind may impair sleeping well.
Prevalence of the disability. Some disabilities are relatively common, others very rare. Some are ""invisible"", such as the man suffering from debilitating depression who outwardly looks fine.
Public attitude or misconceptions about the disability. This may differ from one time period, culture, or sub-culture to another.;
, Get to know people who have conditions that you are trying to understand. Interview any people you know who have the disability. Better yet, hang out with them to see what their experiences can be like. You can also look for communities online where actual disabled people converse and check in with them. Some disabilities have their own communities (Deaf culture, Autistic community, etc.), but general disability communities can help, too.


Look for hashtags and similar signs that indicate who actually has a disability. One common one is ""Actually Autistic.""
Find the point of view of actual disabled people. Often people with good intentions try to speak for disabled people and end up promoting harmful or misleading ideas.
For example, non-autistic people sometimes speak of as autism being a puzzle (often in a negative way). However, it may not be mysterious at all to someone who is autistic—it is just an everyday reality.

, While disability is often a significant part of a person's identity, it is not their entire identity. ""Blind"" or ""has ADHD"" can be aspects of a character, but not the whole character. Besides, rounded characters are more interesting in general. Some examples of potential characters are listed below:


Kori is deaf-mute and uses sign language. She has a great sense of humor and she and her friends often prank each other. She is studying Forensics in college.
James is autistic and has a bit of trouble with socialization because of it. However, he is quite eloquent when he is comfortable and often writes beautiful love letters to his fiancée. He really loves to cook.
Francesca uses a wheelchair. She is quiet but friendly, and she loves to paint. On weekdays she cares for her sister's son, Juan, who likes to sit in her lap and watch while she paints.
Professor X uses a wheelchair. He is a well-respected leader of a team of superheroes, is brilliant, telekinetic, and cares deeply about non-mutants, even if many wish to destroy people like him.

, Sometimes people will include a disabled person just to satisfy a desire to include a character that to be ""inclusive"" without really having that character be a meaningful presence. Token characters are usually flat and often appear for one episode of a show to prove a point or teach the other characters a lesson about something—typically never to reappear. While the writer probably has good intentions, this has many negative implications. For one, disabled people are still effectively sidelined, not really active in the world. It is seen as enough to just be there, but not be a full person. But what most people with disabilities want is to be seen as a person foremost, not a passive bystander or ""plot device"" in life - they want to have a purpose, not just merely ""be there"" to further the development of other characters.


You can avoid tokenism simply by having the character have a purpose in the story, not just be there to be there. Something about the character should be vital, just as any other in your fiction.
It's okay for disabled characters to teach other characters something, but there should be more to them than just teaching the non-disabled character(s) a lesson.

, Sometimes a character will be disabled just so other characters will feel sorry for them, to justify some questionable behavior, or just to seem cool. All of these things are frowned upon. Some people with autism, for instance, can come off as rude at times—but most do not do it intentionally, and most do not try to use their disability as a free pass to get away with it. If they bring up their autism, it's to explain what happened and that the offense was an accident. So it is with most disabled people.


In comedy, a character's disability is sometimes used as a punchline. It is a fine line using blindness or deafness to cause a point of misunderstanding in the plot, and making the character the joke. Make sure that the person's disability is not seen as a joke. While disabled people can be as funny as anyone else, make sure that the laugh is not at the expense of the person.
In the same vein, disability is sometimes used as an explanation for criminal or similar behavior. This can give readers/viewers a bad impression of the disability, and this can have real-life consequences. In other words, don't do it.

, Writing about minority characters can be a touchy subject, yes. But you don't have to be perfect—the disabled community will appreciate positive representation and that you put effort into your portrayal. Some people might be unhappy with your work, but you cannot please everybody, so don't worry about it too much. Take this as an opportunity to meet interesting new people and learn worthwhile information.

Play on universal fears by adding them to the story.,
End every chapter on a cliffhanger.,
Kill someone close to the protagonist, so the reader realizes that no one, even the protagonist, is invulnerable.",How to Create Suspense in Fiction," This narrative mode is known as the third person omniscient. It will allow the reader to see when the protagonist is making a mistake and about to run into trouble. The reader will impose his own fears onto the story, helpless to prevent the disaster that's coming.


When the reader knows more than a character in a story, this is called dramatic irony.;
, The reader will worry about what might happen to him or her. Maintaining suspense is easier when the reader cares about the protagonist.

, The antagonist, meanwhile, should seem to have all the time in the world to act.

, Whatever it is that the protagonist is trying to accomplish in the story, failure means utter devastation to everything the protagonist cares about.

, Success has to be nearly impossible, and the pressure enormous. The protagonist should be almost at the breaking point by the time the final confrontation with the antagonist occurs.

, Victory will be easier, for example, if the protagonist allows an innocent person to suffer, but defeat almost certain if he does the right thing.

,


A good way to add to the protagonist's problems is with a contagonist. The contagonist gets in the protagonist's way, delaying, deflecting or confusing the protagonist. The contagonist can be a well-meaning but bumbling ally of the protagonist or allied with the antagonist.

, The antagonist must be as intelligent and determined as the protagonist so the reader believes that the protagonist can be defeated.

, Make sure that in the final confrontation with the antagonist, the protagonist has to face that fear and overcome it.

, Darkness, spiders, snakes, heights, tornadoes, basements and rising water are just a few of the things that frighten most people.

, This will make it hard for the reader to put the story down and eager for the next opportunity to pick it up again. Creating cliffhangers is sometimes as easy as choosing where to put the chapter breaks.


The term cliffhanger comes from old serial dramas. Before a feature film, short episodic films were shown, and at the end of each the hero was in some peril, sometimes hanging onto the edge of a cliff with one hand. The audience would return to the theater the next week, as much to see the hero escape death as for the feature film.

, You can also injure the protagonist.

First think about what you want your god/dess/es to be like and what type of community would worship s/he, it, or them.,
Also, what you can do is, if you have a very creative mind (which we all do have), is write your own fantasy fiction, with it's own religion or religions, with a god or gods which you have of your own creation.,
Write down ideas for what this god or goddess is like: is this deity good or evil?,
Are there rules.,
Describe the place of worship.,
Holidays.,
Background.,
Objects of worship.,
Weekly worships.,
Most important (Or so I believe, but who really knows...) The ""BIBLE"" and, no, not the bible, just a kind of guide that brings your religion together.,
(For Fiction) Once you have all your ideas together, begin to write your story.",How to Create Your Own God," The community can tell you how the deity is seen. Ex. Most people believe that a community of harsh and violent worshipers would have a deity that thrusted that idea forward.;
, Other writers have done this before. Eg: George Lucas with the Force (in Star Wars); C. S. Lewis with Aslan (in the Chronicles of Narnia), etc.

, Explain why they are good or bad. Is there a force against them? Is this a religion where there is a ""Hell"" and ""Heaven"" or is it an Oversoul where we are all part of a microcosm?

, Write the rules out and see if any contradict each other or the way the deity is seen. Don't change it if you believe that it is right with this god/dess/es, because contradiction is a good thing in religions.

, Is there a shrine? A gigantic church? Or is it simply in a dark cave where the worshipers gather around a fire and sacrifice?

, These don't have to be ""celebrations"" per say, but can be morbid and rather dark. Sacrificing, gatherings, and other types of religious performances can be taken into account.

, Who was the ""founder?"" Was s/he human? What significance does this person have? (If fiction writing then how does this person play into the plot of your story?)

, Is there a symbol of your religion? Ex. Cross. Another example Jashin-san's symbol. (I mean no disrespect to Jashin by putting ""-san."" So I apologize in advance...)

, How can people worship during their lives? What types of prayers are said? How long should they last? Should they have a shrine in their homes?

, What is the name of it? How does it reflect on the people and the deity? How many pages are in it? What is in it? Is a collection over time or is it older? Who wrote it?

, When your story is completed, find a good publishing company which may be willing to publish your story. Of course, some are very difficult to even get a single look at your story, so you may have to start off with magazines which publish short stories, etc. It also helps to read up in other gods and/or mythology

First, you want to fill out a character sheet.,
Now, get into more detail.,
Get a little deeper.,
Finally, embellish the tiny details..,
Archive it.,
Write a biography.,
Start writing.",How to Create a Super Realistic Fictional Character," This doesn't have many questions, but it has enough to get your character really started. Don't go writing all the little details like hair and eye color yet.


You will need those, but right now, there are only a few questions. What is that person's main fear or phobia? What is their history? What is their name? What is their main drive to do what they do? What side are they on? Now, side can be a little tricky when you're writing a book.
But basically, characters are split into good and bad characters. Sometimes it seems unclear. But when you get down to it, what side are they on?;
, This is when you get a little more into it. Where are they from? Where are they going? Who are their friends and relations? What gender are they? These questions are as important as the little details. Even if you never say ""Their best friend is George."", you still have to know these things as if it were you.


You need to be able to write these characters like you were writing about yourself. You never want to get confused.

, What is their eye color? What is their skin color? What is their hair color? This is what I call the color stage. These things are important for detail and writing your character with realism.


Notice how this is done in different layers? That's because you will write in layers. As you get to know a character in a book, you know more about them. These characters have to have different levels of detail like real life people.

, These are the little, tiny details that aren't very noticeable, but they make it seem like the character could leap off the page and dance any moment. These are little things like birth marks, scars, habits, and other things. They may not seem very important, but without knowing them, your character might and probably will fall at some point, when something like this comes up.

, Either on paper or on a computer program like Word, you need to write all this down. Every single detail, every single thing about a character, you need to record. And you need to do it before you start writing about the character, or preferably before you write the book. You need to know everything, because you don't want him to be a friend of the main character, then realize halfway through the book, when you first talk about him, that you never mentioned him before. You must have all the detail!

, Not write a whole book dedicated to this character, but it might be part of it. Just write a lot of information up until he enters the book. To the very day. It could be helpful in future books, or if you write a prequel. It will be very, very helpful to know the character like this. Read it through enough times to implant it in your brain.


You need to know a character by heart if you want him to come alive. Now, I'm not saying that every character who has a line or is mentioned should have a biography or should answer every question. But you should do it with every character that is mentioned often. It may also help to write this like you would an interview, and you are interviewing the character.

, This may seem like a lot of work, and I'm not going to lie, it is. But it is worth it. If you want a true character that your readers will love, or that they will get to know, you must do this. But when this is all done, with all the characters' information archived and ready to read, then you can start writing.


This is when you will most realize that the archiving is worth it. If you ever forget a detail, it is right there. But when all these steps are done, and your books is published, and your characters inspire people, then you'll realize, if you haven't already, that characters are what make up a lot of what makes books popular.

Determine his values.,
Give your hero a tragic flaw.,
Make him courageous.,
Match him to an archetype.,
Create a hero that is willing to sacrifice.",How to Create an Epic Hero2," The main characteristic that distinguishes a hero from a villain is his moral compass, his compassion, and the fact that he cares deeply about something (such as saving his beloved, rescuing his city, or winning a war.) Determine what your hero will care about, what his ethical code will allow him to do, and what his moral compass might prevent him from doing. , A very important characteristic of an epic hero is a “tragic flaw.” Most often, this is a personality trait, such as pride, impatience, or ingratitude. However, you may choose to interpret this as a physical weakness or shortcoming. The most dynamic heroes will have one of each. This tragic flaw will be something your hero learns about himself through his journey., Above all, an epic hero must be courageous. Even if you position your hero as an underdog character, at his center must be unparalleled bravery. After all, regardless of upbringing or looks, courage is what ultimately makes a hero a hero. Your hero may not begin with epic bravery, but this will be revealed to him, unlocked, and developed in time., Archetypes, sometimes called “universal symbols,” have long been used in both storytelling and psychology to help define the characteristics of a person. The “hero” is already itself a kind of archetype, but perhaps your hero is also a prince, a mystic, an innocent youth, or a scapegoat. Chances are, you can think of examples of each of these throughout literature. You can use these instances to help flesh out details about your epic hero., A true epic hero is one that is willing to sacrifice in order to save someone else. Create a situation for your hero in which your hero must make a choice between something he needs for himself (perhaps his own life) and the safety or protection of his beloved, family, or country. This will display his true heroic nature."
"
Give your hero strength.,
Provide him with authority.,
Give him special powers.,
Grant him noble origins.,
Make him physically attractive.",How to Create an Epic Hero3," Although external characteristics may be the first things you think of when imagining a hero, external characteristics should be developed last, after you know your hero’s circumstances and internal values. External characteristics are often elements that your character will develop over the course of the journey. One such characteristic is strength. Through your hero’s journey he will begin to surprise himself (and others) with his tremendous strength., An epic hero will either approach the story with some type of power or authority, or more often, gain or discover some type of authority through his journey. Ultimately, the hero must be someone who can effect change with his actions, so envision your hero as someone who gains a form of power., Epic heroes are often bestowed with “special powers.” These may be realistic “powers,” such as unsurpassed cunning, a photographic memory, or a quick wit, or these may be more “magical powers,” such as the ability to heal oneself. Once again, these powers will be something your hero discovers and/or develops as the epic unfolds., Epic heroes almost always descend from noble origins, typically from either royalty or divinity. As with your hero’s strength, his noble origins are typically something he does not know about at the beginning, but rather discovers along the way. Perhaps he is the son of a god, or a long-lost king., Another common characteristic of an epic hero is his physical attractiveness. Perhaps his physical attractiveness is not so noticeable in the beginning (due to shyness or weakness), but this handsomeness reveals itself in time. It may even play an important role in the story.

, Maybe Persephone's children can be born from a flower or Hestia's are born from ashes. The possibilities are endless and you can keep adding to and designing your character for as long as you like.

, Work out when they were born, how they got to Camp Half Blood or Camp Jupiter. It's important to understand them completely, including all their flaws and relationships.

, This includes sketching out how they look, what they wear and particular facial expressions. This allows you to picture the character better. Moreover, if you're adding them into a story, it'll be easier to explain how they look.

, Each demigod has a worst enemy equivalent, such as Luke, Kronos, and even Gaia, so start gather up the characters and work out which one would be their worst enemy. This enemy could also shape your character, maybe they caused a wound or killed someone they loved. This adds effect and makes your character more interesting.

, Every demigod has a weapon, even if it's a saucepan. Maybe their weapon is cursed or used to be used by a famous hero (for example, Hercules). Their weapon doesn't have to be enchanted at all, maybe they just use their powers, such as water, or whatever powers they have that are related to their godly parent. Then again, it could just be a knife that doesn't need to be enchanted.

, Hades' children don't have to be all gloomy; try making them happy, this way your character is different from the others. Sometimes making them like their parents is useful though, such as using Hermes' craziness or Hecate's weirdness.

",How to Create a Graphic Novel," Manga and US Comic styles are popular, or you can draw humorous cartoons and give it a quirky edge. There are many resources available to learn how to draw. Your local library or bookstore is a great place to find ""How to draw"" books, but the only way to really improve your drawing skills is to practice. To accelerate the process, have a skilled artist such as a teacher or friend give you lessons, or look over your work and give you pointers. Often just watching a talented artist work is enough to open your mind to the techniques and possibilities. Most of all, don't be afraid to experiment with style. Finding your unique style is often more valuable than simply drawing like everybody else.;
, When doing this, think both about their appearance, and their personality and history. If you have a plot in mind already, that will drive the creation of your characters. Develop the character's appearance by drawing them in as many ways as you can: you will improve your drawing ability and your understanding of the character. Use the character's appearance to develop their personality, and use the personality to develop the appearance.

, They will start out as rough ideas, but eventually you will want a fully developed plot. You can develop this plot in many ways: you can draw out rough pages, you can write it as a narrative story, you can write a page full of ideas, a page full of sketches, or you can write it as a script. Keep in mind, though, that graphic novels take up more space than normal novels, so the plot shouldn't be quite as long. Use the characters and settings to figure out the plot.

, The usual way this is done is with thumbnails. Figure out the final page size, and draw small boxes in proportion to the final page. E.g. If your finished page will be 8.5"" x 11"" (U.S. Letter) then draw boxes that are 1.5"" x 2"". You will use these boxes to plan out the entire book, and while many artists feel they can skip this step, generally your design will be better if you do not skip the thumbnail phase. Thumbnails can also be an invaluable tool to organize the production of the book. Thumbnails can be changed much easier than finished pages. Consider the thumbnails your ""map"" to the finished product. If you have other artists helping you, or if you are dealing with printing shops yourself then handing them a photocopy of your finished thumbnails will ensure that everyone knows what you expect the book to be.

, There are many ways to work, and they will depend on many factors. If you are publishing it yourself, then you must consider how it will be printed, how it will be trimmed, how it will be bound, how it will be transported, how it will be distributed, just to name a few. If you are working with a publisher, they will tell you all the specifications. If you are creating a one-off book, then you have a lot more freedom, and can incorporate any medium you want. The basic questions are: Will there be color, or just black and white? Will the edges of the book be trimmed down (allowing bleed) or left untrimmed (no bleed). Bleed is when page contents extend past the edge of the page, and are trimmed down to the final size after binding. It allows for a more professional look, since most printers can't reliably print all the way to the paper's edge. Binding (how the pages are held together) is also an important consideration since it will affect how close your artwork can go to the center of the book. There are many types of binding available, all with benefits and drawbacks. The general rule is keep your important content about 1/2"" from the edges and ""gutter"" (bound side) of the page. Most graphic novels will have three or four steps per page: penciling, lettering, inking, coloring. 

, If you plan on painting, or erasing a lot, you may want to consider using Bristol board or some other thick medium.

, Draw lightly and erase with a good eraser. Be as sketchy or precise as you want. You should pencil in the text for each panel as well.

, Use a good black pen or marker. Have different tips for different line widths. An alternative method is brush and ink, which is more challenging, but enables a different style. Good use of inking can make your drawings seem dimensional and bold.

, If you don't feel confident lettering yourself, you may want to get someone who is, or consider using a computer for the type.

, Inking can be touched up with white paint (even white-out or liquid paper). Be aware that if you plan on coloring directly onto the original artwork, white touch ups might affect the color adversely. You may want to color a photocopy of the inked art. (See 'Tips' for more on using a photocopier)

, Any medium can be used for color reproduction. Watercolor paint, acrylic paint, art markers, color pencil, etc. Increasingly artists are turning to the computer for coloring their work. Get a good reference for painting, color theory, and any computer software/hardware you plan on using. And PRACTICE!

Outline a day in the life of one of your main characters.",How to Create a Fictional Universe," One of the first elements of the universe you should focus on is the scope of the universe, or how much physical space the universe takes up in a larger world. Consider how big you want your universe to be. It might help to think about what you want your fictional universe to hold and how large it is compared to other universes or worlds.Maybe the universe is the larger world, as far as your characters know, and there are several planets or lands within the universe. Or maybe the universe is very small and consists of only one planet or one land, which is then populated with many different cities and towns. Thinking about the scope of the universe can help give you a sense of the big picture. You can then zoom in to the smaller details once you have the larger details set.;
, You should also think about how the universe looks in terms of geography and landscape. Are there many different terrains within the universe, depending on where you are in the universe? Is there one dominate terrain, such as a universe made of ice or a universe made of jungles?You should also consider how many different terrains or landscapes are going to be in the universe. You may separate these terrains by area, province, or even by different planets.
You may also start to think about how the landscapes in the universe might affect other elements, such as the economic systems, the social structures, and the customs of the world. You may have certain beings who live in specific terrains or landscapes only, such as humans who live in cities and towns, and mutants who live in jungles.

, You should also consider how weather functions in the universe. Is there always rain and monsoons on certain planets in the universe or droughts and wildfires in certain areas on a planet or land within the universe? Try to be specific about how the weather functions in each area of the universe.Keep in mind you are building a fictional universe, so the laws of physics and nature may not function in the same ways they do on earth or in our world. You are not bound by the rules of our world and you can make your fictional universe as strange and upside down as you would like. This means you may have areas of landscape where it rains fire or where there are jungles next to ice caves and waterfalls in deserts.

, To get a better sense of the physicality of the universe, you may sit down and draw a map of the universe. This could be a detailed sketch of the different lands and areas in the universe as well as the names of these areas. You can also use a computer program to draw the map. Using a computer program might allow you to get more detailed and draw elements of the universe in proportion to each other.Try to be as detailed as you can when you draw the map, as you will be using the map as a reference point when you sit down to create stories in your fictional universe. Include names of cities, towns, areas, and lands, as well as basic information about the landscape, terrain, and climate of the area. You may also color the map so it is easy to reference when you create stories set in the universe.
You can view several examples of drawn maps of fictional worlds and universes, including an interactive map of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth from The Lord of the Rings., Think about who populates the universe. Is it humans and human-like being? If so, what type of humans are in the universe? You may base the humans in the universe on human groups that exist in our world or merge several groups to create the humans of your fictional universe.For example, you may decide that there is a race of humans that were colonized by another race to create a hybrid race. You may use elements of American slavery and the colonization of indigenous peoples in Canada as templates for the human groups in your universe.
If you do use existing human groups as a template for the people in your universe, make sure they are multi-dimensional and not based solely on stereotypes. You are creating a fictional universe, after all, so you can add in nuances and oddities as you see fit, even to the humans who inhabit the universe., Your universe may also have otherworldly beings or creatures, such as elves, dwarves, and fairies. You may have otherworldly creatures who live among humans or a universe populated by only creatures and no humans.You can also make up your own species, where there are magical elements and human elements present in the beings in your universe. Let your creativity run wild and create a species that will be unique and engaging.

, You may also want to account for the role of certain objects in the universe and their role. These could be objects that are used by every being in the universe or objects that are only used by a select few. Start by focusing on objects that have an important role in the universe and then move down to less important objects that are used in the more mundane aspects of the universe.For example, maybe the universe is held together by a central object, such as a shard of dragon’s glass or a molten ball of gold. Or, maybe the universe is populated by special objects that grow on trees or on the graves of the dead. Use your imagination to sketch out several key objects in the universe to make it feel more detailed and well-rounded.

, Though not every fictional universe needs to contain magical elements, your universe may benefit from a little magic. If you are going to include magic in the universe, you should determine how much magic exists and who can access this magic. You should also consider the origins of the magic, such as nature, ancient artifacts, the gods or a God, or powerful humans.You should also think about how the magic is treated in the universe. If the magic is powerful, are there keepers or guardians of the magic? If the magic only available to a select few or has it been forgotten and waiting to be reclaimed by a chosen hero?
You may also consider if the magic in the universe is considered a positive element, like a sacred gift or treasure. Or, maybe the magic has negative connotations, associated with fear and evil.

, Determining the governing system of the universe will come in handy later when you start to have your characters move around and interact in your story. You can use the political allegiances of the characters to create conflict and tension, especially if your characters are on opposite ends of the political spectrum.Is the universe a democracy, a dictatorship, a republic, or a mix of different governing systems? Does the universe have a stable government or a government in upheaval? Maybe there are different governing systems in each planet or land in the universe and these systems compete against each other or fight for power over the universe as a whole.
You may want to use an existing governing system and add to it until it becomes a weird hybrid system. For example, maybe the governing system has elements of democracy but it is run by otherworldly beings and some decisions are made using magic.

, You should consider how the beings in the universe exchange goods and services. Do they use currency to purchase items from each other? Is the currency in the form of paper money, gold coins, or live birds? Be specific about the details of the economy in the universe so your reader or viewer can get a better sense of what it is like to exist in this fictional world.If there are multiple lands or planets in the universe, you should determine if there are different currencies in each land. There may also be different economic systems in each land or planet.
You could use an existing economic system and adjust it or add different elements to it. You may use elements of capitalism, for example, but add elements of socialism to the system.

, Most worlds include some element of theology, whether it is organized religions, pagan beliefs, or the belief in one higher power. Your universe may have one theology, such as an organized religion, or there may be several different theologies in the universe. The type of theology may be based on the beings who populate an area as well as the governing system of the area.You may use an existing religion or belief system to create a theology for your universe. For example, maybe you combine elements of Catholicism with elements of Haitian Vodou to create a hybrid theology found in a certain area of the universe.

, Most worlds are organized based on a hierarchy, where there is a dominant culture and nondominant cultures. The dominant culture may be a certain group of people or a certain type of creature. The dominant culture may have certain privileges and rights that are denied to nondominant cultures. Having these elements will help to create tension and conflict in the universe, as many nondominant cultures rebel or revolt against a dominating force or group of people.Having different types of cultures will also create social classes or social hierarchies. These classes could then come into conflict, especially if you have characters in your stories who are from different classes.
Often, dominant cultures will have their version of history included in the official history of an area or land. The dominant culture in your universe may uphold their version of history, which contradicts or oppresses the history experienced by nondominant cultures. This could help to build tension and conflict in the universe.

, You should think about how someone might get around in the universe. Maybe they hop on a super plane and travel by air or they have to travel by horse across many lands. Perhaps your universe contains cities that have public transit systems that run on magic. Factoring in the transportation system will help to create the infrastructure of the universe and make it easier for you to place your characters in this world.You may also want to consider if there are certain modes of transportation that are only used by certain groups or beings. For example, maybe the wizards in the universe get around by flying broomstick and the fairies get around by flying dragon. Or, maybe humans use the bus while elves use horses to get around.

, Think about how beings might interact in a public space, such as on the street, on public transit, or in a village or town. Do certain groups greet each other with special signs or words? Are there common customs among all the beings in the universe or unique customs for each group? Focusing on the accepted and unaccepted customs will help you get a better sense of how certain characters will act in the universe.For example, maybe humans in the universe greet each other by using computerized glasses to say hello. Or, maybe a certain group acknowledges each other with a simple facial gesture or hand motion. Not knowing the accepted customs may lead to consequences in the universe, such as excommunication from a group or community.

, You should also think about what the beings in the universe wear and how their clothing affects their status in a group or community. Maybe all the male beings in the universe wear leather loincloths and carry swords or all the female beings in the universe wear pants and carry whips. Dress can be a good marker of where a character belongs in the universe.

You should try to think about how your main characters might be dressed, based on their status in the universe. Maybe one character dresses in all black because he was born into a certain group or one character always wears long, flowing dresses because she is the member of a higher social class.

, One way to get a better sense of the daily routines of someone in your fictional world is to write out a day in the life of your main character. You may start with how the character wakes up in the morning and how she prepares for her day. Think about how she gets dressed, how she speaks, what she eats, and if she prays to any higher power before she goes out into the world."

Determine if the planet will be hospitable.,
Note how the planet functions within a larger system.",How to Create a Fictional Planet," Start by considering if the planet is made up of gases like oxygen and nitrogen, or with other gases not found on Earth. Humans need oxygen to survive, but if your planet is not going to be populated with humans, your planet may not need oxygen at all. Your planet may be made up of one gas that requires special equipment to breath in, or several gases that mirror the atmospheric make up of Earth.You may want to consider if you are trying to create a believable or realistic planet where humans can survive or if you are going for the fictional effect and not worrying about plausibility at all. You may end up creating an atmosphere for the planet that is similar to Earth so your reader is more likely to believe human life can survive on the planet.
You should also think about how the atmosphere appears on the planet. Is the atmosphere foggy and thick with white gases or does it have patches of poisonous gases that appear green or blue? Maybe sections of your planet contain different atmospheres, leading to a wide range of gases and elements on the planet.;
, You should also have a good idea of the climate or climates on the fictional planet. Consider if the planet has a variety of climates based on location or one overall climate.Maybe the planet consists mostly of ice and it is always winter on the planet, with temperatures below zero. Or, perhaps there are areas of the planets that are tropical, with hot, humid temperatures and areas of the planet that are dry and arid.

, You should consider if there are going to be seasons on the planet and if so, how many seasons will there be. The seasons on the planet may mirror the seasons on planet Earth, consisting of spring, summer, fall, and winter. Maybe the seasons are limited to two, summer and winter, or there is only one constant season on the planet.You may want the seasons to correspond with the climate and the atmosphere of the planet. Perhaps a planet that is made mostly of frozen water will have only one season: winter. Or, if the climate is tropical on the planet, it may be summer year round.
Keep in mind the names of seasons on the planet can also be different than the ones we have on Earth. You are creating a fictional planet, after all, so you have the freedom to come up with new names for seasons and include them in your story.

, Think about how the planet looks in terms of landscape and terrain. Try to be specific about the landscapes on the planet and connect the landscape with the climate and atmosphere of the planet. This will make the planet seem more believable and cohesive to your reader.Perhaps the planet consists of a variety of landscapes, such as ice capped mountains, grassy hills, desert plains, and tropical jungle. Or, maybe there is only one type of landscape on the planet, such as a planet made of ice that contains glaciers, ice walls, and frozen forests.You should also consider if there are going to be bodies of water on the planet, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers. Perhaps there is only one long body of water that circles the entire planet or several lakes that are considered sacred to the people living on the planet.

, Most planets that have been settled by a species will have distinct landmarks that have been built or created, such as a giant central tower or a monument to a particular historical figure. There may also be natural landmarks on the planet, like a sacred mountain peak or a dense, preserved forest.You can make a specific landmark a key element in the journey of your protagonist so the landscape feels central to your story. Maybe your protagonist has to journey to a central tower to receive important information from the planet’s government. Or, maybe your protagonist is searching for a key buried in a sacred mountain on the planet.

, You should consider if there are going to be natural resources, like minerals or natural gas, on the planet. These natural resources could then serve an important purpose in your story set on the planet, as your characters may try to extract or use these natural resources for their own gain.


You may include mineral resources like gold, iron, or coal. There may also be precious stones like diamonds or pearls on the planet.
You may include natural resources like fossil fuels or natural gas. Or, the planet may contain lots of forests for timber and fertile land for growing crops.

, You should decide if your planet will be divided into settled areas like cities, towns, or villages. Perhaps there are only a handful of major cities on your planet, and lots of small villages in remote areas. Or, maybe your planet is full of urban areas and large cities, with only a small amount of rural villages or areas.


You should consider how the planet's cities, towns, and villages are going to factor into your story. Maybe your protagonist lives in a large city in a specific spot on the planet. Perhaps your antagonist lives in a remote town. Consider how you are going to use the lay out of the planet in your story and build it from there.

, To get a better sense of the overall geography of the planet, you should sit down and sketch out a map. It does not necessarily have to be well rendered or well drawn. Instead, focus on getting down the general details of the planet, such as the names of the areas on the planet as well as key features of each area.For example, maybe you are creating a planet that is divided into two sides: one of ice and one of sand. You may then label one side “Frigid Land” and list details about the atmosphere, climate, and landscape in this area. You may list: “Blue atmosphere, below zero temperatures, populated by glaciers, ice walls, snow-capped mountains, and sparse forest.”

, You should consider who is inhabiting the fictional planet. Maybe you have human-like species who live on the planet or alien-like species who have colonized the planet. Perhaps there is a mix of both species who attempt to live in harmony on the planet.Determine a rough estimate of the population of the different species on the planet. Maybe humans are outnumbered by aliens, or humans and aliens are outnumbered by a species of animal on the planet.
You should consider the different races that live on the planet. Maybe there are different races of humans who live in specific areas or locations on the planet. There may be different races of aliens as well who only inhabit a specific area on the planet.

, Consider the flora and fauna that exist on the planet, from mammals to insects to plant species. Try to be detailed about the biodiversity, as it can tell your reader a lot about the physical aspects of the world. It can also serve as useful plot points or character moments, where your character interacts with the biodiversity on the planet.You may want to try using some of the unique biodiversity found on Earth as a jumping off point. Do some research on strange biodiversity on Earth and put it in as part of your planet’s biodiversity.Another option is to take an existing plant or animal and make them more unique or strange. Your planet may be populated by grapevines that excrete blood, for example, or wildebeests who are only two inches tall. Get creative and turn familiar elements of our world into unique ones for your fictional planet.

, You should also consider how the species ended up on the planet and the events that lead to the creation of the planet. Sketch out a history of the planet, before and after it was settled by a species. You can then include plot points and characters from your story in the history of the planet.You should consider the origin of the planet and the species. Is the planet a distant star that was inhabited by aliens who crash landed on it? Or did the species grow and evolve on the planet over a long period of time?
You should also consider major events in the history of the planet. Maybe the aliens who crash landed had to overthrow a species who already lived on the planet. Or perhaps the species who evolved on the planet had to survive the dark ages to then be prosperous on the planet.

, You should also consider how technologically savvy your species is going to be on the planet. Does your species have access to advanced technology that uses signalling stations on the planet? Or does your species use technology that is very similar to Earth's capabilities, with access to wi-fi and high speed internet?


Keep in mind you are creating a fictional planet and you do not need to stick to realistic ideas of technology. You have the freedom to create your own versions of existing technology, such as cellphones that are called beam-hands or a version of the internet that is called simply ""the Net"". Get creative and do not be afraid to create your own technologies for the species on your planet.

, You may decide to include magical elements on your planet, especially if you are writing a sci-fi fantasy story. Determining how magic functions on the planet will allow you to then use the magical elements of the planet in your story.For example, perhaps there is a specific area of the planet that is known for its magical forest, which seems to swallow up anyone who enters. Or maybe the planet contains patches of green gas that can suffocate anyone who is not wearing the proper breathing gear.
There may also be magical beings who exist as species on the planet. You may limit magic to only these magical beings, who bring magic with them, rather than have magic be a part of the planet’s make up.

, You should also consider if the planet is friendly, dangerous, or a bit of both. Maybe the planet is only hospitable to certain species, such as aliens or magical beings, and it is threatening to humans. Or maybe the planet has areas that are known to be dangerous and unsafe for anyone who enters.You may decide to treat the planet as another character in your story, with a mind of its own. Perhaps it creates conflict for your characters, where they have to escape the inhospitable planet to stay alive.

, You should also try to get a macro sense of the planet, where you consider if and how the planet exists within a larger system of planets. Maybe the planet is light years away from the nearest planet or perhaps it is under the domain of a larger planet in the solar system.You should consider where the planet is located exactly within a larger system.
The rules of the planet may also be based on its position in a solar system, where it is limited by a larger planet or in control of smaller planets. Think about the positioning of the planet in relation to other planets and celestial bodies, such as stars, meteorites, and black holes.

Know you are not alone.,
Talk about it with your friends.,
Allow yourself to fantasize.,
Write fan fiction.,
Share your work with others.",How to Cope With Being in Love With a Fictional Character1," You are not the only person out there who is attracted to a fictional character. Chances are, you aren’t even the only person attracted to that particular character.


Even without falling in love, many people can take emotional and verbal cues from characters they see portrayed in fiction. Romantic feelings are just one way fictional characters can affect our real life.;
, Chances are you aren’t the only one in your circle of friends to follow a certain type of fiction. Even if they do not care for the exact book you are reading, or show you are watching, they will understand some of the feelings you have., Fantasy, creating a false world around your romance, is a normal reaction to love that has its limits. In this case, the limit is that the object of your affection does not exist.Your fantasy can take any kinds of forms. You may picture a physical relationship, or maybe imagine getting married and living your lives together. A more active imagination might even consider how the relationship would end, including divorce, combat, or death. All things are possible with your imagination.

, One way to express your love for a fictional character is to explore your feelings in writing. Create a story involving the object of your affection, and build a situation where the two of you finally meet.Let your imagination run wild. If you are love with this character, consider what he or she does that attracts you, and depict them doing more of it. Include yourself, creating a world where the two of you can be together.
If you’re more of a visual person, try sketching or drawing your fictional character instead. Visual work can be just as imaginative as the written word.

, Post your story to a website that publishes fan fiction. You can find sites that cater to general audiences, or serve fans of a particular book or show. This also gives you an opportunity to provide feedback for other people’s stories.Just remember, if you are a character in your stories, to avoid posting personal details. You don’t want someone to be able to track you down based on private information that you made easily available online.
Some people have been able to make a lot of money off of their fan fiction. These are the exceptions, so while you may be willing to publish your work online, don’t be surprised if only a few other diehards read it."
"
Figure out if your love is hurting your life.,
Remember that the character isn’t real.,
Recognize stereotyping.,
Cut yourself off.",How to Cope With Being in Love With a Fictional Character2," Daydreaming or fantasizing is fine, but your fantasy should not take over your life. If you find yourself wanting to get out of social situations, or avoiding real relationships, then you have taken your love to an unhealthy place.If you are unable to stop fantasizing on your own, consider therapy or antidepressants to help break free. Discuss this option with a doctor if you are concerned about your ability to function.

, In the end, you fell for a character, someone who does not exist. Make sure that is clear in your mind, even if it means stating it over and over again.Try to look for your character’s flaws or negative aspects. If he doesn’t have any, that itself is a flaw. No one is perfect, and you wouldn’t be okay with a real relationship where nothing was wrong with your partner.Sometimes it helps to have other people say these things to you to make them more real. Discuss your desire to cut yourself off from this fictional world with your friends. They can help you of things that are real, and what isn’t.

, Especially in visual fiction, many characters are portraying stereotypes of people. A good way to get over your character is to remember that he is just a representation of reality. Real people aren’t necessarily as perfect, or romantic, or witty, or uncomplicated (or whatever adjective you choose) as your fictional character.


This step is also important when considering how you react to characters you don’t like. Certain types of people are depicted in specific ways to get a reaction from you. For example, teacher characters can be shown as cranky old people who want their students to fail. While some of these people exist, that hardly represents them, and shouldn’t affect the way you interact with real teachers, especially those who are younger and friendly., This is good advice for ending relationships with real people too. If you want to stop thinking about and caring about someone, cut her out of your life. This will give you room to grow, and be able to live your life without her.Don’t read the books, watch the shows or movies, or do anything involving that character. This also means avoiding websites that talk about this fictional world. You wouldn’t want to stalk an ex on Facebook, so don’t give yourself a similar opportunity here.

Remember that it’s okay to grieve.,
Vent your feelings.,
Find ways to remember your character.,
Keep reading or watching.,
Remember that someone else controls your character’s fate.",How to Cope With Being in Love With a Fictional Character3," You have let this character become part of your life, especially if he or she has appeared in something you have read or watched for a long time. It is natural to feel some sense of loss.For teenagers and young adults who have not yet experienced death, fictional worlds can be a good entrance to thinking about and discussing the issue. Consider sharing your feelings with others. You may find this can be a good way to start talking about serious issues in your real life as well., If your favorite character has been killed off, or written out of the fictional world, you’ll probably be angry. Let others know about it. You will be experiencing some extreme feelings, and sometimes it’s better just to let those out.Just be careful about spoilers when dealing with popular books, movies, or TV shows. In the modern world, people don’t always experience things together, meaning some people won’t see things as soon as you do. If you posting on a public forum like Twitter, keep your comments vague, saying “I can’t believe that happened” rather than “Why did they kill my favorite character.” Keep the details for people you know are on the same schedule as you., Reflect on what made him so important to the story, and what made you fall for him. Talk to friends or others about the character, why his death is so frustrating, and what you liked most.Reread or rewatch the parts of the book or show where your fictional love appears. The great thing about fictional worlds like this is that we can always go back.
Look for other ways to keep the character in front of you, whether writing your own fan fiction, or drawing the character so you can see him again.

, Good fiction will deal with what follows from a character’s death. After she is gone, stick with the show or book so you can see the other characters react. This can help you accept what has happened.Alternatively, you can take a break from the show or book. If you are truly emotionally afflicted by what has happened, you’ll want to take some time away from this fictional world to make sure it isn’t overly affecting your real life.

, The difficult thing about fictional characters is that their story does end at some point. In the end, all of their actions are the result of someone else’s imagination. That means only that person has control of what happens. Even if your character didn’t die, the book or show would eventually end."

, Notice how it says that he is the ""Strong God"" Philiicities. That's his title. Maybe he always has to be referred to in that context, otherwise your characters have broken the rules of your work's universe and must be condemned to death, thrown into the wilderness, or something like that.

, Do they gather around a large shrine in groups of eight and chant a crazy song? Or perhaps they put their feet together while doing a handstand with their eyes closed? It's your call.

, The Strong God Philiicities' symbols, for example, are the Shield, representing the ability to protect others, and the Sword, representing the ability to fight your enemies.

, If you need more, proceed to the next part.

, The same considerations apply for any God or Goddess you make up.


For example, Caring Goddess Aria: She must always be referred to as the ""Caring Goddess"" Aria, she is worshiped by gathering around a large tree in a pond and closing your eyes while in a circle with other people (the circle must be large enough to surround the tree), where you then say your prayers to her and leave after saying ""Peace"". Her symbols are the humble Tree, which represents growth, and the tiny Egg, representing something you must care for.

, For example, the Caring Goddess Aria is the Strong God Philiicites' sister. You have the protector and the caretaker, who are also brother and sister, respectively. It's a perfect match.

, You might want to have a lot, one, or only two. Your call.

, How did your deity or deities come to be? How did they create the universe or world? Did one of them try to destroy their creation? These are the kinds of things your backstory must answer, and more.


Read books about creation myths and other myths related to deities. Joseph Campbell's various collection of stories about myths is a good place to refer to. Some of these works can be found by searching for his name online.

, This step might be most applicable if you're making a video game but it depends on how much detail you wish to incorporate into your creative work of any type. Some people (like the members of the Shoddy Cast) like to read all the in-game lore, so you might as well make a huge holy book for the players to read if they take the countless hours to do so (that and people might make your religion real if your fictitious work is famous enough, so they'll need something).

, Make the deity's temperament clear from their actions or attitudes (although it's nice to complicate things and show a little of good and evil in your deities, depending on the context.) Make it so that the readers or players can make this decision for themselves, based on the backstory, the holy book (if you have made a detailed one or you've detailed passages from it in your writing), and their own personal preferences.


For example, the Strong God Philiicities saw the planet of Itchidora's inhabitants as a nuisance and began to attempt to wipe out the planet before the Caring Goddess Aria trapped him in a prison in the middle of the planet. Some of your characters might think that the Strong God Philiicities was misunderstood and would gladly die for a god, while others might side with the Caring Goddess Aria and decide that the Strong God Philiicities deserved to be imprisoned. Either that or some people might be mind-controlled by the Strong God Philiicities (or struck a deal) and are trying to free him.

Select manga that suits your interests and personality.,
Begin with the first manga in the series.,
Lay the book down with the spine on the right side.,
Start on the side with the title, author’s name, and edition.",How to Read Manga2," After you explore the different types and genres of manga and familiarize yourself with some popular series, it’s time to make a decision about what type of manga you’ll be reading. Go with your gut and choose something that really excites you!

, More often than not, manga are serialized and contain many stories. Make sure you start with the first story and work your way through the series chronologically. If a series is popular enough, its episodes might be published together in a collected volume. The issue and series are usually printed on the cover.

, Manga should be read with the magazine or book spine on the right. As you lay the manga down on a table, make sure the leaf ends are on the left and the spine is positioned to the right. This is ""backwards"" compared to English books.

, It’s important that you begin reading manga on the correct side. The front cover will usually contain the title of the manga along with the name of the author or authors. Flip the manga over if you come across a warning that says, “You’re reading the wrong way!”"

Read panels from right to left and in an up to down sequence.,
Read dialog balloons from right to left and up to down.,
Read black panel backgrounds as a flashback.,
Read fading panel backgrounds as a transition from the past to the present.",How to Read Manga3," Like the pages of manga, individual panels should be read in a right to left sequence. Start reading each page by beginning with the panel that is in the upper right hand corner of the page. Read right to left and when you reach the edge of the page, go to the panel in the far-right of the following row of panels.If the panels are all arranged vertically, begin with the topmost panel.
Even if the panels don't line up perfectly, stick to the right to left rule. Begin with the highest row or column and make your way - right to left - to the lowest row or column.

, Dialog balloons, which contain conversational text between characters, should also be read in a right to left sequence. Begin in the upper right hand corner of the individual panel and read the dialog balloons from right to left, and then up to down., When a manga panel has a background that is black, it is usually indicating that the events illustrated in the panel happened prior to the story being depicted in the manga. Black backgrounds signal a flashback to an earlier event or time period., A page that contains a panel with a black background at the top, then panels with fading shades of gray, and finally a panel with a white background is depicting a time shift from the past (black panel) to the present (white panel)."
"
Read a sigh bubble as an expression of relief or a character’s exasperation.,
Interpret lines across a character’s facial area as blushing.,
Read a nose bleed as lust, not injury.,
Interpret a sweat drop as embarrassment.,
Read facial shadows and dark auras as anger, irritability, or depression.",How to Read Manga4," Oftentimes manga characters will be illustrated with an empty dialogue bubble at or below their mouth. This indicates that character is sighing, and can be interpreted as either relief or exasperation., Manga characters are often depicted as blushing with lines sketched across the nose and cheeks. Interpret these expressions as illustrations of a character being embarrassed, overjoyed, or even having romantic feelings toward another character., When a manga character appears on page with a nosebleed, this usually means they are having lustful thoughts about another character or are gazing lustfully at another character, usually a beautiful woman., Sometimes a sweat drop may appear near a character’s head. This usually indicates the character is embarrassed or feeling extremely uncomfortable in a given situation. This is usually less severe than the embarrassment depicted by blushing., When a manga character appears in a panel with a purple, gray, or black blob or shadow floating in the background, this is usually indicative of the negative energy surrounding the character."

Observe and research manga.,
Learn how to draw.,
Write a script.,
Make the basics of the manga.,
Fill in the details.,
Scan in your pages.,
Using a picture editing software such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, clean up your lineart and make sure it looks professional.,
Optionally, colour and shade the manga.,
Add in the speech bubbles and effects using your picture editing software.,
Try getting published by one of these methods:


If you want to take the easy way out, use a website such as Comicgenesis.com and publish it as a free webcomic, but the only money you can make from this will be from merchandise and donations - not a good way to go, if you plan to be a full time manga artist.",How to Make Manga," Learn the different styles, such as shonen (boys) and shoujo (girls), and the differences between them. Understand the techniques used.;
, A manga tells a story in pictures, and your story will be a little limited if all your characters are stick figures. Using your knowledge of the manga styles, develop an individual style instead of sticking to the stereotypes of manga. If you can't draw, find an artist, but you have to be an excellent writer to stand a chance finding a good artist.

, As with all stories, you'll need to plan well. Know exactly what's going to happen in your story, view it in your head like a movie or an anime before writing it out. If you are working with an artist, you'll need to give them a precise, vivid description or a basic storyboard for them to understand your script.

, When you were writing the script, you should have known exactly how you were going to lay out your manga, but if not, draw out the panels and draw sketches onto paper to represent characters. If you're working with an artist, ask them if they want to do this or if you should do it for them. At this stage, since you're not making the details, it doesn't matter if your artist doesn't fully understand the script and gets something wrong, as you'll be able to correct them or change it without destroying any solid work. Do not add in the speech bubbles yet.

, Flesh out the characters, turn your basic plan into a work of art. If you're working with an artist, leave this stage up to them. Still do not add in the speech bubbles.

, Alternatively, take a picture with your webcam or smartphone (it will be lower quality).

, A graphics tablet is an extremely good idea for using this, so you can edit anything with the same precision as with a pencil. Again, leave this stage to the artist if they have any graphics experience.

, If you intend to make a lot of manga on a weekly basis, you probably will not want to colour it, but a one-shot manga or a short graphic novel would be good in colour.

, Keep it clean - do not colour-code your speech bubbles or add in unnecessary effects. If you're working with an artist, you may want him or her to do some of the more complicated effects, but anybody can make ordinary speech bubbles.

, Full time Manga artist usually average out to about $30k to $35k yearly. obviously the more publicity you get the higher you will get paid.
Find a publisher in your own country. If this is your first manga, this is definitely the way to go. You may think that it will not sell, as it is not of Japanese origin, but with the increasing popularity of manga across the world, you may be surprised.
If you are determined to publish in Japan, however, prepare yourself for dedication and disappointment. Becoming a manga artist in Japan is not an easy thing to do, however, it isn't impossible. Try taking part in a contest that manga magazines hold. This is the easiest way to establish yourself in the Japanese manga industry.

Learn how to draw in a realistic way.,
Study and compare the styles of successful manga.,
Keep in mind what you enjoy drawing and what you find difficult or time-consuming.,
Understand your own genre and target audience.,
Leave room for characterisation.,
Work out the degree of realism in the writing of the manga you're drawing for.,
Practice!",How to Develop Your Own Manga Style," Manga, as an art style, is simply a simplistic, exaggerated version of realism - developing your own style is simply a matter of which proportions to change and which details to forget. If you don't know how to draw realism, then you don't really know what you're exaggerating or why.;
, Find out the genre and target audience of the manga that you're studying, and compare the styles of those which have a similar genre and target audience. With that in mind, try to figure out why the artist has decided to exaggerate and simplify certain features, and why those styles are popular amongst their target audience. The manga that you are studying do not necessarily need to be manga that you like - only manga that's popular amongst others.

, Whilst you shouldn't use this as an excuse to neglect improvement, a style that simplifies or even removes certain hard-to-draw features may prove to be an advantage to you.

, As you should have figured out from step 2, realism won't win you any points in a child's comedy, but it will if you're making an adult's horror manga. Acceptable levels of detail and exaggeration will vary between audience and genre.

, The more you simplify, the more difficult it will be for the appearances of your characters to vary without going to extreme measures. Physical features are important for distinguishing your characters and also for characterisation, so ensure that your style doesn't require everybody to have the same face.

, For example, nobody will mind surreal elements if you're writing a zany fantasy manga, but outlandish appearances will strain your readers' suspension of disbelief in a realistic manga.

, The more you practice drawing, the more your style will develop. This is probably the most important step. You need to tune your style before you go on to make any actual manga, otherwise stylistic inconsistencies (from where you've changed your mind) will start cropping up - and your readers will definitely notice if your style undergoes drastic changes, even if it's gradual.

Take appropriate courses in high school.,
Seek out others with similar interests.,
Consider an art degree.,
Practice your drawing.,
Use free resources.,
Brainstorm ideas for plot.,
Plot out a story.,
Make your characters.,
Develop a style.,
Create your manga.,
Get your work ready for a publisher.,
Present it to a publisher.,
Enter competitions.,
Consider self-publishing.",How to Become a Manga Ka," While you're still in high school, start building your artistic skills by taking art classes. Drawing and painting would both be helpful for building your skill set to draw manga art, and even a general art class could potentially help you build skills.In addition, take literature and writing courses. As a mangaka, you'll be creating a story line, as well, so make sure to spend time focusing on how to develop a story.;
, Working with other people on similar goals can help encourage you in yours. In addition, you can learn new skills from other people in the group. Try to find a group interested in manga at your school or in your area. You could also join an art club to help increase your skills.


If you can't find one to join, consider creating one. There's bound to be others who have similar interests.
Look for classes or groups at your local library or with your park and recreation department.

, While you don't absolutely need a degree to be a mangaka, formal education can help give you the professional skills you need. A bachelor's degree in fine arts is a good choice, as it will help you build up your artistic skills. However, you can also go much more specific. A number of universities in the United States offer degrees in comic art,and if you're willing to travel to Japan, you can earn bachelor's or master's degrees specifically in manga art.In addition, think about double majoring or minoring in literature or writing. Developing your writing skills will be helpful in writing stories later.

, Formal schooling increases your skill set, but so does practicing on your own. Just like learning an instrument, practicing drawing will make you better over time. You can start out by imitating characters you like, but you can move on to creating your own characters and panels.In fact, comic artists recommend putting in practice every day. Make sure you are setting aside at least an hour a day to work on your artwork., You don't need formal education to learn from professionals. You'll find many resources are available to you for free. You can find online courses for free on sites like YouTube, Coursera, and Princeton's website, all of which you can use to develop your drawing skills. You'll also find resources available at your local library. Make use of the resources available to develop your skills.Don't just get books on drawing. Look at books on writing comic books, as well as books just on writing.
If your library doesn't have what you want, most libraries will order books from other libraries for you to use.
If you are wanting to become a mangaka, you obviously have some familiarity with the genre. Nonetheless, make sure you are reading widely in the genre to see what is getting published. Don't just read your favorite mangas over and over. Branch out into ones you normally wouldn't be drawn to, just to see what else manga has to offer. Plus, exposing yourself to different styles will help you work towards your own style.

, Even though manga comics are visual-based, you still need a plot to drive the story. Think about the stories that you love to read, and how you can make your own contribution. Manga has a wide variety of stories, from horror to love stories, so feel free to let your brain run wild. The key is to be thinking about your story all the time. If you limit your brainstorming to just when you sit down to write the story, you're not giving your creativity the time it needs to build a good story.Try starting with one idea on a piece of paper. Build off that idea by connecting dots to other ideas you come up with.
Another way to get your creativity flowing is just to free write. Start with a word or image, and just start writing until you hit on something you like. Once you do, start developing that idea.
Pick an idea you enjoy. Working on your own manga is going to take some hard work. If you don't pick an idea you love, you'll have a hard time motivating yourself to work on it., Once you have an idea for a story, you need to work beyond that because manga comics generally need more planning than a normal novel. You need to create an outline of how your story is going to move from beginning to end.Start by figuring out the main plot points. What's the driving force of your story? What are the major events? Make sure to include setting, as well. Think about the background you want for your setting and how that will affect your story. For example, an urban setting is very different from a rural setting in terms of story.
Move on to going scene-by-scene, so you have an idea of what the main scenes will look like.

, When creating your characters, you need to think both about their place in the story (personality) and their physical appearance. To keep them consistent throughout your story, you should develop character sheets that outline both types of traits.


For appearance, you can simply draw the character in a model or turnaround sheet. Basically, you draw the character from every angle, figuring out clothing, hair, and proportion, so that you can recreate the character in the same manner throughout your manga. You can also create a 3D model using something like clay instead.For their personality and personal traits, write down traits for the character, such as personality quirks, personal beliefs, religion, favorite foods and color, and so on. Don't forget things like personality flaws. No one is perfect, and no character should be either. Also think about things like motivation.Create sheets for all your characters, but make sure your main characters are the most fleshed out.

, Really, developing a style comes from drawing for a while, and using your creativity to figure out what you like. However, it's important to pick something that's doable. You don't want to start on a style that's hard for you to maintain over time. Use one that you enjoy and find easy to draw.That doesn't mean that it must look simple, just that it's simple enough that you can put in the hours it takes to draw it through a whole story or a series of stories.
Explore different styles. Once you see what others do, you can see what you like and don't like. That will help you figure out what you like in your own style. Try not to just copy any one style exactly. You want yours to be unique in some aspect.

, Working scene by scene, create your manga. Begin by sketching out the scenes, blocking where the dialogue and characters will go; remember, you're just creating a bare-bones sketch to see where things will go. Move on to fully drawing out the scenes, but use pencil so that you can make changes. Later, fill in with ink and color. Many mangas are not colored, due to cost restrictions, so you can work just in black and white if you prefer. In fact, many publishers prefer black and white.How you create your manga is up to you, as many manga artists work in digital formats nowadays.If you prefer to work digitally, consider using a manga drawing app. These tools are designed for creating comics, so they will make it easier for you to work.Don't forget to make your text legible. If people can't read your text, they won't read your comic.

, When looking at publishers, consider what types of work they tend to print, and then pick one that fits your style and theme. Make sure you follow all their guidelines to the letter, including maturity level. For instance, most will want PG or PG13.Most publishers will want a copy of your manga, not the original. You can make a copy on a high quality copier or use a laser printer.
Pay attention to sizing formats for the company you are sending it to.
Most companies will expect you to have the basics of drawing down, such as proper proportions. If you aren't there yet, you may want to wait awhile.

, One simple way to find a publisher or magazine you want to contact is to look at the back of your favorite mangas. You can call up the publisher and schedule an appointment to be seen and show your work. It's actually a common practice, and many mangakas began in this manner. You can also look them up online.You need to have your work ready to show. It may not be published, but many publishers will give you advice on how to do better. Others will hire you to work for them.
If you can't visit in person, many publishers take submissions by mail.

, Some people become mangakas by submitting their work through contests run by the publishers. Most contests will focus on Japanese-language contests, but a few accept submissions in other languages. Sometimes, mangakas are hired from these contests.Morning Manga and Comic Zeon both sponsor manga contests in other languages, so find their websites if you want to learn more.

, Self-publishing is becoming more popular in all writing and comic book genres, especially in a digital world where you can do so much on your own personal computer. You can do the same thing with manga, and sometimes, you can even be recruited to be a mangaka from your online work.If you self-publish, you can either take the route of an ebook, or you can publish a serial manga on a blog. You can self-publish ebooks through sites like Ebooks Direct or Amazon. You can publish free blogs through any number of sites, even sites like Blogger or Tumblr.
If you take this route, you'll need to market yourself on platforms like social media by posting about your work and encouraging others to read and follow you.

Decide what type of manga you are interested in.,
Learn the rating system.,
Read anime publications.,
Find places to get manga, including the following:


Anime/Manga magazines like Shonen Jump and Shojo Beat -- monthly serialized anime compilations which allow you to sample many titles at a time.,
Read manga from the farthest right page to the farthest left, and read each individual page from the top right to the bottom left.,
Find fellow fans.",How to Get Into Manga," There are several different kinds to choose from, usually grouped by the gender and age of the target audience, including:



Shojo: Manga designed to target 12-18 year-old females through character-driven stories. Popular shojo themes include: magical girl (see below), school romance, historical romance, modern romance, science fiction, sports, Gothic horror/vampires, and boys love (yaoi) manga. Fruits Basket, Hot Gimmick, Fushigi Yugi, Peach Girl, Vampire Knight, Nothing But Loving You, Emma, Godchild, Ouran HighSchool Host Club and Kare Kano are examples of shoujo manga.


Magical girl (mahhokka) is a popular subgenre of shojo featuring young girls who use their superhuman powers to fight evil and protect the Earth. Examples of magical girl manga include: Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Alice 19th, Shugo Chara, Tokyo Mew Mew and Wedding Peach.


Bishoujo titles involve extremely cute girls or animals. Think cuteness overload. Example titles include Hamtaro.

Shonen: Action-themed stories written for boys. Shonen manga is usually involves humorous plots featuring male protagonists. Camaraderie between boys and men in sports team and fighting squads are often plot elements. Shonen titles often feature attractive female characters with exaggerated features. Example titles include: Naruto, One Piece, ""D. Gray-Man"", Gon, Ranma 1/2, Slam Dunk, Lupin III, Bleach, Inuyasha, Prince of Tennis, the aforementioned Love Hina, Gun Blaze West, Rurouni Kenshin, HunterxHunter, Tenchi Muyo!, Initial D and Full Metal Panic!.

Mecha is a common subgenre of shonen involving giant robots. Mecha titles include Gundam Wing, Voltron and Big O.


Shonen-Ai: Stories involving affection between boy characters targeting a mainly female audience. Shonen-ai manga is aimed at teenage girls and usually involves feminine, effeminate characters resembling boy bands like NSYNC.

Seinen manga targets college-aged men, although some titles are aimed at men well into their 40s. Unlike shounen manga, seinen manga features a wider variety of artistic styles and subject matter ranging from avant-garde to pornographic. While seinen manga contains many of the same themes as shounen manga, it is more rooted in reality with a stronger emphasis on plot. Works of manga that are the most acclaimed for their depth and maturity, such as Maison Ikoku and Ghost in the Shell, come from the Seinen genre. Other popular seinen titles include Lone Wolf & Cub, Golgo 13, Eagle, Death Note and Monster. Chobits is one more on the adult side.

Josei is the female equivalent of seinen manga and considered the manga equivalent of a Harlequin novel. Most of the josei manga found in the United States, fits into the yaoi genre (see below). Storylines usually involve: office life, marriage, babies, infidelity, families, and romance. Non-yaoi titles include Paradise Kiss, Happy Mania, Tramps Like Us, Blue, Walking Butterfly, Midnight Secretary, and Honey and Clover.
Yaoi is manga involving graphic depictions of homosexuality. The vast majority of yaoi manga is produced by women, for women. This is the more mature form of shonen-ai.

;
, Because some manga contains adult themes, there is a rating system set up for manga which is very similar to that for video games and movies. Some U.S. manga publishers use the following ratings:


A (All Ages)
Y (Youth, 10+)
T (Teen ages 13+)
OT or T+ (Older Teen, 16+)
M (Mature, 18+)

, New Type, AnimeInsider and Animerica are good sources to turn to for manga reviews.

,
Bookstores Many large chain bookstores like Borders and Barnes and Nobles have sections for manga and graphic novels.
Online Sellers Many manga online manga shops can be found simply by searching for manga in Google.
Another alternative to buying manga is reading it for free online. Sites like MangaFox have thousands of series online.
Online Rental Services Just like you can rent movies online through Netflix and Blockbuster, there are online rental services such as Anime TakeOut that allow you to rent books of manga.
Your Local Library: Yes, you read that correctly: your local library. More and more libraries these days have sections devoted to graphic novels and manga to encourage ""reluctant readers"" and bring more traffic into the library. If your library doesn't have the titles you want, you can often request items or obtain them from another library via Interlibrary Loan.

, Some manga exported out of Japan is reversed, so that it is read from top left to bottom right. If this seems confusing to you, don't worry, open up a manga like you would open a regular book, and there will often be a page that will tell you how to read it.

, See if there is a manga/anime group at your school or in your town. Many metro areas host manga meetups. Many colleges and high schools now have manga and anime clubs. In addition, you can attend anime conventions which bring fellow manga/anime fans together.

Learn from the other manga ka.,
Write your story.,
Create your characters.,
Make sure your workspace and tools are in order.,
Be patient and ready for disappointment.,
Practice.",How to Be a Pro Manga Ka," This way, you can make your manga interesting. Just don't copy it completely. Learn from popular manga(s). Why are they so popular? What is the interesting part? Most factors that make these manga(s) popular are:


Interesting story: this is an important part. An interesting story means interested readers. A more intriguing story goes deep and flows in clues, or rather, bits and pieces throughout the manga. This helps grip the reader to it, and makes them want to find out more so it can all piece together.
Easy-to-understand story: clarity is number one! Whatever the manga is, if it's not understandable, the readers will close your pages. If your clues and plot twists do not piece together as they should, the reader will be left puzzled and rather indignant. It doesn't have to piece together right away; if you prolong the manga in issues and volumes, that can wait.
Nice graphics: the artwork is the most important part of a manga. It's what catches the reader's eye, and quite a lot of effort should be put into this artwork. Manga-kas regularly worry about technicalities such as backgrounds, panel angles, and anatomy, which are styled to the artist's original form.
Exciting panels: the media is an art! From the background (detailed, with added effect), panel's shape (square, circle, bleeding), until the flow (up, then big, then small). This will help your manga keep a form that is easy to follow.
Character's personality: this will make them unique! The personality stereotypes like being brash, prone to blanking, being forgetful, being grave and serious or excessively emotional, etc, will make them easy to recognize. But properly-made characters should go deeper than stereotypes. The most important part of a character is how he or she is used in the plot, and how his or her past made them how they are today. In addition, one might consider catchphrases such as ""kaze~"" or ""After all, I am ___~~"". But these are rare, and made only for strangely outgoing characters. Overdoing it will annoy the reader.
Additional effects, this is also useful for conveying overt emotion. Something like camera angles, out-of-frame, zoom in and zoom out, are also useful when aiding the panel set.;
, Manga is a set of pictures to tell a story you make. So, decide your beginning story. Match it to your story's genre. And for good, don't copy! Maybe you're a fan of Naruto, and you're making a manga of the ninja world. Put that off, be creative! There are still many stories to be made. But still, the decision is in your hands. For inspiration, use the media that you see and involve yourself in regularly, or match it to an idea or even a dream. You might take a bit of the story from one manga, then a bit of another and so on. You might put that interesting little bit from, say, Shingeki no Kyojin, together with that awesome dream you had/that random daydream in math class. Mash it up, mix it together, edit it to your own tastes; most importantly, have fun. Just make sure it's in your own interests, and that it matches the genre you aim for!

, Dynamic designs are fine for shonen {action} manga, but try to stay clear of stereotypical designs, like ninja robes, katanas, and spiky outrageously colored hair. Try to match original concepts to the characters' personalities. You character might be a tomboy, and she likes weird clothing combinations. Maybe you can dress her up in combat boots and mini-shorts, along with a tucked-in vintage-ish shirt. She might hang out with lots of guys, so she talks like them too. Whatever you do, make it original, make it memorable. Make you character one that your readers will instantly recognize, even from afar and say, ""Hey, that's from 's manga, , right?!""

, One cannot become a manga-ka on his own with just a pencil and paper. To complete professional work, you must have the tools necessary to ink and tone {or color} it. Multi-liner pens are a start and Deleter* screentones are available on their web-store. Although, granted, these tools are not cheap, so be ready to save some serious money for these if you are serious about this as a career. Otherwise, it is not worth the time and money to simply dabble.

, You don't become experienced in a week. And since OEL manga is at an all-time low, get ready for high expectations and denials. They are a part of the business, and without patience, you can never succeed. Just keep trying until your work is done and a publisher accepts your submissions. We recommend starting out small, and building up a fan-base for your work. But never give up; it will make your work a burden more than a hobby, a joy, or even a job.

, Learn from your mistakes and take in what you can. Reference anatomy from photographs, and learn intricate style, often ranging from dynamic and chunky with hard lines to delicate and uniquely original, from artists that interest you.

"
"
So you have heard of manga, and want to become a fan.,
There are a lot of types on manga.,
If you don't like the idea of sitting at a computer reading it, Borders sell a nice selection of manga.,
If you have little pocket money, you can also go to the library.,
You may need to learn a bit about Japanese culture, food etc.,
You may find manga unusual at first, but after a while it becomes a great hobby and can make great conversations with friends at school etc.

",How to Be a Manga Fan," First you need to find the manga. There are a lot of ways to get your hands on manga. One way is to go onto manga websites like onemanga.com. This site has updated manga, completely free to read.;
, Shonen (for boys) and Shoujo (for girls) are the most popular. Here are some explanations:


Shonen is for young boys and is usually full of action and adventure. A lot of girls read Shonen too. Eg Naruto, One piece, DragonBall, Pokémon.
Shojo is for young girls and usually has a lot of romance. You don't have to be very girly to read Shojo though. Sailor Moon, Tokyo Mew Mew, Fruits Basket, Shugo Chara.
Doujinshi is produced by fans and is unofficial. A lot of popular mangas are used for doujinshi where the story-line is changed somehow.
Yaoi or Shonen-ai is about male relationships. Eg Loveless, Gravitation,Super Lovers.
Yuri or Shoujo-ai is about female relationships. Eg Shiroi Heya no Futari.
Hentai is NOT for children and it is pornography with no plot or a poor plot in mayor cases. There is also Redikomi (manga with adult content for women) and Seijin (the same, for men).
Gekiga is like our (the Western countries) type of ""Graphic Novels"".
Kodomo is for very young children who cannot read very well. This might be good to buy for your little brothers or sisters if they have taken an interest in your collection.

, Just ask an assistant.

, A lot of libraries have manga now due to it's increase of popularity.


Once you have bought and read a manga book, you can find a few friends who are also interested in manga and swap.
Remember to always support a mangaka (manga author) by purchasing some of their works if you enjoyed them.

, before reading manga, as some mangas do not explain clearly some of the things mentioned in it.


The internet has a lot on Japanese culture but there is also library books too. You will eventually learn a lot from manga and will not need to keep looking up words after a while.
You may also learn a bit of Japanese while reading them (Romaji, if English translated) but you will not need to be fluent in Japanese to read them!!

",How to Act Like Mikasa Ackerman," Before you dive into your new persona, you must know exactly why Mikasa does what she does. Become Mikasa's number one fan! Re-read the manga and re-watch the anime, this time focusing your attention on Mikasa and her actions. Contemplate her actions. What does Mikasa like? Why is Mikasa so brave? What does she wear? Who is her family? Who are her friends? If you need help, you can try reading Mikasa's article on the Shingeki No Kyojin wiki.;
, Personality is the most important part of acting like Mikasa. You can look like Mikasa all you want, but if you're nothing like her, people won't be convinced.


Externally, Mikasa is somewhat cold and silent, but naturally gifted when it comes to slaying titans and using her 3-D Maneuver Gear. To act like Mikasa, you need to shed any hyperactive or talkative tendencies you have, as Mikasa is neither of those things. Rather, try for a mysterious, but strong silent-type that Mikasa Ackerman exemplifies. She is known for not being the star of the party. If you're going to act like Mikasa, you don't need to try to be in the spotlight - the spotlight will usually find you.






Internally, Mikasa is determined, loyal and somewhat vulnerable beneath it all. She doesn't give up easily, nor does she do anything without putting all her effort into it. Mikasa is passionate in all that she does, and has a deep relationship with a small circle of friends.







, You're not going to become Mikasa Ackerman overnight. If you're into roleplaying, make Mikasa your muse. If you like fanfiction, write a short story featuring Mikasa as the main character. Think up a situation and ask, ""What would Mikasa do?"" The point here is that you need to totally immerse yourself in Mikasa's head.

, Now that you have become an expert in all things Mikasa, you should begin practicing her traits in real life.


If you really want, you could even change your appearance to look more like Mikasa, although this is not necessary. If your desire to act like Mikasa is only temporary, you could purchase Mikasa-related cosplay gear, such as her red scarf or a Survey Corps uniform, or even make it yourself. Keep in mind that cosplaying can get very expensive, whether you are buying or creating your gear.

Know what critics expect.",How to Name Your Fanfiction," Come up with a temporary title to serve as a placeholder while you're working on your fanfiction. Don't overthink it: anything will do as a working title, as you will be changing it when or before you complete the story. Working titles can round out the presentation of your story while you deal with the writing process, giving you something to look at other than a nagging blank at the top of the page.


It can be helpful to choose a working title that deals with some central idea, character, event or motif in your fanfiction. These are some of the factors you'll be considering when finalizing your title, so having a fundamental concept of what label describes your story can prevent you from having to concoct one out of the blue later on.
Improvising a working title has the beneficial creative effect of forcing the writer to distill what is important about the story to them into a single word or phrase.;
, Your reader will likely also be a fan of the work your fanfiction is based on, so strive to present to them something fresh while staying in the vein of your source material. Fanfiction will be somewhat exclusive to certain readers by nature, but keep your work accessible by selecting a title that will interest even non-fans.Titillate fans of the material you're calling on with specific references. Using the names of well-known characters or other details from the source material as part of your title (e.g. ""Murphy's Bargain"" or ""Journey to Kyrandia"") will excite fans while also giving them a sense of what to expect from your story.

, Your fanfiction is about something. It is set somewhere. It features certain characters. Any of these can be a jumping-off point for finding just the right title. Your story has something to say, so your title should say something about your story. Use the inventory of details you've drawn on to craft your fanfiction to single out one idea or set of ideas that is arresting enough to carry the weight of your story.Since fanfiction takes creative license with other, established works, highlight the originality of your story by using one of your own fictional inventions as part of your title.
Though you can get away with it when naming a novel or short story, don't get too abstract with the title of your fanfiction. Your title should be explicit enough to inform the reader of the type of fanfiction it is but also offer some concrete new image.

, Don't bore your reader or leave them guessing with a vaguely-written title. The name of your fanfiction, like your writing, should be full of dynamic, active language that evokes a response in the reader and moves them to read your work.


A title like ""Man the Cannons"" is more effective than one like ""The Great Sea Battle"" because it is indicative of action.
Remember to keep your title consistent with the type of fanfiction you're writing. For instance, a story about Dr. Who might simply be titled ""Dr. Who: A Case of Star Sickness,"" while a fanfiction about Indiana Jones would want to retain the formatting of the titles of the source material; ""Indiana Jones and the Emerald of Skull Island.""

, Unless you have a certain idea that you're resolved to use as your title, play around with multiple titles. Titles are like dates: it's unlikely you'll find ""the one"" until you've been through a few that didn't work out. Experiment with different styles and modes of presentation for your title, and get creative. Once you have a short list of potential winners, you can pare them down from there.Ernest Hemingway came up with two defunct titles, ""The World's Room"" and ""They Who Get Shot"" before settling on ""A Farewell to Arms."" Had he not, the book's final title might have been some reworking of the original and been far less memorable.

, This is the cardinal rule of writing fiction. Since the title is what sells your story, you want to ensure that the name you've given it isn't derivative or a rehash of something else. The most memorable titles are the ones that don't follow formulas. Be bold when naming your fanfiction and try to give it a unique spin that makes readers take notice.


Avoid cliches. Many titles take a safe but uninteresting template approach (e.g. ""The Legend of..."") and get lost in the sea of nearly identical titles. Your title should be something catchy and repeatable that doesn't sound too much like something your reader has heard time and time again.
Resist the urge to turn your title into a pun. It can be tempting, but it's never as clever as you think it is. At best, a pun title draws the reader's attention to it and away from the meaning of the story; at worst, it can be instantly offputting.

, See what comes up. Someone else may have already thought of it before, or it may be too similar to something else. Once you've verified that your title is original, see what other results your search produces; this is a good time to find out if some part of your title might be obscure or overused, and what else people are searching for when they come across your fanfiction., Now that you've got a name for your fanfiction, go back over your story with this title as your new frame of reference. Does it do an adequate job summing up or characterizing your story? Does it make sense in context after reading it, or will readers fail to apprehend its meaning? Just as you proofread your writing to look for inconsistencies, double-check your title to make sure that it's a fit for the completed work.


Rereading your fanfiction will give you another opportunity to mine for other potential titles that might better serve the story.

, Ask a friend to look over your fanfiction and give you their thoughts, particularly on the title choice. You wrote it to be read, so this will also give you your first opportunity to have other eyes on your story and receive some initial feedback. Have your friend point out the strengths and weaknesses of your story where the relation to the title is concerned.


Ask the person reading your fanfiction to tell you what they think of the title before and after reading the story. If it's not strong enough to interest them before they read the story, you may need to rework it.
Find a friend that is impartial or more likely to give you honest criticism. Ask them to be specific: hearing ""it's good"" benefits no one.

, Before you commit to your title, consider what inspired your fanfiction. If it directly borrows from source material, make sure the title you've chosen is in keeping with the style of the source while also being original enough to distinguish itself as your own original work.

, Make your title really sing. The title is the first part of your story readers will see, and, like it or not, people do tend to judge a book by its cover. Hook them with something attention-grabbing right off the bat and once they're interested let the story you've told draw them in.


Be careful not to let your title run away with you. It should be brisk and punchy, but not overly complex or unusual just for the sake of standing out.

, Investigate what traits make a title eye-catching. Do a little reading about titling and find out what methods your favorite authors use. Naming a story is a big step, one that typically gets made in the final stages of writing. While you write, dig a little deeper into your own ideas and see what among them might serve as the heart of the story.Authors often change the titles of their stories multiple times before arriving at the most suitable one. Don't be discouraged if the first title you think of isn't a perfect fit.
Unless you have a particular idea of what you want the title to be, wait until later on in the writing process to decide on a name for your story. You may find that certain events occurring late in your story recommend themselves quite nicely as titles.
Assume that your reader's attention span is short (this is often the case when browsing titles) and make the most of it with dynamic, unusual or standout wording.

, Even if you're not submitting your fanfiction for publication or sharing it all over the internet, keep in mind that people will be reading it and use the occasion to impress even seasoned literary critics. Ensure the quality of your story by adhering to the standards that publishers use when reviewing manuscripts; though it makes use of established fictional icons, your fanfiction should offer something fresh and exciting, down to the title.E.L. James' ""50 Shades of Grey"" began as a fanfiction adaptation of characters from Stephenie Meyer's ""Twilight"" series. It is now one of the most popular literary and movie franchises in the world. You never know how far your fanfiction will go, provided you sell it properly.

Think of an idea.,

Create a new clan (optional).,
Begin the story with an interesting paragraph that lets the reader want to read more.,
Write out a prophecy.,
Think of a climax.,
End the story.",How to Make a Warrior Cat Fanfiction," The idea can be about a cat already in the Clans, a cat like Rusty growing to become a warrior, or even life in StarClan. It can be anything! The key here, though, is to make sure it's not something clichéd - that means something that is used too much. Most people will roll their eyes and stop reading if you write a story about ""a cat with special powers that must fight to save their clan."" It's written about too much and it's not very interesting. To come up with a plot that's interesting, think of an adventure you might actually want to read. Make sure the key parts of the story are there, too - you want to know how you're going to end it before you begin. Give the story a decent introduction, a middle that leads up to climax, and a satisfying ending.
, The best character has good qualities but is also flawed in some ways. Now, most people make the mistake of flaws as being ""oh, my cat can't hunt very well, so it's okay that she's attractive and the leader and the best cat ever."" These are referred to as ""Mary Sues"" in the case of females. ""Gary Stus"" is used when referring to males. The key to this sort of flaw is that it must actually make the cat miserable or unable to advance the plot at some point. She can't hunt? It's only a viable flaw when the Clan is starving and she can't even feed her own kits. That's when it actually becomes a ""flaw."" Other flaws to include are character flaws. These are things like pride, greed, jealousy, and other bad qualities. The best characters are lovable and great, but also have setbacks that make the reader understand and feel bad for them.

However, you also need to remember to give them some skills, or else readers won't care about them and they're not relatable. But, if it's going to be some minor character that's going to turn out to be evil later, it's a good trick to give them a lot of flaws so readers don't predict that they are a villain!

, Bringing in a whole new clan with a new set of attributes, lifestyles, and habitat can raise the readers' attention. They would want to know how this clan came in from the beginning and how they survived.

Be careful when creating Clan names. Things that aren't quite natural like ""MagicClan"" or something long and awkward like ""AuroraClan"" are all things you want to avoid. Do something natural like IceClan, or even Squirrelclan.

, Now, it's recommended you don't begin instantly with tons of action and suspense. You need to make the reader care about the cats and introduce the characters, settings, and even lifestyle if it's different from the main canon cat's lives before you threaten them with impending doom. Now, action scenes aren't bad - just use them sparingly. If you have cats attacking and fur flying in every chapter, things get rather boring and predictable.

Erin Hunter started one of her books with a small battle between two clans with both their deputies in it. This prequel took place a generation before the main story.

, If you have one at all, make it good. For example, if a cat named Grasspaw is the main hero and Yellowpaw is evil, don't say something like 'The grass shall defeat yellow,' because that is too simple. And don't make it too complex, like,""When the color of the sun threatens the Clan, the blade of what grows from the earth shall rise and defeat it.""Try for something between the two extremes.

Be very careful about writing prophecies. They can't be obvious or too vague, and quite a few people have tried to use them and usually they just end up making it a little silly. Don't use one unless you know it will make for an exciting plot. There are also prophecy generators on websites like Scratch, just be careful with some of the prophecies because they may come out weird, like 'cat that saves a blade of grass will win a battle against a mouse.' Don't use lists of prophecies, because most of them will have already been used.

, For people who are not familiar with the term ""climax,"" a climax is the most exciting part of the story. There can be a great battle between the clans, a cat confronting a corrupted leader, or whatever is the most important and exciting event in your plot. Now, be careful not to write the climax too soon in the story. Disaster will strike if we meet your cats and suddenly are plunged into a battle.... and then the story is over. Make the stuff leading up to your climax interesting and intriguing. Make the readers interested in what's going to happen., The ending is a bit difficult. You need to resolve all the problems that arose in your story and keep it satisfying. Don't end the story on ""and the prophecy was fulfilled."" Perhaps end it on a funny conversation between Clanmates or a cat receiving their warrior name. Something that will make your readers go ""whoa"", or ""wow""."

Decide what fanfiction you want to add your OC to.,
Research your chosen fandom further.,
When creating your OC, try to blend them in with your chosen fandom.,
Give them a believable past with a canon character or make them related to one.,
If you intend to couple your OC with a canon character, again watch for compatibility.",How to Create a Believable Original Character for Fanfiction," Each fandom will have information that other ones will not need. For example, in Reborn! you will have to choose a flame type for your character, were as in any other fandoms, this information would not exist. Jot down all the things that you will have to consider when creating your OC.;
, If vampires don't exist in your chosen fandom, then don't make your character half-vampire. By all means be creative, it is your OC after all, but remember to keep your OC realistic to your chosen fandom.

, Don't make them a smart, pretty, athletic person who also saves kittens from trees in their spare time from saving the world. Mary-sue's (or Gary-stu's) are not the best way to blend your OC in, you want them to feel at home.

, This is an optional step, however it makes your OC blend in better if they have a past that other characters can relate to, since that in turn will help the reader relate to them too. Although you will need to be careful with this as certain canon characters will not be suited for your OC. For example, using the manga/anime Reborn! again, Tsuna, the main protagonist, is a meek, shy boy and would not have an aggressive older sister who likes to make people bleed.

, For this you may want to look at the canon character's friends and see what traits they like in a person.

Choose the anime/manga/book/TV show/video game/movie you want your fan-fiction to be about.,
Come up with a storyline.,
Compose your opening paragraph.,
Add a new element to your story that makes it unique and interesting.,
Add more details.,
Further develop the story.,
Come up with a conclusion.,
Reread your entire fan-fiction.,
Share your work with others.,
Take constructive criticism.",How to Create Incredible Fan Fiction," If you want, you can even do a crossover where two worlds collide! It's best to write about something you have a good bit of knowledge about. Don't try writing a fan-fiction using an anime you've only seen the first episode of, or it will likely be a failure. Choose something you have seen all (or at least most) of, or a game you have beaten or are close to beating.;
, No good fan-fiction could exist without a storyline. The great thing about fan-fiction is, you can completely change what really happens (the ""canon"") in the show, movie, story, or game. If there was an event that you didn't like, you can always leave it out or alter it in your fan-fiction. Think about what must have happened after ""THE END"" appeared on the screen or page. Fan-fictions can stray from the story's actual happenings. However, don't be too outlandish when coming up with your storyline. The best thing to do is get a piece of paper and write down your ideas. After you've listed as many possible ideas as you can, chose the ones that you think would make your fan-fiction story as interesting as possible without going overboard.

, This is very important in creating a good fan-fiction story. The opening is what draws the reader into the story. If your opening is not dull, people will want to continue reading your story. A good opening will get the readers attention and make them want to read more. One good example is to start your story off with an exciting event that will set the plot for the rest of the story. Another good example is the introduction of a new character. Just be creative and you'll come up with something eventually.

, Nobody wants to read something that isn't special or exciting. Adding something unique to your story will make it stand out and be more memorable.


One thing you might do is create a brand new character to add to your story to mix things up a bit. Be descriptive about your new character's appearance, skills, and personality. This will make it easier for readers to imagine your character. (It's also good practice in how to create a good character for your original, non-fan-fiction writing.) You could even add yourself and/or your friends to the story! Be descriptive.

But be careful when doing this, avoid creating a Mary Sue or a perfect character. Nobody wants to read about the most beautiful, talented, kindest, most perfect person saving the day or ending up with the main character (usually of the Original Work) These stories can be subject to Flames (or mean reviews).


If you don't want to add a new character there are many other options for making your story unique. You can set your story a few years before or after the original plot. You could also try a new setting, or reversing the roles of the characters. Another thing you could do is take a minor character from the original story and make them you fan-fiction's main character. Most mangas, animes, books, shows, and movies have many minor or supporting characters to choose from. There are so many things you can do, it just takes a little imagination.

, Every once in a while, go back and reread what you have written or typed so far. If there is anything that could have more details, add them! Instead of ""It was sunny outside."" you could add more details and have something like, ""The bright afternoon sun shined brightly upon the town."" Not only is this more interesting, but it gives readers a better idea of how you were imagining things as you wrote the story. It may be a nuisance, but it's worth it!

, Don't let one thing drag on and on. Add new conflicts or challenges. This will keep your story fresh and exciting, and will open doors for new ideas. But be sure not to move too quickly, or things may become too confusing. Move at a steady pace and things will flow smoothly. Many animes, manga, books, shows, movies, and games have very slow paced or non progressing plots, and that can become very boring, so be sure to keep things fresh and exciting. (This is very important!)

, Once you've progressed the story as far as you want, end the fan-fiction adventure with a memorable conclusion. Something cliche like ""It was all a dream."" or ""They all lived happily ever after."" is a definite no-no. A good conclusion is almost as important as a good opening. Some writers actually think up the ending and write it first and then go back. Unless you are planning a sequel, don't leave the readers hanging. If you aren't planning a sequel, be sure to tie up any loose ends.

, Check for spelling and grammar errors as you go along. If there is anything you think needs to be added, removed, or changed, go ahead and do so. Make sure everything makes sense and if anything doesn't, do what you can to fix it. Try to see your story from a readers perspective. They don't know everything you imagined in your mind while writing this. Any changes you made to the anime/manga/movie/book/show/game's characters or plot needs to be explained.

, You've worked hard on your fan-fiction, don't let it go unnoticed! If you typed it on your computer, upload it to a site like fanfiction.net or enter it in a contest. If you wrote it by hand on paper, show it to your friends or even scan it to your computer and upload it! The more people who read your story, the better, right?

, Learning from it to improve your writing will help you when you write the sequel to your first fanfic. You can learn a lot from what other people have to say, and it will help you greatly!

,How to Make a Comic Strip1,
"
Decide on a story that you want to publish.,
Decide on your format.,
Plan each panel.,
Balance text and images.",How to Make a Comic Strip2," Decide what you want your story to be about. With strips, you really don't have to know every little detail of the story you are trying to tell, but you should have a basic idea of where it's going. This can help you make sure that you've got material for more than just the first few strips.


If you're wanting to do more of a gag-a-day strip, you'll want to outline the types of jokes you want to make. This will help you decide what kinds of and how many characters you need to pull off those jokes.

, You'll first need to decide how many panels you want to average, if you want one row or two, etc. For a 1 row strip like Garfield, 3-4 panels is the norm. For a two row comic strip like Cul de Sac, 6-8. You can also find 1 panel comics and 3 row comics.


Of course sticking to a particular size will matter most if you plan on publishing your comics in print (such as a newspaper). If you plan on having them online instead, don't worry about this as much.
If you're printing and even if you're not, it's best to at least keep the same width and height for a single row. So, you can have one strip with one row, and another strip with two rows, but all three rows should be the same width and height as each other.

, When you go to make an individual strip, write down and plan each panel. You need to know what is happening where, which characters will be included, etc. Keep it simple. A written script should be as bare-bones as possible. Descriptions of scenery should only be included if they are necessary to the action of the strip.

, Make sure that you aren't putting too much text in your panels. This can make the comic hard to read and enjoy. Try to limit the number of speech balloons to 2 (3 if there's a one or two word balloon), and keep the number of words in a panel below 30 and preferably below 20.

"
"
Give them hopes and dreams.,
Give them flaws.,
Flesh out their lives.,
Fight cliches.",How to Make a Comic Strip3," Give your characters things that they want. Having established goals is a great way to drive story and create story lines when you're running low on ideas.

, You don't want characters that seem perfect. This strikes readers as being unrealistic and boring. If you want people to really sympathize with your characters and root for them, give them flaws.


They can be greedy, too talkative, rude, selfish, or not exactly smarter than your average bear.

, Give your characters backgrounds, interests, hobbies, and other things that show that they have actual lives. This makes them seem more real and relatable.

, Fight the cliches! Don't make them boring

Draw the frames.,
Sketch the characters.,
Add speech bubbles.,
Sketch backgrounds and scenes.,
Do your line work.,
Add text.,
Add color.",How to Make a Comic Strip4," First sketch the frames. You will need to decide, based on the amount of dialogue in the script, what panel will need to be largest, smallest, etc. Just make sure that you keep within your size constraints.

, Next sketch in where the characters will go. Make sure that there is enough room for speech balloons. Try to place them in a way that the panel will not look too full or too empty.

, Sketch in where the speech bubbles will go. Remember not to cover characters or take up too much of the frame. Keep in mind that sometimes changing the speech bubble's shape can be used to indicate a particular voice. For example, a bubble with a shape like a cartoon sun (with the pointy edges) can make a character ""sound"" like they're yelling. Take advantage of this.


For good examples of speech bubbling, see online comic Dumbing of Age or print comic Pearls Before Swine.

, After you know where the characters will go, you can sketch in a background or other objects if you want. Some comic strips have very detailed backgrounds, some only include the basic objects that the characters interact with. You can go anywhere in between or beyond.

, Go over your sketch lines with something dark and a little more permanent, so that they look clean and professional. Remember to use line width variation and other artistic tricks. When you're done you can erase the sketch lines.

, With the comic mostly drawn, you can add in text to the speech bubbles. Make sure to use a consistent font and text size. Even if a bubble is smaller, the text should always be the same size. Larger or smaller text indicates, respectively, whispering and shouting. Also make sure to use a legible font.

, If you want to, you can color your strip. Keep in mind that coloring is time consuming, and will significantly change the number of strips you are able to get done in a certain period of time.

"
"
Decide on an update schedule.,
Building a buffer.,
Publish it in a paper.,
Publish your comic online.",How to Make a Comic Strip5," If you're going to get your comics printed in a paper, that paper will probably have a very specific schedule for when they need comics to be updated. You will have to meet those requirements. If you're publishing online, you'll have a little more flexibility. Still, remember to be realistic.

, If you want to publish your comics, the first thing you're going to want to do (regardless of what medium you're going to use to get your comics out to readers), is build a buffer. This is a backlog of available strips. For example, if you have a single update a week, have a buffer of 30 strips. That way if you get behind, you've still got strips available to go out on schedule.

, You can publish your comics in a newspaper if you want to. This can be either your school newspaper or a local paper. Call their submissions department to find out if they're interested in new comics. Getting your comic in a paper, as an unknown, can be very difficult. Be prepared.

, If you want to reach a larger audience, have more control over your work, and a better shot at controlling how much money you make, you can publish your comics online instead. This is easy to do but how much money you make will vary and it can be difficult to develop a readership.


Use a website. There are many websites that are known for hosting comics. Like starting a blog, you can start an easy-to-update page where people can find your comic. This is great for beginners. A popular options are SmackJeeves and ComicFury.
Make a website. You can also make your own website. This will give you a little more control but can also be more work. Only do this if you feel you are capable of making a nice, looking site on your own or with a little help.
Use your blog. It is becoming increasingly popular to publish comics using blogging sites like Tumblr. This is an incredibly easy publishing mechanism which allows you to put up ads to make money but also not cost you money to host the site.

Think of the prefix through the mother's eyes.,
Remember about the ranks.,
When giving the cat their suffix, remember the first tip: it has to make sense.,
Now put the names together.",How to Name the Main Character in Your Warriors Fanfiction," It has to make sense. You may be set on Wishbreeze, but would a queen name her kit Wishkit? No, queens don't name their kits things like Hopekit, Wishkit, Ghostkit, or Dreamkit.


The queen will name the kit after it's fur color, first impression, or where they were born. They usually don't want to wait until the kit is a few days old, so they most likely won't be named after their eye color. Besides, cats are born with blue eyes, and the parents don't want to wait to name them after their eyes. Write down all of the prefixes that make sense for your cat.
For cats that used to be rogues, you can make their old rogue--or kittypet--names their prefix. Like if a rogue named Pine became a Clan cat, his name might be Pinetail.;
, All kits names end in -kit, apprentices' names end in -paw, the leader's name ends in -star, and a warrior's name can end in anything except those listed above and things that warrior cats wouldn't know. Elders, queens, and the deputy have names just like warriors.

, An all black cat with amber eyes wouldn't have a suffix of -frost. It just wouldn't make sense. Write down all of the suffixes that makes sense.

, Write down any possible names that sound good.


This is the main character; him/her and the main villain should have the most memorable names. Make it roll off the tongue, and be nice-sounding, but not unbelievably beautiful.
Names like Grayfur and Whitetail are very unmemorable. Smoketalon and Hailshine would be better names for a gray tom and white she-cat.

warnings
the time in canon
whether it is AU or not.
relevant timescales - is it set after or before a major event in the series? This is important as some readers are only interested in certain eras or timelines. You only want to attract those who will review. Not those who as soon as they realize that this isn't what they want, they click back.;
, A little used route is to include quotes from famous speeches or prose, such as Shakespeare or the ""I Have a Dream"" speech. And the more distinctive the better. Search for your new title in the site archive before officially adding it to your story. If there are more than two stories with this title, or several that are close enough that they could be confused, pick a new name. The more original the name, the more likely people are to notice it and therefore read it and thus...you guessed it...review it.

, There really shouldn't be a need for an author's note, but if you want to add one, do so at the end of the chapter. The only things at the top of the page should be a brief set of warnings and the title. Any major things people should be aware of should be made briefly aware, with the direction to go to the end of the chapter if they need more explanation. It shouldn't need it though, because your chapter should do it for you.

, Get right into the story, with no backtracking to the canon. Anyone reading your story already knows the basic original plot, and has most likely been sifting through hundreds of other stories that day looking for a gem. If you need to add back-story, do it gradually, while introducing your new material at the same time.

, Carefully proof-read your whole story. Read your entire whole story to ensure that it sounds like something you would say, and that it fits with the personalities of the characters you are using.

,, If after the first chapter is posted a reader offers to beta-read the story for errors, accept. Betas can find new ways to make your story more interesting and pick out errors you might not see after proof-reading.

, Reading anything before taking on the challenge of writing usually helps.

, Preferably not fast music or heavy metal if it's what you usually listen to because it'll probably get stuck in your mind and distract you. Slow songs or trip hop genres are likely to get visual imagery and your train of thought on a better track.

, A lot of writers get their ideas for books from daydreaming, it opens a thread of thoughts where you can picture scenes or characters who want to come up with. It's good to imagine what the story is like before you begin it.

You may be a fan of Marvel comics, with a preference for a particular superhero or series. Or you may be more interested in Japanese comics, such as manga, and use manga titles as inspiration for your comic. Study the drawing style and the storytelling of the comics you admire. You could then use them as a jumping off point for your own comic or get inspired to make a comic you have already made better.


You may also think about creating your own version of an existing comic book character, such as a female version of a character or a character who is trans or queer instead of straight. You may put your own on spin on an existing character, being sure not to copy the character exactly. Try to put your original take on the character so it feels like your own.;
, You can also get inspiration by adapting an existing myth or fable for your comic. You may choose a myth that is obscure and not very well known to your audience, such as a Native American myth or a Japanese myth, and use elements of it in your comic. Leaning on an existing myth could allow you to get creative with interesting source material.


You may also put an original spin on an existing myth or fable that is well known, such as your own take on the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. Doing this could allow you to create a comic that is unique and relatable to your readers.

, You may also find inspiration by adapting an original work you have written, such as short story or a poem, and turning it into a comic. You may use the storytelling in your story to plan out the comic and use the same characters.


You may also improve an existing comic to make it better by using other story ideas you may have in the comic. Combining several story ideas or adding more ideas or characters to the comic could make it better.

, Perhaps the most important element of your comic is the storyline. A good storyline, full of incredible exploits, will help to keep your reader interested. Incredible exploits are often used in superhero comics or comics that explore fantastical elements. You should include exploits that seem startling and incredible in your comic so your characters are put in situations that are interesting. This will also ensure your reader stays entertained.You may include incredible exploits in your comics that involve your characters, like a plot to save the world from destruction hatched by your main character or a conflict with your main character’s superpowers and their everyday life. Or you may include incredible exploits that happen to your characters, such as an explosion in a chemical plant that infects a character or an encounter with a dangerous force that leaves the character weak and alone.

, A compelling storyline also involves in the contrast between incredible exploits and down-to-earth realism. You should try to contrast every incredible exploit in your comic with moments of realism so your reader is constantly being pulled in both directions. Doing this will also ground the incredible elements of your story in a world that feels real to the reader and relatable.For example, you may start with a moment of down-to-earth realism, where your character does an everyday, casual thing, such as getting a coffee at Starbucks. You may then have an incredible moment, such as an explosion that occurs as the character exits the Starbucks. The explosion could then trigger a series of events that are a contrast of realism and incredible exploits.

, A consistent narrative is also a good way to build a storyline that keeps your readers engaged. Linking events that occur in the narrative together will also create a storyline that feels well done and thoughtful. You should strive for a narrative that has a sense of plot and pacing.You should try to use elements in the story more than once with purpose and intention. For example, if you introduce a new character to the storyline, they should be linked or connected somehow to existing characters in the story. The link should also be dramatic and purposeful to justify introducing a new character.
You should also repeat certain symbols or images in the comic with purpose. Perhaps you associate certain characters with certain colors and only use these colors when they are in the scene. Or perhaps you use a certain symbol to represent a location in the story, and every time this location is mentioned in the story, this symbol is used.

, You should inject your storyline with emotion and passion, as these two elements are often what matters most to readers. You should be invested in the comic as the creator and translate your strong passion for the project on the page. Choose a storyline that you find interesting and that you are wholeheartedly passionate about exploring. Try to inject this enthusiasm into the story.You can give your story emotion by adding elements to your storyline that you find interesting. For example, if you have a strong interest in molecular biology, you may add elements of molecular biology to your storyline.
You can also invest your characters in details that you are passionate about, such as a character that wants to save the forest or a character who is passionate about human rights. You can use your characters to translate your own personal beliefs or ideas into the world of the comic.

, Your comic can be unique and great by having characters who are flawed. Flawed characters are relatable to your audience and are often more nuanced than characters who are perfect. Giving your characters flaws will allow you to explore the full range of the human condition, creating characters who make mistakes and do not always do the right thing.For example, you may have a main character who has superpowers and wants to do good in the world. But maybe your character has a weakness for alcohol or is grappling with mental illness. This flaw gives the character depth and conflict.

, Your characters should also all have a clear goal or purpose in your storyline. The goal could be small or large. But giving your characters a goal will ensure they act with intent in your story and in ways that make sense to them. Having characters with clear goals will also help to plot of the story to move forward and keep your reader on edge.For example, your superhero main character may have the goal of getting rid of a bad person in their small town. They may do everything in their power to destroy the bad person, though they are battling mental illness. They may encounter obstacles or issues that get in the way of their goal, but end up succeeding by the end of the comic.

, Your story should also have a villain that is unique and distinct. This will prevent your story from feeling run of the mill or too familiar. A good villain will have humanizing traits that allow the audience to sympathize with them, though they may do bad things or perpetrate evil.For example, maybe your villain had a troubling childhood, which lead to her decision to act badly or to hurt others. Or, perhaps your villain has a love of sharks and reptiles, and treats these animals with respect, though he may treat humans with no respect at all.

, To create a good storyline and strong characters, you should try to draw parallels between your main character and your main villain. Connecting the villain and the protagonist of your story will allow you to explore the relationship between good and evil. It will also add tension and conflict to the relationship between your villain and your protagonist.


For example, perhaps your villain has a soft spot for reptiles and your protagonist is a superhero that turns into a reptile. Or, perhaps your villain is constantly seeking a family to love him, and is jealous of the seemingly perfect family of your protagonist.

, A great comic should also look good and have an appealing, distinct drawing style. As the artist, you have the freedom to draw the comic as you see fit. You should channel all your creativity into the drawing style of the comic and create a style that feels unique to you.You may decide to use a specific drawing style that fits the story you are telling. You may decide to use a very simple layout, with very little background images or details, to fit a story set in a void or in a lonely environment. Or you may decide to use a very bold, graphic layout for a story set in a carnival or in a crowded area.
Once you choose a drawing style, you should try to be consistent and stick to a similar style throughout the story. This will make the comic feel concise and cohesive.

, Though you should try to stick with a cohesive style in your comic, you should also play with the way the panels appear on the page. You may use symmetrical panels to show the storyline in a more interesting way or combine square and circular panels. If you do play with the presentation of the story on the page, you should do so with intention and purpose. This way, it will feel effective to the reader, rather than confusing or jumbled.For example, you may decide to keep the panels symmetrical and then put the panels around one panel in the center of the page. The central panel may be a critical moment in the scene or the story. This will then allow the reader to view the moments that lead up to the critical moment in the center of the page.

, A great comic will have a solid storyline, good characters, and a high quality presentation. The comic should look as good as it reads. If possible, go for high quality paper printing and binding for the comic. Produce the comic with a hardcover and a quality book spine. You should also try to print the comic so the colors in the graphics pop and show up well on the page.Making the comic look beautiful and high quality may encourage readers to pick it up and read through it. Combining a beautiful presentation with a quality storyline is a sure fire way to make a comic that is well worth reading.

, Once you have created a comic that you think is great, you may want to share your work of art with others. You may shop your comic around to publishers to see if they might be interested in buying your comic and distributing it locally, nationally, or even internationally. You may contact several online and brick and mortar publishers to see if they might be interested in your work.


You should learn how to write a query letter to a publisher when you send out your work. You should send your work to publishers who seem to publish work similar to yours to improve your chances of getting published.

, You may also consider self-publishing your comic, where you promote and distribute it on your own. You may publish your comic in hard-copy form or online. Publishing your comic online may be a more affordable option and may allow you to reach more readers.


If you do publish your comic online, you should use social media to promote it to potential readers. You should also market the comic so it reaches more people.

, You can also share your comic with others by submitting to comic book contests. Check to see if your favorite comic book publishers are holding contests for first-time comic book artists or rising stars in the industry. Submit your comic and see if you get chosen as the winner, being sure to follow all the guidelines required for submission to the contest.

, Obtain a basic knowledge for dialogue rules first so you can fix any errors that you see, then move on to the more in-depth stuff. Does the dialogue sound realistic? Is it driven by the plot, resulting in it sounding awkward? These sort of things are a bit more difficult to fix, especially if the dialogue is plot-driven, but it plays an important part in improving the overall quality of the story.

Check the characterization of canon characters.,
If the story contains OCs (original characters), then examine these characters.",How to Edit Fanfiction2," If the story uses canon characters from the work which the fanfiction is based upon, then review the original material immediately before reading the fanfiction. Pay careful attention to how the character acts and speaks, and determine whether or not the character is properly written in the fanfiction. One of many fanfiction readers' biggest pet peeves is when characters are written out-of-character, so this step is extremely important.

, Look over their character traits and determine whether or not the character is a Mary Sue/Gary Stu, which is generally hated in fanfiction communities. If so, advise the author on how they can improve the character. Additionally, original characters are difficult to fully flesh out, so be sure to be on the lookout for flat OCs. If the fanfiction is long and takes place over a long period of time, then pay attention to how the character is developing and suggest ways in which this could happen.

, The pacing should be pretty consistent throughout the story, excluding scenes that have a dramatic mood shift from the rest of the story. If the story feels too rushed or scenes are unnecessarily drawn-out, then let the author know and suggest places to add/remove details.

, Most stories should have a beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and conclusion, although it might vary slightly depending on what type of a story it is. For short one-shots, only the the basic elements are really needed, whereas for longer stories, there might be multiple story arcs and sub-plots. If the story is missing a conclusion, falling action, or any other element, or if a sub-plot is forgotten about, then inform the author. These are essential building blocks to a good story.

If you are producing a graphic novel, there is much more flexibility with sizing, though the most common sizes are 5.5” by 8.5” (14 by 21.6 cm) or 6” by 9” (15.2 by 22.7 cm)., You may have noticed that the paper used in comic book covers is heavier and of different quality than paper you might use in your home printer. These different kinds of paper allow the illustrations to be communicated on the page more clearly on the page and while holding up to wear and tear. The three main kinds of finish you'll need to decide between are:



Gloss finish, which is the brightest and shiniest finish; ideal for highlighting the images on your cover.

Matte finish, less bright and reflective than gloss, but still somewhat reflective. Matte can save you money on printing costs while providing a quality cover.

Uncoated paper, which is the flattest finish in terms of sheen. It has a natural appearance and is most frequently used for the inner pages of the comic., In addition to finish, the thickness of your paper will influence the durability of your finished comic. The standard weight for printer paper is between 20 and 24 lbs (9 - 10.9 kg), though this is often too light a weight for a comic. Thinner paper runs the risk of not having enough substance to prevent bleed through from the illustrations contained in your comic.


The inner pages of comics are often printed on 60 or 70 lb (27.2 or 31.8 kg) weight paper. Though there is not a set standard for the ideal thickness of your cover, cover pages are generally thicker than the pages on the inside of the book., Different printing companies specialize in different kinds of printing. A standard business printer might not be able to provide the quality or have the materials on hand to produce your cover art in the way you've decided, so be clear about your expectations. Higher quality at-home printers, on the other hand, can be a cost efficient solution for smaller projects.


Printing costs vary considerably between companies. You should shop around and get several quotes for your printing before deciding on a printer.

, This can be either in the images on your cover or in the title itself. In either case, you'll want readers to be interested in buying your comic book, and a time-tested technique for catching readers' attention is to include a cover image that ignites interest or sparks questions.


For example, a picture of your hero in a difficult situation might make potential readers think, ""How does he get out of that?"" To answer the questions, they'll have to buy your book!, You'll want a title that both catches eyes and faithfully conveys an important aspect of the story of your comic. You might choose a title that reflects the main action of your comic, you might decide upon a title that hints at deeper conflict or emotional turmoil, or your title might be suited for a clever pun.A comeback story might be titled ""Rebirth"" or ""The Phoenix Rises.""
An epic battle might be captured by titles like ""Bloodshed Battlefield"" or ""Skirmish in the Snow.""
Emotional plot lines could be expressed by titles like ""The Conflict Within"" or ""The Chaos of the Mind.""

, A title that doesn't seem connected to the images surrounding it can leave potential readers unsure if your book is one they are interested in buying. The title and artwork should work together to summarize the subject matter of your book.


As an example, a comic titled ""Fighter"" should probably have some kind of fighting sequence depicted on its cover.

, A significant portion of tone in comics is conveyed by the style of the artwork. Cover art that is significantly different from what is inside your comic can leave readers feeling cheated. You'll want to be sure that your cover art corresponds to the quality and tone of the art in your comic.


The tone of your comic can be expressed through genre features. For example, noir artwork should make use of shadows and a gritty quality, while fantasy will probably want a more lustrous, weird, and wondrous quality.

, Shapes inscribed on your cover page can bring out contrast or add to the framing of the scene. As the shape of your cover page will most likely be square, the shape that offers the most contrast is the circle, though you might find other shapes layered in the background can give pop to your cover art.


You might also consider using the border of the page to frame the cover art, giving the impression of peeking in on a scene to the reader., If, in your story, you have a hero facing off against against a villain, you can do a classic ""versus"" pose, where you put the two characters in an antagonistic posture on opposite sides of the page.


You might also gather associated characters together, putting ""good"" characters on the right and bad guys on the left, for instance.

, Character heavy comics can make cover art feel overcrowded. If you intend on showing a large group of characters, or maybe even an army battle sequence, on your cover, you may want to draw the figures in smaller scale.


This way, you can give a sense of largeness to the scene and incorporate more of the setting, creating greater balance between the figures and their surroundings., A semi-transparent image in the background, looming over heroes, has been used in many comics to indicate the watchful eyes of a villain. In a more general sense, this technique can add an element of the foreboding to your cover art, which might be just what you need.

, By using shading and perspective, you can make your characters appear as though they're breaking out of or into the space of your cover page. This illusion of depth can literally draw your readers into the story, making them feel immersed in your story from the outset., In the event you are the illustrator of the comic, you may not need to hire an illustrator. However, you still might benefit from hiring an assistant, like an inker to complete the line work you do on your own. This can help your project finish in the most timely fashion possible., Depending on the medium in which you've decided to draw your comic, these materials may be drastically different. You should be able to purchase the majority of your supplies at your local art store, and a list of common art supplies you might use includes:


Colored pencils (optional; for coloring)
Computer (optional; for coloring)
Markers (optional; for coloring)
Paper
Pencils
Pens (for inking)
Scanner (optional; for digital coloring)

, A reference for the finished design will help prevent you from forgetting a part of it. A rough draft will also give you a better feeling for the composition of the scene, giving you a second chance to rebalance your cover art before working on the real thing., Take your paper and pencils and do a preliminary sketch of your characters. Once the rough design for the cover panel is on the page, you can start cleaning up your lines and penciling in details.


At this stage, you might also want to include your name and the names of others involved in your project., You might have chosen a setting right from the inside pages of your story, but you could also use settings hinted at in the dialogue of your comic. In the same fashion as your character preliminary sketches, you will also:


Draw your rough background images
Clean up your lines to create a clean image.
Add details and fill out the illustration., Professional comic production teams often have one or more individuals dedicated to this task. During the inking process, you will need to use ink to finalize the penciled line work. Beyond that, while inking you should:


Correct any errors or inconsistencies in the penciling.

Utilize shading techniques to create an interplay of shadow and light in the composition., This is typically the final stage in comic creation process. Many contemporary artists will scan the inked design and use a computer for coloring, but some artists still prefer physical media. Your key goal at this point is to create coloring that does not detract from the line work., The route you take in printing will depend on whether you've decided to send your book to a professional printing agency or do the job yourself. A quality home printer, hard work, and a significant time investment can save you money, but a printing agency has the process necessary for better consistency and larger scale projects.


Some printing agencies may require you to provide a digital copy for printing. In this case, you may need to take a high resolution scan of your cover art.

Get some inspiration from your favorite comic books and web comics. Read through some of your favorite strips and ask yourself what makes the characters compelling and interesting.


Read comics in your local newspaper. Look at the world of web comics online. Pay attention to the characters and how they're develop. How does the writer create a unique personality and voice for each character? Why are the characters interesting? How is their storyline developed over the course of the comic.
Pay attention to drawing. In more serious comics, drawings may be quite realistic. In more lighthearted comics, characters may be unrealistic in appearance. Their bodies may be disproportionate and their expressions may lack detail.

, Comics are a diverse field. There are some gag-a-day comics, such as comics published in local newspapers, but there are also comics that tend to be more serious. Many web comics have complicated and long running story lines with somewhat more complex characters.


If you're looking for a simple format, you may want to go the talking animal route and emulate comics like Garfield. Usually, these comics only have a few panels and end with a joke.
However, you may also want to do something more serious. A web comic, like Questionable Content, may better serve you inspiration-wise. While humor is incorporated into this comic, the story lines can also be serious on occasion and not every strip contains a punchline. You can also try looking into graphic novels. While different than comics, there is some overlap.

, Once you have a general idea of the type of comic you want to create, do some light sketching. You do not have to draw a final version of your character. Just grab a pencil and paper and begin drawing a few versions of the character you're aiming to create. Light sketching can help you figure out your drawing style and get a sense of how your character may appear.If you're creating your main character, keep in mind he or she should be visually appealing as your audience will look at this character a lot. Draw a few light sketches of the character's head, as well as his or her body. Try to find a design that looks nice.
However, keep in mind you'll have to be drawing this character a lot. If you are new to drawing especially, stick to a design that is somewhat simple. Strive to see the basic shapes behind a character. For example, your character's head is shaped like an oval. His torso is a chubby cylinder.
Drawing can help you get a sense of a character's personality as well. What kind clothes your character wears, for example, can reflect personality.
Do not worry about creating the perfect design yet. You are just in the preliminary planning stages. You can get your character into final form later.

, From here, start brainstorming about your character's personality. Who is this character? What is he or she like? Spend some time brainstorming before you move on to drawing a more final version of your character.Think about your genre. If you're doing a gag-a-day comic, you may not need a character with a ton of personality traits. Look at a character like Garfield. He's lazy and sarcastic, and does not have too many traits beyond this.
If you're working with a more complex genre, consider your character more deeply. Write down a list of positive characteristics, as well as a list of flaws. Jot down some of your character's hopes and dreams.
If you're writing a genre-based comic, like a fantasy comic, archetypes can help you establish a character. Archetypes are stock characters and ideas that tend to appear again and again in fiction. For example, maybe your character is the archetypal mentor. Therefore, you can assume he's wise, patient, and calm.

, Every artist uses different tools. Before you begin to draw your comic, make sure you know how you'll be drawing it. You should pick tools you can work with efficiently. Tools that are unfamiliar to you may be tedious, making it harder for you to commit to your character.If you're tech-savvy, consider using electronic tools. Tools like adobe photoshop, for example, can really help streamline the process if you're comfortable drawing on a screen.
If you'd prefer to do it the old fashion way, think about the type of paper you'll use, as well as the type of pen and pencil. You may want to swing by a local art shop and peruse the supplies. Try holding a type of pencil in your dominant hand to see if it feels right.

, Once you've discovered your tools, start with the basics. Draw a basic outline of your character's body. You want to get a sense of his or her basic proportions before fleshing out the character. You should also draw a somewhat closer up picture of just your character's face. As the face is where your character will portray emotion, you want to make sure you've got the character's facial structure locked down.Remember basic shapes. This can help ground you as you sketch out the character's bare form. Do not worry too much about filling in or shading. You're just trying to get a basic shape down here. Once you have the basic shape, fill it in a bit. Add muscle to your character's arms, for example, or a scar on your character's chest.
Spend some time drawing the character's face. Focus on the main features. What is the basic shape of your character's face? Is it heart-shaped, oval-shaped, rounder? Does the character have any distinguishing physical characteristics, like big eyes or a cleft chin?

, Redraw the character's face and body again and again. Most cartoonists draw many, many versions of their character before settling on a final design. Reshape and redesign the character several times until you get a version you like.Use your eraser here. If you dislike how the character's legs look, erase and redraw them.
You can add or subtract elements of your character as well. For example, you may have originally intended your character to be bald, but that doesn't feel right. Try adding some hair.
Draw as many versions as you need until you find something you like. This can take awhile, so have patience. You should not settle on a design that you dislike. Keep ease of drawing in mind as you go. Even if you really like a particular element of your character, you should not keep anything it would be difficult to draw over and over again.

, Your character will have to make a lot of expressions throughout your comic. You should practice drawing just your character's face expressing a wide variety of emotions.Figure out how many expressions you want to create. If you're doing a more simple comic, you may not need as many expressions. You may be able to get by with just things like happy, sad, angry, etc. However, if you're doing a more complicated comic, you need more expressions. In addition to the basics, include things like irritated, hollow, confused, pouty, and so on.
When you're done, draw your character expressing each of your chosen emotions. Adjust each drawing as you go. Use your eraser to alter elements of your character that you dislike. Maybe you want his brows to be more furrowed as he expresses confusion, for example.

, After a lot of experimentation, try to draw one solid design of your character. You can use this design later on when you begin actually writing your comic. Mixing and matching all the elements you liked from the preliminary drawing phases, draw a final version of your character.Draw slowly here and provide slightly more detail than you did in earlier steps. You want this drawing to be something you come back to as you draw your comic. Remember to keep ease of drawing in mind. If you find some element of your character is difficult to draw, you may want to cut this element out in your final draft.
Have a friend look at the final drawing and give you honest feedback. If you have a friend with experience in illustration, this would be a good person to ask. If the friend has any constructive feedback, you can retool your character accordingly.

, To start, you want to give your character a name. This should be something that appeals to readers. You may also want to consider a name that speaks to your character's personality.If you're writing a comic with an animal character, names are somewhat easier. You can pick a name that sounds like a silly pet name. However, when using people as characters, names can be complicated, especially if you are doing a serious comic.
Keep the implication of names in mind, especially if you're using names packed with meaning. The name ""Christian,"" for example, carries religious context, so avoid using it unless you want that in your comic.
There are no hard or fast rules for names. You can pick a name that's meaningful or merely a name that you feel is memorable. It can help to know the time period in which your comic takes place. For example, if you're doing a comic that takes place in the 1940's, modern names like Harper and Jayden may seem out of place.

, Once you've established a solid name, you'll want to give your character a personality. Think about what kind of person your character is and make a comprehensive list of your character's traits.For a simpler comic, you may not need as complex of a personality. Your character may be defined by a few quirks and traits. For a more complicated comic, however, you'll have to get more in-depth.
Write down general personality characteristics, focusing first on the most notable traits about your character. If a friend of your character were to describe him or her, what would that friend say? From there, get more specific. How does your character react to others? Is he kind and generous, or does he tend to be withholding in his emotions. How does your character respond to conflict? Is he sage and calm in the face of adversity, or does he tend to shy away from challenges?

, Your character should have a backstory, especially if you're doing a more complex comic. Spend some time fleshing out where your character was before the events of the story began.Even in complex stories, you do not have to form an overly complex backstory if you do not want to. You can simply lay out the basics. Where was your character born? What was his childhood like? What are the major events in his life that shaped him as a person?
Try to focus on how the character's past affects his current personality and choices. Backstory is important because your character will be inevitably affected by his past as he moves forward in your story. As you write backstory, try to consider how your character's unique experiences will affect his life.

, Interesting characters have a set of wants and needs that drive most of their actions. Spend some time consider what your character wants.


In a simple comic, your character may want simple things. Garfield, for example, wants to sleep and eat. In a more complicated comic, character wants may be more abstract. For example, your character may want to find a sense of purpose.
You should also focus on needs. There are many universal needs that every character will experience, like the need for food, shelter, and basic love and compassion. Your character may have unique needs depending on his situation. A character that was abandoned in childhood, for example, may have a heightened need for security as an adult.

Use the front cover to introduce the comic to the reader.,
Use the splash page to introduce the story.,
Display the rest of the story in panels on the other pages.,
Use word balloons to show dialogue.,
Use captions to explain things the images can't show.,
Display onomatopoeic words to indicate sounds.",How to Design Comic Books1," Nearly all comic books have an illustrated front cover that features an illustration of the story's hero, such as Batman, or its setting, such as the skyline of Gotham City, or a scene representative of the story inside. The front cover also displays the title of the comic, usually in a distinctive font, such as the telescoping letter arc of ""Superman"" or the image of the Caped Crusader's cowled head atop a large bat body displaying ""Batman"" across its wings. More recent comics also list the names of the story author and principal artists on the cover, as well.


Generic illustrations of the hero or story scene are more often used for single-issue stories or graphic novels, while story-scene cover illustrations are more commonly used for issues of a limited or continuing comic series.
Cover illustrations that use a story scene do not have to use a scene that actually takes place in the story but can instead use a variant of it. The cover of Lois Lane #78 (October 1967) shows a surprised Superman, witnessing bullets apparently bouncing off Lois Lane, who in turns asks the Man of Steel when they're getting married. In the actual story, where Lois and Lana Lang decide to move to the bottle city of Kandor at the request of a Kryptonian rival for their affections, a squad of Kandorian doubles of Superman's friends stand in for them to assist Superman, and it is actually Lois' super-powered look-alike, who has no designs on the Man of Might, that he actually meets. The cover scene plays off Lois' long pursuit of Superman's affections to entice the reader to read the story within the covers.
Titles and title logos are usually separate from the cover illustrations, but they may also be incorporated, such as the cover of one issue of ""Shazam"" that used the magic lightning bolt that transforms Billy Batson as a cutout to display the title from a vertical list of the 6 Elders who give Captain Marvel his powers while depicting the World's Mightiest Mortal striding across the cover.;
, The splash page typically is the first page of the comic story, although it can also be a later page when the first 1 to 4 pages are used as a prologue to set up the rest of the story. It features a large panel at the top or bottom of the page (or a single panel that takes up the entire page) that displays the name of the story feature (such as ""Superman"" in an issue of Action Comics), the story title, and a representative story scene. From the late 1960s onward, this page has also consistently given the names of the story author, artists (penciller, inker, and colorist), and editor.


As with the front cover illustration, the splash page may not display an actual story scene but a variation of it. It may be a different variation of the same scene alluded to on the front cover, or a different scene.
In comics that feature more than 1 story, usually only the lead story warrants a splash page with a single panel. Backup feature stories are typically shorter, requiring the story to start more quickly than the lead story.
At the bottom of the lead story splash page are the indicia, which typically include the name of the comic publisher, and the date and place of publication.

, Apart from the splash page, comic book panels are normally subdivided into smaller panels, each of which displays an image in the story. The typical arrangement is to have 2 columns of 3 or 4 panels on each page; however, if an image or object is particularly important to the story, it may take up a larger panel than normal, sometimes the entire width of the page.


American comics are normally read from left to right, top to bottom, with the reader finishing one page before moving on to the next. Japanese comics, or manga, in contrast, are normally read from right to left, top to bottom; the comic binding is typically on the right side.
In some cases, panels have to be read out of this order, given the flow of the story; in these cases, arrows or other guides can be used to show the order in which the panels should be read.
The panel border can also be varied to show variations in the scene. Placing panels side-by-side, without a gutter space between them, can be used to show a rapid sequence of events, while rounded rectangle or wavy line borders can be used to indicate flashback scenes.

, When comic book characters speak or think, their external or internal dialogue needs to be displayed for the reader; this is done with word balloons. These balloons come in several styles, are usually confined to the top third of the panel, and typically display text on a white background.


Round dialogue balloons are used to indicate speech; they are connected to the character speaking by a ""V"" shaped line (pointer) pointing toward the character's mouth. If 2 or more characters are speaking, the balloon highest in the panel indicates which character is speaking first, with the next highest balloon containing the other character's reply, and if the first character has a rebuttal, it appears in a separate balloon below the second balloon.
Cloud-like word balloons are used to display a character's inner thoughts to the reader. A series of smaller ovals (bubbles) connect the balloon to the character thinking. (These balloons are sometimes used for telepathic communication, as well.)
Jagged-line or ""line-burst"" balloons are used for broadcast dialogue, such as from a radio, television, or a character communicating telepathically with others. A ""V"" shaped line is used to indicate the source of the broadcast.
Words in word balloons are normally written in all uppercase, except for comics intended for young readers. Usually, a particular narrow sans serif font is used for the dialogue (such as Comic Sans MS), although alternate fonts are sometimes used for alien or artificial intelligence beings to signify an unnatural-sounding speech. Emphasized words are shown in boldface, and some comic companies follow the practice of showing proper names in boldface, as well.
A good rule of thumb is to have no more than 3 balloons in any given panel of a comic book story.

, Although comic books are the best examples of the fiction-writing directive, ""Show, don't tell,"" there will be places when expository text is necessary to tell the story. Captions can be used in the splash panel to introduce the story or in the other panels to set the scene, note the passage of time or change of scene (""Meanwhile, back at the Hall of Justice""), provide character descriptions, or even footnotes by the editor of the series. Captions display text in the same font as that used for most dialogue, but display text on a colored background, usually yellow.


A common use of footnote captions is to refer to previous comic book issues whose story elements form the basis for the present story.

, Onomatopoeic words in comics include the ""BIFF!"" and ""POW!"" of fight scenes, the ""THWIP!"" sound Spider-Man's web shooters make, the ""BAMF!"" sound Nightcrawler of the X-Men makes when he teleports, or the ""SHNIKT!"" sound Wolverine's claws make when he extends them. These sound effect words are written in a colored, bold typeface on or near the object making the noise; the larger the letters, the louder the sound.


Along with sound effect words, you can also use impact lines or starbursts to show the force of blows and site of impact when drawing fight scenes.

Break your story down into a collection of scenes.,
Develop a sequence of panels for each scene.,
Decide what objects should receive the most emphasis within the scene.,
Draw the panels.,
Add the narration.",How to Design Comic Books2," This is called ""plotting,"" and in breaking your story down this way, you decide where the action takes place, which characters make appearances and how they act, and how many panels should be devoted to each scene. Minor scenes can be dealt with in 3 panels or fewer, while major scenes may take several pages worth of panels to be resolved.

, An opening sequence for a Superman adventure story might begin with a range of mountains, then show the door to his Fortress of Solitude, and then show the Man of Steel at work in his science lab, then cut to a display of a flashing light on one of his computer monitor banks.


One way to develop this sequence is to create a storyboard, a series of rough sketches or thumbnail images that show the flow of the story. Storyboards are often helpful in conveying the essence of the comic story in progress to an outside observer, such as an editor.

, This determines the size and shape of the comic panel. A mountain panorama can best be depicted in a long, rectangular panel, while a character close-up may best be portrayed in a large square panel.


When putting more than 1 object in a panel, place the most important object in the foreground, preferably off-center, so that it appears closer to the reader. Other objects can appear in the background, as long as they don't clutter it. If a character or object needs sufficient emphasis in a panel, you can eliminate the background altogether if you've established it in a previous panel.
At this point, you can also decide which scene should provide the image for the splash page and the front cover, and whether you want to use an actual story event or a variation of it.

, Once you have determined what you want to show, it's time to draw it. Comic book drawing usually begins with a pencil sketch, which is then inked to bring out the important lines, shadings, and shadows, and then it's colored in.

, The narration includes the word and thought balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia. In most cases, the space for the narration is blocked out, reference lines are drawn to place the words on, and then the words themselves are written in before the boundary balloon or caption box is drawn around them.

Some websites will host your comics for a fee.
If you can afford it, you can contact a web design company and hire them to make you an online comic website.

, The host website will tell you the largest file size it will accept, and how much space you can use altogether. This is important as each page of your comic will be uploaded to the host website as an image file, and you don't want to exceed this maximum size when you create each image. Also the more images you upload, the more space you will use up. If you exceed these limits, you may find you can't upload your last page, and your readers will be stuck wondering how it ends!

, Most online comics display one page at a time. Some display two pages side by side (like an open book) but this can affect how your story flows. Plan your pages with this in mind. Ex. you may have to re-design your 2-page spread if your online comic will only display one page at a time. You may have to review and possibly re-do some of your comic pages if you have drawn them already.


If your comic pages are drawn on paper, scan each page and save it as an image file eg files with extension .jpg, .png, .bmp.
Do not make it bigger than the maximum file size allowed by your host! Larger files will save more details and your comic page will look cleaner, but too large may exceed your limit.

Look for cover damage.,
Make note of attempts to repair the book.,
Examine the spine.,
Inspect the staples.",How to Grade Comic Books1," When grading a comic book, the first thing you'll see is the cover. Take a close look, ideally with a magnifying glass, and make careful notes of any apparent damage, including:Bends, folds, or dents that warp the shape or surface of the book, but don't affect the color
Coackling, a bubbling effect on the cover usually caused by printing defects
Creases, more severe folds that remove ink or otherwise create distortions in the coloring
Tears
Moisture, water damage, or ""foxing"" (bacterial or fungal growth on the paper)
Fading, lack of gloss, or ""dust shadow"" (partial exposure to dust or air resulting in uneven fading)
Fingerprints, especially those which in which skin oils have led to discoloration of the ink
Chew (rodent damage)
Writing or other soiling of the cover.;
, Look for evidence of tape or glue or other attempts to repair the book. These generally have a negative effect on the value.Note that more sophisticated efforts to restore a comic book, such as color restoration or re-glossing are often undetectable by amateur graders (and sometimes even professionals), but can also have a negative effect on value if noticed by a potential buyer. Such restorations should be noted upfront before attempting to sell a comic book., Less obvious but equally important to the surface of the cover is the spine of the comic book. Inspect it closely, making note of any of the following:Spine stress/bindery tears, small creases, folds, or tears (under 1/4 inch) running perpendicular to the spine
Spine roll, a curvature of the left edge of a comic toward the front or back, caused by folding back each page of the comic as it was read
Spine break, spine stress that has become a full tear (usually through multiple pages), typically found near the staples
Spine split, a clean, even separation at the fold, usually (but not always) right above or below a staple

, The staples themselves must also be inspected closely. Make sure no staples are missing at that the staples are in good condition.Look for signs of rust on the staples, as well as ""popped"" staples. A popped staple occurs when one side of a cover has torn right next to the staple, but remains attached by the paper beneath the staple. This condition can easily lead to detached staples.

Scan the pages of your comic book.,
Name the digital images sequentially.,
Organize the images into folders.,
Create a compressed (zipped) file.,
Rename the compressed file extension to indicate the file is a comic book archive.,
Read the digital archive file with a comic book reader program.",How to Convert Comic Books to Digital Format," Scanning the pages creates digital images of each page. The best kind of scanner to use for this task is a flatbed scanner, as it allows you to place the comic on the platen (glass screen) without taking it apart. You can also use a wand scanner to go over each page to create your digital images and then upload them to your computer; this type of scanner may produce more satisfactory images if you choose to digitize a graphic novel or anthology bound like a book.


Although flatbed and wand scanners will let you create digital images from comic pages without taking the comic book apart, some comics fans choose to take their comics apart when scanning them. If you do this, carefully open the staples binding the comic together and separate the pages. Be sure to pay attention to the page order both when reassembling the comic and when managing the digital images you've created.
Some comics fans choose to scan only the front cover and story pages, while others also scan the inside covers, the back cover, the letter column pages, and advertising pages as well.
Whether you choose to separate your pages or not when scanning, handle the comic as gently as possible. If the comic is particularly valuable, you may wish to handle it with gloves when scanning it.;
, Some scanners automatically include numbers in the names of the digital images they create; however, the default names usually are the date the image was scanned, along with a sequence number for the order in which the image was scanned. If you did not create your images by scanning the comic front to back, you'll have to rename the image files to reflect the correct sequence.


You can rename the file by double-clicking the file name and typing a new name or by reviewing each page with a digital image processing program such as Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro and saving the scanned image under a new name. Digital imaging programs enable you to rotate the image, if you scanned the page upside down, make minor corrections before saving, and also enable you to save your image in a different graphic format than the scanner created it in.
A good naming convention for page image names is to use the short form of the comic name (""Action"" for ""Action Comics,"" for example), the issue number and a sequence number representing the page order. (Comic books sequentially number their story pages; however, these numbers may not include the letter column or advertising pages.)
Graphic images of comic pages may be saved in a number of formats, including Windows Bitmap (BMP), Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), and Graphic Image Format (GIF). The most common formats, however, are JPG and PNG, with PNG offering image compression without a loss of data.

, This step is entirely optional and may best be used to separate page images for the main comic story from those of backup features.

, Digital comics are most commonly in the form of comic book archive files, which are compressed files created using either a compression utility built into your computer's operating system or a third-party utility program.


Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 all have the capability to create ZIP files by selecting the files or folders to be compressed, right-clicking, selecting ""Send to"" from the popup menu and then selecting ""Compressed (zipped) folder."" Mac OS has a similar built-in function for creating compressed files.
If you prefer to create ZIP files with a third-party utility, you can use a utility such as WinZip, PKUnzip, IZarc, or ALZip, or Power Archiver for Windows or Stuffit Expander or The Unarchiver. Utility programs such as Bandizip, and Zipeg work for both Windows and Mac, while 7-Zip works on a number of platforms.
To create a RAR compressed file, you must use either the commercial utility WinRAR or the freeware application RAR for Pocket PC. (The RAR compression format was created in 1993 by Eugene Roshal and offers a better rate of compression than the ZIP format, but at a lower compression speed.) The ACE compression format has a proprietary utility program associated with it also, WinAce. Other compression formats, such as TAR and 7Z, have their own utility programs associated with them.

, This is necessary for the comic book reader program to recognize the compressed file as a comic book archive. The format names given below all begin with ""cb"" for ""comic book,"" with the third letter of the new extension taken from the first character of the original extension. (Some readers, however, will work with compressed files with their original extension names.)


Rename the extension "".zip"" to "".cbz"".
Rename the extension "".rar"" to "".cbr"".
Rename the extension "".ace"" to "".cba"".
Rename the extension "".tar"" to "".cbt"".
Rename the extension "".7z"" to "".cb7"".

, Your digital comic file should read effectively with whatever comic book reader program you have installed on your computer. If not, you'll have to create the compressed file again. Comic book reader programs for Windows include CDisplay, Caliber, Comical, Evince, and GonVisor. Readers for Macintosh include FFView, Simple Comic, and a Mac version of Comical.

Count the pages.,
Note any loose pages.,
Look for damage to the pages.,
Assess paper integrity.",How to Grade Comic Books2," Once you've had chance to thoroughly examine the cover, carefully open the book to examine the pages. For very collectible books, the use of tweezers is recommended to minimize contact with harmful skin oils. Your first step is to count the pages.


Make sure there are no missing pages in the comic book. Missing pages severely impact a comic's value., With older comics, it is common for the center-fold pages (and sometimes other page as well) to become detached from the staples.Make note of how many pages (or ""wraps"") are detached, either fully or partially.

, In addition to damage caused by readers, paper stored improperly can easily degrade. There are several common problems with the pages you should watch out for and make note of:Tears, creases, or cuts (such as clipped coupons)
Tape, glue, or other attempts to repair pages
Writing or other soil to the pages
Water damage, often leading to a stiffness or rippling of the paper
Staple migration, a condition that occurs when the rust from staples stains the paper around it

, Today's comics are printed on a higher-quality paper that withstands aging reasonably well. With older comics, this is not the case--the quality of the paper is likely to have degraded some from age.Look for discoloration or brittleness. Especially in comics from the 1980s and earlier, the paper can become yellow or tan as it oxidizes, and loses some of it's structural integrity.
A certain amount of discoloration is expected and acceptable in very old comics, but the less the better.

Consider a ""Mint"" grade.,
Assess whether it might deserve a ""Fine"" grade.,
Determine whether it might merit a ""Good"" grade.,
Consider a ""Fair"" grade.,
Give a ""Poor"" or ""Incomplete"" grade if necessary.,
Look into professional grading.",How to Grade Comic Books3," Comics are graded using both descriptive categories and a 0-10 rating system. If your comic is in flawless or nearly flawless condition, it might merit a grade of ""mint"" or ""near mint."" This condition applies to perfectly flat comics with supple paper, a glossy cover, and no obvious wear.""Mint"" grades include ""Perfect/Gem Mint"" (10.0) and ""Mint"" (9.9). These describe comics that have no detectable imperfections. A 10.0 book is absolutely perfect in every way. Very few comics meet this criteria, even those still sitting on the shelves in a comic store.""Near Mint+/Mint"" grades include ""Near Mint/Mint"" (9.8) and ""Near Mint+"" (9.6). These grades describe comics that have only the slightest wear. A small number of stress lines and very slight discoloration are acceptable defects. Most people would consider these to be perfect, but the trained eye may notice tiny imperfections.
""Near Mint"" (9.4) and ""Near Mint-"" (9.2) describe comics that have minimal stress lines and discoloration. The spine and cover are flat. The cover may have a small amount of surface wear, but the colors are still bright. A 9.4 Near Mint book is the standard condition of a new book sold at a comic store as is considered ""new"" condition. A 9.2 indicates only the very minor wear, typically a minimal stress mark on the spine (non-color breaking) or other similar marks.

, A comic which is well preserved but not ""mint"" is typically described as ""Fine"" or ""Very Fine."" These are comics that have been read and enjoyed, but with care. They may have some discoloration, but pages should still be supple and the cover should still be glossy and attractive.""Very Fine/Near Mint"" (9.0), ""Very Fine+"" (8.5), ""Very Fine"" (8.0), and ""Very Fine-"" (7.5) are grades that allow for some wear, as they have typically been read a few times. A few stress lines are acceptable. While the cover can have some wear, it should still retain its original glossiness.
""Fine"" grades include ""Fine/Very Fine"" (7.0), ""Fine+"" (6.5), ""Fine"" (6.0), and ""Fine-"" (5.5). These grades describe comics with a fair amount of stress lines and creases. A low number of small tears and missing pieces, usually 1/8 to 1/4 inch (about 3.1 to 6.3 mm) in length is also acceptable at this grade level.

, Below ""Fine"" is the grade of ""Good."" This is somewhat deceptive, as a grade of ""good"" is actually not particularly good, but more like average. These are comics that have been well-loved by a reader. Still, books in this condition must be intact and readable.""Very Good"" grades include ""Very Good/Fine"" (5.0), ""Very Good+"" (4.5), ""Very Good"" (4.0), and ""Very Good-"" (3.5). These grades describe a comic that has all of its pages but is noticeably creased, rolled, and scuffed. Missing pieces on the cover can be as large as 1/4 to 1/2 inch (about 6.3 to 12.5 mm).
""Good"" grades include ""Good/Very Good"" (3.0), ""Good+"" (2.5), ""Good"" (2.0), and ""Good-"" (1.8). These grades describe comics that are in somewhat worse condition than the ""Very Good"" grades. The cover may have some missing pieces and the book is generally scuffed, abraded, and faded. Moderate spine split is permissible. The comic still has all of its pages, however.

, A ""Fair"" condition comic is ragged and unattractive. It may have pieces of pages missing that make the story more difficult to follow (e.g. clipped coupons that cut into panels on the reverse side of the page).""Fair"" grades include ""Fair/Good"" (1.5) and ""Fair"" (1.0). These grades describe comics that are worn and in general disarray. Despite their condition, they still retain all of the pages and most of the covers. These comics may be torn, stained, faded, and brittle.

, ""Poor"" comics are what the name suggests--heavily damaged. They may be defaced, torn, stained, or have missing chunks.""Incomplete"" comics are those missing covers or pages.""Poor"" (0.5) describes comic books that are missing pages and up to 1/3 of the cover. The comic may be brittle and defaced by other materials such as paint and glue.
Some people will not grade a comic missing it's cover, but some give ""Incomplete"" comics a score between 0.1 and 0.3.

, If you have a comic that is extremely rare, you may wish to consider having it graded professionally. This allows you to speak confidently about it's condition in any setting, such as negotiations about pricing.


If you plan to have a comic professionally sealed (or ""slabbed""), a professional grading is recommended, since any potential buyers will not be able to open the comic and assess it for themselves.Professional graders included the Certified Guarantee Company (CGC) and Professional Grading Experts (PGX).

, Over the course of his comic book career, Superman has appeared in a number of DC Comics titles, either as the star or as a supporting character. Following is a list of titles where you can find the Man of Steel:


Action Comics. Superman first appeared in Issue #1 of this comic in June, 1938, 5 years after his creators, Jerry Sigel and Joe Shuster, first tried to publish him. He has appeared in each issue since and on the covers of most, except for a few early issues and for a brief period in the mid-to-late 1980s, when it was published weekly instead of monthly. Action Comics ran for 904 issues, until August 2011, when DC rebooted its continuity and gave Superman a new costume. Action started again with Issue #1 in September 2011. (This comic title may be what gave rise to one of Superman's nicknames, the Action Ace.)
Superman. Premiering in June 1939, this was the first comic book title to be named for the superhero character it starred. Issue #1 reprinted the Superman story in Action #1; subsequent issues led with original stories. Unlike Action Comics, Superman was renumbered twice. The first renumbering happened when Superman was retitled ""The Adventures of Superman"" in January 1987 and a new Superman title was created to showcase the changes made to the character following the Crisis on Infinite Earths. That new Superman ended with Issue #226 in 2006, as ""The Adventures of Superman"" reverted to the title ""Superman."" In August 2011, it ended with Issue #714 and was renumbered to Issue 1 the following month.
Superman: The Man of Steel. This title, using Superman's most famous nickname, was first a 6-issue miniseries covering Superman's revised origin following the Crisis on Infinite Earths. It returned in 1991 as a monthly comic and ran for 134 issues before cancellation in 2003.
Superman: The Man of Tomorrow. This comic, using Superman's original nickname, started on a quarterly basis in 1995 but began to be published less frequently before being canceled in 1999 after 15 issues.
More Fun Comics/Adventure Comics. Technically, it was not Superman who appeared here, but Super boy, who was the juvenile form of Superman. (The modern Super Boy, introduced in 1992, was a genetically engineered being, half of whose DNA was Superman's.) Super boy premiered in More Fun #101, January 1945, which was later renamed Adventure Comics. A Super Boy title followed in 1950; the Boy of Steel appeared in both titles until the late 1960s and in his own title with the Legion of Super-Heroes thereafter.
Superman's Pal: Jimmy Olsen. The first of 2 titles to focus on 1 of Superman's friends, this title premiered in October 1954 and ran for 163 issues, ending in March 1974. It centered on the escapades of Daily Planet cub (and later full-fledged) reporter Jimmy Olsen, who could, when things got hairy (or in some stories, he did), summon the Man of Might with his signal watch. Early stories in this series often took a humorous bent, while later stories became more serious. Jack Kirby's ""Fourth World,"" including the Forever People, the New Gods, and the villainous Darkseid, were first introduced in this comic book.
Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane. Following a tryout in Showcase, this title, premiering in March 1958, gave Lois Lane her own comic book. Stories varied from humorous to serious; a number of stories had Superman as the object of a love triangle between Lois and his childhood sweetheart, Lana Lang, who had grown up to become a TV reporter. The title ran for 137 issues, ending in October 1974, after which Lois' adventures were folded into Superman Family. There were also 2 annuals.
Superman Family. This title featured various members of the Superman myths who had either had their own titles or appeared as backup features in Action or Superman. There were Superman stories, as well as stories featuring Jimmy Olsen, Lois Lane, Super girl, Krypto, the Earth-2 Superman, and Kandorian superheroes Night wing and Flame Bird. Some issues featured a single story that incorporated all members of the Superman family then featured in the book. This title ran for 59 issues from May 1974 to September 1982, with its first issue numbered at 164, following the numbering of Superman's Pal: Jimmy Olsen. It became a giant-sized Dollar Comic in April 1977.
World's Finest Comics. Introduced as World's Best Comics in the spring of 1941, this title originally featured Superman and Batman in separate stories, even though both were featured on the cover. In Issue #71 in 1954, Superman and Batman started working together. This partnership was interrupted in the early 1970s to let the Metropolis Marvel partner with other superheroes, then the team-ups with Batman resumed until the title's cancellation in 1986 after 323 issues. The two heroes would pair again in Superman/Batman, although their post-Crisis partnership was often rougher than in their earlier years.
DC Comics Presents. Introduced in July 1978, this title paired Superman with superheroes other than Batman, paralleling the successful teaming of the Caped Crusader with other superheroes in ""The Brave and the Bold"". DC Comics Presents ran for 97 issues, ending in 1986.
Justice League of America. The Silver Age counterpart to the Justice Society of America, the Justice League of America started as a feature in ""The Brave and the Bold"" (Issue #28, March 1960), before becoming its own title in 1960. While Superman had been a reserve member of the Justice Society, he took part in only one JSA adventure and made a token appearance in another. However, he was a charter member of the JLA, appearing in most of the issues of Justice League of America until that title's cancellation in 1986. He did not appear in the first reconstitution of the Justice League after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, but he has appeared in most of the JLA membership rosters since.
Super Friends. DC Comics' adaptation of the Hanna-Barbra cartoon series that featured Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, Aqua Man, and their junior partners (originally Wendy and Marvin, then later Wonder twins Zayn and Jayna). The comic was better grounded in the DC universe than the TV series and also introduced international superheroes such as the Jack O' lantern, the Seraph, and the Green Fury. (A more recent Super Friends title features chibi-style renderings of Justice League Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aqua man, Flash, and the John Stewart version of Green Lantern.
Superman Adventures. Aimed at a younger audience, this title follows the continuity of the 1996 to 2000 ""Superman: The Animated Series"" and features art drawn in the style of that series. Superman also appears regularly in the DC animated titles ""Justice League Adventures"" and ""Justice League Unlimited,"" based on the animated series with the same titles.
Superman has also appeared in a number of special issue comics over the years. The earliest were the 1939 and 1940 New York World's Fair Comics, produced in conjunction with the 1939 World's Fair; there was also a 1953 3-D edition, complete with special glasses. A number of annuals or 80-page giant issues were released to mark milestone anniversaries for the character, although some featured original stories, such as a 1977 special issue where the Man of Steel encountered an alien race who regarded him as a God after he had unknowingly bestowed the gift of eternal life on them as the result of saving Earth from destruction when time traveling into the primordial past.

, If you collect comics for profit, first appearance issues are among those prized by collectors. First appearance stories are also popular stories for reprint collections aimed at those collectors who want to have the story without having to shell out big bucks to own the original comic book. Major characters in the Superman mythos are listed below, along with the comic issues in which they first appeared:


Some of the major characters have appeared since the early days of Superman's adventures. Lois Lane first appeared with Superman in Action Comics #1, while his arch-enemy, Luthor, first appeared in Action #23, April 1940, albeit with a shock of red hair instead of the bald pate he would sport from his third appearance onward. Jimmy Olsen and Perry White were introduced on ""The Adventures of Superman"" radio show, but made their way into Superman comics by 1940. Superman's parents, Jor-El and Lara, first appeared in the Superman newspaper strip in 1939 as ""Jor-L"" and ""Lora,"" but did not appear in the comics until 1945, when they appeared in the first Super boy story in More Fun Comics #101 that January. More Fun/Adventure also established the first names of Superman's foster parents, the Kents, as Jonathan and Martha. The fifth dimension imp, Mr. Mxyzptlk (then spelled ""Mxyztplk""), made his first appearance in Superman #30, September 1944.
The 1950s expanded the Superman cast of characters and also began to flesh out the history of his home planet, Krypton. A trio of Kryptonian villains appeared in Superman #65, August 1950, and again in Action #194, July 1954, followed by Krypto the Super dog in Adventure #210, March 1955. Two super-gorillas from Krypton followed in the next few years. Then the bottle city of Kandor made its first appearance in Action #242, July 1958, when Superman first fought Brainiac, the evil android who had shrunk it. Ten months later, Superman's cousin Super Girl premiered in Action #252. Other characters added to the Superman myths were his childhood sweetheart, Lana Lang, who appeared as a teenager in Super boy #10 in 1950 and as an adult several years later, and his imperfect clone, Bizarro, who appeared as a juvenile in Super boy #68, October 1958, and as an adult a year later in a 2-part story in Action #254 and #255. The Arctic Fortress of Solitude was also introduced during this decade, as were the Legion of Super-Heroes, who premiered in Adventure Comics #247, April 1958.
The 1960s further expanded and refined the Superman myths. Luthor acquired a first name, Lex, in Adventure Comics #271, April 1960, and his reason for hating Superman became a desire of revenge over the accidental destruction of his lab, the life form he created, and the loss of his hair. The Phantom Zone appeared the following April in Adventure Comics #283, giving Superman a ready source of villains from his home world to battle and re-imprison. Luthor would get a planet of his own to defend, Lexor; Bizarro also got his own planet, the Bizarro World (Htrae), in a 2-part story in Action #263 and #264. The Kandorian version of Batman and Robin, Nightwing and Flame bird, were also introduced in this decade, as was the Superman Emergency Squad, also based in Kandor.
The 1970s and early 1980s added few new characters to the Superman family. When Clark Kent moved from print to TV journalism, he acquired a new boss in the person of Morgan Edge of Galaxy Communications and a minor nemesis in the person of practical joking sportscaster Steve Lombard. The enduring villain to come from this era came in 1980 in the person of the hulking, cruel Mongul, introduced in November of that year in DC Comics Presents #27, a villain powerful enough that Superman never faced him without the assistance of other superheroes.
The mid-1980s saw the revision of many characters in the Superman myths, such as Lex Luthor, Brainiac, and Super girl, and the elimination of others, such as Krypto, Nightwing and Flame bird, and the Superman Emergency Squad. It was not until November 1992, however, that a major new villain was introduced, that being Doomsday, who premiered in Superman: The Man of Steel #18. Doomsday did what no other foe before had done � kill Superman, who was actually in a death-like coma during which a number of pretenders to the Superman mantle arose.

, In his over 7 decades, Superman has been featured in a number of memorable stories that have proved popular with fans who seek out either the original comic book or one of many reprints that include those stories.


Stories from the late 1930s and early 1940s often showed a social bent reflecting Sigel and Shuster's vision of Superman as ""champion of the oppressed."" A story in Action Comics #3 shows the Man of Steel going undercover in a mining camp to expose a corrupt operation. Another story from the 1940s shows him halting a war by abducting the leaders of the combatant countries and forcing them to fight it out with each other. Social issues would return periodically over the years, including Superman's 1986 appearance in the ""Heroes vs. Hunger"" special comic and a story from the 1990s where he dismantles the military of Middle Eastern country Qurac for their sponsoring of terror.
Stories from the 1950s and 1960s had Superman dealing with more powerful foes and bigger stories with science fiction elements such as radiation, time travel, and other dimensions. Major stories from this era included Superman's time travel back to Krypton before its explosion, as well as the imaginary stories where Luthor kills Superman and where Superman solves all the world's problems by splitting into Superman Red and Superman Blue. Superman #76, August 1952, featured the first comic book adventure Superman shared with Batman, and Superman #199, August 1967, featured his first race with the Flash. This was also the period when Superman was first plagued by Red Kryptonite, which had bizarre physical and mental effects on him for limited periods of time. Story forms included 3-part ""novels"" and ""Imaginary Tales"" that diverged from the regular continuity.
Stories from the early 1970s saw a return to social relevance, such as the story in Superman #247 from 1972 where the Guardians of the Universe implant the notion in Superman's mind that he may be doing too much for mankind, a notion renewed several years later by the being Destiny in Superman #352. This was also the era when Clark Kent went from being a newspaper reporter to a TV anchorman; by the end of the decade, he was working for both the Daily Planet and station WGBS. Multi-issue story arcs became more commonplace during this era, such as a 4-part series in Superman #296 to 299 where an alien causes Superman to lose his powers when dressed as Clark Kent, forcing the Man of Steel to re-examine his dual identity.
The late 1970s-to-mid 1980s saw the introduction of limited-run series such as the 3-issue ""World of Krypton"" in 1979 and ""The Krypton Chronicles"" in 1981, which wove stories first told in the backup feature ""The Fabulous World of Krypton"" into stories of Jor-El's life and career and of Superman's family history. The 4-issue Phantom Zone miniseries, published in 1982, featured a bold attempt by the Phantom Zone criminals to escape the Zone and also revealed the Zone's nature as an interface between 2 dimensions.
After the Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1986, storylines and story arcs became, if not grander in fact, grander by being given names, such as ""World Without a Superman"" and ""Reign of the Supermen,"" the results of Superman's apparent death after battling Doomsday. Another major story arc hearkened back to the Superman Red and Blue imaginary story from the 1960s by having Superman changed from being a physical powerhouse to an energy being given form by his containment suit and eventually being split into a Superman Red and a Superman Blue. Most of these story arcs were reprinted as graphic anthologies shortly after their original publication, and the entire saga with Doomsday and its aftermath were also published in novel form.

, Superman has been drawn by a number of comic artists over the years. Several of these artists have become associated with the character; a partial list is given below.


Joe Shuster, who co-created Superman, was the first artist to draw Superman, which he did from the character's premiere into the early 1940s. His Superman lacked the detail associated with later artists, although he did show the Man of Tomorrow's enjoyment of his super-abilities through subtle facial detail and depicted Superman's cape billowing behind him as he soared through the air. Shuster initially showed the ""S"" shield as a triangle (with an indistinct ""S""), gradually evolving it into the more-familiar pentagon shape.
Wayne Boring first drew Superman as an assistant to Joe Shuster for the Superman newspaper strip, which he took over in 1940. His first comic book work appeared in 1942, and by the end of the decade, he was the principal artist for Action Comics and Superman. He was again the principal artist for Action during the mid-1960s and returned to draw one of the last of the Red Kryptonite stories in the early 1980s. He established the towering, muscular look associated with the Man of Steel, although with a thicker waist than drawn by other artists, and also defined the futuristic appearance of the planet Krypton.
Curt Swan first drew Superman in Superman #51, April 1948, and Super boy in Issue 5 of that comic the following year, as well as doing some of Superman's early team-ups with Batman in World's Finest. He was the primary artist for Superman's Pal: Jimmy Olsen and ended up drawing the Man of Steel in most of his non-team appearances from the 1950s through the mid-1980s. Swan added a dimension of realism to Superman's facial expression even as he exaggerated the Man of Steel's musculature.
John Byrne wrote and drew Superman for the first few years after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, starting with the 6-issue revision of the character's origin, Superman: The Man of Steel. He revised the look as well as the origin of Lex Luthor and the appearances of Jor-El and Lara, among others, made Clark Kent more outgoing, and also did away with Super boy.

These issues are usually bagged and backed and may also be kept behind glass. Newer used issues than these are kept in bins and may be organized by title.


Comic shops also carry various DC reprint collections, which may be soft-covers in black and white (Showcase Presents) or hard-covers in color (DC Archive Editions). Other reprint collections are in the format of graphic anthologies, which are color soft-covers.

, Comics collectors looking to part with comics they no longer want may advertise them for sale in either local newspapers or comic book industry publications. Most ads will mention the comic publisher or comic titles available, but usually not specific issues of specific comics.

, Thrift stores, second-hand bookstores, and flea markets may all have Superman comics in their inventory. Most issues will be more recent issues, but you may find some Silver or Bronze Age titles if you're lucky. You may also find some of the smaller Blue Ribbon Digests, which reprint Superman adventures around a theme, or larger Treasury-sized Famous First Editions, which reproduce the stories from first issues of various DC titles.

, Most science fiction conventions feature a dealers' room that may include comic book dealers. There are also conventions devoted solely to comic books, ranging from small, 1-day events to national, multi-day conventions such as Comic-Con, which feature representatives of major comic book companies as well as the opportunity to buy and sell. At smaller conventions, the oldest Superman comics available will likely be those from the late Silver or early Bronze Ages, although you may find a few late Golden Age and early Silver Age issues. Larger conventions are more likely to feature dealers who have Superman comics from the early Silver or late Golden Ages.


As with comic shops, dealers at conventions often feature older and costlier titles on display separate from the boxes of newer, used comics.

, Many comics dealers have Internet storefronts. Usually, these are oriented toward current comics, but some dealers may deal in older issues. You may also find vintage Superman comics available through online marketplaces such as eBay, Craigslist, or Amazon.com, or through comics auction sites such as <a href=""http://www.comiclink.com"">www.comiclink.com</a> or <a href=""http://www.comicconnect.com"">www.comicconnect.com</a>.


In addition to major Internet search engines such as Google, there are also specialized search engines for comics such as <a href=""http://www.comicseeker.com"">www.comicseeker.com</a>.
You can also network with other Superman fans through online communities and forums.

, Because the oldest Superman comics are the rarest Superman comics, if you want to get something from the early Golden Age, you're most likely to get it by dealing with an auction house. Keep in mind that the oldest comics now command prices well over $100,000, however.

Be kind to charity.,

Try a first aid course.,
Finally, make a comic about yourself.",How to Become Like a Comic Book Superhero (for Young Teens)," Don't just go straight to getting a name because, of course, your name will probably have something to do with your powers. Flight is a good one to do. You may want to base your powers off an animal such as a fox or a bird. So if you did maybe a monkey, you could be flexible and smart.;
, It's quite difficult to think of one. Do you have a nickname? A favourite colour or animal? Many superheroes in books have their name or nickname with a ""Captain"", ""Super"", or ""Miss"" or ""Mister"". I would personally go for a nickname because if you want to hide your identity, your real name could spoil it.

, This may be the only time a superhero creates a scheme instead of destroying, but it is still important. This will be used for your costume and car and whatever else you want.

, Make sure it doesn't limit your mobility or flexibility. A good superhero costume would tie together the traditional aspects (such as tights or a cape) along with a new innovation or change (like instead of a tied mask, its glasses or something). You can sew some of it and buy some if you want. Ask your Mum to help you, if you aren't the greatest at sewing.

, A teddy bear dressed in your colours (yeah, a teddy bear. They can stare down evil) or you could have one of your VERY VERY VERY BEST friends to help. You must trust your life with them. Your identity. And the password to one of your favourite websites or forums. This is so you can make sure trust is fully there. If you get in a fight, CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD! Also, make them a costume.

, Of course, you should be fit in all ways, but make sure you excel in your ""power sport"". For flying, long jump or high jump would be good. Super strength people should try shot-put. Merheroes should swim like they were born in the water. And of course, super speeders should win the cross country every time.

, If it is on in your country, do the 40 hour famine (20 hours only if your under 14, it's the rules, at least in NZ)or volunteer at the local soup kitchen. Every week you should do something like donate a dollar to charity, every month you should donate ten, and then every year donate to some yearly telethon. Aim to go to Africa and help the needy there when you are old enough.

, Ask your Uncle or Dad to take you to a shooting range that is safe for young people, and they might even say yes! If you can't, head down to your local fair or carnival, and play that game where you shoot a water pistol at a target. Wrestle with your siblings. Make sure you can defend yourself!

, Basic first aid is important, so you can help people in need. If you can't find one, research on the internet about how to do CPR, how to dress a wound, etc.

, Make sure you don't spill the beans about your identity though! HAVE FUN SAVING THE WORLD!

Create the language or languages spoken in the fictional world.,
Determine the beliefs of the world.,
Identify traditions and rituals.,
Describe the social hierarchy of the world.,
Discuss the social norms.,
Identify the taboos.,
Determine how the world functions economically.,
Outline the political system.,
Think about the world’s approach to war and the military.",How to Create a Fictional Culture," Language is a major component of a world’s culture. Think about how the characters in your story communicate with one another. Consider if the language is spoken and written, if it uses letters, and if it is similar or different from English. Be consistent and detailed about the specifics of the language in the fictional world.There may also be more than one language spoken in your fictional world. Doing this will often create a richer and more diverse culture.
For example, you may have one group of people who speak a language similar to English and a group of aliens who speak a language very different from English.
Or you may have a city of people who speak a dialect similar to Chinese and people who live in the outskirts of the city who speak a completely made up language.;
, Another key element is the belief system or religion of the fictional world. This has a big impact of the culture of the fictional world, as what people believe in often shapes how they interact with one another and view the world. Determine if there are multiple religions in the world or one dominant religion and other less dominant religions.You may borrow from existing religions, such as the use of a book similar to the Bible or the saints in Catholicism. Try combining elements from several different religions to create a fictional one.
For example, you may have a dominant religion that closely resembles Christianity and less dominant religions that combine elements of Buddhism and Taoism.

, Write down any traditions that are practiced as part of the culture. Identify rituals that are done by members of a certain religion or group in the culture. Be specific and detailed. Most traditions and rituals are very old or ancient and have been practice for a long time. Consider this as you create your own for the fictional culture.For example, you may have traditions like reciting a prayer before a meal as part of the culture. Or you may have a ritual around visiting someone’s home that is expected in the culture.

, A big part of culture is how a society is organized on a social level. Think about the social hierarchy of the fictional world and how this affects the culture. Is there one group at the top of society and one group at the bottom? Is the society organized by class, race, or religion?For example, the world may have elected leaders or groups. Or there may be rightful heirs to the throne. May be people in the world discriminate against a certain group based on their religion, class, or race.

, Social norms are what is deemed normal or acceptable in a society. Culture often comes from social norms and expectations. Outline the social norms of the fictional world in detail. Ask yourself, what is considered normal in this world? What is deemed acceptable or okay to do in public?For example, a social norm in the fictional world may be that men and women wear full length clothing in public and refrain from touching.

, Taboos are practices that are considered unacceptable or indecent. Every culture has taboos that go against social norms. Identify a few taboos in your fictional world to create a more detailed and believable fictional culture.For example, there may be taboos around how the dead are mourned and buried. Perhaps it is against the social norm not to bury the dead in the cemetery.
There may also be taboos around sexuality and sexual relationships between people. It may be against social norms to be with someone of the same sex or to have more than one sexual partner at a time.

, Think about the economic system in the fictional world. Determine how characters make money and survive. This will influence the overall culture of the fictional world. Is it a bartering system with no money? Are there different levels to the economy? Are there wealthy and poor people?For example, you may start with how the main characters in your fiction earn their money. You may then think about how their jobs affect how they think, act, and communicate with others.

, You should also identify the political systems or systems in the fictional world, as this will inform the culture. Decide if the fictional world is based on American democracy or a totalitarian regime. Determine if there are winners and losers in the political system. Outline how politics affects the lives of the characters in your story.For example, your fictional world may have a political system based on American democracy, with political parties and the electoral college. Or your fictional world may combine elements of a totalitarian regime and socialism.

, Another major influence on culture is how the military functions in the fictional world. Think about whether the military has a strong presence in the world and if so, in what way. Consider if there is a history of wars or conflicts in the fictional world. These elements will all contribute to the culture of the world.For example, maybe there is a forgotten war that is only remembered by older people in the fictional world. This may then create a culture of disconnection from the past for the younger generation in the world.

Decide how intimate you want your writing to sound.,
Consider if dialect is important.,
Think about how much information your reader needs.,
Decide if you want to offer multiple perspectives.,
Consider the bias of the narrator.,
Think about using multiple points of view.",How to Choose Point of View in Storytelling," With first person point of view, the narrator uses the pronouns ""I"" and ""we"" when telling the story. The narrator can have various levels of intimacy with the story, depending on who he is, but he is always a character in the story in one way or another.The narrator may be the main character of the story, in which case he will be telling his own story from his own perspective, with no outside opinions. For example, the narrator may say, ""I was five years old when I first met Sally. We walked to school together every day until high school...""
The narrator may be a secondary character, in which case he is likely describing something that he witnessed, adding his own interpretations and biases to the story. For example, the narrator might say, ""I have been concerned about my brother for some time now. He has been becoming more and more reclusive every day.""
The narrator may be retelling a story that he did not witness at all, in which case he is recalling something he heard, and likely adding his own interpretation to the events as he retells them. For example, the narrator might say, ""I remember hearing that this house was haunted. They say the woman who lived here 100 years ago still walks the halls."";
, Second person point of view is the least common in story telling because it requires the narrator to address someone (either the reader or another character) as ""you"" throughout the narration. It is most often used in shorter narratives as an experimental style.When narrators speak in the second person, they are often addressing their younger selves. For example, the narrator might say, ""You were so foolish back then, thinking that you would become rich and famous.""A narrator may also be addressing the reader directly, although this is difficult to sustain in longer narratives.

, Third person point of view is the most popular point of view for story telling because it offers writers the most flexibility. The narrator is not a character in the story, and talks about the characters by using the pronouns ""he,"" ""she,"" and ""they."" The narrator may be entirely objective, or may have a close connection to one specific character.With a third person objective point of view, the narrator tells only the objective and observable facts of the story, without elaborating on the thoughts and feelings of the characters or interjecting with any personal observations. For example, the narrator might say, ""Jim had a serious look on his face as he spoke to his wife. She was crying and speaking incoherently.""
With a third person limited point of view, the narrator has access to the thoughts and feelings of one specific character, most typically the main character. This point of view allows the writer to describe the main character from a distance, while also giving voice to his inner thoughts. Depending on the intent of the author, the narrator may be very close to the main character, to the point that it almost becomes difficult to distinguish the narrator from the character, or the narrator may maintain more of a distance.For example, the narrator might say, ""Jim had a serious look on his face as he talked to his wife. He hated to see her cry because it made him feel like a monster, but he felt that he had no choice but to continue.""

, Third person omniscient point of view is similar to other third person points of view in that the narrator uses the pronouns ""he,"" ""she,"" and ""they"" to talk about the characters. It is different, however, in that the narrator has complete access to the thoughts and feelings of all of the characters/ This point of view is sometimes referred to as ""the voice of God"" because the narrator knows much more than any of the characters. For example, the narrator might say, ""Jim had a serious look on his face as he talked to his wife. He hated to see her cry because it made him feel like a monster, but he felt that he had no choice but to continue. His wife was feeling more angry than hurt, but she didn't want Jim to know that.""

, Ask yourself how close your main character is to the story and how connected you want the reader to feel to this character. A first person point of view will create the strongest sense connection, and a third person limited point of view will be a close second.Keep in mind that if you choose to write from a first person point of view, you need to establish how and why the narrator is telling the story, as this will have a big impact on the way in which the reader interprets it. Your character could, for example, be writing his story in a private diary, or he could be telling it to a group of friends., If the unique flavor of your main character's dialect is important to your story, you may want to choose to tell it from a first person point of view. This will allow your narration to have the same cadence as your dialogue.If you want the narration to have some of the flavor of your character's dialect, but still be distinct, opt for a third person limited or omniscient point of view. When a third person narrator is very close to a specific character's thoughts, it is natural for the narration to mirror the speaking habits of the character.

, A first person point of view is the most limiting in regards to how much information you can share with the reader, while a third person omniscient point of view allows you to share anything and everything. Think about whether your story will make sense to the reader without any intervention from a third person narrator.If you want the reader to feel confused with the main character or follow the main character's process of discovering something, the limitations of a first person point of view will serve your needs.
Third person limited and objective points of view offer a nice middle ground between first person and third person omniscient.
Keep in mind that just because you choose a third person omniscient point of view does not mean that your narrator has to share all of his knowledge with the reader; it simply means that he can do so if it benefits the story.

, The benefit of a third person omniscient point of view is that your reader can understand how multiple characters feel about an issue, even when the characters don't understand each other's feelings. The reader also gets the benefit of the narrator's interpretation.Multiple perspective are particularly helpful if you want your story to convey a sense of dramatic irony, if you want the reader to feel torn between loyalties to two characters, or if your story consists of multiple overlapping narratives.
While a third person omniscient point of view may be the most useful for conveying multiple perspectives, you can achieve a similar effect by using a third person objective point of view, which leaves it up to the reader to infer how each character is feeling.

, It is possible for any narrator to be deceitful, but readers are much more likely to distrust first person narrators because of their inherent biases. Third person omniscient narrators may also be viewed suspiciously, as they know everything, but may not choose to reveal everything to the reader.In some cases you may want a less than objective narrator, in which case a first person point of view is ideal.
If you don't want there to be any question regarding the truthfulness of your narration, choose a third person objective point of view.
If you need slightly more insight into the characters' thoughts, you can choose a third person limited or omniscient point of view, but be very cautious about how much interpretation of events your narrator offers.

, Your point of view does not need to remain static throughout your story, although you should never change it without a good reason. If you feel that multiple points of view are needed to best tell your story, experiment with it!Be cautious about changing points of view abruptly, as this will confuse the reader. If a sudden change of point of view occurs, consider alerting the reading by starting a new chapter or section.

Examine your work honestly.,
Think about the Setting.,
Explore your characters.",How to Breathe New Life Into a Cliched and Generic Fantasy Story," This is the most important step. While the rest of the article will examine common cliches in greater detail, the most effective thing you can do is look at your work, identify the cliches that it embraces, and then think about how you can twist or subvert - or, even, if you're really good - deconstruct them.;
, The setting of a work of fantasy often influences everything else, from characters to plot, and it can be the defining point of a work. But we've all seen the fantasy version of Medieval Europe a thousand times. Sword and sorcery, princesses and knights, dragons and ogres - how about basing your setting off of a different culture's myths? How about a dismal Russian-esque setting, with Baba Yagas, firebirds, and creepy rusalkas? Or a world based on the myths of Native Americans, where the hero will be tested by tricksters? Also try different time periods: pre-historic, ancient, Renaissance, Baroque, Victorian, modern...

, In any fiction, characters are the most important piece. Fantasy is no exception. Though your characters can and will be influenced by the setting and the plot - even if those two aspects are derivative, if you have lively, original characters, then your work will be remembered.


The Hero. Does your hero need to be a teenager, who is prophesied to save the world and become the greatest hero of all times? Does he necessarily need to be the Chosen One? Does he have to become the most powerful person in the world? Does he have to have a dark/mysterious/tragic or otherwise special past? We've seen those many times. Try something different or at least use your own twists. Your hero may be a teenager, who becomes the savior of what-did-they-call-it-again-country... despite having a relatively normal past and not even being a subject of a prophecy. Maybe the viewpoint character is a mentor, who at first does not appear to be the main protagonist, but(fill in here yourself). Maybe s/he is someone not often used as a hero. There are numbers of possibilities.
Villains. They're often best when they truly believe they aren't evil, but are merely at cross-purposes with the hero. Both sides feeling they are in the right makes for better drama. It's easy to stick them to the stereotype of a maniac who wants to rule the world; instead, find them something evil to do, and then give them a motivation. They aren't necessarily in need of vengeance, and they don't have to be insane. They could simply be misled or confused. They could believe that things need fixing and only they are able to do so.

Alternatively, you can make your villain a faceless, unseen entity, but you should still have a vague understanding of their character. Why does the evil faceless entity oppose the forces of good? Hoe does it see them? Why does the entity believe they have the right to change, conquer or destroy the world?


Other characters. Avoid stereotypes. We have seen gruff dwarves, lithe elves, good-hearted thieves, gallant, noble knights, tender healers, wise, experienced mentors and others of that ilk. Be creative and break the mold. Original personalities make wonders for your characters.






You may want to try mix-and-match method with this one. Take two stereotypes, for instance and change personalities. Fairies are typically cute and mischievous little helpers and orcs are typically terrifying, beastly henchman. What would barbaric pixies be like? How about a race of prankster goblins?

To create a good title think about the age of your target audience and make a title that reflects that age.

Analyze the examples.",How to Begin a Short Story," One method is to sit down and start with your basic story, writing down the details of the story in one sitting. This could be the crazy, amusing story you might tell a friend but are not sure how to translate into short story material. Getting down the raw data, or details of your story, can then allow you to shape it into a crafted piece later.Focus on simply telling the story and getting it down on the page. This could take you one hour or several hours. Pretend you are talking to a good friend and sharing the story with them over coffee.
Avoid doing any outside research or reaching for information outside of the story you are telling. Try not to slow down to really think about certain sections or areas of the story. You will address any issues in the story once you reread it later.;
, If you are struggling with an idea for your story, you can try using a writing prompt. Writing prompts can help to get your creative juices flowing and allow you to narrow your focus. They can also force you to write about something you may not have considered before or thought of on your own.Most writing prompts have a time limit (i.e., write about the prompt for five minutes). You can extend the time limit for the writing prompt if you feel it is helping you generate useful material for your story. You can also deviate from the writing prompt if your writing takes you in a different direction. The prompt should act as a way to get you started, but it should not feel restrictive or limiting in any way.
A writing prompt can be anything from a phrase, such as ""I remember..."" to an image, such as ""Imagine you are trapped in your childhood bedroom"". You can also use a phrase from a favorite poem or a book, as well as a phrase from a favorite song.
You can find a list of writing prompts at http://www.writersdigest.com/prompts Writer's Digest and http://www.dailyteachingtools.com/journal-writing-prompts.html Daily Teaching Tools. You can also try an online random http://writingexercises.co.uk/firstlinegenerator.php first line generator.

, Once you have written some raw material for the story, you should take a moment to read it over and see if a protagonist emerges. The protagonist is the character whose fate matters the most in the story. This does not necessarily mean your protagonist has to be a hero or pure evil. Your protagonist should be the character readers will care about or sympathize with the most, flaws and all.The protagonist also does not necessarily have to be the narrator of the story, but they should be the one making decisions that move the story forward. Your protagonist should drive the events that occur in the story and their fate should give the story meaning.

, It may help you get started with the writing of the story by sketching out a plot outline so you know what is going to occur in the story. Most writers avoid doing this as they do not want to feel limited by a plot outline. But if you are struggling to start your story, it may help to identify your protagonist, the setting of the story, and the events of the story.A plot outline should first address the story goal. This is something your protagonist would like to achieve and/or a problem she wants to resolve. This is also called the big ""want"" in the story, where your protagonist wants something from herself, another character, an institution, etc.
A plot outline should also note the consequences for your protagonist if she does not achieve her goal. These are also called ""the stakes of the story"", where the protagonist will suffer in someway if she fails to reach her goal. Having high stakes in a story usually encourages a reader to stay engaged and care about the fate of your protagonist.

, Many short story writers will try to start their stories in a scene, usually a scene that feels important and engaging. Starting in scene will hook the reader right away and ground them in the story.You should choose a scene that is essential to the main character or the narrator and shows them in action, doing something that will have consequences later or sets up the plot. For example, rather than start with, “Walter thinks the day will be the same as usual,” you may start with, “Walter wakes up from a bad dream and realizes that today will not be like any other day.”
Though you may decide to use the past tense for your story, using the present tense will give the story a sense of urgency, which can help to propel the reader forward. For example, starting with “Today, I will rob a bank” may be more effective than “Yesterday, I robbed a bank”, as the present tense allows the action to unfold for the reader in real time. The reader gets access to the main event and experiences it with the characters.

, This type of beginning is useful if the setting of your story is essential and you want to establish a certain mood. Perhaps your story is not very plot heavy but it does have a distinct setting that you want the reader to get into right away. You may use a character’s perspective to describe the setting and focus on one detail that will be striking or interesting to the reader.For example, in the short story “Oceanic” by Greg Egan, the first lines focus on establishing the setting of being in a boat in the ocean: ""The swell was gently lifting and lowering the boat. My breathing grew slower, falling into step with the creaking of the hull, until I could no longer tell the difference between the faint rhythmic motion of the cabin and the sensation of filling and emptying my lungs."" Egan uses specific, sensory detail to give the reader a sense of sitting in the cabin of a boat and starts his story in a particular moment in time.Keep in mind you can also do scene setting later in the story if you do not want to start right away with setting. If theme or plot is more important to your story than setting, you may start with these elements first. You should still try to start your story in scene so your reader is engaged right away.

, Another option is to start with a strong narrative voice or a strong description of your main character. This may be a good option for stories that are character-driven, rather than plot driven. Often, first person narratives will start with a voice driven opening line. You can show the reader how the narrator views the world and present their voice so the reader knows what to expect for the rest of the story.Though J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye is a novel, not a short story, it has an opening line that establishes the narrative voice right away: “If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.”The narrator sounds sour and rough but he also draws you in with his frustrated view of the world and his disdain for traditional narratives. The narrator has a distinct perspective that gives the reader a good sense of what the rest of the story will sound like.

, Starting your story with a strong line of dialogue can be effective, but the dialogue should be easy to follow and to the point. As a general rule, dialogue in a story should always be doing more than one thing and never be there just for the sake of conversation. Good dialogue will reveal character and progress the story’s key events or plot.Many short stories will start with one line of dialogue and then zoom out to tell the reader who is speaking or where the speaker is situated within a scene. The dialogue is also usually spoken by a main character or one of the central characters in the story.
For example, in Amy Hempel’s short story “In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson Was Buried”, the story begins with a striking line of dialogue: ""Tell me things I won't mind forgetting,"" she said. ""Make it useless stuff or skip it.”The reader is drawn into the story right away by the funny, strange dialogue and the presence of a “she”.

, A good opening sentence should raise questions in the reader’s mind, spotlighting a minor conflict or a mystery. This could be something as simple as a character considering a recent event and their reaction to the event or a more complex mystery, such as an unsolved murder or crime. Avoid presenting a mystery that is too big or confusing for the reader right away. Let the first line hint at a larger mystery and ease the reader into the conflict.For example,the opening line for Jackson’s short story “Elizabeth” raises several questions: “Just before the alarm went off she was lying in a hot sunny garden, with green lawns around her and stretching as far as she could see.” The reader wonders why the main character is dreaming about a hot sunny garden, what she is waking up for, and what the dream will mean later to the character. This is a minor conflict, but it can be an effective way to ease the reader into the larger themes or ideas in the story.

, Though you may think you have crafted a perfect opening for your story, you should revisit it once you are finished with the story to confirm it is successful. Sometimes, stories can change or shift the further you get into them and your brilliant beginning may not make as much sense as it once did. Read the beginning again within the context of the rest of the story and consider if it still fits.You may be able to tweak your opening lines to fit with the tone, mood, and voice of the rest of the story or you may need to write a new opening to better suit the story. You can always file away your old beginning for another story or a future project, especially if you think it is strong but just does not fit that particular story.

, Your opening line should have no unnecessary words or phrases as this will lessen its impact on the reader. Look over your opening lines and make sure the language is powerful and as tight as it can be. Think about any cliche or familiar phrases you are using and replace them with more interesting terms. Remove any unnecessary description or go with a description that shows character and setting.You may notice that you are using weak verbs or adjectives in your first line that feel vague and nondescript. Replace them with strong verbs and adjectives so your first line makes a lasting impact and sets the bar high for the language and description in the rest of the story.

, It can be difficult to edit your own writing so be willing to show the beginning lines to a reader you trust. Consider showing your reader only the first line or first paragraph of the story and ask her if the opening makes her want to read the rest of the story. You should also ask her if she has a good sense of character or setting in the first line and any improvements she may suggest to make the beginning of the short story that much better., The opening lines of a short story are essential, as they will keep the reader engaged and interested enough to continue on. The first sentence or first paragraph often introduces the idea or situation that will be explored in the story. It should give the reader clear indications of tone, style, and voice. It may also tell the reader something about the characters and the plot of the story.Using Kurt Vonnegut’s rules for a short story, a popular reference for writers, you should always try to “start as close to the end as possible” in your opening lines.Place your reader right in the action as soon as you can so they are hooked into reading on.
Often, editors will read the first several lines of a story to see if it’s worth reading to the end. Many short stories are selected for publication based on the strength of their opening line. This is why it is important that you consider how you can make an impact on the reader and make an impression with the first one to two lines., To help you get a better sense of how to start your short story, you should read several example opening lines. Note how the writer draws the reader in and uses every word like it counts. Several examples include:“The first great act of love I ever witnessed was Split Lip bathing his handicapped daughter.” “Isabelle” by George Saunders.
“When this story goes out into the world, I may become the most famous hermaphrodite in history.” “The Obscure Object” by Jeffrey Eugenides.
“Just before the alarm went off she was lying in a hot sunny garden, with green lawns around her and stretching as far as she could see.” “Elizabeth” by Shirley Jackson.

, Once you have read over the example opening lines, ask yourself several questions:


How does the writer set the tone or mood? For example, the first line in Eugenides’ short story “The Obscure Object” introduces the narrator as a hermaphrodite and lets the reader know that the narrator’s life story is going to be told. It sets up a reflective mood, where the narrator relays their life as a famous hermaphrodite.
How does the writer introduce key characters or setting? For example, Saunders’ first line in his short story “Isabelle” introduces a character named “Split Lip” as well as his handicapped daughter. It also provides a key theme of the story: love between father and daughter. Jackson’s first line in “Elizabeth” uses description and sensory details, like “hot sunny” and “green”, to paint a specific image in the reader’s mind.
What are your expectations as a reader, based on the opening lines? A good first line will signal to the reader what they are in store for, and provide just enough information for the reader to be drawn into the story. The opening line in Saunders’ story, for example, lets the reader know that the story may be a bit quirky or strange, with a character named “Split Lip” and a handicapped girl. It is a bold opening that lets the reader know how the story is going to be narrated, with a unique narrative voice.

Understand the reasons people collect comic books.,
Evaluate the scope of the collection.,
Look at how rare the comics in the collection are.,
Examine the condition of the comics being sold.,
Look at what measures the owner has taken to protect the comics.,
Learn how the collector plans to sell the collection.,
Evaluate the asking price.",How to Buy a Comic Book Collection," Although stories of the most recent price fetched at auction for Action Comics #1, the comic book in which Superman premiered, make the news periodically, not everyone collects comic books for their potential to appreciate in value over time. The reasons people collect comic books vary; a comic book collector may choose the comics he or she collects for one or more of these reasons:


Investment potential. Old and rare comics can appreciate considerably in value over the years, particularly if they feature well known characters such as Superman (Action Comics #1) or Batman (Detective Comics #27). The better condition an old comic book is kept in, the greater its value.
History and cultural significance. Someone who collects comic books for their cultural significance will likely be drawn to comics from particular eras, such as the Golden Age (1938 to 1955) or the Silver Age (1956 to 1970); to characters popular in the past, such as the Lone Ranger from the 1930s to the 1950s; or to characters that have stood the test of time, such as Superman or Archie.
Favorite publisher. Some collectors favor the comics of a certain publisher over another. The 2 largest comic book publishers, DC and Marvel, have their own legions of fans, while other comics collectors favor the works of smaller publishers such as Dark Horse, Boom Entertainment, and others.
Favorite genre. While many comic book collectors favor superhero comic books, other collectors favor science fiction comics such as ""Mystery in Space"" or ""Magnus, Robot Fighter,"" while others favor horror comics such as ""House of Secrets"" or ""House of Mystery,"" historical adventures such as ""Tomahawk,"" or romance titles such as ""Young Romance"" and ""Modern Romance.""
Favorite characters. Many collectors collect comic books for characters they can relate to in some way, whether it's the range of powers and moral character of Superman, the ""where there's a will, there's a way"" message of Green Lantern, or the ""outcasts of society"" represented by the mutant heroes and villains in ""X-Men."" Other collectors develop a fondness for supporting characters, such as Superman's lady love, Lois Lane, or reporter pal Jimmy Olsen, each of whom had their own comic books for over 20 years. Collectors usually develop a fondness for a character by reading the several recent appearance of that character, then go back to collect previous appearances of that character to contrast the earlier presentation with the more recent one to see how the character has evolved over the years.
Favorite writers. Writers such as Mickey Spillane wrote the comic book adventures of characters such as Captain Marvel or the Sub-Mariner before turning to novels. Science fiction writers such as Alfred Bester and Gardner Fox wrote for ""Strange Adventures"" while also writing novels, and television writers such as J. Michael Straczynski and Joss Whedon are now taking turns writing comic book adventures for Spider-Man, the X-Men, and other comic book heroes.
Favorite artists. Comic books are a visual medium, and many readers and collectors are drawn to the various styles of rendering the characters within them. Some are drawn to the realism of Neal Adams and John Romita, others to the cartoon adaptations of Carl Barks, others to the surrealism of Steve Ditko, and still others to the square-jawed style of Jack Kirby, who brought life to many of the Marvel heroes created by Stan Lee.
Crossover with other interests. Fans of ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" may collect comic books featuring the characters of those universes along with books, action figures, and related paraphernalia, while fans of pulp heroes such as the Shadow and Doc Savage may collect comic book adaptations of those characters.;
, Someone who has collected comic books for a long time should have a large collection of issues, with titles going back a number of years, while someone who started his or her collection more recently may have a narrower range of titles and a smaller number of issues within each title. Larger collections are also more likely to include the first appearances of significant characters than are smaller collections.


One way to evaluate both the comic book collection and the collector is to see what kind of books about comics the collector owns and how many of them. A collector fond of Superman might have ""The Greatest Superman Stories Ever Told"" or the Superman volume of ""The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes."" A collector who likes DC Comics in general might have several coffee table books about DC and its characters or back issues of the company's ""The Amazing World of DC Comics.""

, The fewer copies of a particular issue of a given comic book, the more valuable the comic is. Issues can be rare either because few issues from the original print run survive to the present day, as is the case with many older comics, or because few issues were produced to begin with, as is likely with comics from an independent publisher.

, The condition of the comics in the collection is another factor that determines their value. Stains, creases, fading, worn edges, missing pieces, or dog-eared or torn pages can seriously reduce the value of an individual issue or the overall collection.


Comic books are graded in 2 ways: with descriptive terms or with a numeric grading scale. Descriptive terms range from ""Gemstone Mint"" for the best quality comics to ""Poor"" for the worst quality comics that still retain their covers, which correspond to numeric grades of 10.0 to 0.5.
Some large collections of older comics in exceptional condition may merit pedigrees, particularly if the current owner is the person who originally purchased the comics.
It is possible to improve the appearance of older comics through 1 or more restoration techniques; however, not all collectors approve of using these techniques. Accordingly, many prospective purchasers employ the services of an authentication service such as CGC or PGX to validate the condition of a comic book and to identify any restoration techniques used on it.

, Serious comic book collectors are more likely to take measures to preserve their comics than casual collectors. Most collectors preserve their comics by placing them in archival plastic bags with a piece of white cardboard to keep the comic stiff. Comic book authentication services usually provide archival sealing and mounting as part of their services.


Because reading a comic book necessarily exposes it to wear and tear, some collectors own both mint-quality copies of their favorite issues and poorer-quality copies they read for pleasure. Other collectors scan their comics, creating digital images of each page that can be incorporated into PDFs or read with special comic reader programs such as CDisplay.

, Some collectors may choose to sell individual comics from their collection, either to pare titles they no longer have an interest in or to earn money quickly. Other collectors may choose to sell their entire collection at once, in either a single lot or multiple lots, feeling they can no longer take care of it properly.


Recent comics are more likely to be found at a yard or rummage sale than are older comics. Older and rarer comics are more likely to be sold through a broker or auction house, while comics of intermediate age can be found in the dealers' rooms of science fiction and comic book conventions.
If the owner is selling the comics online, look for detailed pictures of as many comics in the collection as possible, particularly for any flaws in the comics. Also, look for a detailed written description of the comics that addresses their rarity and condition. If the seller lives in the same city you do, arrange to meet with the seller to view the comics yourself.

, While the actual worth of a comic book collection is ultimately whatever the buyer and seller agree upon, there are published guides to the value of various comics. The industry bible is the Overstreet Price Guide, the print form of which is updated annually by its publisher, Gemstone Publishing. Online price guides are also available, such as ComicsPriceGuide.com, providing a convenient way to look up the list prices of comics in the collection to compare against the asking price.

"
Use descriptive nouns and verbs whenever possible.,
Use adjectives and adverbs sparingly.,
Avoid repeating a word in a sentence when you use a different meaning of it.,
Avoid using ""crutch words."",
�Important"": Importance is usually subjective; you can better convey importance by showing it through such things as a character's job and responsibilities, family position, or military rank.

,
�Seem"": This word is vague, as it requires a judgment from the reader.,
Avoid cliches.,
Expand your vocabulary.",How to Avoid Repetitive Words and Phrases in Fiction Writing1," Using specific nouns and verbs (""roses"" or ""tulips"" instead of ""flowers;"" ""chuckled"" or ""guffawed"" instead of ""laughed"") puts a sharper image in the reader's mind than does using the more general equivalents. The choice of words can also convey additional information; for example, mentioning giving someone tulips in the story suggests the act takes or took place during early spring, which is when tulips bloom. Someone who chuckles is mildly amused, while someone who guffaws is deeply amused.


The idea that words create images in the mind is called ""connotation."" When choosing a descriptive noun or verb, make sure it conveys the emotions your character is experiencing and the images you want to put in the mind of the reader.
An exception to choosing descriptive synonyms is for the word ""said"" in dialogue tags (""he said, she said""). Other than using ""asked"" when the speaker is asking a question and ""replied,"" ""responded,"" or ""answered"" when the speaker is answering a question, it's usually better to use ""said"" in a dialogue tag. It's even better to write dialogue with as few dialogue tags as possible, using narrative to describe what the speaker is doing while addressing someone else or having the speaker use the name of the person he or she is talking with in the dialogue.;
, Sometimes adjectives and adverbs are necessary to convey an image, when nouns and verbs alone aren't specific enough: ""American Beauty roses"" as opposed to just ""roses,"" for example. However, using adjectives and adverbs when you don't have to often just adds more words for your readers to slog through to get to the image you're trying to convey; saying ""She marched into Mr. Smithers' office"" carries a stronger image than ""She walked angrily into Mr. Smithers' office.""


Adjectives and adverbs are unnecessary when the noun, verb, or adjective they're modifying already conveys the image. You don't have to say ""trumpeted loudly,"" because ""trumpeted"" already conveys the image of loud sound. They're also inappropriate when they contradict the word they modify. You don't say ""rather unique,"" ""somewhat unique,"" or ""very unique,"" because something is either unique or it isn't.

, Saying ""Over the past century, the planet Xytox was invaded over 50 times"" is confusing, because ""over"" is first used as a synonym for ""during"" and the second time as a synonym for ""more than."" While both meanings of ""over"" are valid, you should replace one or both uses of ""over"" with the synonym.

, Certain words and phrases lend themselves to being overused in writing, fiction or nonfiction. A partial list of these words and phrases is given below:


�Am""/""Are""/""Is"": These forms of ""to be,"" and their past tense forms ""was"" and ""were,"" usually come off as vague or passive when used too often. Saying ""I was in the den"" is both vague and passive, while ""I sat quietly in the den"" offers action and suggests a contemplative mood.
�Beautiful""/""Lovely""/""Attractive"": Remember the maxim ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."" You can use ""beautiful"" effectively in first-person narratives, where the beholder is speaking to the reader, but it's not as effective when telling a story in the third person.
�Big""/""Huge,"" ""Small/Little/Tiny"": These words are subjective. To a 5-year-old child, almost all adults are ""big,"" while to basketball center Yao Ming, many things are ""small."" When possible, convey size by using comparative imagery, for example, ""golf-ball-sized,"" ""grapefruit-sized,"" ""mountain of a man,"" and so on.
�Exciting""/""Thrilling"": Each person has his or her own idea of what is and isn't exciting. Excitement is something you should demonstrate to your reader, by putting your characters on the roller coaster and letting them scream their lungs out instead of describing it as ""exciting.""
�Fascinating""/""Interesting"": Whether something is ""fascinating"" or ""interesting"" to the reader depends on the reader's areas of interest. It's appropriate for a character to call something ""interesting"" if that character then or shortly afterward explains why that item was interesting. (As for ""fascinating,"" you might want to leave that word to Mr. Spock.)
�Go""/""Went"": While these words convey action, they don't convey an image of the kind of action. Other verbs, such as ""walk,"" ""trot,"" ""ride,"" or ""drive,"" convey specific action images and are verbs you should favor. Also, ""go"" and ""went"" are often informally used in place of ""say"" or ""said,"" which can confuse the reader if those words are used to describe both speech and action.
�Got"": The past tense of ""get,"" ""got"" is often used in place of ""have,"" ""caught,"" or ""found,"" all of which bring different mental images to the reader's mind. ""Got up"" is also used to mean ""awakened."" You should try to use more precise words in your narrative in place of ""got.""

,, It works in first-person narratives where the narrator is presenting his or her judgment to the reader to agree or disagree with, but not as well in third-person narratives.


�Stuff""/""Things"": These words are imprecise, often connoting both immaterial concepts as well as material objects. Use them occasionally when you're trying to sound informal, but use words that better convey material or immaterial nature of what you're referring to.
�That"": The word ""that"" can be used as an adjective, an adverb, a pronoun, a subordinating conjunction, or the introduction to a restrictive clause. The problem comes when you write a sentence that uses the word in more than one of these ways. You can often write so that the word ""that"" is understood, or use a different form of another word to eliminate the need for ""that,"" such as substituting ""using"" for ""that uses"" in the previous sentence.
�Very"": ""Very"" is a type of adverb called an intensifier. Use this word infrequently; instead convey intensity through your overall description, not by using intensifiers.

, Cliches are phrases that have been used repeatedly outside their intended context to the point where their intended meanings have been forgotten or ignored. Calling something ""easy as pie"" or ""more fun than a barrel of monkeys"" sounds descriptive, but really isn't � as isn't necessarily true, as someone who has trouble with pie crusts or has been attacked by monkeys would attest.


One alternative to using clich�s is to use re-worded versions of cliches. Instead of saying ""when hell freezes over,"" you could say ""when Satan asks to borrow my snow-blower.""

, To avoid repeating words and phrases and to be able to choose appropriate words and phrases in your fiction writing, you need to be familiar with those appropriate words. See the suggestions listed under ""Expanding Your Vocabulary.""

Use the dictionary.,
Familiarize yourself with the thesaurus.,
Set aside time to learn new words.,
Read a wide range of literature.,
Try your hand at poetry.,
Play word games and quizzes.",How to Avoid Repetitive Words and Phrases in Fiction Writing2," Dictionaries contain definitions of words, their usage, and their origins. All of this information can help you decide if a given word is the right word to use in the section of text you're working on. Dictionaries are available in both hard-copy and online format; you may want to make use of both formats.


Use the dictionary to help you communicate better with your readers, not to inject fancy words into your writing that send them to the dictionary to understand what you're trying to say. Do use less-familiar words that can readers can figure out the meaning of from the context the words are used in.
Specialized dictionaries exist for certain industries that have their own jargon, such as information technology, the law, or medicine. If you write a certain type of fiction, such as medical thrillers, police procedures, or science fiction, you may want to get a dictionary devoted to specialized terminology to go alongside your general dictionary.

, A thesaurus is a listing of synonyms, grouping words and phrases together that have the same or similar meanings. Printed thesauruses are organized in 1 of 2 ways, either in dictionary fashion or with an index in the front, listing categories and code numbers for each subtopic, followed by the synonym groups that fall under those categories and code numbers. Online thesauruses feature a search field into which you type the word or phrase you want to find a synonym for and then list the synonyms grouped by the particular connotation (shade of meaning) of the word you typed.

, You can take advantage of vocabulary builders such as Word of the Day, in either day calendar or Internet form, and books such as ""30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary.""

, As you read, pay attention to how the writer uses words to paint a visual picture in your mind and look for ways to emulate those techniques in your own writing.

, Poetry makes considerable use of imagery and symbolism in the words it uses, as well as the meter and rhyme. Reading and writing poetry can help you learn to use words that convey images to others in your prose writing.

, Games such as Scrabble, Bananagrams, and Unspeakable Words help you develop and practice your vocabulary, with the competition against other players substituting for the pressure of a deadline to stimulate your thinking process.


Other word games, such as Boggle and Scattergories, test your ability to brainstorm as well as the extent of your vocabulary.
The game You've Been Sentenced tests your ability to use words effectively in making complete sentences.

Write several important female characters.,
Have the leading lady (or ladies) help solve problems.,
Make sure she wants something.,
Give your leading lady some meaningful character development.,
Break narrow gender roles.,
Give her meaningful relationships beyond romance.,
Write more than one or two women.,
Create diversity in other forms.",How to Avoid Creating Female Character Stereotypes in Your Writing1," There is no right way to be a woman, and the more women you have in the story, the more clearly your story will convey this. Give your women different roles, different personalities, and different skills. Diverse female characters will help you avoid stale tropes.


If you are writing a story for a mixed-gender audience, your cast should be about 50% female, and the women should get about equal screen time.;
, Give her a clear set of skills, and let her actions meaningfully contribute to the plot. Her actions should move the story along. What decisions does she make? What are her talents, and how can she use them to help?


Give her an active role throughout the story, not just one or two moments of usefulness.

, What is her motivation? Giving your leading ladies something to strive for helps them become more nuanced, interesting characters. Give her a goal beyond helping the team or finding a boyfriend, and she will become more exciting in the readers' eyes.


She wants to prove herself and make a meaningful contribution to her field.
She wants a friend.
She wants to cure the disease that killed her mother.
She wants to win a competition.

, Show that she has vulnerability as well as strength, and let her learn and grow along the way. This will help you create a complex, relatable character. Here are some examples:


She learns to step up, let her voice be heard, and be a leader.
She learns to ask for help in coping with her PTSD from her difficult past.
She stops looking down on people who aren't as smart as her.
She figures out what she wants in life.

, Show your audience that women can succeed in STEM, that they can be leaders, that they can be successful at work while having kids. This will inspire your female readers, and send a positive social message that will create a little extra buzz about your book.


Show that it's okay to wear skirts or pants. A woman can still be traditionally feminine (dressing girly, liking pop music, dating) while being successful and awesome.
Don't let femininity be seen as degrading. Don't have your heroic men express disgust at pink, girly things, or being placed in a role that is usually reserved for women.

, Build her relationship with her sister, her coach, her platonic male friend. Show how she interacts with others. Let readers see how she reacts to their vulnerability, and how they react to hers. Show them bantering, working, and just being silly. This will help her become likable in the readers' eyes.

, Some stories make the mistake of having a female main character or two, and having the rest of the world populated by men. You can avoid this pitfall by making some minor characters female. There is the absentminded mother, the stern councilwoman, the comic relief shopkeeper, the bored bank teller... Let women also occupy some of the minor roles in your story, and this will help show that there are many kinds of women.

, Write women of different races, disabilities, sizes, sexualities, et cetera. This will help you reach out to groups that are often underrepresented in the media, and promote a positive message.


Many curly-haired girls and women of color love to see dark-skinned characters with curls.
Disability is more than wheelchairs and white canes. Also consider Deaf women, chronically anxious women, autistic women, women with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder...

"
"
Don't write Mary Sues.,
Avoid Anti Sues as well.,
Avoid hurtful stereotypes related to race, size, disability, et cetera.,
Make sure that your strong female character is actually strong.,
Avoid the ""Damsel in Distress"".,
Avoid the ""woman in refrigerator"" at all costs.,
Make your writing show the reality that women have other interests in life besides men.,
Be aware that your female character doesn't necessarily have to be in a romantic relationship.,
Show women supporting each other instead of tearing each other down.",How to Avoid Creating Female Character Stereotypes in Your Writing2," Mary Sues are the author's favorite character, and they get preferential treatment (e.g. most beautiful, gets to break rules, overpowered). This is irritating to readers because the author's love of the character is being pushed down their throat. Make sure your character is balanced, and is approximately as talented as her peers are.Mary Sues can also be male.
Mary Sues tend to have many things handed to them (e.g. incredible inborn magical talent, super duper rich) but may have tragic backstories to show how far they've come.
Attention is often called to the Mary Sue, sometimes at the expense of the plot. When she falls, the whole world rushes to her aid.

, An Anti-Sue is a reaction to the Mary Sue phenomenon, when the writer responds by writing a weak character. The story goes to great lengths to make sure the reader know that the character is ugly/plain, clumsy, uninteresting, traumatized, et cetera. The writer has forgotten that it's okay to make a strong and powerful woman.


The character is constantly falling down, tripping, hurting themselves and bumping into everything and everyone just to show oh-how-awkward the character is.
Often, these characters keep repeatedly thinking how common and boring they are compared to other people, noticeably their romantic interest, and how said romantic interest ""could have literally anyone else but chose me! This is so weird, I mean, he is so gorgeous and perfect and godlike, and I'm but a simple, plain girl with nothing special!"" Think Bella Swan from Twilight. You'll want to avoid these because they're so flawed, it's painful.
Anti Sues tend to be female, because usually Mary Sue accusations are leveled at female characters.

, Spend a bit of time researching these traits, and reading what people with these traits have to say about how they are represented in fiction. For example, if you're writing a black autistic girl, read what black women and autistic women have to say. This will help you craft an appealing, non-insulting character. Here are general stereotypes to avoid:


The sassy black woman, the Indian doctor/call center worker, the spicy Latina, the genius Asian girl, the Native American who is extremely connected to nature, and other racial stereotypes
The fat, lazy couch potato
The welfare queen
The man-hating lesbian, the confused bisexual woman, the asexual woman who ""just needs to get laid,"" the transgender woman whose existence is a joke to be made fun of, the LGBT+ person who gets killed off
The violent mentally ill person
The disabled woman who ends up cured or dead, or is just a burden on her family

, Sometimes writers will succumb to the Trinity Effect, where a woman will have an introduction showing how awesome she is, only to be eclipsed and ultimately need rescue from a man.The reader is informed that she is capable, but she relies on the male hero in the end.Ask yourself if she makes meaningful contributions throughout the plot, and if the bumbling hero learns much faster than she does. Would you, the writer, want to be her?


This may happen by relegating her to the less exciting B-fight during the climax,or having her face the major villain first but get defeated and need the man to save her. She may even be stuffed into a refrigerator.

, Another horrible trope, a ""Damsel in Distress"" is essentially a female character who is only there to be rescued by the hero and does nothing to help anyone, nor adds anything to the story. This type of character literally stands there, waiting to be rescued (and often screaming or acting helpless) and does nothing else. You should be able to see why you should avoid this.


This does not mean to never place women in distress. It is okay for one of them to need help, especially if women occupy strong and active roles throughout your book.
One way to invert this could be to place a strong women in distress, only for her to save herself, and perhaps her would-be rescue party as well. Or let a woman save another woman.
Or let a man be in distress for a change, so the woman can save him. Men are allowed to need help from women too.

, This one is particularly problematic. It is most commonly seen in superhero media, but that doesn't mean it can't infect other types of media too. The hero meets a cute, capable, likable woman whose character is developed so the reader can like her too. Then the hero finds her dead.No one likes characters who are used as plot devices/props for destroying the hero's psyche or motivating him to action.


They may be murdered, raped, suddenly disabled, beaten up, and forced to suffer through overall horrifying things just so the hero can be sad.This may happen to the hero's romantic interest, a family member, or even someone he doesn't know well. They don't even have to be developed (Debbie from Savage Dragon) or be introduced before something bad happens to them (Mal from Inception) to be used as a way to emotionally scar the hero.

, Consider how often the story passes the Bechdel Test. This test evaluates if you (1) have two named female characters, who (2) talk to each other at some point (3) about something other than men.This is a quick way to evaluate whether your story treats female characters as plot devices/props.


In a perfectly mixed-gender story, about 25% of the conversations would be between women, 50% would be between a woman and a man, and 25% would be between men.
In a story for predominantly male audiences, there may be only a few conversations that pass the Bechdel Test. (Be aware that women do read ""men's books!"")

, It's almost a rule nowadays that the female character must have a male character to serve as her romantic interest. This annoys single women, aromantic/lesbian women, and just readers in general. Try letting some of your ladies be single at the end (fulfillment does not require a man), or having them date another woman. Show readers that women don't need men to be happy.


Avoid going to great leaps just to pair up your leading lady; this usually doesn't go over very well. She's allowed to be happy and single.
If your cast is more male, and you want them to be paired up, try making some of them gay or bisexual. And remember, men don't need women to be happy either.

, Sometimes (both in fiction and real life) women feel that women are scarce, so they try to make other women look bad in order to be the best. This is obviously not constructive. Show women who build each other up and support each other when they stumble. They will be excellent role models, and your reader will walk away with a smile.

Choose a theme based on age.,
Look at a certain subject categories.,
Explore a common theme in a creative way.,
Focus on a positive message or moral.,
Put a new spin on a well known concept.,
Read examples of children’s picture books.",How to Brainstorm Children's Picture Book Ideas1," Traditional children's picture books are often geared towards children ages 4-8. You should think about what themes might appeal to this age group and how you can connect with children who are at this age level.You may focus more on early picture books, which are written for children ages 4-6. These books are simple and usually under 1000 words. Many picture books are printed in board book format, making them easier to hold and turn the pages.
You may focus on easy reader books, which are for children age 6-8. These books have color illustrations on every page but focus on a more grown up audience. They usually have a smaller trim size and the story may be broken into short chapters, with two the five sentences per a page. Often they are 200-1500 words, though they can sometimes be 2000 words long.;
, You may decide to explore a certain subject category that is popular with children in your book, such as science, history, relationships, or writing and reading. Use a subject category that will appeal to younger children who are just starting to get curious about the world and how it functions.


For example, you may choose to discuss science in your book, where you write about underwater animals or the process of evolution in a fun, interested way using scientific facts. Or you may choose to write about history, where you write about an historical figure in a simple, engaging way. You may focus on a specific time period and explore it in your picture book.

, You should also consider themes that have not been discussed in children’s books in the past or approach a common theme in a creative way. This will help your book to stand out among a sea of books made for children. This theme could be a more general idea like “friendship” or a more specific theme like “friendship between young girls.” You could then approach this theme in a creative, interesting way.You may want to focus more on themes that are simple and still entertaining. You may choose universal themes, such as ""love is everywhere"" or ""share with others"" that will appeal to three to eight year olds. You should avoid complex themes or themes that may go over the heads of younger children.
For example, you may decide to write about the theme of “friendship between young girls.” You could then build characters and a setting around this theme, using your own life experiences of friendship or examples of friendship between young girls that you have witnessed.
You may want to consider asking any children around you what excites or surprises them. You may also ask them what they are interested in and what they enjoy reading. You can then generate a few possibly subjects for your own book.

, Many children’s picture books contain a positive message or a moral. Often, children’s picture books focus on teaching children a certain value or lesson. You may choose a well known moral or message and brainstorm story ideas around it.For example, perhaps you are interested in exploring the moral of “do unto others as you would do to yourself.” You could then create characters or a storyline around this moral so it is appealing to children.
When using a positive message or moral in your book, you should try to disguise it or keep it hidden. Being preachy and heavy on morals in a children’s book can make the story feel stale and dry. Instead, you should think of ways to place the positive message or moral in the background of your story., With so many children’s picture books out there, you may end up choose a concept that is well known and that has been written about before. This is fine, as long as you try to approach the concept from a unique angle.For example, you may decide to write about bullying. You should then consider how you can approach the topic of bullying in a unique way or a way that has not been done before. You may think about your own experiences of bullying as a child and see if you can focus on a specific detail or moment that feels unique.

, You can get inspiration for your children’s picture book by reading well known examples of this type of writing. You may read:Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak

The Other Side by Jacqueline Wilson

Create a character based on a real life child.,
Use an animal as your main character.,
Come up with a unique name for your character.,
Explore a unique setting.,
Turn a familiar setting upside down.",How to Brainstorm Children's Picture Book Ideas2," You can also generate story ideas by focusing on the story’s main character. Strong, well developed main characters are a key element of a good children’s picture book. You may use a real life child, such as your own child, a sibling, or a family member to create a main character that is relatable and detailed.You should consider how the real life child speaks, walks, and acts around other children. Does the child use slang words or their own take on language? Does the child walk in a unique or strange way? Does the child socialize a lot with other children or does the child prefer to be among adults?
You may also choose a child who has a unique physical appearance or unique physical traits. You could then use on their traits as the basis for your story’s main character.

, Many children’s picture books use animals as a main character, as animal characters can make it easier to explore a theme or moral in a universal way. You may decide to use a particular animal as your main character or use a cast of animals in your book.For example, you may decide to focus on a cheetah as your main character. You may then list the typical qualities of a cheetah, such as “speed”, “stealth”, and “an ability to blend into its natural environment.” You could then use one of these qualities to create a story about a cheetah who is the opposite of what one might expect. Maybe the cheetah in your story is not fast at all and has pink spots that make her stand out.

, Many children’s picture books are no longer than 500 words. Of those 500 words, the name of your main character may be mentioned several times in the story. You should try to create a name that is unique and catchy for your main character, as your audience will likely respond well to a name that is memorable on the page.For example, maybe you decide to name the cheetah with pink spots, Pinky the Cheetah. Or, if you are writing a story about a child with a unique trait, you may use the trait as part of their name, such as Lightening Max or Gina the Short.

, Some writers use a unique setting as the inspiration for their story. You may already have a unique setting in mind, such as The Great Barrier Reef or the moon. Or you may list a few unique settings and choose one for your story. You could then build characters and a story around this setting.For example, maybe you be interested in setting a story in the Amazon. You may then do some research on reptiles who live in the Amazon and use a specific reptile as the main character for your story. Your main character could then explore the landscapes and wildlife in the Amazon in your children’s picture book.

, You can also find inspiration by taking a familiar setting and playing around with it. You may twist around certain details of the setting so it feels slightly surreal or fantastical.For example, you may use a familiar setting like the dentist’s office and twist it around so there are details that appear fantastical or surreal. Maybe your main character envisions the dentist’s chair as a space ship. You could then add details to the dentist office that relate to a space station or ground control at NASA. The dentist chair could also have details that are similar to a space ship.

Select a genre for your story.,
Use the linked plot structure.,
Try a “wish fulfillment” plot structure.,
Start with an ending first and work backward.",How to Brainstorm Children's Picture Book Ideas3," You may be able to narrow down the focus for your picture book by focusing a specific genre. You may decide to focus on the fantasy or fairy tale genre. Or you may go for the historical fiction, mystery, science fiction, or humor genre. Once you have chosen a genre, you may then start to create other elements of your story.Once you choose a genre, it may also help you to narrow down the setting or characters in the story. A science fiction picture book may be set on a fictional planet. A historical fiction book may have a historical figure like Amelia Earhart or Louis Armstrong as a main character.
Keep in mind you can use the horror genre for your children’s picture book. But you should try to have a humorous take on horror or only use very mild, non-graphic horror elements in your story so it is age appropriate.

, Many children’s picture books use the linked plot structure or “a series of events” that are strung together. You may decide to use the linked plot structure to order the events in your story and then fill in any blanks or gaps as you go along.For example, you may string together a series of small episodes that involve Pinky the Cheetah. You may start with an episode that shows how Pinky was born and who her parents are. You could then add on episodes about Pinky’s experience at cheetah school and end with an episode about Pinky trying to make friends.

, This plot structure is also used often in children’s picture book ideas, especially in the fairy tale genre. In this structure, the main character wishes for something and receives it by the end of the story. The main character may also end up receiving something they did not expect, but end up appreciating it anyway.This type of plot structure is contrasted by the “purpose achieved” plot structure. In this structure, your main character struggles against the odds to achieve a goal.
For example, maybe Pinky the Cheetah struggles to keep up with the other cheetahs on the track and field team. In the end she achieves her goal of finishing a race first, despite the odds.

, It may also help you to generate ideas and a sense of plot by starting with a strong ending idea first and working backwards. Creating a satisfying ending for your picture book may be one of the more difficult things to achieve. Once you have this, you may then be able to easily fill in the rest of the story.For example, maybe you have an image in your mind of Pinky the Cheetah standing in front of her bedroom mirror, smiling at the pink spots on her body. You may then work backwards to create the events and moments that lead up to the acceptance of her appearance.

Try brainstorming in a sketchbook.,
Use a drawing tool on a computer.,
Record yourself talking about the idea.",How to Brainstorm Children's Picture Book Ideas4," Because you are creating a visual book, you should consider using a sketchbook to do your brainstorming. You may sit down with a sketchbook and plan out the illustrations of the book as you write the content.


If you are not a great sketch artists, you may draw simple illustrations of what you would like for each page of the book. You could then work with a professional illustrator to achieve higher quality drawings for the children's picture book.

, You can also use technology to your advantage by using a drawing tool on your computer. You may use sketching software to create illustrations for the book or as a way to try out different illustration styles.


You may want to learn how to use certain illustration software, like Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop.

, Another way you can keep a record of your ideas is to use a tape recorder to record yourself talking about a concept or a theme. You may keep the recorder with you and take it out whenever you have an idea or a thought about the picture book. You could then play back the recording later and see if you any of your ideas are worth exploring further.

The world you are creating has its own logic and a set of rules to follow. Do animals talk? Can people fly? Your twist should adhere to these rules and make sense within the narrative world you have created. Keep in mind questions like:


What are the logical rules of the narrative universe you are creating?
Does the plot twist abide by those rules?
Does the twist make sense in the narrative universe created?;
, Plot twists tend to fall into five different categories. Although it is important to creatively approach your twist and avoid adhering too strongly to a certain trope, taking these five categories into consideration may point you in the right direction. Reversal of Identity – Someone turns out to be someone or something else.
Reversal of Motive – The apparent actions of a character are revealed to be a deception, designed to conceal motives that are the opposite of what was assumed, aka “I thought he was after THIS, but he’s really after THAT.”
Reversal of Perception – The world that you have been led to believe is real is, in fact, false or incomplete.
Reversal of Fortune – Fate intervenes to alter the fortunes of a character for better or worse.
Reversal of Fulfillment – A character achieves something only to have another character take it away at the last second.

, When writing your twist, keep in mind how you want the reader to react. Imaging the desired reaction to the twist will better help you construct your narrative. Constantly ask yourself what the reader expects from the narrative and try to avoid that. Do you want the reader to feel a sense of certainty before you pull the rug out from under them?
Are you trying to cultivate an atmosphere of uncertainty where there the direction of the narrative is unclear?

, Think about the scenario that you are trying to create and flesh out all of the possible outcomes. Your first idea for an amazing plot twist is probably not your best one, and is unlikely to be the scene you use. Professional writers typically work through multiple scenarios before finding a twist that fits. Remember that there are no bad ideas during brainstorming. , Think about the apparent scenarios and their implications for your story. Thinking about the obvious scenarios might help you gain some interesting insights on how you should develop your twist. At the least, it will help you better understand which plot points to avoid.

, Pursue ideas that might seem too outrageous or do not appear to fit. You ultimately want to find something that surprises your reader, so think big. Let these different scenarios simmer while thinking about what direction you want to take the story. Test these scenarios out. You might be surprised by which idea sticks. , Put pen to paper and let your thoughts flow. Write out multiple scenarios and explore a variety of outcomes. Reveal that the main character is a robot. Have eagles swoop down and save the protagonists at the last second. This is a writing exercise with no limits where you can flex your creative muscle. Write out as many ideas as you can, regardless of how clichéd, obvious, or ridiculous it they are.

, Making a visual representation of your scene, and its place in the broader narrative, is an excellent way to test out a twist. Drawing out your scene will work different parts of your brain and may help you find a new angle for your twist.


Create a bulleted list or outline of your scene highlighting its place in the broader narrative structure.
Draw out a network map of the narrative connecting multiple scenes.

, A plot twist needs to be unique or, at the least, capable of surprising your readers. Remember that you are trying to get them to say, “I didn’t see that coming.” Keep in mind the story you are telling and write something that is out of the ordinary for the narrative.


If a character is murdered in a story with five murders, the sense of surprise is gone, and predictability sets in.
If a character has a special item that they have been using the entire story, do not have them use said item in your twist. The reader will expect that. Instead, see how your character does without their special item.

, Do not make your twist so outrageous that it is unbelievable. It must be a surprise, but a reasonable one. Although your story may have fantastical aspects, it still has to adhere to the rules that you have created. Keep in mind that the more “out there” a twist is, the more you will have to foreshadow and ground it in the reality of your fictional universe.


Be sure to foreshadow. A twist should not come out of nowhere.
If your narrative takes place in a medieval world, do not have aliens show-up in your twist, unless you have given some clues that aliens are involved in the story.
A noir detective story probably would not benefit from dragons, unless dragons are an integral part of the universe you are creating.

, In order for the scene to make sense to your reader, you need to provide adequate foreshadowing. Drop breadcrumbs throughout your story that hint at the twist to come. However, do not be too overt in your hints. Be sure to redirect suspicion, otherwise, the reader will see the twist coming. If a character is going to reveal a secret identity, be sure to have hinted at this identity earlier in the narrative.
When revealing a false perception, be sure to create your world in a way that provides brief glimpses of the true reality.

, If you premise the twist on a well-known gag or trope, it is likely that your reader will see it coming. Gimmicks can cheapen your story and make the reader feel tricked or deceived. You want your twist to heighten your reader’s investment in the narrative, not undermine it.Do not have the entire plot be the dream of one of your characters or the product of a simulation. Framing or nesting can add an interesting element to a story, but it has to significantly add to the punchline. It is unlikely that the reader will appreciate investing their time in a story that was an illusion. Avoid at all costs.
The revelation that a character is actually the long lost relative of another character is very much a soap opera cliché. If you are drawn to this twist, think of ways to make it your own.
Avoid having one of your characters realize that they are a ghost. This is another notorious twist that the reader will likely see coming and not appreciate. In fact, avoid all M. Night Shyamalan style twists.

, Avoid using it as a springboard for the broader narrative. The twist should serve the plot and move it forward, not vice versa. Your story should not be so dependent on the twist that it loses its appeal after the reader figures out what is happening. Re-readability is important. A twist is well developed if the reader enjoys it just as much the second time they encounter it.Do not start with an interesting twist and then start writing your narrative out from there. You will make the entire too contingent on this one moment.

, Your twist should be part of an exciting story situation that, if guessed by your reader, continues to excite them. Instead of being disappointed that they discovered the twist, the reader should be eager to understand the possibilities of what it entails for the broader narrative.Focus on creating a complex and interesting world that the reader engages with. A story that relies too heavily on a twist might like dimension.

, Your twist should always be escalating the plot, not deescalating it. You should scrap a scene if it detracts from or deescalates the narrative arc. If the twist brings your story to a screeching halt, it probably is not worth developing. Do not use a twist for its own sake. Although it may be very clever, it should help move the story along and contribute the final punchline.

, If you are writing fiction for a certain genre, use the field’s tropes to throw off the reader. Subvert the narrative norms in a way that makes sense but is unexpected. Take a tired cliché or trope, like one of the gimmicks mentioned above, and turn it on its head. Readers will appreciate you using something old in a new way. If a certain kind of character is typically an ally of the protagonist, reveal them to be a villain.
In a space opera, reveal the humans to be the villains instead of the aliens.

Revise your first draft.",How to Write a Mystery Story," Mysteries almost always begin with a murder. The major question in a mystery is who committed the crime. Thrillers usually begin with a situation that leads to a major catastrophe, like an assassination, a bank robbery, a nuclear explosion, etc. The major question in a thriller is whether or not the hero can prevent the catastrophe from occurring.


In mystery stories, your reader does not know who committed the murder until the end of the novel. Mysteries are centered on the intellectual exercise of trying to figure out the motivations behind the crime, or the puzzle.
Mysteries tend to be written in the first person, while thrillers are often written in the third person and from multiple points of view. In mystery stories, there is usually a slower pace as the hero/detective/main character tries to solve the crime. There are also less action sequences in mysteries than in thrillers.
Because mysteries are often more slower paced, the characters are usually more in depth and well rounded in a mystery story than in a thriller.;
, There are many great mystery stories that you can read to get a sense of a well plotted, well developed mystery.The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins. The 19th century mystery novel was originally written in serial form, so the story moves forward in measured steps. Much of what became standard in crime fiction was done by Collins in this novel, so it is an engaging and instructive introduction to the genre.

The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler. Chandler is one of the genre’s greatest writers, creating engaging stories about the trials and tribulations of private detective Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is a tough, cynical, but honest P.I. who becomes in entangled in a plot with a General, his daughter, and a blackmailing photographer. Chandler’s work is known for its sharp dialogue, great pacing, and riveting hero, Marlowe.The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. One of the genre’s most famous detectives, along with his equally famous sleuthing partner Watson, solves a series of mysteries and crimes in this collection of stories. Holmes and Watson inject their unique character traits into the stories along the way.""NANCY DREW' by Carolyn Keene. The whole series is situated in United States.Nancy Drew is a detective. Her close friends Helen Corning,Bess Marvin and George Fayne appear in some mysteries. Nancy is Carson Drew's daughter. Carson Drew is the most famous lawyer in River Heights,where they live.
""Hardy Boys by Franklin W. Dixon.This is similar to Nancy Drew.It is is about two brothers:Frank and Joe Hardy, who are talented detectives.They are the sons of a very famous detective,and they sometimes help in his cases.


A Crime in the Neighborhood by Suzanne Berne. This recent mystery novel is set in 1970s suburban Washington. It centers on the “crime” in the neighborhood, the murder of a young boy. Berne intersperses a coming of age story with the mystery of the death of the young boy in bland, boring suburbia, but manages to make the story anything but bland or boring., Think about how the author introduces the main character and how the author describes the main character.


For example, in The Big Sleep, Chandler’s first person narrator describes himself through his clothing on the first page: “I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn’t care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be.”With these opening sentences, Chandler makes the narrator distinct through his way of describing himself, his outfit, and his job (private detective).

, Think about how the author situates the story in the setting or time period.


For example, in the second paragraph of the first page of The Big Sleep, Marlowe places the reader in the time and setting: “The main hallway of the Sternwood place was two stories high.”
The reader now knows Marlowe is in front of the home of the Sternwoods and it is a larger home, possibly wealthy.

, What is the crime that the main character has to solve or deal with in some way? This could be a murder, a missing person, or a suspicious suicide.


In The Big Sleep, Marlowe is hired by General Sternwood to “take care” of a photographer who has been blackmailing the General with scandalous pictures of the General’s daughter.

, A good mystery will keep readers hooked by complicating the main character’s mission (to solve the crime) with obstacles or problems.


In The Big Sleep, Chandler complicates Marlowe’s pursuit of the photographer by having the photographer killed in the early chapters, followed by the suspicious suicide of the General’s chauffeur. So Chandler sets up the story with two crimes that Marlowe has to solve.

, Think about how the mystery is resolved at the end of the story. The solution to the mystery should not feel too obvious or forced, but it also should not seem too out of left field or implausible.


The resolution of the mystery should feel surprising to your reader, without confusing them. One of the benefits of a mystery is that you can pace the story so the solution unfolds gradually, rather than in a rushed or hurried manner.

, Your main character can also be a private citizen or innocent bystander to a crime who gets drawn into solving the mystery. Brainstorm specific details of your main character, including:Body size and shape, hair and eye color, and any other physical characteristics. For example, you may have a short female main character with dark hair, glasses, and green eyes. Or you may want a more typical detective character: tall with slicked back hair and a five o’clock shadow.
Clothing and dress. Your character’s clothing will not only create a more detailed image for your reader, it can also indicate what time period your story is set in. For example, if your main character wears heavy armor and a helmet with a crest, your reader will realize your story is set in medieval times. If your character wears a hoodie, jeans, and a backpack, this will tip off your readers that the story is likely set in modern times.
What makes your main character unique. It’s important to create a main character who stands out to your reader and feels engaging enough to sustain many pages in a story or novel. Consider what your character likes and dislikes. Maybe your female sleuth is shy and awkward at parties, and has a secret love of reptiles. Or perhaps your detective is a complete klutz and doesn’t consider himself a strong or smart person. Focus on details that will help to create a unique main character and don’t be afraid to draw on details from your own life or your own preferences and tastes., Place the story in a setting you know well, like your hometown or your school. Or do some research on a setting you are unfamiliar with, like 70s California or 40s Britain. If you use a setting you have not experienced first hand, focus on specific settings, like a suburban home in 70s California or a boarding house in 40s Britain.


If you decide to set your story in a time period or location you are unfamiliar with, conduct research on the time period or location through your local library, online sources, or interviews with experts in a certain time period or location. Be specific with your research and during your interviews to ensure you get all the details of a setting or time period right.

, Not all mysteries need to have a murder or major crime. But the bigger the crime, usually the higher the stakes in the story will be. High stakes are important because they engage your reader and give her a reason to keep reading. Possible sources for mystery could be:An item is stolen from your main character or someone close to the main character.
A person close to the main character disappears.
The main character receives threatening or disturbing notes.
The main character witnesses a crime.
The main character is asked to help solve a crime.
The main character stumbles upon a mystery.
You can also combine several of these scenarios to create a more layered mystery. For example, an item may be stolen from your main character, a person close to the main character disappears, and then the main character witnesses a crime she is later asked to help solve.

, Build up tension in the story by making it difficult for your main character to solve the puzzle or mystery. You can use obstacles like other people, or suspects, false leads, misleading clues, or another crime.Create a list of possible suspects your main character may encounter throughout the story. You can use several suspects to point the detective and/or the reader in the wrong direction to build suspense and surprise.Write a list of clues. Red herrings are clues that are false or misleading. Your story will be stronger if you include several red herring clues in the story. For example, your main character may find a clue that points to one suspect, but it is later revealed the clue is actually tied to a different suspect. Or your detective may find a clue without realizing it is the key to unlocking the entire mystery., A cliffhanger is a moment, usually at the end of a scene, where the main character is in a situation that traps her or places her in danger. Cliffhangers are important in a mystery because they keep your reader engaged and propels the story forward. Possible cliffhangers could be:The main character is investigating a possible lead alone and encounters the murderer or killer.
The main character begins to doubt her abilities and lets her guard down, allowing the murderer to kill again.
No one believes the main character and she ends up trying to solve the crime alone,and she ends up getting kidnapped.
The main character is injured and trapped in a dangerous place.
The main character is going to lose an important clue if she can’t get out of a certain location or situation.

, Wrap up the story with the solution to the puzzle. At the end of most mysteries, the main character has a positive change or shift in her perspective. Possible resolutions include:The main character saves someone close to them, or an innocent person wrapped up in the mystery.
The main character saves herself and is changed by her courage or smarts.
The main character exposes a bad character or organization.
The main character exposes the murderer or person responsible for the crime.

, Now that you have considered all the aspects of your story, create a clear outline of the plot. It’s important to map out how exactly the mystery will unfold before you sit down to write the story, as this will ensure there will are no loose ends in the mystery. Your outline should be in the order the events or plot points are going to occur in the story. It should include:Introduction of main character and setting.
The inciting incident, or the crime.
The call to adventure: The main character gets involved in solving the crime.
Tests and trials: The main character finds clues, encounters potential suspects, and tries to stay alive as she pursues the truth.Close ones might be kidnapped as a threat
Ordeal: The main character thinks she has found a key clue or suspect and believes she has solved the crime. This is a false resolution, and is a good way to surprise your reader when it turns out the main character got it wrong.
Major setback: All seems lost for the main character. She found the wrong suspect or clue, someone else is killed or harmed, and all her allies have abandoned her. A major setback will amp up the tension in the story and keep the reader guessing.
The reveal: The main character gathers all interested parties together, lays out the clues, explains the false leads, and reveals who the murderer or guilty person is.

, One of the best ways to create a setting or atmosphere is to focus on the five senses: sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. Descriptions of sensory details can also create backstory for your character. For example, rather than tell the reader your character had cereal for breakfast, you can have the character taste the remnants of cereal on her tongue. Or she can smell the cereal she spilled on her hands.Think what your main character might see in a certain setting. For example, if your character lives in a home much like yours in a small town, you may describe her bedroom or her walk to school. If you are using a specific historical setting, like 70s California, you may describe your character standing on a street corner and looking at the unique architecture or the cars that drive by.
Consider what your main character might hear in a certain setting. Your sleuth may listen to the birds chirping and the sprinklers on the lawns on the way to school. Or your detective may hear the roaring of cars or the crashing of ocean waves.
Describe what your main character might smell in a certain setting. Your main character might wake up to the smell of coffee being made in the kitchen by her parents. Or your detective may be hit with the smell of the city: rotting garbage and body odor.
Describe what your character might feel. This could be a light breeze, a sharp pain, a sudden jolt, or a shiver down her spine. Focus on how your character’s body might react to a feeling.
Think about what your character might taste. Your main character may still taste the cereal she had for breakfast in her mouth, or the drink from the night before.

, Skip long paragraphs of description of setting or character, especially in the early pages. You want to hook your reader by starting right in the action, as your main character is moving and thinking.Think about being concise with your language and description. Most readers continue reading a good mystery because they are invested in the main character and want to see her succeed. Be brief but specific when describing the main character and her perspective on the world.
For example, Chandler’s The Big Sleep starts by situating the reader in a setting and gives the reader a sense of the main character’s perspective on the world. “It was about eleven o’clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn’t care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars.”With this beginning, the story starts in action, with a specific time, date, and description of the setting. It then presents the main character’s physical description and job title. The section ends with the main character’s motivation: four million dollars. In three lines, Chandler has covered many of the essential details of the character, the setting, and the story.

, If you tell your reader, “the detective was cool”, the reader will have to take your word for it. But if you show your reader the detective was cool by describing the clothing she wears and the way she walks into a room, the reader can see how cool the character is. The impact of showing your reader certain details is much more powerful than simply telling the reader what to think.Think about how you would react in a situation if you were angry or scared. Have your character react in ways that communicate angry or scared, without telling the reader about the character’s emotions. For example, rather than “Stephanie was angry,” you could write: “Stephanie slammed her water glass down on the table so hard her dinner plate rattled. She glared at him, and started ripping the thin, white napkin into shreds with her fingers.”
Showing, rather than telling also works well for descriptions of setting. For example, in The Big Sleep, rather than tell the reader the Sternwoods were wealthy, Chandler describes the luxurious details of the estate: “There were French doors at the back of the hall, beyond them a wide sweep of emerald grass to a white garage, in front of which a slim dark young chauffeur in shiny black leggings was dusting a maroon Packard convertible. Beyond the garage were some decorative trees trimmed as carefully as poodle dogs. Beyond them a large greenhouse with a domed roof. Then more trees and beyond everything the solid, uneven, comfortable line of the foothills.”

, When creating a mystery, it’s important that the resolution does not feel abrupt or cheap. Try to always play fair and aim to surprise, rather than confuse, your reader. The clues presented in the story should lead to the solution in a logical and clear way, despite any red herrings or false leads. Your reader will enjoy the ending if you make her think, “It’s so obvious, I should have known!”, Once you have created a first draft of your mystery story, go through your pages and look for key aspects, including:Plot. Ensure your story sticks to the outline and has a clear beginning, middle, and an ending. You should also confirm your main character shifts or changes at the end of the story.
Characters. Are your characters, including your main character, distinct and unique? Do all the characters sound and act the same or are they different from each other? Do your characters feel original and engaging?
Pacing. Pacing is how fast or how slow the action moves in the story. Good pacing will feel invisible to the reader. If the story feels like it is moving too fast, make the scenes longer to draw out the emotions of the characters. If it feels like the story gets bogged down or confusing, shorten the scenes to only include essential information. A good rule of thumb is to always end a scene earlier than you might think or want. This will keep the tension from scene to scene from dropping and keep the pace of the story moving.
The twist. The twist can either make or break a good mystery story. This is completely optional, but many of the best stories have a twist at the end. Make sure that a twist is not too ""cheesy"". The more unique a twist is, the easier it is to write. When writing an overused twist, such as ""then they woke up"", you'll need to be a very good writer to make it sound good. A good twist not only fools the audience, but fools the character(s) too. Consider hinting towards the twist during action scenes, so that when the reader looks back on the story, they'll wonder how they missed it. Try not to make the twist evident too early on.

Show the story to children.,
Revise the story for length and clarity.",How to Write a Children's Story," One possible inspiration could be a memorable experience or event in your childhood. Think about memories of your childhood that were exciting, strange, or a bit wondrous. Use a memory as the basis for the children’s story.

For example, maybe you had a strange day in third grade that you could turn into an entertaining story. Or perhaps you experienced a foreign country when you were very young and have a story from the trip kids would enjoy.

, Pick an everyday activity or event and give it some whimsy. Make it fantastical by adding an absurd element to it. Use your imagination to try to view it as a child might.For example, you may take a common event like going to the dentist and make it fantastical by having the machinery used by the dentist come alive. Or you may take a child’s first time in the ocean and make it fantastical by having the child go into the deep depths of the ocean.

, Sometimes a children’s story hinges on a main character that is relatable and unique. Think about character types that do not get represented often in children’s stories. Make your character particular by using real life qualities in children and adults that you find interesting.For example, you may notice that there is not a lot of children’s stories where a young girl of color is the main character. You may then create a main character that fills this void.

, Having a central theme for the story can help you generate ideas. Focus on a theme like love, loss, identity, or friendship from a child’s point of view. Think about how a child might view the theme and explore it.For example, you may explore the theme of friendship by focusing on the relationship between a young girl and her pet turtle.

, Children’s stories are often written with a specific age group in mind. Are you trying to write a story for toddlers? For older children? Identify if you are writing for children age 2-4, 4-7, or 8-10. The language, tone, and style of the story will change based on which age group you are writing for.For example, if you are writing for a 2-4 or 4-7 age range, you should use simple language and very short sentences. If you are writing for an 8-10 age range, you can use language that is a bit more complex and sentences that are longer than four to five words.

, Get a better sense of the genre by reading examples of children’s stories that have been successful. Try to read stories that focus on the demographic or age group you’d like to write for. You may read:


Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak

Charlotte’s Web by E.B. White

The Gruffalo by Julia Donaldson

The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett

, Start with a sentence that will hook the reader in right away. Use a strange image of the main character as the opening. Show the main character in action. The opening should set the tone for the rest of the story and let the reader know what to expect.For example, the first line of “The Beginning of Smoke” by Brunei Darussalam is: “At the beginning of the world, smoke was a man. At that time, there was a boy named Si Lasap, an orphan, who was constantly harassed by the village youths…”
This opening establishes character, tone, and a fantastical element to “smoke.”

, Make sure the story has a beginning, middle, and end. Having an arc will ensure the reader stays engaged in the story. Even if the children’s story is short, it can still have a clear arc.For example, you may start with a young girl discovering a turtle in the lake by her house. Then, the middle section of the story is the girl’s friendship with the turtle. The ending could then be the girl taking the turtle in as a pet.

, Most children’s stories will have a happy, uplifting ending with a moral. Avoid making the moral feel too heavy handed or preachy. A subtle moral will be more effective and less obvious to the children reading your story.Try showing the moral through the actions of your characters. For example, you may have a young girl prepare the turtle’s enclosure in her room and then show her putting the turtle in the enclosure. This could explore the moral of helping others without telling the reader the moral.

, You may want to get the children’s story illustrated to add something extra to it. Try illustrating it yourself or hire an illustrator to bring your story to life.

Illustrations may be ideal if your story is very visual and has a lot of striking images in it.

, Once you’ve finished a draft of the children’s story, read it aloud to yourself. Listen to how it sounds on the page. Notice if there is language that is too complicated or high level for your target age group. Revise the story so it is easy to read and follow., Get feedback from your target age group. Ask your siblings, your younger family members, or children at your school to read your story and give you feedback. Adjust the story so it is more appealing and relatable for children., Go through the draft and make sure it is not too long. Often, children’s stories are the most effective when they are short and to the point. Most children’s stories have very little text, and when they do, they make the text count."

Read political fiction.,
Think about what you want to change or call attention to.,
Narrow down what you want to attack, like aiming at a target.,
Choose your approach.,
Base your story on real circumstances.,
Write a great work of fiction.,
Revise and edit your work once you've completed it.,
Publish your work.",How to Write Political Fiction," There's no better way than reading quality political fiction to get inspired and learn the tricks of the trade. Authors such as those listed above are good choices, but there are many, many other worthwhile works.


John Steinbeck,
Ayn Rand,
Gore Vidal, or
George Orwell
Tariq Ali
Aldous Huxley
Max Barry;
, Chances are you've already got something in mind.

, A very broad attack on, say, ""the government"" is unlikely to create powerful writing, but too narrow an attack, such as on a single person, generally won't serve to bring about meaningful change. There are many exceptions to these generalizations, though. Instead, focus the story on a specific practice that raises your ire. Some authors of political fiction write on war; Ayn Rand took aim at the political distribution of wealth; Richard Edward Connell criticized recreational hunting in his short story The Most Dangerous Game and touched on multiple political and religious themes in the screenplay of the movie Meet John Doe.

, The first impulse is usually to attack the subject earnestly and directly. This can be effective, but many times indirect approaches such as satire and allegory are more powerful. Satire, in particular, is a fun genre to write and, if written well, to read.

, You probably won't use senators' real names, and you may not even use a real country as your setting, but the more connections your story has to real places and real events, the more likely readers are to understand and relate to it.

, Ignore for a moment that the urgent message of your book is far more important than the trite diversions on the bestseller list. Political or socially-conscious work is truly valuable, but that fact doesn't give you license to write a boring or poorly written story. If you really have something important to say, say it well, and make your book every bit as engaging as popular fiction. See the related wikiHows for tips on how to write fiction.

, The creation of a good book typically involves 1 part writing to 3 parts revising and editing. See related wikiHows for help.

, It can be hard to find a publisher for controversial political fiction. The best way to get your story published is to make it an entertaining, high-quality work of fiction. If you've got that, but you still don't have a publisher, look to smaller presses, or publish the work yourself, either on paper or on the internet.

Show, don't tell.,
Let the reader experience the story through the character's senses.,
Layer details on top of one another to set the mood.",How to Add Sense Detail to Fiction1," Use sense detail to describe the story's location and time, the emotional state of the characters and their relationships, instead of stating place, time and mood.


Location: Describing ""ice floes hitting the shore"" transports the reader to an arctic environment.
Time: Describing Christmas decorations helps set the story in December. Describing roughly dressed peasants holding torches of pitch-soaked rags and shouting curses in French helps set the story during the French Revolution.
Character's emotional state: Saying ""John's eyes bulged and his face turned red"" vividly describes John's physical appearance, while implying his anger.
Relationship between characters: Saying one character squeezes another's hand implies that one is reassuring the other.;
, Not everyone experiences the world in the same way. Decide how your character perceives the world, and use words that convey that perception. This will connect your readers to the character.


Instead of describing John's eyes to the reader directly, let your other characters describe them through dialogue. His girlfriend might call them ""dreamy blue,"" while his enemy might describe them as icy blue shards. This shows how each sees John and how they relate to him.

, Create a series of related details that, taken together, create an image in your readers' minds.


For example, in describing a room, you might start with its size, then describe the windows, and then how light shines through them, what's on the walls that the light illuminates and finally how the air in the room smells.

Read!",How to Write a Short Story," Inspiration can strike at any time, so carry a notepad with you wherever you go so that you can write down story ideas as they come to you.


Most of the time, you’ll just think of small snippets of information (a catastrophic event around which you can build a plot, a character’s name or appearance, etc.), but you will sometimes get lucky and a whole story will reveal itself to you in a couple of minutes.
If you have trouble finding inspiration or if you need to write a story in a hurry (for, as an example, a class), learn how to brainstorm. If you can't come up with any ideas, you might have to look to family and friends for inspiration.
Experience usually helps to build good plots. Many of Isaac Asimov's mysteries came from experience of certain incidents.

If you can't think of any ideas, mix different plots from different stories. Make up something - the events of the story doesn't always have to be true.
If you get a topic to write on, don't take the title literally. for example : If the topic is ""Open door"" think of it metaphorically, you can talk about a door to your mind or how a book can open a door to another world. A portal to take you to the future, an opportunity. Try to reach the topic in a different approach; it makes the story more creative.

, After you've chosen an idea, you need to remember the basics of a short story before writing one. The steps to a good short story are:


Flash back : start from an incident that happened before your story started.
Dialogue : a conversation between the characters or a monologue.
Action : Start with something happening or your character doing something.
Introduction: introduce characters, setting, time, weather, etc.
Initiating action: the point of a story that starts the rising action.
Rising action: events leading up to the climax or turning point.
Climax: the most intense point or turning point of the story.
Falling action: your story begins to conclude.
Cliffhanger : don't complete your story and don't tell the audience what happens in the end and leave them to imagine the end. This is useful if you run out of time and don't have time to finish the story.
Resolution: a satisfying ending to the story in which the central conflict is resolved—or not! You don't have to write your short story in order. If you have an idea for a great conclusion, write it down. Move backward or forward from your starting idea (it may or may not be the beginning of the story) and ask yourself questions. “What happened before this?” “What happens next?”

, If you have trouble understanding or finding attributes of a character, turn to your life. You can easily borrow attributes of people you know or even strangers you notice.


For example, you might notice that someone is always drinking a cup of coffee, talks in a loud, booming voice, is always typing away at the computer, etc. All of these observations would together make a very interesting character. Your character can even blend attributes of a number of people.


, For a story to be believable, the characters have to feel genuine and realistic. It can be a difficult task to create interesting and realistic characters. But here are a few strategies to create ""real people"" to populate your story:


Write a list, titled with the character's name, and write all the attributes you can think of, from their position in the orchestra to their favorite color, from their central motivations to their favorite foods. Do they talk with an accent? Do they have any quirky mannerisms? You won’t include all this information in your story, but the more you know, the more your characters will come to life, both for you and for the reader.
Make sure your characters' personalities are not perfect. Every character needs to have some flaws, some problems, some imperfections and some insecurities. You might assume that people wouldn't like to read about a character with a lot of flaws, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. Batman wouldn't be The Dark Knight if he weren't a borderline sociopath!
People can relate to characters with problems, as that's realistic. When trying to come up with flaws, you don't need to give your character some huge, bizarre issue (although you definitely can). For most characters, try to stick with things you know about. For example, the character could have anger issues, be afraid of water, be lonely, dislike being around other people, smoke too much, etc. Any or all of these could be developed further.

, A novel can occur over millions of years and include a multitude of subplots, a variety of locations, and an army of supporting characters. The main events of a short story should occur in a relatively short period of time (days or even minutes), and you typically won’t be able to develop effectively more than one plot, two or three main characters, and one setting. If your story has much more breadth, it probably needs to be a novella or novel.

, There are three main points of view from which to tell a story: first-person (“I”), second-person (“you”), and third-person (“he” or “she”). In a first-person story, a character in the story tells the story; in the second-person the reader is made a character in the story; and in the third-person, an outside narrator tells the story. (Second-person narration is rarely used.)


Keep in mind that first-person narrators can only tell what they know (which will be limited to what they see firsthand or are told by others), while third-person narrators can either know everything and explore every character’s thoughts (third-person omniscient) or be limited to only that which can be observed by one character (third-person limited).
You can also mix and match. For example, you could switch between a first-person narrative in one chapter, and third-person in another, or even have more than one first-person point of view. An excellent example of this is the short story ""Rashōmon"", by Akutagawa Ryūnosuke. This was later turned into a movie of the same name by Akira Kurosawa.

, After you've prepared the basic elements of your story, it can be helpful to make some sort of time-line to help you decide what should happen when.


Your story should consist at least of an introduction, initiating incident, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. You can draw or write a visual with very simple descriptions of what should happen in each of these stages. Having this done will help you keep focused when writing the story, and you can easily make changes to it, so that you are able to keep a steady flow as you write the full story.

, Depending on how thoroughly you've sketched out your plot and characters, the actual writing process may simply be one of choosing the right words.


Generally, however, writing is arduous. You probably won’t know your characters and plot as well as you thought, but it doesn't matter—in a sense, they will tell you what they need, even if you paint them into a corner. Plus, there's always the second draft!


, The first page—some would say the first sentence—of any writing should grab the reader’s attention and leave him/her wanting more.


A quick start is especially important in short stories because you don’t have much room to tell your story. Don’t dillydally with long introductions of the characters or uninteresting descriptions of the setting: get right into the plot, and reveal details about the characters and setting piece-by-piece as you go along.


, You’re almost certain to hit some bumps in the road to finishing your story. You've got to work through them, though. Set aside a time to write each and every day, and make it a goal to finish, say, a page each day. Even if you end up throwing away what you wrote on that day, you've been writing and thinking about the story, and that will keep you going in the long run.


Consider participating in writing groups or activities. One very good activity for writers of all kinds is ""National Novel Writing Month,"" or NaNoWriMo.Every year, from November 1 through November 30th, you are tasked with writing a novel of at least 50,000 words. Brilliance and quality are off the table—the goal is the act of writing. Check out the reference link for more information.

, As you develop your story, you may want to turn your plot in a different direction than you had planned, or you may want to substantially change or remove a character. Listen to your characters if they tell you to do something different, and don’t worry about scrapping your plans altogether if you can make a better story as you go.

, When you've finished the story, go back through it and correct any mechanical mistakes, as well as logical and semantic errors. In general, make sure the story flows and the characters and their problems are introduced and resolved appropriately.


If you have time, put the completed story down for a few days or weeks before editing. Distancing yourself from the story in this way will help you see it more clearly when you pick it back up.

, Send your revised and edited story off to a trusted friend or relative for revisions, edits, and suggestions. Let your reviewers know that you want to hear their real opinions of the story. Give them time to read it and think about it, and give them a copy that they can write on.


Make sure you consider everything that your reviewers tell you—not just the parts you would like to hear. Thank your reviewers for reading your story, and don’t argue with them.
Incorporate whatever edits, revisions, and suggestions you feel are valid. Your writing will be better if you carefully consider constructive criticism, but you don’t have to follow all the advice you get. Some of the suggestions may not be very good. It’s your story, and you need to make the final call!

, It may be frustrating if you're having trouble writing. You can run out of steam, get angry at characters, and feel sad—or even a little guilty—when a beloved character dies or is killed.


Just know that you will, in all probability, doubt your own writing skills at some point. This is totally normal. You'll feel it's not worth continuing, and that you should give up and become a waiter in a dive cafeteria. When these thoughts arise, they can easily take over and make you quit then and there.
One of the hardest tasks as a writer is to learn to squash those feelings and continue writing. When you begin to have these doubtful feelings, or get tired or bored, stop writing! You can get up, take a walk, get a snack, watch TV, or anything to relax. When you return, do so with a fresh mind. You may still not want to write, but tell yourself a few good things about your story—anything about it, from one good passage you wrote, to a well-thought out dialogue, to an interesting character—and congratulate yourself. You're doing something most people can't do.
If someone else knows about your story and has read it, they can also be a good source of encouragement. Just tell yourself that you will finish this story because you want to. It doesn't matter if the story isn't the best ever written—there will be others. If you have a goal to finish it, that's what you'll do.

, Nothing can help you learn how to write a good short story better than reading good short stories. Note the style and how the author uses brevity to their advantage.


Reading a variety of authors and styles will help you learn how to adopt different ""voices"" for each story you write, and broaden your creative palette. Pay attention to how the authors develop their characters, write dialogue, and structure their plots. Here are some suggestions:
""I, Robot"", by Issac Asimov.
""Steps"", by Jerzy Kosinski.
""The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County"", by Mark Twain.
""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"", by James Thurber.
""A Sound of Thunder"", by Ray Bradbury.
""Three Questions"", by Leo Tolstoy
""Mr Gum and the Power Crystals"" by Andy Stanton, for a children's one. (This is a basic one)
""Brokeback Mountain"", by Annie Proulx
Note: many of these short stories have been turned into successful films, or have become familiar cultural references. For example, ""A Sound of Thunder"", the most re-published sci-fi short story of all time, introduces us to the ""butterfly effect."" Philip K. Dick's stories have given us Blade Runner (""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep""), Total Recall (""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale""), Minority Report (""Minority Report""), A Scanner Darkly (""A Scanner Darkly""), and many others. It is important to have all these elements in order so you can have a head start of ideas to work with.

Don't make your character a Mary Sue.,
Have clear dialogue.,
Avoid pointless description.,
Make it original.,
Do your research.,
Avoid dragging out the book.,
End it well.",How to Avoid Errors when Writing a Fiction Book," One of the worst things that could happen in a book is boring your readers to tears before page five. Make sure to hook the readers and start off the action relatively quickly so that the readers aren't putting down the book before finishing the first page.;
, Your protagonist or hero/heroine should be introduced right away. Avoid having pages of description about the town, the street, and the random people walking around before introducing your protagonist. Alternatively, you could also choose to introduce your antagonist (the bad guy) before your hero, but either way, make sure to introduce someone relevant to the story ASAP!

, Make sure that your characters have reasons for doing something. If they're just ambling along in the book doing whatever they please for no real reason, the reader loses interest really fast.

, If your character is just a ""rebel princess"", or their village was attacked by bandits, and those bandits are never mentioned again, your readers will likely think that you were too lazy to make a good background.

, Mary Sue is a term that originated in Star Trek fan-fiction, critiqued for the reason that every single canon character either admired her, or fell in love with her. She was even promoted rapidly. If your character has traits similar to a Mary Sue, readers will think your character is too perfect, and most of the time quit reading because of that. Give your character weaknesses to balance out their strengths.

, ""I'm confused."" He said. ""Me too."" He added. ""What's going on?"" He shrugged. Readers will be scratching their heads in confusion if the dialogue in your book is like that. Make sure that it's clear to the readers who is talking at what time in your book, otherwise it will be way too confusing, and not many readers will bother to decipher who's talking to whom.

, When writing, if you don't know what you want to happen next in your book, don't use pointless description as a 'filler'. Avoid filling up pages describing the coffee table that your protagonist is standing beside, or how the coffee they're drinking is lukewarm. Your readers will get bogged down with useless details that have no real point or relevance to the story, which will confuse them.

, When writing, you'll want your book to stand out, not blend in with every other book that's ever been written. Make your plot and characters original and one-of-a-kind. When we read your book, we don't want to feel like we've already read it. Avoid copying storylines and characters from other books, and avoid excessive use of stereotypes and cliches.

, Have you ever heard of the expression ""write what you know""? It rings very true, especially in fiction. If you don't live in England, it's probably not a good idea to make that the setting of your story, unless you do excessive research. Don't assume that your readers are going to be stupid and overlook things that don't add up. Do your research on even the smallest of things - that's how your novel becomes believable.

, Sure, you might want to write a 600-page book, but it's better to be short and sweet, with the readers loving every second of it. You don't want to torture your readers by dragging out the book at a snail's pace until page 600. Especially in the middle, avoid dragging out the story by having your characters take a trip to Mexico if it will have no relevance to how the story is going to end. Keep it detailed, but keep it concise.

, One of the worst things that can happen with fiction books is having an unsatisfying ending. Sure, you've been writing for months and you just want to get the book over with, but don't wrap up the book so quickly that it leaves the readers wondering what happened. Wrap it up well, tie up the loose ends, and avoid being lazy with the ending. Make it one that will leave the readers feeling content.

It’s best to respond to a particular article that was published by the newspaper. Then, your letter will be more likely to be chosen for publication, and always be ready for rejection.
If you are responding to a community event or issue, your local newspaper is likely to be the most appropriate venue for your letter to the editor.;
, Before you start writing your own letter, you should read through other letters to the editor of the paper you've chosen to get inspiration. Each paper's letters will differ slightly in form, style, tone, and even in length. Read these letters to get a better idea of how to phrase your letters and to see what appeals to the editors of that paper., Most papers will have guidelines for the types of letters they will publish.Most papers have rules regarding the letter’s length. They also typically ask that you include your name and contact information for verification. There may be additional guidelines. A number of papers won't allow political endorsement and limit how often individuals can submit. Make sure to read these guidelines before you send off your work.


If you can’t find the guidelines for submitting letters, call the publication to ask.

, There are a number of approaches to writing these types of letters. Your approach is dependent upon why you are writing the letter. Determine what you hope to accomplish by writing the letter. Some reasons might include:You are angry about an issue and you want the readers to know about it.
You want to publicly congratulate or support something or someone in your community.
You want to correct information in an article.
You want to suggest an idea to others.
You want to influence public opinion or persuade others to take action.
You want to influence policymakers or elected officials.
You want to publicize a certain organization’s work in connection with a current news issue.

, Make sure your letter is timely by sending in your letter shortly after the article in question was published. This will improve your chances of getting published, since the issue will still be fresh in the editor’s mind (and the readers’ minds).If you’re responding to an article in a weekly newspaper, send in your letter in time for it to be published in the next issue. See the newspaper’s guidelines for the publication deadline.

, Make sure to include your full contact information at the top of your letter. This will include not only your address, but also your email address, and daytime phone number.


If your letter is chosen, the editors will use this information to get in touch with you.
If the newspaper has an online submission system, it will likely have a space for you to include this information.

, After your contact information, leave a blank line and then add the date. Write it formally, as you would in a business letter, such as: “Feb 25, 2016.”

, If you are writing an email or sending in a physical letter, address the letter as you would a business letter.Include the recipient’s name, position, company, and address. If you don’t know the editor’s name, you can either find it in the newspaper, or you can just write “Editor.”

, It’s usually a good idea to attach your name to your letter, and some newspapers won’t publish letters anonymously anyway. But sometimes, there may be a circumstance where you want to state your opinion but you don’t want people to know who you are. Add a note to the editor that your letter needs to be published anonymously.


Unless you’ve written about a provocative issue, it’s unlikely that your letter will be published if you’ve also requested anonymity.
You will still need to provide your name and contact information, so that the newspaper can verify your letter. The newspaper won’t publish your information if you’ve asked it not to.

, There's no need to be fancy here. Just write ""To the editor,” ""To the editor of The Herald,"" or “Dear Editor.” Follow this salutation with a comma or a colon.

, Orient your readers as quickly as possibly by stating the name and date of the article that you're responding to. Also, include the article’s argument. You can do this in just one or two sentences.For example: ""As a literature professor, I must take issue with your editorial (""Why Novels no Longer Matter in the Classroom,"" March 18th).""

, After you've stated the argument you're responding to, you should clearly state the position you're taking on the issue and why you feel a certain way. If your authority relates to the issue in some way, then state your occupation as well. Take this time to show why the issue is relevant and important, but remember to be brief.


For example: ""While the article states that college students no longer take pleasure in reading, everything I've seen in my classroom is evidence to the contrary. The article is not only inaccurate, but provides a very cursory explanation of the many reasons why students may be challenged by reading fiction in a college setting. Students aren't getting ""bored"" with fiction because the novel is no longer relevant; rather, their enthusiasm is waning because of professors who are losing interest in their own subject matter.""

, Your letter is too short to cover much ground. Give your letter more force by focusing on one issue and providing evidence for that issue., This helps your reader identify exactly what you’re arguing from the get-go. If your letter is edited, it will be cut from the bottom up. If your most important point is at the beginning, it won’t get lost in the editing.

, Now that you've stated your position on an issue, you need to back it up with some facts. If you want your letter to be chosen, then you need to show that you've put some thought and research into formulating your letter. Though you don't have a lot of space, just providing a few key facts can make a big difference. Here are some great ways to provide evidence:Use recent events in your state or community as evidence.
Use statistics, data, or survey results.
Tell a personal story that tells a larger point.
Use current events in politics for support.

, To make your point relevant, use a personal story. Readers can more easily recognize the impact that news can have on a person when that person shares a personal story., Once you've provided evidence for your point of view, end the letter by saying what can be done to address the issue. Perhaps just raising awareness of the issue in the community is enough, but there may be other things that people can do to address the issue and get involved.


Point the readers to actions they can take to be more involved in the issue in their local communities.
Direct the readers to a website or organization that can further their goals.
Give the readers a way to find more information on the subject.
Instruct the readers directly. Tell them to do something, whether it's to call their local congressperson, vote, recycle, or volunteer in their communities.

, If your letter is intended to influence a legislator or a corporation to take a specific action, name that person or corporation. The staff working for the legislator is collecting news mentions of the legislator. Corporations are doing the same. These people will be more likely to read your letter if you name them specifically., Have one sentence that summarizes your point of view on the issue so your readers have a clear reminder of your main message.

, At the very end of your letter, include a simple “Sincerely,” or “Best regards,” to finish your letter. Then include your name and city. Include your state if the newspaper is not your local publication.

, If your professional expertise is relevant to your article, then include this information between your name and residence. If you are attaching your company’s name to your letter, you are implicitly stating that you are speaking on behalf of the organization. If you are writing on your own, then omit your company name. You can still use your professional title if it is relevant to the issue addressed in your letter. The following is an example that uses an organizational affiliation:






Dr. Barbara Smith
Professor of Literature
Humanities Department
Sparrow University
Springfield, N.Y.





, If you say exactly what everyone else is saying, then your letter won't get chosen. Find a way to put a new spin on an old issue. Your letter may also have a higher chance of getting printed if you have summarized many other letters in an eloquent and provocative way.

, Most letters to the editor are between 150 and 300 words long. Remember to be as concise as possible.


Cut out extraneous phrases or flowery language. Be straight and to the point. This will help you cut down on your word count.
Eliminate phrases like “I think.” It’s apparent that the content of your letter is what you think, so you don’t need to waste the words., Even if you disagree with an issue, maintain a respectful tone instead of being angry or accusatory. Keep your tone formal and avoid slang or overly casual phrasing.


Don’t insult your readers, the article’s author, or your opponents. Keep an even keel when writing your letter., Make sure your letter is written at an appropriate reading level for the newspaper’s audience.


Avoid jargon, acronyms and abbreviations. The readers might not know certain industry jargon or abbreviations that are common in your field. Spell out acronyms and abbreviations. Use more common language in place of jargon., Once you're happy with the wording of your letter, proofread your paper to check for grammar and spelling mistakes. Remember that you're competing against many other letter writers, sometimes numbering in the thousands for a national paper. If you have a stray comma or a grammatical hiccup, you risk looking less professional than your competition.


Read your letter aloud to make sure that the flow of punctuation is natural.
Ask someone to read your letter. Another set of eyes on your letter will help improve clarity. He may also catch errors that you missed.

, Once you've finished your letter, send it to the paper you've chosen. The paper's guidelines should say which form of submission is best. Most papers ask for an electronic submission, either via email or through an online submission system. Some traditional newspapers may still prefer a physical copy of your letter.

, The newspaper reserves the right to edit a letter. The paper will primarily edit for length, or to slightly alter an unclear passage. The paper won’t change the overall tone or argument of your letter.


If your letter contains libelous or inflammatory language, this may be edited out. Or, your letter may not be published at all.

, If your letter is printed and you have requested particular action on the part of a legislator or corporation, follow up with that individual or company. Clip out your letter and send it to the legislator or corporation. Include a note that addresses the action you’ve requested., No matter how perfect your letter might have been, there is always a chance that other letters will catch the editor's eye and that yours will not be published. That's okay. Now that you know how to write a letter to the editor, you'll be a pro at writing future letters. Be proud of yourself for stating your opinion and advocating for something you believe in.

, If your letter was not published but you still feel strongly about the topic letter, try sending a similar letter addressing a similar topic in a different paper.

Choose the right descriptive words.",How to Add Sense Detail to Fiction2," If you're writing about someone entering a cave to take shelter from a rainstorm, determine how each sense would perceive the setting. For example:


Sight: Moss clinging to the cave mouth, water trickling off stalactites
Hearing: Sound of dripping water, heart thumping in response to peals of thunder
Touch: Wet, slippery moss, sodden clothes, blast of cold wind
Smell: Musty, stale cave air, stench of sweat and rain-soaked clothes
Taste: Chalky taste of water dripping into character's mouth from the cave roof

,


Use strong, precise verbs. Saying ""water plopped"" or ""water beetled down"" is more descriptive than saying ""water fell.""
Understand both the dictionary definition of words and their meaning to the reader. A ""babbling brook"" carries the hint of happiness, while a ""rushing torrent"" suggests fear and danger.

Cultivate ideas.,
Describe your world.,
Draw a map, if it's helpful.,
Establish the location of your setting.,
Figure out a timeframe.",How to Write a Credible Fantasy Story2," Fantasy stories typically exist in fictional worlds or universes. If you want to write a fantasy story, you'll be creating a world for readers that's slightly different from our own. To start your fantasy story, try to come up with a fun idea for a setting.


Fantasy writers get ideas everywhere. You may see an article in National Geographic about a desert region that gives you an idea for a fantasy planet. You might go for a walk in the woods and see an unusual looking tree and get an idea there. Exposing yourself to unusual or unexpected settings can help trigger your imagination.Read some fantasy as well and pay attention to setting. How does the world of Narnia differ from the real world, for example? What about Hogwarts sets it apart from a regular school? What makes these settings feel real and unique?
Jot down any ideas you get. Keep a notebook where you write down ideas about the scenery, housing, and weather in your imaginary world. You'll be surprised how quickly things start to come together, and how real your world begins to feel, when you begin journaling its creation.

, What does your fantasy world look like? If you want your story to feel realistic, you need to have a clear vision of your world. Try to make a detailed description of the planet, town, city, or universe where your story takes place.


You can practice descriptive writing by describing a real scene first. For example, sit down outside and write down everything you see with as much descriptive language as possible. Incorporate all your senses. What does it smell like, feel like, look like, and so on?
Then, try to use all your senses to describe your fantasy world. What kind of plants are present? What kind of animals? What colors? What smells? What is the weather like? What noises linger in the air? Free write a long, detailed description of your fantasy world.

, Many famous authors included maps of their fantasy worlds in their work. JRR Tolkien had a map of middle earth, for example. If you're artistically inclined, get out a piece of scrap paper and map your world.


Draw the rough shape of your world. If you're writing a fantasy story that takes place on a distant island, for example, maybe that island is shaped like a heart.
Plot out major landmarks. Draw a series of trees to represent the looming, mysterious forest in your world. Draw a star to represent the capital of each city. Draw ripples of water to indicate rivers, streams, and oceans.
If you've begun to think about the history of your setting, incorporate that here. If you know where the last emperor of your kingdom died, mark that on the map. If you have some idea where the hero saw a ghostly vision of her grandmother shortly after birth, mark that on your map.

, Where is your setting located? Some stories take place in worlds within our own world. The Harry Potter series, for example, involves a hidden world within the realm of modern England. However, The Lord of the Rings takes place in its own universe called Middle Earth.


If you create another world or universe entirely, there are some benefits to this. You will not be bound by realistic laws or rules, for example. You'll be allowed full creative control of your world and can create any kind of setting you choose.
However, creating an entire world of your own had drawbacks. You will not have anything to fall back on. You will have to come up with entirely new landscapes, creatures, rules of reality, and so on. While this can be freeing, it can also be intimidating. If you base your setting in a real world, you'll have some grounding as you work.

, Your fantasy world should be grounded in a certain moment in time. Some fantasy worlds take place in the future, and therefore technological advances are present. However, if you're writing something set in a more primitive society, people may not have modern technologies. Keep timeframe in mind when establishing your setting.


Do some research. Researching can help aid your ideas about technology in a fantasy story. If you want to incorporate a cure for aging, for example, read some articles on the process of aging. Understand how and why aging occurs so you can depict how aging could be paused of stopped altogether in a fashion that feels realistic.If you want your story to take place in an ancient world, research how past cultures lived. Maybe everyone in your story travels by horse and carriage. Read about basic horse care and carriage maintenance. You should be able to find historical accounts of traveling by horse online or at your local library.Think about the ethical implications of technology as well. For example, let's go back to the aging example. How might society change if people suddenly did not age? Would there be potential resistance to the idea of halting aging? What might the public response look like?

"
"
Create social conventions.,
Make social classes.,
Decide how supernatural elements work.,
Make decisions about weapons and supernatural objects.,
Follow your own rules.",How to Write a Credible Fantasy Story3," If you're creating your own world, keep social classes and conventions in mind. This will make your world feel more realistic. Ask yourself important questions. Are there distinct class systems in this world? What are the common customs and rituals?


Many fantasy writers base social conventions on aspects from the real world. For example, most societies have rituals like birthdays, weddings, funerals, and holidays. Try to think of similar rituals for your own world. How do your characters celebrate growing older, for example? How do they mark death?Researching other cultures can be a great way to come up with ideas. Many fantasy writers borrow their ideas from older cultures or different cultures. Research rituals from ancient cultures or isolated cultures to help you gain ideas.

, A lot of conflict in fantasy stories is driven by divisions of class. In the Hunger Games, for example, the upper and lower class systems are very much divided, eventually resulting in a revolution. How is class divided in your world? Are there strict divisions between the rich and the poor?


Write down your social classes. For example, maybe your society exists in a caste system with seven different classes. Jot down all the classes.
Write down how customs and jobs differ between classes. For example, maybe people in the bottom class are hunter/gatherers while people in the top class are royalty and do not have to work.

, Supernatural elements are key to most fantasy stories. Maybe magic is an accepted part of your fantasy world. Maybe ghosts are real and can interact with humans. If you're incorporating the supernatural, you need to establish rules as to how elements of the supernatural work in your world.


Decide where supernatural elements originate. Do they come from gods or goddesses? Are magic powers simply a part of the natural world? Can you gain special powers through certain rituals?How do supernatural elements affect the story? If your character can talk to ghosts, for example, is her gift widely known or is it a secret? In your fantasy world, do mediums have a special place in society?, Fantasy stories often include advanced weaponry or supernatural objects. If you choose to incorporate such things into your own story, make sure you understand how such objects work. In Harry Potter, for example, the wand chooses the wizard. These are the kinds of rules you should establish if you want your story to feel credible.


If your characters fight using a particular style of weaponry, do some research. For example, if your main character is an archer, you'll need to know a bit about how archery works. Read up on archery so you know how to operate a bow and arrow. This will make your story feel realistic.If you have a supernatural object, know how it works. In Harry Potter, for example, the resurrection stone can raise the dead. You have to turn it in your hand 3 times while thinking of the deceased relative. If you have a supernatural object in your work, know how a character would use that object.

, When making rules for your fantasy world, be consistent. Audiences will get frustrated if rules are bendable based on the situation or conflict. Once you establish a rule, do not change it.


Pay attention to detail. If you're creating a fictional world, you may have a lot of new rules to follow. Write down any rules you establish as you write your story. This will prevent you from inadvertently breaking them later. If your character can only interact with his dead ancestors' spirits when a full moon is out, for example, you do not want to describe the ""looming crescent moon"" shining down on his late Aunt Cassie's face.Rules should not be broken to suit the storyline, even if this means a certain conflict or tragedy is unavoidable. For example, in the popular fantasy show Buffy the Vampire Slayer, characters can only bring someone back from the dead when that person died of supernatural causes. Therefore, when Tara is killed by a stray bullet, Willow is unable to save her. It's tragic, but it follows the rules set out by the show. This makes the program's fantasy world feel credible.

"
Create non-human creatures.,
Keep character motivation in mind.,
Decide on a hero.,
Consider a mentor.,
Make a memorable villain.",How to Write a Credible Fantasy Story4," If you want to make your fantasy world feel real, include some non-human characters. Part of the fun of a fantasy world is seeing mythical creatures come to life. However, make sure your creatures read as realistic.


You can use traditional mythical creatures, like vampires or mermaids. Just make sure to establish the rules for those creatures in your own story as variations of mythical creatures vary. In Twilight, for examples, vampires can choose not to eat people and sparkle in the daylight. In Buffy, however, the majority of vampires cannot control their tendency towards evil and will die if exposed to sunlight. If you write vampires into your story, how would they work?
Feel free to create your own creatures. However, be careful when doing so. Do not combine too many different types of mythical creatures or animals. Stick to a character with a few characteristics and powers. For example, a vampire-mermaid-unicorn that breathes fire, tells the future, and lives underwater may feel overwhelming. Instead, you could create a winged horse that can fly and also communicate with its owner telepathically., When writing fantasy characters, you can follow some basic storytelling conventions. All characters should have motivation.


Your characters should all have flaws or strengths that relate to their central motivation. Ask yourself what each character wants. For example, maybe a character named Ramona was abandon by her mother. All she wants is a family of her own. She tends to be overly jealous and clingy with her friends, a flaw, but one that's understandable given her abandonment issues.Make sure your character's actions are believable in the context of your story. For example, Ramona is from a hunter/gatherer class, but displays an ability to talk to the dead. She may have some special knowledge of ancient hunting techniques, learned from a long-deceased relative, that will help other characters out in a crisis., Almost all fantasy stories have a hero. One character with unique strength and determination helps move the plot forward. This character will fight the main antagonist and solve the central conflict. Decide on who your hero will be before you begin writing your story.


Usually, the hero does not realize he or she is special right away. Luke Skywalker does not realize he can use the force until meeting Obi Wan Kenobi. Harry Potter does not know he's a wizard until Hagrid informs him. Try to choose an otherwise ordinary character as your hero. Readers will more easily relate to a character who seems like a mostly normal person.Try to find ways to foreshadow the hero is important, however. This is usually achieved by telling the story from the hero's perspective. Returning to the above example, if Ramona is going to be the heroine of your story, try having her narrate or frame the story from her point of view., Many fantasy stories feature a mentor. As stated, Obi-Wan serves as a mentor for Luke Skywalker in Star Wars. Harry Potter has a variety of mentors, like Hagrid and Dumbledore, who help introduce him to the wizard world. A mentor can help your fantasy story run smoother.


Traditionally, the mentor is someone slightly older than your hero. The mentor generally knows the rules and conventions of the society your hero is navigating. The mentor has often known the whole time the hero is special or unique.Introducing a mentor is a great storytelling technique. It allows you to explain the conventions of your world in a manner that does not feel clunky or overly expositional. Think of how awkward Star Wars would be if Luke simply explained the force to the audience. Having Obi-Wan explain it allows the force to be explained smoothly. He's introducing the concept to Luke for the first time, as the audience is first introduced as well.

, A villain is an important element of a fantasy story. The hero should have a central antagonist to fight against as the story progresses. Spend some time developing a credible villain.


A villain's motivation should be clear. Many villains want power. However, wanting power for power's sake can feel dull. Think of Scar in Lion King. Yes, he wants to rule the kingdom, but he also feels inadequate when compared to his brother. Sibling rivalry drives his actions as much as a desire for control. Think of a deeper motivation for your villain.Try to be empathetic when writing your villain. Audiences will be more moved by your villain's plight if they feel they understand him or her. For example, give your villain a tragic backstory. This can help explain why he or she has turned to evil in the present.Create an interesting visual appearance for your villain. Try to aim for something sinister. Think of how scary descriptions of Voldemort were, given his slit-like eyes and nose. Think of your scariest nightmares and pull imagery from there.

Revise the birth announcement as needed.",How to Write Birth Announcements for a Newspaper," Decide on a newspaper that is most appropriate for your purposes and for your audience. Are there certain people you want to reach? Your local newspaper is always a good choice, but you may also want to pick one in your hometown.


Local newspaper. This is a good way to inform your friends, coworkers, and neighbors.
National newspaper. By using a national newspaper, you'll be able to share your announcements with friends and family who live around the country.
Newspaper in grandparents' hometown. This way the grandparents will be able to share the birth with their friends and others in the community.;
, It should tell you exactly what their procedures are for birth announcements. They might also give you helpful guidelines to follow and they should mention if they charge. Every newspaper will have slightly different procedures.


Some newspapers have forms to fill out.
Some newspapers have staff writers will write the announcement instead of you.
Others papers will ask you will let you craft your own.
Either way, you are going to need information from them, such as what you need to provide or the word limit if you write your own., Newspapers vary in terms of their online presence. There are a number of things you should consider:


Online announcements may or may not reach as many people as the print editions.
Online announcements may also be free as opposed to printed announcements.
Online announcements may give you the ability to include photos or more information., While some birth announcements are very simple, others can include extra details and language that make it stand apart from other announcements. This is your opportunity to consider what kind of announcement you want to create.


If you want a standard announcement.
If you want to be very creative.
If you want to wow and dazzle people who see the announcement.

, This information is the core of the birth announcement and will include everything someone will need to know to be well-informed about the birth of the baby. Make sure to include the following:


Parents' and grandparents' full names. You can choose to include middle names, initials, or not.
The baby’s full name.
The baby's birth date.
The baby's gender. You can choose to leave this out, but it might be helpful if the gender is not clear from the baby’s name.
The baby's weight and length. This is often included but not required., Often times, both parents and grandparents are named in the announcement. Depending on where the parents and grandparents live, and who is putting out the announcement, there are several different options.


If the grandparents are putting out the announcement and everyone lives in the same community, the grandparents can choose to either put their names first or the parents' names first.
Both sets of grandparents can also decide to cooperate on putting the announcement out, and include the names of both sets of grandparents.
If the parents are putting out the announcement and everyone lives in the same community, they can choose whose names to use.
If the parents are putting out the announcement and they live in a different community as the grandparents, they should use their own names.

, There is no real one way to do this, so it really depends on your preference, where people live, and who is putting out the announcement.


One set of grandparents: “Greg and Victoria Reese would like to announce the birth of their granddaughter Jolene Parton Reese.
Both sets of grandparents: ”Greg and Victoria Reese and Michael and Susan Smith would like to announce the birth of their grandson Horace Greeley Reese.
Only the parents. “Joe and Jess Reese would like to announce the birth of their daughter Jolene Parton Reese.

, Here is your opportunity to squeeze in the names of the parents or the grandparents depending on whose name came first.


If the grandparents' names came first, you can now use the parents name. For example: “Jolene, daughter of Joe and Jess Reese, was born on June 21, 2014.”
If the parents’ names came first, you can now use the grandparents' names. For example: “Jolene, the granddaughter of Greg and Victoria Reese and John and Martha Rose, was born on June 21, 2014.
Depending on circumstances, like if grandparents are deceased or are putting out their own announcement in their own community, you can leave out one set of grandparents.

, Include the baby’s size, and the hospital, if appropriate. Adding this information will give the reader more information about the baby and the setting of the birth. For example:


“Jolene was born at Baylor Hospital. She was 6 pounds, 8 ounces at birth, and 18 inches (45.7 cm) long.”
You can also use more flare in order to make the announcement ""pop."" For example “Jolene, full of joy and happiness, was born at Baylor Hospital. She was 6 pounds, and 8 ounces at birth.”
Feel free to exclude this information if you want.

, This will give the reader a better idea about your family, and will remind friends you've fallen out of touch with about your other children.


“Jolene has one four-year-old sister.”
""Jolene will join her four-year-old sister Sarah.”
""Jolene completes our happy family and joins her two sisters Sarah and Anna.”
Alternatively, you can say whether she is the first child or not: “Jolene is the Reese’s first child.”

, The photo will really bring your announcement to life and make it stand out. Some newspapers might charge extra to include it, though. So this depends on your budget. Make sure to include a high-contrast and clear photo that will show up well if printed in black and white., This information can be either informative or can simply add detail to your announcement. This information does not have to come at the end. You can sprinkle it in wherever. Just make sure there is good flow and keep the word count in mind.


The time and location of religious ceremonies.
A website address that features extra information or photos for family and friends.
Consider thanking the staff of the hospital or a specific nurse or doctor if anyone went out of their way.

, Even if you are writing a longer announcement, make sure you take out any extra words you don’t need. Your first draft will most likely be over the word count. So you’ll probably have to go back and trim some of the fat.

, Make sure to edit the announcement before turning it in. Check for typos and any extra words you don’t need. Have a friend or family member read it. Also, run it by your partner to make sure he or she approves.


Ensure that it meets the guidelines set by the paper before sending it in, including the word count.
If you’re not the parents, run it by them.
Don’t be afraid to move things around or to add or subtract if you don’t feel the announcement is right."

Contact those who may spread the release directly.",How to Write a Product Press Release," Write down all of the positive features associated with the product. Remove those features that are common in similar products you’re competing with for sales. This will leave you with the benefits of your product that give it a competitive sales edge versus comparable products.;
, One way to help determine which benefit is most significant is by identifying which feature is the most unique to your product. This is your unique selling point. When thinking about which benefit you will emphasize in your release, remember that you’re hoping to grab the reader’s or viewer’s attention.One sure way to grab your audience’s attention is by offering something they’ve never heard of before. Even better, shoot to convince them your product will improve their lives in some way.

, While conceptualizing how to package your unique selling point in the most appealing way, think about how your product will literally affect its users’ lives. You’ll want to share this vision with your audience, by including a reference to a solution or experience that your product offers.Your product’s unique selling point is largely objective, but there’s more to a good product press release than just saying: “Look, we added handlebars to a bicycle.”
In order for your product release to be the most appealing, you also have to clearly state, “Our bicycles are now easier and more safe to ride!”
Further, while your unique selling point emphasizes the reason your product is worth buying or investing in, the story about your product’s importance or appeal will emphasize why journalists, bloggers, and other media producers may want to write about your product or feature your release.

, Your product may be an extremely specific item with relevance to a very particular audience – such as industrial or commercial businesses that use products such as yours. In these cases, stick to the facts about your product’s objectively superior qualities.For instance, if you expect trade publications to be the media outlets most likely to carry your release, you’ll likely want to emphasize technical benefits associated with your product.

, Your headline needs to be one of the strongest statements in your release. Especially online, many people who will see your release may only read the headline. Accordingly, emphasize the main benefit of the product you’re releasing right out of the gate.For example: ""New cell phone comes with cord attached for easy charging"" or ""Popular line of coolers now feature sync-ability with multiple devices.""

, Fill your first paragraph with the most pertinent information regarding who will benefit from your product, and why it’s worth reading further. Essentially, convey the product's ""story"" here. Also include the launch date and any event information about the product’s release right up front, so interested parties immediately understand the relevant timeframe.Begin with a sentence that summarizes the content of the release, providing a clear idea of what the release contains.
For instance, ""SnowMonster Enterprises has released a new line of tailgate equipment that not only keep your beers cold for 7 days, but now also stream a SnowMonster-approved soundtrack directly to all bluetooth-capable devices within 7 miles.""

, Include support and evidence regarding the quality of your product in the body of the release. In particular, include prominent testimonials, numerical statistics, details of research that supports the value of your product, and excerpts from any case studies that have been done regarding your product’s use.In particular, include one or two brief, direct quotes from a stakeholder or a company executive that will provide journalists with a narrative to develop or a point to address further.
Try something like, ""SnowMonster's CEO has audaciously claimed that ""Fraternity parties will never be the same. We at SnowMonster have always provided you the best way to keep your cans cool. Now we've provided you the best way to blast featured radio singles and SnowMonster hype messages from every single speaker at the party, simultaneously. Phones with the SnowMonster phone case will play loudest, of course.""""

, Wrap up the body of your release’s text with details about how interested parties can learn more to acquire the product. Specific details regarding where further information may be found, and how one may go about purchasing the product in various capacities should be included here.At the very least, your concluding content should include your company name, any relevant website URLs, addresses, and email addresses, and a telephone number for inquires, sales, and other business concerns.

, Particularly if your company or a company your product is affiliated with is already well recognized, you’ll want to convey who is behind the product. Even if your company is brand new, of course, consistent exposure will lead to increased credibility of your brand, and this this will strengthen people’s assessment of your credibility.


If you have a company logo, include it at the top of your release.
As an example of a company profile: ""SnowMonster Enterprises is known for the most successful marketing campaign in the contemporary era. It sells coolers, t-shirts, and the most popular snap-back hat on the branded-wearables market.""

, There are several rather simple logistical concerns to ensure you’ve covered. The release should be under two pages, and under 500 words. Use a common, standard font, such as Times New Roman or Calibri. Your headline should be in larger, bolded text. Make sure the document you provide to media outlets has a white background and uses a 1 inch margin, is single-spaced, and has an empty line between paragraphs., A press release of any type is a professional document that will be treated with less seriousness if there are writing mistakes. Proofread your release, preferably more than once, to ensure it is free of spelling or grammar errors.One common slip to watch out for is the uses of words “I”, “we”, or “you.” These risk leading to grammatical inconsistencies, and their use may make your release come across as a bit too much like an infomercial.

, The higher the quality of any images of the product, the more likely they will be included, not to mention prominently featured in any third party’s publication of your release.If possible, include a video or link to a video in your release as well, as videos are an especially effective marketing tool online.

, If you’re hoping that your product press release will be picked up by third-party media outlets, make a point of contacting a few key outlets directly. Include something that they can offer their followers.For instance, include a special offer or opportunity that they may share with their followers.
Even better, offer to allow a particularly valuable publication opportunity to release the news of your product first. This alone will greatly strengthen the chances that a particular outlet will feature or expand upon your release.

Outline your story.,
Introduce the central problem.,
Develop the hero's story.,
Choose an appropriate ending.",How to Write a Credible Fantasy Story5," As fantasy stories can include a lot of twists and turns, outlining ahead of time can be helpful. Before writing your story, draft an outline.


You can create an outline with headings and subheadings. Headings are traditionally marked by roman numerals, while subheadings are marked by lower case letters or numbers. For example, something like, ""I. Introduce Ramona, a. Ramona is in the fields working, b. She is interrupted by the spirit of her Aunt Jean.""
Think of basic story structure. Your story should have a beginning, introducing the characters and the world. Then, there should be a turning point where your character's course of action much change. There should be rising action, building up to a climactic moment where the conflict is defeated. From there, the story should move towards a resolution.

, You should introduce the central problem early on in your story. This is a twist in the story where your main character is suddenly forced into action, setting them on the path to heroism. Katniss Everdeen volunteers as tribute for the Hunger Games. Buffy Summers realizes she has to accept her duty as slayer when her friends are attacked by vampires. An event should occur, early on, that provokes your hero to action.


If you include a mentor, it's often the mentor's arrival that marks the beginning of a story. For example, Harry Potter realize he's a wizard when Hagrid shows up at his aunt and uncle's cabin. Creatively introducing your character's mentor can serve as the turning point of your story.In many fantasy stories, the character leaving home is the turning point. Maybe your character needs to go on a journey. Ramona, for example, could receive news that her mother, who lives in another country, is ill. She has to travel across a desert, smuggling the medicine that's banned in mother's home across the border., Each event in the story should help develop your hero. Your hero's strengths, skills, and special talents should be tested by each event and conflict.


Pay attention to how this occurs in your favorite fantasy stories. What trials and tribulations does Harry Potter face that help him accept his destiny as the boy who lived? How does Katniss come to accept she has to lead the revolution?
A lot of mini-conflicts should lead up to the climax, each one testing your character's strength and helping her use her skills and powers. For example, Ramona has to deal with rival smugglers attempting to steal her medicine. She's able to outwit them with the help of a wayward ghost and then continues on her journey.Mini-conflicts should build up to a main climax. The character should face the villain and succeed or fail, using the skills he or she has developed in the process.

, Once your character has faced the climax of the story, choose an appropriate ending. How you choose to end a story depends on where you want to go next.


A fantasy story can have a happy or sad ending. You can end with the conflict ultimately unresolved or the hero losing. You can also end with a partial victory. Some evil has been defeated, but there are still unresolved conflicts. This can be particularly useful if you want to write a sequel. There will be challenges for your hero to face the next time around.
If you do not want to write a sequel, you can still have an unhappy ending. However, keep in mind audiences often crave victory in a fantasy story. An unhappy ending may not go over well.
Try to tie up emotional loose ends as well. A character should learn something on his or her journey. For example, Ramona may reconnect with her mother, some of her abandonment issues lessening. Audiences want to see characters grow emotionally during the progression of a story.

Find out what the deadlines are for each media outlet.",How to Write a Press Release (for School Students)," A press release should answer the following questions:


Who was / is involved?
What happened / will happen?
When did it / will it happen?
Where did it / will it happen?
How did it / will it happen? ('How?' is not always relevant.);
, Do this in one or two sentences of the first paragraph.

, This will be the material which reporters can use in an article.

, Also provide some brief background information about your group:


who you are;
what your objectives are; and
what you have already accomplished.

, So press releases are most effective when they announce something new, deal with something that is topical, or provide 'human interest' — personal stories that will get people’s attention.

, This is so that reporters can get in touch with you to find out more if they want to.

, Find out the name of the news editor, producer or specialized correspondents and gather contact information and other details. This will mean you can ‘issue’ your press release to the right people.

, Give reporters as much notice as you can, and then remind them the day before the event.

You will also find opinion pieces, like editorials and book or movie reviews in the pages of your school newspaper. But generally, you will be working on a news article or a feature article.News articles cover the basics of current events. They answer the five key questions: who, what, where, when, and why.
Feature articles are longer and more in depth than regular news articles. They cover one subject from multiple angles and written in a more creative format.
Both types require the same level of research and reporting. If you are writing a feature article, you may have more freedom with the structure of the article. However, news articles always follow the same “triangle” or five part structure.;
, A newspaper article is written in the form of an inverted triangle, with the most important or key information in the first paragraph (the wide part of the triangle), and then the least important information in the last paragraph (the narrow point of the triangle). A basic news article is made up of five parts:


The headline: Also referred to as the “hed”, this is a short, attention grabbing statement about the event. It will appear at the top of your article.
The byline: Tells the reader who wrote the article. If you wrote the article, your name will appear in the byline.
Lead paragraph: This first paragraph contains the who, what, when, where, and why in as few words as possible. You must find all the answers to these questions and place them in the opening 1-3 sentences of the article.
Explanation: The second-third paragraphs should include any other facts or details the reader should know. This is where the writer answers any other important questions the reader might have after reading the headline and the lead paragraph. This section can include direct quotes from witnesses or bystanders.
Additional information: The last paragraph contains the least important information. For example, information about a similar event or occurrence. Your editor may cut this paragraph down if the article is too long for the space it needs to fill in the newspaper.

, These abbreviations are important in the newspaper world. Most editors will ask you for the “dek” and “lede” of your article after you pitch the story to them.The “dek” is a blurb, usually one to two sentences, that tells the reader what the story is going to be about. It will appear under the “hed” or headline of the article. For example, an article about fiber might have the head: “YOU’RE FIBER-ED!” and the dek might be: “Ten Reasons To Eat More Fiber.”The “lede” is the introduction to the news article, usually in the first paragraph of the article. “Lede” is a deliberate misspelling of “lead” to prevent confusion in the days when printing was done with lead type.
The “lede” should answer the classic five W’s of journalism. What happened? Who did it? Where did it happen? When did it happen? Why did it happen?Some articles require a ""How"" as well, but this can often be covered by answering the others.

, Most news articles are written from an objective point of view, in the third person. Unlike opinion pieces, or editorials, news articles should not contain any “I” statements, such as “I believe” or “I think”. The main purpose of the article is to inform your readers of all the facts around a story or event. You should maintain a neutral tone throughout the article and cover all sides or perspectives on the story.However, most stories have a particular angle or “slant”. This means the story focuses on a particular aspect or element of the larger story. For example, a story about fireflies could focus on the endangerment of fireflies through the use of pesticides in the air. The “slant” is a valuable way to give the story a clear focus and unique take on an existing topic.Feature articles can use the “I”, or first person point of view. Recently, personal narrative style features, with the “I” and a personal story that colors or informs the news story, have been popular online., Now that you are familiar with the structure and terms of a basic news article, read several example articles to get up close and personal with how to write an article:


“Pandemic Level Increased”, a straightforward news article about swine flu.“Harry Potter Opens July 15”, a creatively written news article about the opening of the film Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.“Fireflies Count!”, an example of a feature article written from the first person point of view.“Pregnant at Harvard?”, an example of a feature article written in the style of a personal narrative for The Harvard Crimson, a university publication., Look for the headline, the byline, the lead paragraph, the explanation paragraph(s) and the additional information at the end of the articles.


For example, the headline for this article, “Pandemic Level Increased”, has the byline: Daniel Wetter.It also has a lead paragraph that begins with key information: “The swine flu outbreak became a phase 6 pandemic on June 11, declared the World Health Organization (WHO). Officially known as the H1N1 virus, the flu is being transmitted community-wide in both North America and Australia. A pandemic is an epidemic (disease outbreak) over a widespread geographical area.”
It then has a fairly long explanation section, with quotes from two doctors, or medical sources.
It ends with additional information, or an ending sentence that reinforces the main slant of the article: “Being health conscious and getting vaccinated will make you part of the solution.”

, The “hed” or headline should be pretty obvious by now. The “dek”, or blurb, usually 1-2 sentences, that tells the reader what the story is going to be about, will be underneath the “hed”.


For example, for the article “Harry Potter Opens July 15”, the “dek” is “Magic and mysteries in the air at Harry Potter’s New York premiere.”The “lede” of the article should answer the four W’s and the H of newspaper writing. The Harry Potter premiere article’s “lede” appears in the second paragraph. “At the premiere of the newest Harry Potter movie in New York City July 9, I stood along the red carpet watching as excited Potter fans crammed together behind metal barriers waiting for the stars to arrive. Some sported sorting hats, the signature round rimmed Potter glasses, and other mystical garments from the world of Hogwarts. Some held up signs. One read: “Honk if you love Harry.” And there was honking—and yelling and cheering and chanting. “Snape! Snape! Sirius! Snape!” It was magical!""
The “lede” in the article then extends into the third paragraph: “The crowd ignited with screams and cheers as the actors stepped out of their limos and onto West 54th Street in front of the Ziegfeld Theatre. There was so much excitement in the air you could taste it!”
This “lede” answers the who (Harry Potter fans, including the writer of the article), the what (Premiere of the Harry Potter movie), the where (Ziegfeld Theatre, New York City), the when (July 9), and the how (The premiere happened because the newest Harry Potter movie is out and Harry Potter fans are enthusiastic about the new film).

, Tone and point of view are important elements of a news article. Most news articles should maintain a neutral or objective tone. But they should also have a “slant” or particular focus in the article, while still discussing all sides of the story.


For example, the Harry Potter article is written in the first person, by a Harry Potter fan, so it will have a certain slant and point of view. The writer uses statements like: “It was magical!” and “There was so much excitement in the air you could taste it!”These statements are purely opinion based and serve to give the article some personal color and perspective.
In contrast, the swine flu article is written in the third person, with no use of the “I” or any personal statements from the writer. It presents the facts and details of the swine flu outbreak and how to prevent spreading the disease to others. It is a more standard news article in tone and voice.In The Harvard Crimson feature story, “Pregnant at Harvard?”, the writer examines her personal struggles with being pregnant at Harvard and uses many personal notes and moments to give the story a unique slant. These types of features are becoming more popular in publications and school newspapers, as they give a story a personal connection or voice., Journalism students often use writing prompts to generate story ideas. These can be prompts such as:“That Time I…”: Think of a life changing experience or moment in your life. It could be that time you almost drowned in your neighborhood swimming pool, that time you ate nothing but ramen noodles for 2 months, or that time you broke up with an abusive boyfriend. Then, consider how these personal experiences could translate to a story idea. For example, pool safety in residential pools, the health issues associated with a diet of ramen noodles, or the steps needed to get out of an abusive relationship.
“A Day in the Life”: Profile of a person of interest by following them around for a day. This could be someone with an interesting job at your school, a peer or student at your school who is working on a social or political project, or a teacher who is leading a unique class or approach to teaching. This could also involved your school’s star athletes, or athletes who overcame obstacles to be successful.
“Everyday school topics”: Think about your daily school routine and note anything interesting or unique you come across. This could be your morning commute, with gossip on the school bus that could lead to story ideas, your lunch meal, with its suspicious looking macaroni and cheese, or your classes, with a great teacher or an incompetent teacher. Look for possible issues you encounter during your school day, or conflicts that you might want to delve further into.

, Another good way to take a simple word or one-word idea and turn it into a story idea is to brainstorm possible angles. Choose a current issue, like gay marriage in America or gender identity, and do a brainstorm. Or choose an issue that is related directly to your school, like the school budget for next year or a new class.Write down the word or idea in the center of your paper.
Write down other related words or terms around the central idea. Don’t stop to evaluate the items or revise them. Don’t worry if the words or terms seem lame, and don’t cross out or ignore the idea.
Continue adding words or terms until you feel you have written down enough. Read over the terms and circle or highlight any terms that seem useful or that could lead to a possible angle or slant on the topic.

, Read through other news sources to see what other writers are talking about or discussing. Get back issues of your school’s newspaper and look at what previous articles have addressed before. Are there current topics that might respond to previous articles? Or is there a unique take only you might have on a controversial topic?For example, you may be going through a personal trauma that relates to a current topic like gender identity, abortion rights, same-sex marriage, or police brutality. Or you might know someone, like a family friend or relative, who might be able to offer a unique take on one of these topics. This person could act as a key source for your article.

, Often, if you are a staff writer for the newspaper or have signed up to be a contributing editor to the publication, your editor may assign you story ideas. Your editor may also assign you seasonal articles, like Christmas or Halloween themed stories, that will be in the seasonal issue of the newspaper.


Most editors will ask you what topics you are interested in writing about, or if you have a unique angle on a certain topic or issues before they assign story ideas. Maintain an open dialogue with your editor so she knows where your interests lie, and which story ideas might be the right fit for you.

, Once you determine your story idea, you should do some basic research to ensure the story is worth pitching to your editor. You also want to confirm someone else hasn’t already written the story, or from the same angle.


Do a basic google search of keywords of your topic. If you’re writing an article about teaching social justice in high school classes, for example, do a basic search of possible courses in your area, state, or country.
You should also make a list of potential sources you can contact and interview for the story.
If you have been assigned a story idea via your editor, you likely will not need to write a pitch letter for the story. But you will still need to do research before you write the article.

, One of the first things you should do is contact your potential sources and set up in person interviews. You can also conduct phone interviews or email interviews. But if possible, try to talk to your sources in person. Email interview answers tend to be stilted and awkward, as the interview subject is responding by typing, rather than talking.Contact the source via email or by phone. Give the person a brief summary of the article you are writing, the “lede”, and ask them what time works best for an interview. Try to give 45 minutes minimum for the interview, especially if they are a primary source. Confirm the meeting time with the source.
For a standard news article, you should have one to two sources minimum. Good sources include people with credentials that relate to your topic, such as a medical doctor or a specialist in your topic. Your sources should have strong knowledge about your topic, on a professional or personal level, and be willing to answer questions on tape.

, You should come to the interview with a list of at least 10 questions to ask the source, as well as two to three backup questions.Focus on open ended questions that will result in expansive answers, as opposed to a yes or no. Rather than start a question with “Do you think”, begin with “How do you think” or “In what ways does”.
Don’t be afraid to ask dumb questions, such as “How does that work?” or “What do you mean by that term or abbreviation?” This will be useful if you are interviewing experts in a specialized field or about a complex idea and need to simplify it for the general public.
Ask short questions and then follow up. Most interviewers make the mistake of sticking to the questions on their notepad, rather than having a more free flowing conversation with the source. Start with short, basic questions like “How did you get into teaching social justice at schools?” or “How do you balance athletics with school?” and then build off of the source’s answers. Split up long winded questions into shorter questions so that source does not get overwhelmed or confused by your questions.
Mix lighthearted questions with pointed questions. A good interview will generate quotes from your sources that address your topic and give your unique angle on the topic some weight. But avoid only asking pointed questions that might cause your source to shut down or clam up. Mix in lighthearted or fun questions so the source feels comfortable and relaxed during the interview.

, To get the most accurate quotes possible, use a small digital recorder. Place it on a flat surface and let the interview subject know you are recording the conversation before you turn it on.You can also download a recording app on your phone to record in person interviews or phone interviews.If you are doing a skype interview, you can use a recording app through skype.

, If you have already been assigned a story idea by your editor, you will not need to create or send her a pitch letter. But if you are proposing an original idea to the editor of your school newspaper, you will need to create a pitch letter. Keep the letter short and to the point. Follow this format:Address the letter to the editor of the newspaper, by title or by name. For example: “Dear Chronicle Editor in Chief” or “Dear Mrs. Jenna Smith”.
Create an engaging opening sentence. Avoid telling the editor you have a great story or that you, the writer, will blow their socks off. Lead with what is strong and interesting about your topic, as well as the unique angle you might have on the topic. For example: “The World Health Organization has recently declared swine flu a phase 6 pandemic. Yet there is very little knowledge of how to prevent the spread of this disease in the classroom.”
Body paragraph: Break down your article in more detail. Let the editor know if you plan to speak to certain sources. If you have any personal connection or experience with the topic, note this in the body of the letter. For example: “As a student at Roosevelt High, I think it’s essential that students are aware of what swine flu ir and how to prevent the spread of swine flu. In my article, I will talk to two medical professionals about the dangers of swine flu and prevention techniques. I plan to also look at how students can practice simple, everyday habits to prevent the spread of this disease. ”
Closing: Finish the letter by letting the editor know if you have done any initial research on the topic and if you have any other experience writing similar articles. For example: “Based on my initial research, swine flu is a major disease that is not nearly as understood by the general population, or by high school students, as much as it should be.” Provide links to clips, or examples of your writing, in other publications. Then, sign off the letter with “Best regards” or “Thank you for your time.”

, Once you submit your pitch letter, give your editor time to review it. Then, ask her if she has any suggestions on other sources or angles for your story. She may also give you a word limit for your story. Most news articles are short, 400-500 words long.

, You want to lead with a sentence that grabs the reader’s attention and intrigues them enough to keep reading. Start with the most important information first.For example: “The swine flu outbreak became a phase 6 pandemic on June 11, declared the World Health Organization (WHO).”or “I was like a seeker in the game of quidditch, but I wasn’t searching for the golden snitch...I was searching for the golden actors who star in the latest Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.”The first lead is factual, objective, and to the point. It tells the reader that there is a clear medical issue and gets them to pay attention to the outbreak.
The second lead is more personal and uses the first person. It draws the reader in by using familiar terms from the world of Harry Potter and unique language to keep the reader engaged.

, Don’t overuse adverbs or adjectives in your article. Keep the language simple and plain, with strong verbs and nouns. If a word or term is not essential to the story, don’t include it.Using plain language will build trust with your reader, especially if you are discussing a complex medical topic. It will also help your reader follow along with your writing.
Use sentences that are 25 words or fewer. Focus on plain English, rather than academic or technical jargon.

, Consider who you are writing the article for. If its for the general public, you should assume the reader has no prior knowledge of the topic. Imagine you are explaining the topic or issue to someone who has never heard of the topic. However, if you are writing about a current issue that the general public might be familiar with, such as the latest political scandal, or the big win at the football game on Friday, you can assume some prior knowledge of the events. Your article should then give the reader new information or more information on a major topic from yesterday’s news or the latest hot topics.If you are writing an article for a certain section of the newspaper, like the Arts and Culture section, you may be able to assume your reader will be familiar with certain mainstream artists or current cultural trends.
You may also be writing about a topic that is very familiar to most readers, such as Harry Potter. In this case, you could use terms or phrases that are known to avid readers of the topic, such as an article about a Harry Potter film.

, Strong verbs will make your article lively and interesting. Focus on using active verbs like “she stands”, “walks” “runs”, “spots her teammate”, “chats to her coach”. Passive verbs can sound dull and boring to readers.


In most cases, editors advocate for the use of the present tense, rather than the past, to give the article immediacy and an active voice. However, you can use the past tense in your article if your editor says otherwise.

, The reporting “voice” of the article should only contain facts. Any opinions or subjective descriptions should be attributed to a named source. Your article should be supported by quotes from at least two sources. Rather than tell you reader they should be concerned about swine flu, for example, use a quote from an expert to back up with claim.For example: "" ‘We need to be appropriately concerned,’ Dr. Trochet said. It cannot be ignored, but it can be prevented with easy measures, she stressed. Dr. Trochet and Dr. Tom Hopkins, the Chief Medical Correspondent on NBC's Sacramento Station, KCRA, talked recently to the Scholastic Kids Press Corps about swine flu concerns. They also discussed how to prevent getting or spreading the disease.”
Use “said” or “told me” when attributing a quote to a person, and only use the source’s last name or title and name.

, Make sure your article adheres to the five part structure of an article:


The headline, or the “hed”.
The byline.
The lead paragraph, or the “lede”. Should answer who, what, when, where, and why in as few words as possible.
Explanation paragraphs, including direct quotes from sources.
Additional information, last paragraph that contains the least important information.

, Look over the article for any spelling or grammatical errors. Ensure your article has a strong ""lede"" and follows the five part news article structure.


You should also format the article based on the publication you are writing for. If it is an online publication, ask the editor if there is any specific formatting you need to do, such as adding links in text.
Your school newspaper may also have a style guide with rules of certain phrases or terms in the articles they publish. Ask your editor for these guidelines and adjust your article accordingly.

"
"
Know a ""lead"" from a ""lede."",
Lead with your best stuff.,
Worry about the lead, not the conclusion.,
Provide the 5 ""W's"" and ""H."" A traditional lead attempts to answer most or all of the key questions -- Who?,
Keep it short.,
Focus on action.,
Break the rules when inspiration strikes.,
Consider the benefits of leads for all writing.",How to Write a News Story Lead," In fact, they are the exact same thing. The use of ""lede"" dates back to when newspaper publishers needed to differentiate between the term used for the beginning of a news story and the molten lead (the metal) used in the printing process., A news story lead is based on the premise that you need to save the best for first. It has to catch the reader's eye and succinctly provide the most important information about the article.


The phrase ""burying the lead"" (or ""lede"") refers to delaying or withholding the most vital information. For example, if a teenager tells his mother he cleared out some more space in the garage like she asked but fails to mention he did so by totaling the car, that's burying the lead.

, Unlike essays or books or most other forms of writing, news articles are written on the assumption that the reader may not finish the piece.


Newspaper readers often skim only the beginnings of stories, and editors often trim off the ends of stories before they ever go to press, so the focus is on the lead, not on building up to a fantastic conclusion.
News stories usually use what is called an inverted pyramid structure, where the weightiest, most substantial information is on the top, and the least substantial elements are at the bottom., What? When? Where? Why? and How?


For example: ""A faulty space heater caused a raging fire in the 400-block of Grant Street last night around 2 am, leaving two firefighters hurt and three families homeless.""

, While the exact numbers vary, journalism students are often taught to write first sentences of between 25 and 35 words, and not more than 40. This is considered just long enough to provide, in most cases, the vital details in a succinct manner.

, Readers are drawn in by active sentences that highlight the stakes, the conflict, or the impact of the event covered, propelling them forward into the story.


A form of sentence editing called the Paramedic Method involves identifying and eliminating redundancies and use of the passive voice in favor of sentences using simple verbs with the ""doer"" as the subject.As an example of the Paramedic Method, compare ""The highest office in the nation was granted once again to John Doe by the voters last night"" with ""Voters granted John Doe another turn in the nation's highest office last night.""

, A writer is more artist than scientist, so however hard and fast the rules may seem for leads, high-quality exceptions to the standard abound. Some variations include:


Asking a question -- ""Who could have guessed a single phone call two years ago would bring down the city's most famous banking family?""
Using an anecdote -- ""From Amy Smith's raucous nosebleed seat high above Ajax Field, the kick looked perfect; yet the barely-visible referee's arms refused to rise in agreement.""
The delayed lead, which can use questions, anecdotes, or other methods to draw readers in without immediately revealing details. This, however, tends to work better in longer features than ""hard news"" stories., What writer, from a high-schooler with a book report due to a grizzled novelist, cannot benefit from thinking about providing critical initial details in a concise and active manner that draws the reader into the work?

Determine you newspaper's niche.,
Choose a good name.,
Choose between a paper or online newspaper.,
Develop a news staff.",How to Write a Newspaper2," There are a lot of papers, blogs, and media outlets covering a lot of different topics, but thinking that you can immediately compete with the scope and content of The New York Times will lead to failure. Search for a topic or perspective that currently isn't being offered in your area and try to fill it. Small town news, events, and politics are frequently under-reported by major papers, and immediately appeal to everyone who lives in that town..
The more specific your niche the more you will stand out to potential readers, but if you think of something too specific you may alienate readers. For example, try writing about ""Central New York High School Sports"" instead of ""Tompkins Country Soccer.""
Do you have expertise in a certain industry that might appeal to a wider audience? For example, if you are knowledgeable about a nearby music scene your paper could interview bands and review new CDs to bring them to a larger audience.

, Your name should, in some way, illustrate to potential viewers what your paper is about. This can be easy if you are starting a small town reporter (The Lansing Sun, The Petaluma Dispatch-Herald), but is a little harder with niche papers. Find something succinct, but not limiting.


Try something that lets you write a lot of different types of articles. Instead of ""The Southside Chicago Beekeepers Chronicle,"" try something a little broader like ""Windy City Bees & Beekeepers.""
Always note the date and edition of the paper underneath the title.
Be sure to put your contact information or website near the title as well.

, While traditional newspapers are printed and distributed physically, you can often reach a wider audience and cut printing costs by publishing online. That said, some papers are more successful in print because they can be placed in strategic locations and promoted by local businesses.


Online newspapers tend to attract a diverse readership and can be easily marketed through social media and word of mouth. They are also cheaper and easier to manage on the fly, as you can respond to users and publish to new stories instantly. However, you will be competing with millions of other small papers for the same readers and online plagiarism is rampant. A great, interactive website can also get expensive.
Print newspapers are easier to charge money for, and many consumers still like the physical experience of reading. But the physical experience costs a lot more time, money, and energy to bring to the world, and other than ""letters to the editor"" you will get minimal feedback on your writing and who is reading it. While there is nothing stopping you from being both online and in print, you should choose one or the other when you're starting out.

, Whether in print or online, starting a newspaper is tough work for one person. Between writing, editing, designing, photographing, publishing, marketing, and accounting, there are a lot of different skills that go into creating a newspaper. While more and more jobs are needed as your paper grows, you must fill at least the following roles to get started:



Reporter: Writes stories, covers events, and pitches new ideas to the paper. Reporters are out in the field interviewing, collecting data, and researching the next big article to write, and produce all of your newspaper's content.

Editor: Helps the reporter hone the story into the right length, tone, and angle for the newspaper. Often they oversee several reporters in their section (business, sports, politics, etc.) and work as the middleman between the reporters and the editor-in-chief.

Editor-in-Chief: The head of newspaper, she/he has the final decision on whether or not a story gets printed, what stories go where, and the direction of the paper. In smaller papers they edit and critique stories while giving reporters guidance and advice.

Copy Editor: Proofreads articles before they are published, looking for grammatical, syntactical, or factual errors. Sometimes they do basic research for stories as well.

Photographer: Accompanies a reporter on stories to capture images that complement the article. Increasingly, web-based newspapers are requesting video and sound teams as well.

Graphic Designer: Responsible for the look and layout of your newspaper or website as well as creating graphs, tables, and illustrations for stories.
Sometimes these roles will overlap, and sometimes you will need multiple people covering the same job. Be flexible and recognize what your paper needs-- a newspaper about art, for example, might need an entire team of graphic designers to make a beautiful paper. "

Find a story that is unique, compelling, informative, or important to your audience.,
Do thorough research.,
Learn the five W's of news writing.,
Write a compelling lead line.,
Use the traditional ""inverted pyramid"" to tell the most important information first.,
Remain objective while you write.,
Proofread and double-check your facts.,
Choose one or more pictures that are representative of your story.",How to Write a Newspaper3," ""A dog biting a man is not news,"" states an old journalism cliché, ""but a man biting a dog is."" News stories need to have an impact on their readers by exposing something they didn't already know. As you are brainstorming, ask yourself if the story is relevant to your community, if there something unique or out-of-the-ordinary, or if it sheds light on a previously mysterious event or phenomenon.


A good reporter bears witness to a person, event, or trend that a reader could not see on their own.
The best news stories contain a little bit of everything by bringing a new and fresh perspective to the world. , No matter what your topic, readers turn to newspapers to learn something, and they have the assumption that what they are reading is true. If an article is inaccurate or false then it does not matter how good the writing is -- the article has failed. You can prevent this by researching fully before you write, using a variety of sources, and looking into any facts that feel fishy or incorrect.


Always take notes while you do research, and keep a log of your sources in case a story's veracity is questioned.
Never use only one source of information-- interview more than one person, consult more than one book, and dig as deep into the topic as you possibly can.
Ask your sources if they can recommend anyone else to talk to, or further events worth covering. , At minimum, a news article needs to cover five basic questions about your subject: Who, What, Where, When, & Why. While artfully told stories and poetic language make a story better, a newspaper article doesn't work if it cannot provide the reader with these basic facts. While some of these points may be less important than others depending on the story, they should all be covered at some point.


List these five words out on a sheet of paper and fill them in before you begin writing. If you're missing one, go back and find the answer.
Many articles need to go further by answering ""How?"" or ""So What?"" to fully explore the story. , The lead is the first sentence of a story, and it needs to both grab the reader and tell them exactly what the story is about. Short, punchy, and informative, the lead is the most important sentence in the article and is usually the hardest part of the story to write.


The lead line needs to contain the central idea of the story. If you're writing about a possible peace deal, don't write ""US and Iraq met yesterday to talk."" Say, ""Yesterday, American and Iraqi diplomats began peace-keeping negotiations for the first time in a decade."" , Your first paragraph should contain the most relevant information to the story so that anyone reading it knows more or less what happened. This is your pyramid's base. You then adds specific facts and ideas by expanding from the points made in the first paragraph. This allows readers to be informed no matter where they quit reading


While the opening paragraph does not need to contain all ""five W's,"" it should cover the most essential ones.
As you write ask yourself: ""if an editor cut my story after this paragraph, would it still feel complete?"" Space restrictions in print papers make this a very real possibility. , Being objective, or sticking to facts and figures instead of your opinions, is at the center of a writer's trustworthiness. People read the news to get information and they trust that it will not be biased. If you are a liberal who is assigned to write about the local Republican town meeting, for example, you do not want to insult or deride the politicians you are covering.


Research all viewpoints equally on controversial subjects. If you interview the lawyer defending a criminal, for example, you should interview the prosecutor as well, no matter what you think of the case.
If there is a conflict of interest, such as reporting a scandal at your parents' business, you should ask another reporter to cover the story.

, Nothing can derail a reporter's credibility faster than typos and incorrect facts. Make sure you've accurately quoted sources and that you've formatted your article correctly.


try to cut any words, sentences, or phrases that are unnecessary to the story. People appreciate brevity and want to get right to the facts.

, The best photo-journalism tells a version of the story all by itself. Since space is often limited in papers you need to pick the one or two photos that best represent your article so that anyone thumbing through has an idea what they'll be reading.


If you are publishing online you may have the ability to post as many pictures as you want. Still, you want the first picture a reader sees to be the best one you have.
Never stage a photo, steal a photo you found online, or photograph people without their permission. Use a consistent format for your newspaper. You can download free style guides for the most common newspaper formats, Associated Press and APA, online. No matter what style you choose (AP, APA, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc.) make sure every reporter sticks to the same style guide.
Have someone else check your article to insure that you didn't miss anything on your own.

Choose the most relevant or compelling stories for the front page.,
Craft attention-grabbing headlines.,
Create different sections to help the reader navigate.,
Find advertisers willing to pay for ads.,
Understand the basic principles of newspaper layout.",How to Write a Newspaper4," Just like the lead line draws people into your article, the front page story needs to draw people into your paper. Choose a story that is relevant, timely, or especially unique and make sure you have a quality picture accompanying it.


Think about what story will grab the most people's attention. It may be a dramatic sporting event, or a piece of breaking-news, but no matter what it needs to have wide appeal.

, Usually the editors, not the reporters, write headlines. The goal is to give the reader a brief, catchy hint at what the story is about without giving away the entire article. The best headlines are short and eye-catching and promises the reader new information, or force them to ask a question they want answered.


Use numbers whenever possible. They communicate a lot of information without a lot of space.
Use active language, interesting adjectives, and expressive verbs. Ex. ""Rouge Deer Smashes into Deli Window."" , This is crucial the bigger the paper gets. No matter how good your stories, some people only pick up a paper to read sports, or check out the opinion pages, or do the puzzles. Group similar articles together in a format that works for you, and remain consistent in every issue so your readers become comfortable.


Put a small table of contents on the first page or your homepage to help people search.
Order your paper so that your most compelling sections come near the front. , Whether online or in print, having paid advertisements is essential if you ever want to turn a profit on your newspaper -- subscriptions and sales are too small of a market to rely on completely. Once you determine how much space you want to devote to ads, ask friends and local businesses if they want to take out an ad, or if they know anyone who does.


Give potential buyers options at different price ranges: small, black and white ads are cheap, but full page color advertisements are going to cost a lot extra.
Many blogs and websites allow you to sign up for already designed advertising programs, where you get paid per advertisement clicked. Check your website host or use Google AdSense to find advertisers for free. , Once you've chosen your stories and ads, you need to decide where they all go. Also know as paste-up, laying out your newspaper is a full-time job requiring journalism, design, and computer skills. Today, desktop software such as Scribus (free), Serif PagePlus (cheap) or Adobe InDesign provides templates and tools to create any layout you can imagine. In general, newspaper layout has only a few hard and fast rules:


Remember, clarity before everything else. If it is difficult to read or find articles then you need a new design.
Edit, cut, or change stories to make them fit if you need.
Bold and center your headlines so they stand out.
Never use anything smaller than an 11-point font.
Use no more than two fonts to prevent confusion and clutter.
Be sure to set your computers to a CMYK color scheme instead of the default RGB, as ink printers refer to CMYK when printing.
Fill up any remaining space with ads, puzzles, comics, or miscellaneous stories. Look up some of your favorite designs, or research some award winning newspaper layouts for ideas if you're stuck.

Find your target audience.,
If you are going the physical route, find a printer that meets your needs.,
If you are going the web route, invest in a website.,
Continue producing content.",How to Write a Newspaper5," Now that you have some articles and a paper, you need to know who is most likely to read it. Search online for articles that are similar to yours and see who reads them, and talk to local businesses or vendors where other newspapers are distributed.


Take your audience's suggestions to heart and respond to their needs and wants when you can.

Build a social media platform by posting content regularly and searching for like-minded individuals who would be interested in your paper.
Don't be afraid to republish some of your early articles in other newspapers and news blogs -- just make sure they credit your original paper!

, Printing machines can be expensive and take up a lot of space, so if your paper is in low circulation you probably wait to buy your own. Call local print shops or other local papers to see how they print their newspapers, and be ready to spend some money.


Color ink will always be more expensive than a purely black and white paper.
Think about how many pages you want or can afford before collecting articles.
There are online newspaper printers that sell 300 newspapers for roughly $300, but they may not be your best deal if you can find a local printer who will set up a regular contract. , Many blogging platforms offer intuitive controls for designing a website to use, but if you are really serious about starting a news platform you need to invest in a custom built website. Until you have serious readership, however, consider a free site like Wordpress, Blogger, or Tumblr to get the ball rolling.


Consider buying the domain name for your paper, like www.TheWikiHowTimes.com, so that you look professional to readers and potential advertisers.

, No matter what your platform, you're going to need to keep writing articles and publishing pictures to keep readers coming back. Skipping a week's print edition or abandoning your blog for a few days tells people that you aren't serious about reporting the news and they will find other sources that post more frequently.


The more you produce, the more likely it is that someone will read it and be entertained. This means more viewers, referrals, and readers in the future. "

You may also focus on publications you know little about but would like to start contributing articles to. Read at least three to four recent issues of the publications, with a close eye on several aspects:Check if the bylines match the names on the masthead. If the names on the bylines do not match the masthead names, this may be an indication that the publication hires freelance writers to contribute to its issues.
Look for the names and contact information of editors for specific areas. If you’re interested in writing about pop culture, identify the name and contact information of the arts editor. If you’re more interested in writing about current events, look for the name and contact information of the managing editor or the features editor. You should avoid contacting the executive editor or the editor-in-chief as they are too high up the chain and you will likely not interact with them as a freelance writer.
Note recent topics or issues covered in the publication and the angle or spin on the topics. Does the publication seem to go for more controversial takes on a topic or a more objective approach? Does the publication seem open to experimentation in form and content or are they more traditional?
Look at the headlines used by the publication and how the articles begin. Note if the headlines are shocking or vague. Check if the articles start with a quote, a statistic, or an anecdote. This will give you a good sense of the writing style that gets published in that particular publication.
Note the types of sources quoted in the articles. Are they academic or more laymen? Are there many sources quoted, or many different types of sources quoted?
Pay attention to how writers wrap up their articles in the publication. Do they end on a poignant quote? An interesting image? Or do they have a bold, concluding thought?

, If you’ve had a good conversation about a trend, topic, or issue with a friend recently, think about how you may be able to take this conversation and turn it into a story idea. Maybe your friend was discussing a new trend on social media or how racism is a problem at her daughter’s school. Focus on conversations that were full of passion or strong emotion and that relate to a current issue or trend.These inspiring conversations do not need to be about global problems or about a large issue. Having conversations with your neighbors, your friends, and your peers can allow you to discuss local topics that could then turn into an article idea for a local magazine.

, If you are thinking of writing a magazine article for a local publication, you should look through local event listings for any events that may be newsworthy. This could be a local protest, restaurant openings, local plays, or local music festivals. Starting small with local publications before you branch out to national publications could help you get started as a magazine writer, especially if you are just starting your writing career.You should also look through your local newspaper for human interest stories that may have national relevance. You could then take the local story and pitch it to a magazine. You may come across a local story that feels incomplete or full of unanswered questions. This could then act as a story idea for a magazine article.

, You should have a good sense of what other writers are currently writing about or posting on social media. This way, you will not miss any current ideas or trends and may be able to put a different spin on an existing article.You can also set your Google alerts to notify you if key words on topics of interest appear online. If you have Twitter or Instagram, you can use the hashtag option to search trending topics or issues that you can turn into article ideas.

, Perhaps you are really interested in a topic that has been written to death in many different publications, but you can’t stop thinking about the topic. Look for a new angle on the topic so it feels fresh, relevant, and new. This will make your magazine article stand out to editors and engage your target audience.For example, rather than write about the psychological problems of social media on teenagers, which has been done many times in many different magazines, perhaps you can focus on a demographic that is not often discussed in relation to social media: seniors and the elderly. This will give you a fresh approach to the topic and ensure your article is not just regurgitating a familiar angle.

, One of the key elements of a good magazine article is good research. Take the time to locate good sources and read any necessary supplementary material to help you get a better sense of the article idea. Read through research material like articles, books, video, and social media posts. Good quotes from sources can often make or break your credibility as a writer and lead to a stronger article.Look for content written by experts in the field that relates to your article idea. If you are doing a magazine article on dying bee populations in California, for example, you should try to read texts written by at least two bee experts and/or a beekeeper who studies bee populations in California.
You should ensure any texts you use as part of your research are credible and accurate. Be wary of websites online that contain lots of advertisements or who are not affiliated with a professionally recognized association or field of study. Make sure you check if any of the claims made by an author have been disputed by other experts in the field or have been challenged by other experts. Try to present a well rounded approach to your research so you do not appear biased or slanted in you research.

, Think about individuals who may have interesting things to say about your topic and who can offer an expert opinion on your topic. You may also want to use consumers or clients as sources, depending on your topic. Do not be afraid to get on the phone and start calling people for interviews. Most people like to talk about themselves or about a topic they enjoy and are well versed in. You can also steal sources from other articles, as there is no rule against this if the sources are named in the article.You can also do an online search for individuals who may serve as good expert sources based in your area. If you need a legal source, you may ask other freelance writers who they use or ask for a contact at a police station or in the legal system.

, Once you get your sources to agree to sit down face to face for an interview, you will need to interview them with the aim of building trust and rapport but also getting good quotes you can use in the article. You can conduct the interviews over the phone or via video chat, but in person interviews are usually the most successful. Use a tape recorder and take notes during the interview, as recorders can fail.Prepare a list of questions before the interview. Research the source’s background and level of expertise. Be specific in your questions, as interviewees usually like to see that you have done previous research and are aware of the source’s background.
Ask open ended questions, avoid yes or no questions. For example, rather than asking, ""Did you witness the test trials of this drug?"" You can present an open ended question, ""What can you tell me about the test trials of this drug?"" Be an active listener and try to minimize the amount of talking you do during the interview. The interview should be about the subject, not about you.
Make sure you end the interview with the question: “Is there anything I haven’t asked you about this topic that I should know about?” You can also ask for referrals to other sources by asking, “Who disagrees with you on your stance on this issue?” and “Who else should I talk to about this issue?”
Don’t be afraid to contact the source with follow up questions as your research continues. As well, if you have any controversial or possibly offensive questions to ask the subject, save them for last.

, Most editors will require you to transcribe all interviews in full in a word processing document and have it available in the event a source needs to be confirmed or a quote needs to be checked. Your magazine article will be fact checked by the magazine's fact checking team before it is sent to print and the fact checkers may require your transcribed interviews as a way to confirm quotes and sources.The best way to transcribe your interviews is to sit down with headphones plugged into your tape recorder and set aside a few hours to type out the interviews. There is no short and quick way to transcribe, unless you decide to use a transcription service, which will charge you a fee for transcribing your interviews.

, Before you dive into writing the article, you should set aside some time to create an outline. Read over your research, including your interview notes. Highlight any good quotes from your sources and key pieces of information from your research. You can then lean on these to create the article outline.Your outline should include the main point or angle of the article in the introduction, followed by supporting points in the article body, and a restatement or further development of your main point or angle in your conclusion section.
The structure of your article will depend on the type of article you are writing. If you are writing an article on an interview with a noteworthy individual, your outline may be more straightforward and begin with the start of the interview and move to the end of the interview. But if you are writing an investigative report, you may start with the most relevant statements or statements that relate to recent news and work backward to the least relevant or more big picture statements.Keep in mind the word count of the article, as specified by your editor. You should keep the first draft within the word count or just above the word count so you do not lose track of your main point. Most editors will be clear about the required word count of the article and will expect you not to go over the word count, for example, 500 words for smaller articles and 2,000-3,000 words for a feature article. Most magazines prefer short and sweet over long and overly detailed, with a maximum of 12 pages, including graphics and images.You should also decide if you are going to include images or graphics in the article and where these graphics are going to come from. You may contribute your own photography or the publication may provide a photographer. If you are using graphics, you may need to have a graphic designer re create existing graphics or get permission to use the existing graphics.

, A strong magazine article will draw a reader in and hook them from the first line. In fact, the lead paragraph of your article is considered the most important paragraph in your entire article. You can generate a hook first line to engage and inspire your readers in several different ways:Use an interesting or surprising example: This could be a personal experience that relates to the article topic or a key moment in an interview with a source that relates to the article topic. For example, you may start an article on beekeeping in California by using a discussion you had with a source: ""Darryl Bernhardt never thought he would end up becoming the foremost expert on beekeeping in California.""
Try a provocative quotation: This could be from a source from your research that raises interesting questions or introduces your angle on the topic. For example, you may quote a source who has a surprising stance on bee populations: ""'Bees are more confused than ever,' Darryl Bernhart, the foremost expert in bees in California, tells me.""
Use a vivid anecdote: An anecdote is a short story that carries moral or symbolic weight. Think of an anecdote that might be a poetic or powerful way to open your article. For example, you may relate a short story about coming across abandoned bee hives in California with one of your sources, an expert in bee populations in California.
Come up with a thought provoking question: Think of a question that will get your reader thinking and engaged in your topic, or that may surprise them. For example, for an article on beekeeping you may start with the question: ""What if all the bees in California disappeared one day?""

, You should tailor the article’s language and tone to the target audience of the magazine and use the writing style of previously published articles in the publication as a guide. Make sure you weave in relevant and strong quotes from your sources, such as an expert source or a quote from another text.You want to avoid leaning too much on quotations to write the article for you. A good rule of thumb is to expand on a quotation once you use it and only use quotations when they feel necessary and impactful. The quotations should support the main angle of your article and back up any claims being made in the article.

, You should try to end your first draft with a concluding statement that leaves the reader satisfied but also curious about further developments on the topic. Go for an ending that leaves the reader asking, “what next?” and do not try to answer all the questions raised by your article topic. Instead, look for ways to wrap up the article in an interesting, open ended way.You may want to lean on a strong quote from a source that feels like it points to future developments relating to the topic or the ongoing nature of the topic. Ending the article on a quote may also give the article more credibility, as you are allowing your sources to provide context for the reader.

, Once you feel you have a solid first draft, you should contact the editor of the publication that has accepted your pitch and send her the draft. Ask her to give you feedback on specific sections of the article and to tell you if you are clearly defining the overall angle of the article.Having a conversation about the article with your editor can offer you a set of professional eyes who can make sure the article fits within the writing style of the publication and reaches its best possible draft. You should be open to editor feedback and work with your editor to improve the draft of the article.

, You may also want to give the article to a peer, such as a fellow writer, to get feedback from them as well, especially if you are struggling with a particular section or line in the article. Applying feedback from your editor and from your peers can help your article reach its strongest draft in terms of content, flow, structure, and tone.You should also get a copy of the publication’s style sheet or contributors guidelines and make sure the article follows these rules and guidelines. Your article should adhere to these guidelines to ensure it is ready for publication by your deadline.

, A good magazine article will flow well, with good transitions between paragraphs and good sentence structure. Try reading the article out loud to yourself or to a sympathetic audience. Note if any of the sentence structure sounds awkward or wordy. Be willing to removing or reworking large chunks of text so that the article flows and you have strong sentence structure throughout the article.

, Make sure you hit your deadline and turn in the article on time, especially if you are turning in your first article for the publication. If possible, turn the article in early to impress the editor and show you can meet deadlines for future articles for the publication.Most publications accept electronic submissions of articles. Talk with your editor to determine the best way to submit the revised article.

Find this information before you start your article to ensure that you do not end up wasting your time writing something that will not be accepted.Some magazines (both print and online) will not look at submissions from outsiders contributors. Check to see if your chosen publication accepts unsolicited submissions before you send anything. You may also need to pitch your story to the magazine first.;
, Reading other articles that have been featured by the magazine is a good way to see what the editors consider good writing.Read at least a few featured articles, if not a few issues of the magazine, to get a feel for what qualities your article will need to have.


For example, do the editors seem to feature articles that include wit and humor? Or do they favor pieces that incorporate lots of quotes from experts? What kinds of stories seem to get featured more often?

, Considering your audience is a crucial part of any writing project, and it is especially important to consider your audience for a magazine article. Take some time to consider who reads this magazine, why they read it, and how you can best meet the readers’ needs in your article.


You might ask yourself about how old your readers are, what they do for a living, what interests them, and what they are looking for when they read this magazine. You might determine that the readers are mostly women their 20s and 30s who are looking for information about fashion.
The way that you identify your audience will also have an effect on how you should present your information. For example, if you are writing about how to transition a summer wardrobe into fall, then what kinds of tips and suggestions would be the most helpful? What experts can you consult for helpful information? What would be the best way to organize the information?

, Identify topics that interest you and that would fit well within this magazine’s focus. A topic for a magazine article should not be too broad or too narrow. It should be something that you can provide adequate coverage for in the space that you are allotted.For example, a topic about “men” would be too broad, while a topic about how to introduce yourself to a man at a coffee shop might be too narrow. Something in between, such as how to break the ice with a guy you just met, would be a good topic to get you started.
Try making a list of things that you are interested in writing about. As you make your list, think about whether a not a topic is too broad or too narrow. Could you write a book about it? If so, then it is probably too broad. Could you write more than a paragraph about it? If not, then it is probably too narrow.

, A good magazine article often has a unique angle on a subject that goes beyond a basic version of that topic.Having an interesting angle is part of what will set your writing apart from other authors who stick to basic topics.


For example, your topic might be staying hydrated while exercising, but an interesting angle on that topic might be something like, ways that staying hydrated improves your exercise results, or how to make hydrating post-workout snacks.
Think about what questions readers might have about the topic. For example is there anything that readers might find hard about staying hydrated? Some readers might find it hard because they dislike water or because they don’t see why it matters so much. These are the kinds of questions that may help you to choose an angle.

, Next, you will need to conduct some research on your topic. Depending on the length of your article and your topic, you may need to consult some experts on your subject.For example, if you are writing about a new diet craze, then it would be good idea to include some quotes from a dietician. If you are writing about obsessive compulsive disorder, then your article should include advice and suggestions from a psychiatrist or therapist.
Think about what the most authoritative sources would be for your topic and make sure that you include information from these sources in your article.

, Before you write your magazine article, you may want to pitch it to an editor first. A good pitch letter will be short and to the point. It will describe the main character of your story and include some preliminary research.Try sending a pre-pitch email. A pre-pitch email can help you to gauge the editor’s interest level before you send the actual pitch. A pre-pitch letter might consist of a couple of sentences that introduce you and describe the idea you have. For example, you might write something like, “I have an idea for a story that I think might be a good fit for your publication…” Then, provide a brief (one to two sentence) description of your idea.

Keep your pitch to one page. If the editor seems interested, then you can send your full pitch. However, it is also important to keep your pitch on the short side. Try not to exceed one page for your pitch letter.

Include details the editor will want to know. Open with something interesting, such as an anecdote or shocking fact. Then provide a brief summary of the story you hope to tell. Next, explain why people will care about this story. Then, explain your plan for completing the story and close by reminding the editor why people will care about this story. You can also add a line or two that mentions other publications for which you have written.

Follow up a week or two after you send your pitch letter. If you have not heard back from the editor within a week or two of sending your pitch letter, then it is a good idea to follow up. Try sending an email to the effect of, “We spoke a couple of weeks ago about my story idea. Have you had a chance to think about it any more since we last spoke?”

, Outlining before you write is a great way to determine if you are covering everything you should in your article and it can also help to guide you as you write. This is important whether your article is short or long.You can create a basic tiered outline that lists the sub-topics you will cover, what information you will provide in each section, and the quotes that you will use in each section of your article.

, Starting off your article on an interesting note is a great way to hook your reader. You can lead your story with an interesting anecdote, a shocking fact or statistic, or a thought provoking question.For example, an article about a new diet might begin with a short anecdote about someone who was struggling with her weight and who lost a significant amount of weight on this plan. Or, it might start with a statistic about obesity related-illness.

, Unless you are an expert on the subject you are writing about, then do not claim to be an expert or include opinions.Instead, use your sources to guide your suggestions and support your claims.


For example, if you are writing an article about depression, then don’t make claims about how to treat depression unless they are supported by a trustworthy source, such as a psychiatrist. For an article about how to build table using old barn wood, you would either need to try it yourself to get some good perspective or consult a carpenter for advice that you can offer readers.

, The tone that you use for your article will depend on the topic, your audience’s expectations, and your goals for writing. For example, you would need to adopt a serious, respectful tone for a topic like suicide or cancer. However, if you were writing about a video game, then you might be able to adopt a slightly humorous tone.Keep in mind that the tone of your article will also depend on your angle and the audience to whom you are writing. For example, one angle for an article on a video game that has a cult following might be to provide serious players with advanced tips on how to level a character faster. For this article, you would need to approach your topic with some seriousness and reverence for the game. Readers might feel insulted if you adopt a sarcastic tone or if you mock some aspect of the game or those who play it.

, Your ending is as important as your introduction because it will be your reader’s last impression of the article. Your reader may decide that he or she likes the article more or less depending on the way that it ends. Some good ways to end an article include:Using an anecdote. Close with a little story about something related to your piece. This will build interest for your reader. Sometimes you can even find a way to connect this story to something you said in your lead, such as by setting up a conflict in your lead and then telling readers what happened at the end of your article.

Summarizing. You can summarize the content of the article in a way this not just repeating information you provided. Try saying what the main point of your article was in a slightly different way, such as by putting it into your own words or using analogy.

Inviting your reader to try it out. If you have written a DIY article or something that readers can reasonably try on their own, then you might conclude by inviting readers to try it out and put their own spin on it.

, One of the best ways to get some perspective on what you have written is to take a break from it. After you finish your article, take some time away from it. When you return to the article, it will be easier to identify ways that you can improve what you have written.Try going for a walk, calling up a friend, or watching a movie to get your mind off of the topic. A few hours will help to give you some perspective, but if possible, spend a day or two away from it.

, When you first come back to your article, try to focus on the content. Look for ways that you can make your article more informative and/or entertaining.


What additional details might improve the value of this article for your readers? How can you include this information?
Have you addressed everything that your audience might have questions/concerns about? If not, what can you add to address these questions/concerns?

, Having someone else read your work is also an effective way to determine if you need to add anything else or clarify something. Ask a friend to read your article and make notes in the margins on anything that was confusing or unclear.


If possible, have someone read your article who does not have any special knowledge of the subject. This will help you to determine if you have provided enough information for someone who has not done the research that you have will be able to understand.

, After you have done all that you can to ensure that the content of your article is as good as possible, you will need to proofread your article to ensure that it is polished. Proofreading involves checking for errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and other minor issues. This should be the last thing that you do before you submit your work.


Try reading your article backwards one sentence at a time to make it easier to catch these minor errors. Another effective method is to read your article out loud.As you do so, mark any errors that you catch with a pencil and then fix them in your word processor.
Don’t trust your spell checker to fix errors for you. Your spell checker may overlook words that are spelled correctly, but these might not be the word you meant to include. For example, if you type “fold” instead of “food,” then spell checker will not know to correct the word. This may result in a nonsensical sentence, such as, “It is important to eat some fold before you exercise.”

, In some cases, you may be required to format your article in a special way for the magazine. This may include using a special font, columns, or special spacing. Make sure that you read over any special formatting guidelines that the magazine requires writers to use. Apply these formatting changes to your document before you submit it.

Before you begin to write your romance novel, decide whether you will want to sell your book online or send it to a publisher to have a more likely chance of selling it in stores.

,
If you choose to send to a publisher, get a literary agent, they will pitch the book to the publisher.,
Think up characters, especially two main characters, the main two people in the novel.,
Pick their ages.,
Decide on the setting.,
Think of events that really make your story a romance.,
Write believable dialogue.,
Start writing/typing your book.,
End the novel well.,
Use proper grammar, spelling and punctuation.,
Have your friends check your novel.",How to Write Romance Novels,", Gather the contact information of the agent you've in mind. Keep this in a safe spot so you don't have to go search for this stuff again. If you are going to sell your book online, go through the motions of publishing a book. Don't publish anything, though, just follow the guidelines strictly.

, Think of past events in their life, and maybe that could affect them. What are their weaknesses and strengths? Have they had past loves? Get to know your character.


Characters are a huge part of a romance novel. For the leads to seem ""realistic"" (if that's what you're going for), you must give them flaws. Nobody is perfect, so why make your characters perfect? (However, making them seem perfect to one another is perfectly fine, as long as they have their flaws underneath it all.)
Don't have your main characters obsessed with only one thing or one person. The reader should be able to get to know them beyond their romantic interests.

, Depending on the group of people you're writing this romance for, pick the ages of your characters. You'll want your romance novel to be relatable, so writing an adult romance novel centered on fifteen-year-olds won't be a huge hit. Vice versa, if you're writing a teen romance, try not to make them forty-something, or even thirty-something, as these are the ages of the parents of the kids who will be reading your romance. Tweens and teens devour more romance novels, so it would be best if your characters ranged from about 18 to 24. Direct the ages of your characters to the age group of people you want to read your romance.

, If it's in the future, it probably won't look like the world today. If you're writing paranormal romance, try making up your own world. Base it on what sub genre your romance is on. You don't have to get super specific if you don't want to, but your readers will have an easier time visualizing the story if they can picture the setting. In addition, the setting can help build your characters—if it's always sunny, maybe one longs to live in a place where it rains one day etc.

, Include events that have to do with romance, like dates and heart breaks. Think of interesting ideas, not the same ones that other stories have used. Maybe one of the character's ex is jealous of the relationship, and is trying to get back together with them, or the parents might not approve and select a different partner for the character. Don't forget to use other characters in your book too, like exes, parents, (if it's about teenagers), and friends.


Don't always make these events a ""picnic in the park with butterflies everywhere"" or like a ""marriage, divorce, date, marriage, divorce, date, cheat, break-up."" You want your romance novel to stand out from the rest.
Give the couple their share of trouble along the way. The whole ""boy-meets-girl-and-they-fall-in-love-and-live-happily-ever-after"" thing is kind of a mainstream idea. Make it interesting, for example, "" boy-meets-girl-and-they-hate-each-other-until-boy-sees-girl-getting-drunk-and crazy-at-a-party-and-takes-her-on-a-pity-date-and-she-finds-out-about-the-pity-part"" Yes, it's a long scenario, but it's much more complex. Depending on what kind of romance you're writing, create different problems for your characters, such as she's a ghost, he's 10 years older than her and her family doesn't approve, she's disabled, he's from the future.

, ""Um...I'm Charlotte. Do I know you?"" sounds believable. Feel free to give them cheesy dialogue like, ""You have the most amazing eyes."" However, don't fill up the entire novel with cheesy compliments. A good romance novel usually has a balance of realistic and mushy lines. Also, remember that romances need to be passionate. Give them emotions!


Include descriptive words. ""Nice"" or ""Cool"" sound unprofessional and tend to deter readers. Other dull and overused words include 'good', 'great', and 'amazing'. Look for more interesting synonyms for these words, such as 'exceptional', 'pleasing', or 'satisfactory'.

, Think of a hooked beginning, like one of your characters flirting with another person they like, or if it is paranormal, it could start at a magical place. You don't have to stick with the outline, but you should follow it. Also, think of a good ending. Most endings are the two characters living happily ever after, but why not try something different? The ending will be remembered, so you should make it really good!

, You can write an amazing romance novel, but if your ending is not satisfactory, it will just be remembered as 'okay' or 'I liked it, but the ending was bad'. Don't rush the ending because you're sick of plodding through chapter after chapter. It's best to end the novel with the guy and girl getting together. This will make the readers really happy, because they want the guy and the girl to be together! However, don't feel like you have to end the novel with the two main characters living happily ever after. Look at Romeo and Juliet.

, No one desires to read something that is as poorly worded and proofread as, ""and Sarah, like, just went to the bathroom n never came back again ever and everyone was real sad. THE END, thanks for readin my book, her'es my e-mail, tell all ur friends bout it, BYE!!!"" It's likely no-one will buy it. If you are sending it to a literary agent, they WILL keep having an editor change your novel until you stop making mistakes/errors. When you have to edit something, don't change the story! The agent would've rejected it if it was really a bad story, so if they haven't rejected it so far, don't change a thing! (Besides mistakes the editor wants you to fix.)

, Ask for critique, otherwise you won't get any better. If they honestly like it, have the story published! Or, if you don't want to, put it on the backseat for a while and then you can read it for your own entertainment.

Use traditional business-letter format.,
Choose a common, readable font.,
Read the publication's submission guidelines.,
Create a universal header.,
Include your name and contact information.,
Address your letter to a specific person and greet them appropriately.,
Research the publication you're querying.,
Open with an attention-grabbing summary.,
Provide further information about your article.,
Include information about yourself.,
Provide an estimated word count and delivery date.,
Thank the editor for their time.,
Edit and proofread carefully.,
Finalize your letter.,
Mail your proposal to the magazine.,
Wait for a response.",How to Write a Magazine Proposal," Magazine editors typically expect query letters to be formal business letters. The word processing application you use to draft your letter typically will have a template you can use.The template should provide for one-inch margins on all sides of the page.
Text should be single-spaced, with a double space between paragraphs. Do not indent your paragraphs. This is known as the ""block paragraph"" format, and is generally easier to read.
Your text should be left-justified, or right-justified if you are writing in a language that is read from right to left.
Try to keep your overall letter to one page. Keep in mind that many editors read hundreds (if not thousands) of queries each week. You don't want to monopolize their time.;
, A magazine proposal is not the place to get creative with your font choices. Generally, you should just use your word processing application's default font, unless the magazine's submission guidelines specify otherwise.While the submission guidelines may not indicate preference for a particular font, they may state whether to use a serif or sans-serif font. Times New Roman is a good example of a serif font, while Helvetica and Arial are sans-serif fonts.
If you can identify the font the magazine uses and use that in your letter, it can be a nice touch.
For readability, your text ideally should be 12-point size. If your letter is on the longish side, you may want to decrease the font size so it'll fit on one page, but don't go smaller than 10-point.

, You typically will find information about a magazine's submission guidelines somewhere within the first few pages of the magazine (look on the page with other publication information) or on the magazine's website.If the magazine's technical specifications regarding format differ from those on your template, make sure you adjust them to meet the magazine's specifications.
Most magazines publish submission guidelines in several places, so it shouldn't be difficult to find. However, if you are unable to find specific submission guidelines, call or email using the contact information provided and ask for them. Don't simply send your query cold – you may not receive any response.
While some aspects of submission guidelines may seem overly nit-picky to you, part of the purpose is to demonstrate that you are capable of following instructions. As you read through the guidelines, give the editors the benefit of the doubt that they have a legitimate reason for every requirement, regardless of how irrelevant or unimportant it seems to you.

, If you plan to submit multiple queries, either of this article or of several different articles, taking the time to format your own letterhead will save you time and make your letter look more professional.Most word processing applications have various templates you can use to create your own letterhead. Once you've made it once, you can use it for every query letter you write.
Your header should reflect your personal brand and reputation as a writer, so think about your background and the types of articles you want to write.
For example, if you are a parent and most of your articles are personal essays and informative articles about parenting, you probably could get away with cute graphics in your header that implicated children. However, if you are writing more serious medical or legal articles about child rearing, you would want the style of your header to reflect an appropriate degree of professionalism.

, If you've chosen not to create letterhead, the traditional spot in a business letter to provide your own name, address, and other contact information is the top right-hand corner of the page.If you're using a business-letter template, it may already have this block formatted for you. Otherwise, simply type the information, hitting return after each line. Then highlight the entire block and change the formatting for the selected text to right-justified.

, Below your own contact information, double-space and then type the name and professional title of the person to whom you're writing, along with the mailing address of the publication.A magazine proposal should always be addressed to a specific editor by name. If the submission guidelines don't provide the name of the person to whom you should send your query, you'll have to do a little research to find out who they are. But if you're unable to do the work required to find this out, whoever reads your letter will probably gather from this that you also are unable to complete the necessary research to write a quality article for their magazine.
Use a formal greeting for this person, opening your letter with ""Dear Ms. (or Mr.) Editor."" Don't assume the person's gender. You may have to do some research to find out their gender identity, but making an assumption based on their name can set you up for an instant rejection if you're wrong.
If the editor identifies as female, don't use titles such as ""Mrs."" or ""Miss,"" which assume their marital status, unless you have specific information that they prefer one of those titles.

, If you want a magazine to publish your writing, you must be able to tell the editor how your article will fit in with the rest of their content and appeal to their target audience. This requires reading the publication extensively.The more familiar you are with the publication, the better you'll be able to write your article in a similar style to other pieces they publish. If this seems like a lot of work to you, keep in mind that sending a proposal to a magazine that publishes articles similar to yours will greatly increase your chances of publication.
Another reason to read the magazine is to make sure they haven't published an article previously that was too similar to yours – on the same topic, or taking the same angle. For example, you may have an article based on an interview with a local elementary school teacher who runs a toy drive for needy children on their birthdays. However, if you pitch your article to a magazine that has already run a story about the same teacher, not only will they not publish your story, but you'll acquire a bad reputation with that editor.
Many areas have several magazines that cover the same subject matter, but for specific niche audiences. For example, there are many women's fashion magazines, but each target women of a particular age and socio-economic status. Some focus on young mothers, while others may focus on young professionals or teenagers. While there may be some overlap, you'll stand your best chances of getting your proposal approved if your article appeals to that magazine's core audience.
If you're merely sending blanket queries to every publication within a specific niche, the editors will see this. Your query letter should be targeted specifically to each editor (if you send more than one) and address each publication.

, The first paragraph of your query letter should make the editor want to read your article and learn more about the subject you've proposed. Explain what is unique about your article, or about your angle of approach to your topic.If there have been other articles written on your topic – especially in the magazine you're querying – mention them up front. This can be an effective way to get the editor's attention. If they've already assigned several stories about something, it's clear they're interested in it. If you have a unique perspective or an angle they haven't considered, chances are they'll be highly interested in your article.
It can take time and effort to develop a good ""hook"" that will really grab the editor. Although it may come to you immediately, you should expect to go through several drafts. This is a part of your query that you may want to read back to friends or family and get their opinion on it.
There are some hooks or angles that you should avoid in your opening paragraph. If this would be your first publication, don't lead with that fact – the editor may not read any further. You also shouldn't start with a throat-clearing phrase such as ""my article is about."" Just go right into it.
While it is appropriate in other contexts to begin your letter by introducing yourself, that isn't the best way to begin a query letter. The purpose of your letter is to sell your article – not to sell yourself.

, Use the second paragraph of your magazine proposal to let the editor know anything else about your article that might impact the editor's decision to publish it.Identify the audience of the article and explain why you think your article would appeal to them. Make sure this audience is one the magazine targets (you'll know this from your research).
For example, suppose you've written an article for female college freshmen looking to create a stylish wardrobe on a limited budget. You might send magazine proposals to women's fashion magazines that are geared towards teenagers. If you send a proposal to a magazine that focuses on women in their early 20s, that audience is likely too old for your article. But high schoolers would be interested in planning ahead, especially if they were imminently starting college.
This is also a place to go into your process, if it's relevant to the final article. Explain how you came up with the idea, or the people you've interviewed to get information.
While this may be the longest paragraph in your proposal, it still shouldn't be more than four or five sentences. Be concise. If the editor wants to see more, they'll let you know. The point of a query letter is that you give them enough information to make a decision as to whether they want to read your article.

, Provided the editor is interested in your article, they also want to know why you are the ideal person to write it. Use the third paragraph of your query letter to tell the editor about any personal or professional experience you have that relates to the topic of your article.For example, if you have a college degree or job experience that provides you with particular expertise regarding the topic of your article, you should mention this. If it's not immediately obvious, you'll want to include a sentence explaining why the educational or work experience you have is related to your article.
Particularly with personal essays, you'll also want to relate personal experience that makes you uniquely suited to write this article. The experience or traits you tell the editor about should be things that make your particular point of view compelling, or apart from the traditional narrative concerning the topic your article addresses.
If you've had articles published elsewhere, particularly if they touch on similar topics, this is the place to mention those. Note whether you've included clips along with your article.

, Refer to the magazine's submission guidelines to find out what their maximum word count is, and whether they have an estimated timeline for publication.Do not propose an article that goes beyond the magazine's established maximum word count. If your article is longer than it should be, it's your job to trim it to meet the magazine's specifications – not theirs. An article that's too long isn't doing the editor any favors. It can be just as difficult to cut an article down as it is to add to it.
If you've already finished the article, you can simply state ""A first draft is available immediately upon your request."" Keep in mind that the editor may suggest changes or additional research before your article is ready for publication.
If you plan to query multiple publications at the same time, simply say ""I am making simultaneous queries."" You don't have to include information about the publications you've also queried – if the editor is curious, they may ask you when they follow up on your query.

, Editors are busy people, and have to sift through hundreds of queries. Show that you appreciate them and their work, and they'll typically treat you with equal respect. Include a single sentence as a separate paragraph, or at the end of your final paragraph.Avoid saying ""thank you for your consideration."" It sends a subtle sign that you don't expect the editor to accept your piece. You don't want them to merely consider your article – you want them to publish it.
Simply thank them for their time, and tell them you look forward to hearing from them.
Close your letter with a formal and professional closing such as ""Sincerely yours,"" with space for your signature. Type your name under that space, then include your preferred method of communication (typically your phone number or email address) below your name.

, A magazine editor has a sharp eye for grammar and punctuation. A single typo in a one-page query letter can destroy your chances of getting published. The editor will assume you are careless, and that your article writing is equally careless.One good way to proofread is to start at the end of your letter and move backwards. When you read backwards, errors will jump out at you that your eyes would have skimmed right over otherwise.
You also should read your letter out loud. This will not only help you identify typos or grammatical errors, but can help you find sentences or passages that don't flow well or lack the transitions necessary to enable one part to move smoothly into the next. If you find yourself stumbling as you read, figure out a way to rewrite that passage so it's easier to read.
You may want someone else to read over your letter as well. A pair of fresh eyes may be able to catch errors or identify trouble spots that you didn't see before.

, When you've thoroughly edited your letter and are confident that it's as strong as it can be, you're ready to print it out and sign it so you can send it to the editor. Use thick, quality paper to print your letter.You can get bond paper at a stationery or office supply store. You may see many different colors, but don't use anything other than white or perhaps ivory.
Print your letter using black ink. It's okay if you have a letterhead that uses some color, but generally you want to keep color to a minimum.
Sign your letter using blue or blank ink. Make at least one copy of your signed letter for your records before you mail it.

, Many publications still expect you to mail magazine proposals rather than sending them using email. Even if the publication accepts proposals through email, editors typically take a mailed proposal more seriously.If the publication has asked for clips, or additional information to be submitted along with your letter, make sure you've included everything listed in the publication's submission guidelines.
You may not have everything asked for in the submission guidelines. For example, the publication may ask for three previously published clips, but you don't have any as this article would be your first publication. In that case, include a brief sentence explaining this at the end of your query letter.
Avoid sending a full copy of your article, even if you already have it written. Wait until you have word from the editor that they plan to publish your piece. While you do have intellectual property rights in your article from the moment you create it, those rights are extremely difficult to enforce should a less-ethical editor decide to steal your content.
Use a regular, letter-sized envelope with your letter folded into thirds, unless your letter and enclosures are more than three or four pages. Then you should use a larger manilla envelope so the pages can remain flat.

, Most magazines provide an estimated response time in their submission guidelines. Add at least two weeks to that time, measured from the date you mailed your proposal, and do not contact the editor before that date.If no response time is provided, wait at least six weeks before following up on your magazine proposal.
When you follow up, send a polite, formal letter inquiring as to the status of your proposal. This needn't be more than a couple of sentences. Include a copy of your original letter, so the editor doesn't have to go hunting for it.
For example, you might write ""On September 1, 2016, I sent the attached query letter regarding my article about college freshmen trying to create a stylish wardrobe on a budget. It is January 1, 2017, and I have yet to receive a response. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience so I can shop this article to other publications. Thank you.""
If you don't hear anything within a couple of weeks of sending that letter, you might consider a polite phone call – especially if you're determined to get your article in that particular magazine. Otherwise, you should simply write it off and feel free to query other magazines until you find the right home for your story. However, you might want to send another letter withdrawing your article from consideration.
If you've sent queries to several magazines and one has expressed interest, you don't have to wait until the end of the response time to contact the other magazines. Call or email the editor and let them know that someone else has expressed interest in the piece and that you are withdrawing it from their consideration.

Decide what kind of mystery you'll be writing.,
Start roughing out your cast of characters.,
Begin to rough out a plot, if you want, base it around your characters.,
Plant some clues!,
Write a FD, aka First Draft.,
Go back and edit.,
Send it to be published.",How to Write Mystery Novels," This means think about whether this is a ghost story or a crime novel, a creepy haunted house or a murder scene. This is going to be the biggest decision to make for the duration of your novel.;
, These characters are the meat and potatoes of your novel. You will need a protagonist, an antagonist, sub-characters, and a background for each one! How many details you include will depend on how many times that character appears in the story. If the guy behind the grocery store counter is only noticed once, don't detail him out too much. Give a description and maybe a name. But if he's your main character, include details right down to if they drink coffee and when! A good template to use is:


Name, Age, Height, Weight, Role in Story, Eye color, Hair color, Skin tone, Habits, Identifying feature, Past, Present, Future, and Theme Song.

, Or, base your characters around your plot. A strong plot has a beginning, middle, and end. The beginning should be an introduction to future events and the life of your character. The middle should be the problem your character must face and should include a high point where an important decision must be made (or a climax), and the end should be a cool down that wraps up loose ends and leaves readers hungry for your next great work!


If you get stuck on finding a plot, read some of your favorite mystery novels to get ideas. Also, keep your eyes and ears open for new ideas and topics to write about.
Use a system of ten scenes to map out your plot. Write each scene separately and connect them with pages in between. Scene one should be an opening scene. Two through four should be complications, and five should be point of no return complication. Six through ten should be solutions and wrap ups.

, Whether you're writing crime or ghost stories, you need clues as to what is actually happening. in crime novels, they should be very subtle, like a cigarette butt at the crime scene, or a misplaced item that can't easily be moved. In a ghost story, they should be shocking, like the sudden disappearance of a person in the dark or a ghostly hand on one's shoulder. Read some real life accounts of crime scenes to find out what the little things are that give people away.

, It doesn't have to be perfect, it has to be the bones of your story. You can go back and add some flesh and skin later but for now, let's focus on the bones! Let the writing come easily, don't filter it. Just start writing your ideas down.

, Look over your work and rewrite, and rewrite, and rewrite until your head hurts and your wrist cramps up at least twice! Make it the best you can make it, and be prepared for the next step, publishing.

, Be prepared for a no! Not everyone gets their first mystery novel published! It takes time and effort. Try again and after four ""No"" responses, make some changes and try again.

While opinion-oriented news sources are usually entertaining, they may slant the stories in ways which are not obviously apparent. Therefore, it’s important to find a few trusted traditional news sources to watch or read regularly.While this is by no means a complete list, a few reliable and comprehensive traditional news sources include the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), Al-Jazeera, National Public Radio (NPR), and the New York Times.;
, A Google Alert is a customized notification service allowing you to set an alert with Google for any topic. When that topic is mentioned on the web, you’ll receive a notification from Google letting you know. Google allows up to 1,000 topics per email address, so you can set alerts for a wide range of subjects.To use Google Alerts, simply go to https://www.google.com/alerts/ and enter the search terms you want to keep track of. Choose the types of news sources you wish to receive, the frequency at which you wish to receive alerts, and the email address you wish the alerts sent to.
For example, you may wish to set up Google Alerts for a specific area, such as Washington, D.C., or a specific subject, like tornadoes. You can also set alerts for a specific person, like the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

, News aggregators pull stories about similar subjects from different news sources and group them together in an email list or feed for your consumption. News aggregators are great tools ways to stay abreast of news and current events because they sample from a wide variety of sources and put all of the stories in one place, saving you the hassle.For example, if you are interested in the topic of white collar crime, a news aggregator will search numerous news sources, picking out articles about white collar crime and arranging them in an easily digestible format.
Some of the most popular news aggregators are Flipboard, Taptu, Pulse, and Google Current. Most have a free mobile app and can be used right from your phone, so try a few out and see which ones work for you.

, Partisan, opinion-based, and topical news sources all have their place on a well-informed citizen’s reading list. While one shouldn’t rely on them exclusively, they play an important part in learning how to distinguish false equivalencies, an unintentional pitfall of objectivity.Examples of reputable opinion-based news sources include Vox, Slate, National Review, Reason, and Jacobin.

, Although almost all news sources tackle political events to an extent, sources that cover politics and nothing else are among the best for detail and analysis.


Some good sources to turn to are RealClearPolitics, Politico, Politics1, and OpenSecrets.

, Local papers are the most trusted news source for news about local crime, social events, schools, and local government. They also cover a much broader topical area than other local news sources.Local newspapers are some of the only sources available for in-depth coverage of local politics, and local newspapers often initiate investigative reports that other types of media explore in greater depth.

, While local newspapers cover a wide variety of newsworthy local events, local television covers fewer events in greater depth and with more exposure. Local broadcast television stations comprise the largest portion of the local media market in most cities, and are the most trusted sources of information for local political races., FM radio is usually the best source of information on local traffic conditions. Radio stations get news of accidents, collisions, and road closures from police scanners, so their information up to date. Public radio is also great for morning news reports, talk shows, investigative reporting, and specialty news programming.Not only is the traffic information current, it is also delivered in a format where it is most likely to be useful—in your car.
For a listing of radio stations in your area, sorted by genre and subject matter, check out http://radio-locator.com/


, “Liking” your local media outlets and governmental agencies on Facebook, and following media personalities on Twitter, can help you find out about breaking news items in your area. By maintaining a wide circle of civically and socially active friends on social media sites, you can find out about local events through word of mouth.There’s no ironclad rule that you’ll get news before anyone else if you follow local anchors on Twitter. However, Twitter feeds are often updated with brief descriptions of breaking news events even before the full story is written.

, As internet-based media continues to take up more and more of the total media landscape, it is becoming steadily more common to see personal and semi-commercial blogs that talk substantively about local issues. The larger your town is, the more likely it is you’ll have a variety to choose from. Search for local blogs at blogdigger.com.


Check and see if there’s a Patch site for your area. Patch.com is a hybrid between a news aggregator, blog, and social media site. While Patch’s coverage doesn’t extend to all 50 states, if it covers your state, it can be a great resource for local news stories.

, The volume of media available to consumers is greater than ever before, and more of it comes from sources that are highly partisan. Those developments make it more difficult to know if the information you’re getting is accurate, so you’ll need to fact-check the claims you hear from news sources, politicians, and other media.There are a number of good fact checking websites available. Try FactCheck.org, PolitiFact.com, ProCon.org, and Snopes.com.

, If you only consume news at one level, it will skew your perception of the world. It can make you magnify small problems and minimize large problems. Take special care to follow the news locally, nationally, and internationally in order to get a balanced picture of the world. For example, sources like NPR, the New York Times, and any of the broadcast networks are primarily focused on national affairs. Al-Jazeera, PRI, and Reuters are all good sources for international coverage.

, Once you feel like you’ve got a handle on finding high-quality news sources, make an effort to develop your expertise on an issue of special concern to you. It will enhance your credibility on that particular issue, but developing the expertise in one issue teaches you lessons you can apply to other fields.For example, if campaigns and elections are your thing, then regularly read sources like Politico, fivethirtyeight.com, and the Cook Political Report.
If foreign policy and diplomacy is more your style, check out Foreign Policy and Foreign Affairs, two trusted sources of information on policy.

Continue with the rest of the novel.",How to Write the Beginning of a Novel," Most novels start with a little seed of inspiration. Perhaps you have an idea for a cool character, an interesting setting, or a unique problem that you want to address in novel form. Whatever your idea is, you can build the novel around that idea.


Write what you know, or at least what you have a passion for. If you are inspired to write a novel about 17th century Russia, but you know nothing about that era and don't care much for Russian culture, perhaps you should rethink your idea!
Try to pick a setting, theme, or culture to base your book that you know something about. Novels feel authentic when the author writes from experience.;
, Before you start that first chapter, you need to brainstorm ideas. This early stage of planning is crucial to give you the ""big picture.""


What is the point of this novel? Is it purely for entertainment, or are you trying to make a political or moral point?
Who is the audience for this novel? Who does it appeal to?
What is the genre or category for this novel? Is it a romance, family drama, sci-fi, crime drama or who-dunnit, young adult fiction, or some combination?

, Even though you do not want to tell all about your characters within the early pages of your novel, it is important for you to know their back stories in order to understand the motivation for each of your characters.Take some time to write about the back story of each of your characters. Some questions you might want to answer as you develop these backstories include:


Where is he/she from?
How was he/she raised?
What does the character value?
What does the character hate?
How does he/she look? Speak? Behave?
What is this character’s conflict? How might he/she end up confronting this conflict?

, The setting for your novel can be elaborate or sparse, but it is important either way. Before you start to write, take some time to ask yourself some questions about the setting, such as:What settings do authors in your genre tend to use?
What is the tone or mood that you want the setting to have? How might you accomplish that?
Is it real or imaginary? Urban or rural? Large or small?
What towns, cities, roads, and structures are present?
Do you need to do research to learn more about the setting?

, This is where you put your plans down and make sure everything fits together in a coherent, compelling story. Not all of your ideas from brainstorming will make it into the final novel, so now is the time to figure out what will work, how it will flow together, and what the structure of your novel might be.


You can create a literal storyboard on a large poster or white board, or you can use a piece of paper or computer document. If you use a white board, be sure to take a high quality photo of the board when you're done! The last thing you want is for all your hard work to be inadvertently wiped away.
Begin with a ""cast of characters"": Every recurring character should appear here, with their name and a brief description. For example, list the age, gender, any physical features that matter, and their general role in the story.
List each chapter and outline what happens in that chapter. You do not need to include every detail, but any elements of the story that are necessary and build on previous chapters should go here.

, Sometimes authors start with a dream, conversation, or a description of the setting or main characters. Other authors jump right into the middle of an action sequence. However you do it, make sure that the style, tone, and point of view stay consistent for the rest of the novel.


If your introduction is verbose and descriptive like Charles Dickens, the other chapters should be, too. If its terse and to the point like Cormac McCarthy, then the rest of your book needs to stay that way too!
Make sure you write in the same point of view as the rest of the story. For example, if you write in first person in the introduction, write the rest of the novel in the same point of view., The first time you put pen to paper (or begin typing) your first draft, remember it does not have to be perfect. That's why it's called a draft!


The very first sentences of the novel should capture the reader's attention so that she will keep reading. They should also be gorgeously written, not awkwardly phrased or confusing in any way, so that the reader will notice your writing style and want more of it.
However, if you're having trouble with the very first sentences, don’t let that keep you from writing. Jump right in and write. You can always go back and add better sentences to start the chapter once you've got some writing momentum.

, The beginning of the novel is a great place to give the reader an idea of what type of characters they will encounter, and to introduce them to the main protagonist. This gives the reader someone to root for early on.Try not to get bogged down in describing the characters' physical appearance. A few details are good to help the reader visualize the character, but remember that one way that readers relate to a story is by imagining the characters in personalized ways. For instance, if you say a protagonist is handsome, a reader can imagine him in ways that she thinks would be attractive; but if you say he has a sharp, chiseled chin, this may not be something she finds attractive, so she may have trouble relating to him. Too many details makes it difficult for a reader to connect with characters.
Don't feel like you have to completely develop the main characters right away. Save some compelling information for later. Only provide as much backstory as you need to get into the storyline, and leave them a bit mysterious.
Remember that you don't need to introduce everyone right away. This can be overwhelming for a reader who is trying to keep up with everyone, so keep it focused!

, Many amateur writers waste time on setting and character development which can be boring to a reader. After you orient the reader to the setting and a few important characters, you shouldn’t waste the reader's time. Try to quickly move into a problem, dilemma, or just a suggestion that a problem will be arising soon. This is the hook that gets the reader to continue.Give hints about the rest of the story. The beginning of the novel should suggest (without giving away) where the story will go, what is on the line, or otherwise what the reader is in for if he or she commits to the rest of the novel. Think about it as tempting the reader to engage.

, The introduction should connect to the rest of the story and matter, not just serve as backstory, context, or introductions. Make it matter! Every chapter, including the first one, is a piece of a puzzle!If you introduce a problem or dilemma early on that is quickly resolved in the next chapter, be sure you also introduce some longer-term problem. You can also try to create a little mystery about where the details in the introduction are headed.

, The opening of a novel should set the stage and give just enough information to keep the reader interested. Don't give away important details just yet; you want to keep your reader's attention!Try to avoid laying out the plot of the book or giving a preview of what is to come. You want to keep people guessing.
You also do not need to provide the backstory or the whole history of the characters at this point. Instead, work the backstory into the main story as needed to support the ongoing plot. Remember, the backstory isn't the story!, This might sound obvious, but most readers are turned off by cliché openings and predictable, cookie cutter descriptions of characters.While there are always well-written exceptions to these rules, avoid:


Opening with a dream sequence that the reader doesn’t realize is a dream. Many readers find this off-putting and deceptive.Similarly, avoid opening with the character waking from sleep or unconsciousness.Beginning with a description of the cast of characters, like the family, household, or school.Descriptions of characters faces or bodies that imply they are gorgeous and perfect in every way. Most readers prefer a relatable hero or heroine to one that is flawless and unrealistic.

, The average beginning of a novel should be as short as you can make it. If possible, start the conflict on page 1. Don't make your reader wait 50 to 100 pages before they get to the good stuff!


Don't get lost in tedious description. Your reader wants some action and plot advancement, not to get stuck in the details of a description of the countryside or of the main character's face, body, clothes, and personality.The introduction should be long enough to cover the subject but short enough to keep it interesting. Interesting and luring introductions grab readers into the story and make them want to read more.
Just give the details that are needed to get the reader feeling oriented in the setting and familiar enough with the character to visualize him or her. Most readers enjoy using their imagination to make the characters come to life, so don't feel that you need to describe everything about him or her., After you have finished writing the beginning of your novel, you will need to spend some time on revision to make sure that the story and details are in line with your vision for the novel. Give yourself at least a few days to read over the beginning of your novel and check for continuity, clarity, and development.Some questions you might ask yourself include:


Does everything that happens in the beginning make sense? Does it flow well?
Are there any drastic tone shifts that might be confusing for readers? If so, how can I adjust the tone in these places?
Is there anything in the beginning of the novel that might confuse readers? Is it possible to work on clarifying and/or developing these passages?

, After you have completed revisions on the content of your novel’s opening pages, you will need to take some time to edit your work as well. Read through the chapter to check for errors like spelling, punctuation, and grammar.


Reading out loud is a great way to catch minor errors. You can also try reading your first chapter backwards to make it easier for you to catch minor errors.
If you find an error, one way to check for similar errors is to use MS Word’s find and replace feature. For example, if you find the typo “opwn” when the word should be “open,” then search for “opwn” and replace all instances with “open.”, Once you have your first chapter nicely edited (but still not perfect-- that will come later!), find a writing friend or teacher and ask her to be your first reader.


The ideal first reader is someone who has a strong command of the language, loves to read novels, and will give you honest feedback.
Ask your reader if the opening chapter draws her into the story, and what she is left asking at the end. Your reader will be able to tell you if the story makes sense and can also let you know if it is engaging. Remember that the beginning of your story is the most important part! If the reader gets bored at the beginning, she probably won’t finish it at all.
You can also have more than one person read it to give you a variety of opinions. This would be a great time to engage with a writing workshop or creative writing class.

, After you've mastered the novel's beginning and you've received feedback from readers, don't waste any time in starting chapter 2. You want to keep writing while you have momentum in order to avoid writer's block!


Remember to stay consistent with the writing style, point of view, and characters that you've worked so hard to develop in your novel's beginnings.
Also remember to tie up any loose ends from problems, dilemmas, or mysteries that you left unsolved in the novel's beginnings.

Revise the draft.",How to Write an Original Teen Romance Novel," To get started on your teen romance novel, you first need to come up with a story idea that feels original and fresh. You may put an original spin on a story you have read before or a common storyline in teen romance novels. Remember your audience is teens so your story idea should contain elements that teens are interested in, such as young love, intense emotion, sexual awakening, and an aversion to authority.For example, you may put a spin on the girl meets boy or boy meets girl storyline by having the boy/girl be an alien from another planet or have the girl/boy possess a superpower that tends to repel most boys/girls.
You may also draw on your own life experiences to help you create an interesting story idea for your romance novel. Think about how you felt as a teenager and some of the situations or conflicts you got yourself into. You could then use your experiences to create a storyline for your novel.;
, You should also start to create the main characters in your teen romance novel that feel unique. Your main character or characters should have backstories that are specific and detailed, as this will allow them to feel real and distinct. You should also allow your main characters to be flawed and make mistakes or bad choices. Having a perfect, safe main character will likely lead to a boring teen romance novel that may not find many readers.For example, you may have a main character who realizes s/he can read minds, but struggles to make friends at his/her high school or get the attention of a girl/boy s/he likes. Though your main character has a certain power, s/he still has flaws and experiences failure.

, Once you have a sense of your story and your main characters, you should sit down and create a plot outline. Creating a plot outline can help guide you once you sit down to write the novel and give you a sense of your story overall.Most teen romance novels follow a very similar plot outline: infatuation, flirtation, friendship, commitment, and finally, love. You may end your novel with a happily-ever-after, but most teen romance novels do not end on a forever note. In fact, your ending may be more open ended or indicate that your characters may only be in love while they are young.

, To get a better sense of the genre, you may read several published teen romance novels. You may try to read a variety of teen romance novels, from the more popular to the more obscure, so you have a good sense of what is being written and published in the genre. You may read several examples, including:The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky.

Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell.

Boy Meets Boy by David Levithan.

To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before by Jenny Han.

, When you sit down to write the novel, you should always consider your character’s goals and determine how they affect what happens in the story. Your main character should have specific goals or wants that s/he would like to achieve. Your protagonist’s goals will push the story forward and add drama to the events in the story.You should then place obstacles in your main character’s way that s/he must overcome to achieve his/her goals and consequences if your main character fails to attain his/her goals. This will create conflict and tension in the story, which will keep your reader engaged.
For example, maybe you have a main character who was born able to read minds and is entering his/her first year of high school. S/he may have goals like making friends and getting to know the cute girl or handsome boy in his/her art class. But s/he may have to overcome his/her insecurities about his/her special abilities and resist the urge to read his/her crush’s mind so s/he has a real chance at a relationship with him/her.

, Your novel will be much stronger if you make sure there is a strong narrative voice throughout the story. You may use the first person voice of your main character to give the language in your story more character and specificity. Or you may use a third person voice that still feels unique and specific to the story. A strong narrative voice will keep your reader engaged and make your characters sound more distinct on the page.You may ask yourself, How would my main character describe this scene? How would my main character describe another character? What kind of language would s/he use? These questions can help you get into the mindset of your main character and write from his/her narrative voice.
For example, you may have your main character use slang that is common among teenagers to describe scenes and characters around him/her. S/he may say things like, “The girl was hot” or “I checked her Facebook profile and it said ‘single’.”

, Teen romance novels are written with teens in mind and they should include discussions around a topic most teens are thinking about: sex. Though you may feel shy about discussing sex in your novel, including scenes about sex in your story can make it feel more relatable to your audience. Try to discuss sex in an open, honest way.For example, you may have your main character discuss sex with other characters or consider having sex with another character. Make sure you include all the awkward moments of a first kiss, a first make out, and a first time. This will make the scenes feel more honest and believable to teens.
Though you may want to include notes about safe sex, such as the use of condoms, you should not paint sex as a taboo, shameful thing. Keep an open mind about sex among young people and make sure your characters share that open mind as well.

, To ensure your teen romance novel feels original and unique, you should strive to avoid cliches. Cliches are phrases or descriptions that have become so familiar they have lost all meaning. The romance genre tends to be littered with cliches so you should do your best to have descriptions that feel specific and unique to your story, rather than phrases a reader may have heard before.For example, you should avoid describing a character as “really good looking”, “sultry and sexy”, or “tall, dark, and handsome.” These descriptions have been used before many times and will not have much of an impact on readers.
Instead, you should create descriptions that feel specific to your story’s narrative voice and your main character. Your main character may describe an attractive guy as “better looking than my childhood crush, Tristan” or a mean girl as “worse than my mother on a good day.” Keep your descriptions fresh and unique to your characters so they do not become cliche.

, Once you have finished a first draft of your teen romance novel, you should read it over from start to finish. You may make notes or underline sections as you read it over. Look out for sections that contain awkward sentences or cliche descriptions. Mark any sections that feel underdeveloped or any plot points that have not been fully explored.You should also read the draft out loud so you can hear how the dialogue, descriptions, and characters sound on the page. You may mark any moments that do not flow well when read out loud and underline them so you can revise them.

, You should also try to share your first drafts with your core audience: teen readers. You may ask a teenaged friend or acquaintance to read over the draft and give you feedback on the story. Listen to what your teen reader has to say and use their feedback to improve your draft.You may also discuss certain elements of your story with your teen reader. You may ask if your story feels unique or distinct, especially if your teen reader knows of other popular teen romance novels. You may also ask for advice on how to make your story feel more original.

, Once you have received feedback on your novel and read it over several times, you may sit down and revise the draft. You may focus on certain sections that feel underdeveloped or sentences that seem awkward or unclear.You may also think about how you can improve upon your story and make it more original. If you notice certain elements of your story seem too familiar or cliche, you may adjust them and revise them until they feel more unique.

Ditch the idea that young adult is a genre.,
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that young adult novels are easier to write.,
Stop dumbing down your writing.,
Tackle dark, serious, or edgy topics.,
Don’t just make things up.",How to Write a Young Adult Novel1," Although bookstores and publishers use the phrase young adult as a marketing category, it is not necessarily a genre. A young adult novel could represent any genre such as science fiction, mystery, horror, romance, historical fiction, or fantasy.This is one aspect of writing young adult fiction that many authors find appealing. You are not restricted to one specific genre, and instead can write books in different genres or books that cross genres.;
, Writing any type of book requires hard work, and young adult novels are no exception. Many writers have also reported that these books can be more challenging to write because young adults can be picky readers and are looking for very authentic and original stories.Writing a young adult novel can be especially difficult if you are no longer considered a young adult. It’s hard to find a voice and adopt a tone that young adults can relate to.
Also, keep in mind that many novels that end up being marketed as young adult books or are popular among young adults, were not necessarily written with that intent., Unfortunately, some people believe that young adults novels are watered down or dumbed down versions of adult fiction. Just because the protagonist in the novel is a young adult does not mean you should feel like you are writing for children.While your prose and the quality of your writing should be engaging, your readers don't want something simplistic. Young adults want to be treated like adults and you may alienate your audience if you use writing that is too simple or childish.
Also, remember that many adults read and enjoy books that fall in the young adult category. Think about how many adults read series such as Harry Potter or the Hunger Games. If your writing and content are too basic and elementary, you will lose this group as potential readers.

, Many people mistakenly assume that young adult novels should be light and breezy, with no exploration of difficult subject matter. Successful young adult authors, however, are ones willing to address and examine how serious issues in our society affect young adults.These topics may include, but are not limited to: abuse, sex, gender identity, drugs, rape, incest, suicide, racism, discrimination, violence, and genocide.

, While creativity is encouraged in young adult fiction, don’t assume you can make things up and get away with it. If you are talking about or referring to real people, places, events, or products, you need to do your homework.Young adults are savvy readers and can easily sniff out uninformed and inaccurate descriptions, opinions, and details. For example, if you are writing a book that talks about video game culture, get the details about the games and the culture of this community right.

Formulate an idea.,
This combination of genres may seem confusing when you look at it face on, but remember that teenagers are very easily bored.,
Once you have a genre, think of where you're going to go with it.,
Try to draw on real life situations, but just exaggerate them a bit to increase their interest.,
You must find whatever you're writing interesting.,
Use language they'd understand.,
Try to add a little reality into everything.,
Always remember who your target audience are, and where you are heading with your novel.",How to Write a Teenage Novel," This means a series of decisions you need to make early on in your mind, and stick to. Do you want to write for boys or girls? For boys, follow the idea of action and suspense. Maybe horror and science fiction can also appeal to boys, but it will also be the interest of many girls. So first thing's first, decide on your genre. The teenage section has dozens of genres, including romance (which goes hand in hand with comedy in most successful cases), the supernatural (think Charmed, Twilight by S. Meyer and Wicca by Cate Tiernan), comedy, horror, race (think Malorie Blackman's N&C trilogy), science fiction, real life (diaries), action and many others. The best sellers are those who successfully combine many different genres with each other.;
, You need to keep them interested, and the best way to do that is add things they don't know, or don't suspect. You want to write a page turner, remember.

, What is your plan? Are you going to have one character, or alternate between characters in different chapters? Who is the voice, the narrator? Where is your main character heading? Try to find a main character people can relate to. Don't make them perfect, people won't like them, and they can't relate to them. They need to have flaws.

, If you had a really bad date once, you can incorporate it into your comedy romance. A first hand experience is always better than making something you've never experienced up, and the reader will get a realistic representation.

, Otherwise, you'll never finish it. Plus, if the writer doesn't want to read their own book, who will read it? This audience is pickier and more cruel than many adults, so you need to bring everything you've got.

, Look up the local slang on Urban Dictionary if needs be. This audience wants to think the narrator is talking directly to them. So talk their language , but beware you must dictate on how much slang to use in your teenage novel, you don't want to make you book incredibly dated.

, That's what adds complexity to best sellers. No matter how unrealistic the storyline is, it's always good to have something normal to focus on. Like, if it's a novel about witchcraft, you can give the main character family issues. Or a crippling shyness with the guy they like. It makes the character, and your story more realistic, and believable, no matter how ridiculous the actual story line is.

, The main character should undergo some kind of crisis in the middle section, and it should be resolved by the end. Or if it's a series you're planning, leave something missing that you can pick up on. It doesn't need to be a cliff hanger, but anything that will provoke questions will do.

If you know what your story will be about, great! Just write 1-3 chapters and add a twist somewhere in there. If you don't know what to write about, look through books for inspiration before completing this step.


EXAMPLES: A freak lightning storm destroys the city, the entire town is brought into a dystopian state, then someone dies in a freakish way, a war is started;
, After about a chapter after the base twist, make the reader realize that the originally introduced problem isn't the biggest problem the protagonist has to face.

, Think about how it could get worse. What is the worst for the current scene? How can you deter the protagonist? How could you use a character's flaws and weaknesses against them? What can you do to a character important to the protagonist? How can you make the villain stronger? Can you introduce a new villain? Can you add a new, almost impossible task for the protagonist? Can you complete one of the villain's tasks?

, At lease one character has a personality that make you think, is that person who we think they are? Choose a character you think fits the bill, and twist it so you find out they've been lying, whether it has been to the protagonist, to the villain, or to everybody. You can also choose to make the protagonist be the liar.

, If there is a piece of secret information crucial to the plot, let it out in a sudden, but effective way. First decide who it will be revealed to, the protagonist, the villain, or to everybody. Then, use this to decide how the secret got out. Was the secret keeper tortured or guiled, or something new? Try not to do the classic ""they had a change of heart"". This would rarely, or never, happen in real life.

, The villain is stronger than ever, your only hope of protection is destroyed, the only one strong enough to face the villain is dead. What now? Well, now, when it seems like all is lost, pick it right back up again.

, Not lose forever, but for the time being the villain has won. Keep the story going, though, possibly with some action involving a unique type of revenge on the villain.

, Eventually, they will win, but at the moment, make the them only think they won and then, later in the story, realize they actually didn't.

, Make them realize they didn't defeat the villain forever, that the villain was only pretending to lose, or even that there was a ""deputy"" waiting to take the place of the villain after their downfall.

, This is hard, but sacrifice always is fun to add in when it comes to victory.

, If the protagonist knows everything, knowledge is their weapon. If the villain knows everything, knowledge is their weapon. And, as you probably know, everything is more fun to read when the villain has a weapon the protagonist needs.

, We all expect a character to have one true identity. So, when you find out that a character is somebody else besides who you think they are, everything is more exciting.

, Since there's always a double-identity character, make it exciting. Along with the double-identity character, make a d-i character that doesn't know they are somebody else.

, Whether it's the villain or the protagonist, make sure at least one character finds out that they have the thing they've been so desperately searching for for the last 5 chapters.

, Making this information revealed in a ""little did they know"" type fashion make the reader always on the edge of their seat.

, So, the reader thinks they're all in the know with their special piece of crucial-but-secret information, and then they find out it was all false and the true information is still secret. This always throws the reader for a loop.

, Someone rich is poor. Someone poor is rich. Someone weak gains power. Someone Powerful becomes weak. A good guy is bad. A bad guy is good. Make sure there is always something switching in a way that is crazy but not confusing.

, At first they are introduced as a villain, but over the course of the book you learn that they actually aren't evil, but they aren't good either. You can also do this by introducing a character as good and then revealing that they aren't good or evil, but in the middle. This leaves your reader never knowing what the character might do next.

, This is kind of a side story that goes along with the story your reader thought was the only story. Eventually, the plot and the subplot collide, combine, and sometimes switch. Switching would make the plot the subplot, and the subplot the main plot. The other option is to just combine them, which adds new characters, new problems, new villains, new information, and new weapons.

, Let the reader believe that everything on the page is true and then, after dropping subtle hints, you find that everything you've been told is wrong, and that the narrator is telling their own version of the story.

, That character should probably be really good or really evil.

, Like in Harry Potter, this usually creates the feeling of, one ounce of power and one is going to win. Since it creates that feeling, give the villain that one ounce of power and then twist it so there is still a glimmer of hope for the protagonist.

, So, the war is over, the guns have stopped firing, and, well, only 4 people are still alive. Something like that created a problem within an answer, which is always fun.

, When a character seems to be on good terms with everybody, kill them. When a character seems well protected, kill them. No body likes a protected, everybody-wins character.

Choose your genre.,
Create the cast.,
Plan your novel in a notebook or on your computer.,
Choose a place and a time for the setting (say New York 1929).,
Develop the plot.,
Write.,
Keep writing and then, once finished, put it away for a week, a month even.,
Once you've edited and finalized your novel, find a publisher to show your novel to.",How to Write a Short Novel," Crime, Horror, Romance,...you decide. If you don't know, just start writing.

, Think of one to three characters who are interesting. Write a Breakdown (describing the looks, personality and history of each character). They should be as familiar to you as your friend, brother, sister, mother and/or father. Once you do this, your characters will talk for themselves and they may even surprise you by what they say. When this happens, you know your characters are interesting.

, An outline of points (places where events happen) can be detailed as you want. Some deviation may happen, but that can keep the feel of the book more organic, but be careful of getting too far off. You can't have a character trying to solve a murder, then decide to go to 'Comic-Con' to hang out with Star peeps, then come back and pick up where he (or she) left off.

, Make it as interesting and attention grabbing as you can!

, Think of a really good storyline for the characters to be involved in. This can be done with the 'fish out of water' story where the character suddenly is in a situation they know nothing about (ie: Castaway). Or perhaps something happens to them or a member and they have to deal with it. But be aware of obvious lines. If your reader knows what's going to happen before they read it, you might as well be drawing equations on Hooters bathroom paper.


Remember, don't go over the top with the storyline! The ones are usually the best.
There are parts of a story: setup, conflict, climax and resolution.
Your set up shouldn't be very long; just long enough to introduce the characters and the situation. (Scrooge is a jerk; then his friend comes back as ghost to let him know more will visit him).
The conflict is then what the character has to deal with and solve. (Ghosts show up and torment Scrooge).
All this leads to the climax of the story where the situations reach a head. (Scrooge sees his death and has a change of heart).
The resolution ties up ends and sends the story out. (Scrooge gives Crochet a raise and a turkey).



, Remember a book should have a minimum of one page, but more would be preferable. Remember, you do not have a deadline so take your time! If it goes over pages, go to How to Write a Novel.

, Come back to it and then rewrite, rewrite and then rewrite some more. First publications are rare, impossible even. Much of the magic of prose come from rewriting anyway.

,


Consider a publisher for your novel. Many of the the publishers have digests or anthologies that are well suited to works.

Create your characters.,
Think about your plot.,
Write an outline.,
Start to tackle one of the main enemies of all writers: the beginning.,
Begin diving into your plot.,
After you have finishing writing your first draft, EDIT, EDIT, EDIT!,
Finalize.,
Publishing.,
Start writing your next book in the series!

",How to Write a Series of Fantasy Novels," The base of your novel is your characters. Start off by creating your protagonist and antagonist, then break down to supporting characters. When you think of The Hobbit, you remember Bilbo Baggins. Your characters will help shape the plot and direction of your first book. Create character profiles. These are good to help determine your characters' backgrounds. A useful template to use is Name, Age, Height, Weight, Eye color, Hair color, Hair style, Friends, Family, Personality Traits, Likes, Dislikes, and Wishes.;
, Your plot will not only shape your first book, but it will shape your entire series. For example: Harry Potter is a young wizard who battles Lord Voldemort while attending the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. That synopsis determines your entire series plot. Think about the struggles that your main character has, and what they are searching for. How do they achieve their goal? Or do they not achieve their goal, and your first book ends with a cliffhanger? What are some obstacles that they may face? Once you have a basic idea of your plot, move on to the next step.

, You may think that you won't need an outline, but if your story suddenly starts to not make any sense, it is probably because you didn't have an outline. Just write a basic outline of all of your chapters, but above all know that your story may go in a completely different direction, and your outline is just something that will help you keep order. When you get stumped later on in the writing process, just go back and refer to your outline.

, You must think of a first sentence that will leave your audience wondering and wanting more. Just put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself if your beginning intrigues you. If not, don't fret. Try making your beginning a bit mysterious, because it creates tension and draws the reader in. Otherwise, make your beginning something so bizarre and comical that readers will say ""What?"" or ""That's impossible!"" Just remember that what you hope to accomplish is to create a beginning that draws your audience in. People will notice the difference between, ""It was cold outside,"" and ""The wind howled ominously as it rattled the branches of the bare trees, and then I knew that a storm was beginning to brew.""

, If you come to a place where your characters want to do something else than what you planned, try it out and see how it ends up. If it isn't successful, save it on a different document, because you may find yourself wanting to go back to it later. You will probably reach a point where you will begin to doubt your plot. But the truth is, more people fail from their own criticism than the criticism of others. All you need to do is keep on writing. As said previously in step #3, you can refer back to your outline when you start to doubt yourself. Also, to boost your confidence in your writing, go back and read a part that you have already written that you had thought was your best writing yet, and keep your faith in your writing.

, Make sure that you don't delete huge chunks of your writing at a time; just fix those little errors that you may have made. If you used too many adjectives in one sentence, take out a few so that the sentence has a better flow. Once you have edited, you may notice that your word count is significantly lower than before you started editing. This is perfectly normal, and later on you will have time to buff out those scratches and bring up your word count during the next step.

, This is the time to analyze your writing carefully, even more carefully than when you edited. You can add what you think would be appropriate, and your may decide that one conversation doesn't fit in well with the situation. But this is mostly the time when you put your finishing touches into your novel and finalize the novel that you are going to submit to a publisher.

, Publishing can be very discouraging to many writers, but you cannot give up hope now that you have finished your first novel! Make sure to look for a publisher that specializes in fantasy writing, or at least a publishing company that has published fantasy before. This will help your book get more publicity. Most likely, your first attempt you will be denied, but don't let that discourage you! Did you know that J.K. Rowling was denied by eleven publishing companies before she published the first Harry Potter book? Now, many consider her one of the most successful authors in the world today! If you stick to it and are determined, you may have the next best idea! And who knows, maybe you'll have your book(s) made into movies someday!!

Get excited.,
Study young adult novels.,
Focus on developing your characters.,
Research the setting.,
Identify the source of conflict in your novel.,
Be aware of length.,
Ask young adults for their feedback.",How to Write a Young Adult Novel2," To write a young adult novel, you need to feel excited about the opportunities of writing in this category. Here are some things to keep in mind:The field of young adult fiction is expanding.
Authors often find that they face fewer restrictions about what they write about because young adults celebrate creativity and imagination.
Young adults can also be a more open-minded and supportive audience.
People outside the young adult range will likely read and enjoy your book.
As an author of young adult novels, you have the opportunity to write a book that makes an impact on someone and influences how he or she looks at the world.

, If you want to write young adult books, reading successful young adult novels is an excellent way to start.Pay close attention to the structure, dialogue, plot, and character development.
Make notes about any ideas you come up with for your novel while reading other books.

, Interesting and engaging characters are essential for a young adult novel. Spend time thinking about and developing your characters before you sit down to write or move on to other parts of the novel such as the plot or setting.For each character you create, make a list of his or her history, background, hobbies, relationships, tastes, and personality traits. Although not all of these details will make it in to the book, you will develop well-rounded, and three-dimensional characters that young adults can relate to.
Don't neglect the villains or minor characters in your story. You never know what details you might need or the changes you will make to your plot.

, Now that you’ve developed a full cast of characters, you probably have a better idea of where and when your story will take place. Spend time thinking about the setting of your novel and conduct any research on the time period or location that inspires you.Remember, you are not limited to present-day or real-world locations. Many successful young adult novels take place in the genres of fantasy and science fiction. There is also a healthy market for historical fiction.

, The characters in every novel confront some kind of conflict, and this holds true for young adult books. While the specific conflict will be shaped by your characters, setting, and genre, the characters need to confront issues that your audience can relate to.With young adults, conflicts and struggles often arise over love, relationships, personal freedom, peer or family pressure, a search for identity, taking on new roles and responsibilities, and dealing with high school, college, and career choices.

, While young adults can be voracious readers, you will lose some potential audience members if your book is too long. Although many young adult novels exceed this limit, most books in this category are between 50,000 to 70,000 words.The pacing in young adult novels is often fast, with lots of dialogue. Some people think they resemble extended screenplays as opposed to a longer, slower, adult novel.Remember, if the book or story you are crafting seems much longer than this, you can always contemplate breaking it up into separate books and creating a series.

, You want your book to be as successful as possible and appeal to the intended audience, so it’s a smart move to ask young adults to provide feedback on your work.If you are no longer a young adult, but are writing a young adult novel, this exercise can help you gain insight into the language, feelings, and concerns of your audience. You will also be better able to recall what it feels like to be a teenager.

"
"
Think like a young adult.,
Emphasize what it feels like to be a teenager.,
Be careful with pop culture references and slang.,
Get the voice down.,
Don’t try to be too elaborate with your writing style.,
Think carefully about the age of your characters.,
Show character growth and development.,
Don’t try to preach to your audience.,
Embrace a flair for the dramatic.,
Make the ending somewhat hopeful.",How to Write a Young Adult Novel3," Regardless of your age, you will have to think like a young adult and try to get in your characters’ mindset in order to craft a novel that is believable and relatable to a young adult audience.Pay careful attention to how you narrate the book so you do not seem to be writing this from the perspective of an adult looking back on their teenage years with the wisdom and maturity that comes with age.If you are no longer a young adult, you will have to be careful about the decisions, feelings, and emotions your characters make. Ask yourself if this is something a young adult would actually do or if your hindsight and experience are making your characters and the story less relatable to a young adult audience.
If you are looking for insight into a young adult audience, check out online forums centered around young adult novels. You will get a better sense of the opinions, views, and perspectives of people you want to read and enjoy your work., Although the characters in your young adult novel may be very different from you, readers and writers have argued that successful books are those that capture the emotional experience of being a young adult.For example, even though readers may not identify with the specific struggle a main character in a young adult novel is dealing with, they will probably relate to his or her search for identity and meaning in the world.

, References to pop culture and the use of slang can help you develop your characters and make them more personable, but they can also date your novel and you as an author.Many successful young adult authors recommend using pop culture references and slang sparingly to help you establish the setting and provide specific insight into characters.
Excessive use of pop culture references and slang, however, may make the novel difficult for readers to understand and relate to in the future. References to technology, for example, quickly become obsolete. Overdoing the pop culture and slang can also distract from the storyline and the novel’s central conflict.
If you decide to use pop culture references or slang in your novel, make sure you provide sufficient context that a reader can figure out what you are referring to many years down the road.

, Finding and adopting the right voice for your young adult novel can be daunting. While there are no set rules, many young adult novels are written in the first-person present tense, and are narrated from the perspective of a young person revealing intimate details about his or her life.Many young adult readers, according to writers and editors, are looking for a story that is told in a personal and accessible way.Although adult characters may be present in the book, the novels usually do not emphasize their perspective and readers often identify most with the main character., When you start writing your young adult novel, you may feel like you need to be particularly poetic and creative, but many successful young adult writers have reported that people of all ages are attracted to their work because the writing style is more direct, straightforward, and simple.This doesn’t mean that you should throw writing and grammar rules out the window, but realize that your audience often communicates more bluntly and to the point. Writing like a snobby philosopher won’t help you craft a compelling novel that young adults and people of all ages can relate to.

, The age of your characters will influence who reads your novel and how they react to it. They may be excited to read a book about a character a few years older, but young adults are usually reluctant to read books about characters younger than they are so make sure your characters’ age is appropriate for your intended audience.The age range of main characters in young adult novels is usually mid to upper teens.
If you envisioned a protagonist as younger, you might want to evaluate whether your book is a better fit for a middle-grade audience. The main characters in these books are usually 10 to 12 years old, and the middle-grade demographic is 8 to 12 years old.

, At their core, most young adult books are coming-of-age stories that trace characters’ transition to adulthood. As a result, young adult authors have to demonstrate how their characters experience personal growth and change over the course of the novel.The appeal of coming-of-age stories and personal growth is one of the elements that make young adult books so popular to audiences of all ages. This is something we can all relate to.

, Anyone who has been a young adult or is often around young adults knows that they, just like adults, do not appreciate being told what to do. Avoid writing a novel with the intention of teaching your audience lessons you think are important.It’s okay for your views and opinions to be apparent in the way you write the novel, but you can usually make your audience think critically about a topic by simply raising a question or introducing an issue. It’s not your responsibility as a writer to provide an answer to the question. Instead, let your audience explore and grapple with the topic on their own time and in their own way.

, While older adults may dismiss teenagers as overly dramatic and emotional, you will need to embrace this tendency if you want to be a successful young adult author. When you are a young adult, everything that happens to you can seem and feel life-changing and very important.Young adults, because of how their bodies and brains are developing and changing, feel things intensely. To capture that quality, you have to be able to dramatize things that some people might regard as trivial in your book. For example, a grade on a science test, a glance from a boy you are attracted to, and a snicker in gym class can seem incredibly important to young adults., While young adult books can definitely explore topics that leave readers feeling raw and emotional, successful young adult novels also offer readers some glimpse of optimism or the sense that things can and will improve for the characters. You don’t have to make the ending a happy or rosy one, and tragedy can occur in the book. Just try to leave readers with a sense that there is some chance for survival, growth, and happiness.One of the reasons many adults are drawn to young adult novels is that they often provide more resolution or a reason for optimism than adult fiction.
For example, if you are writing a book about a geeky student in high school, you don’t have to include a triumphant but unrealistic ending where the nerd turns into the most popular student in school. You can, however, suggest that the unpopular student meets and befriends new people, feeling less isolated in the end.

Choose a thriller type.,
Brainstorm story ideas.,
Develop engaging characters.,
Read examples of thriller novels.,
Plot out the novel.,
Begin with a bang.,
Maintain high stakes.,
Keep the action moving.,
Build to an exciting climax.,
End on a high note.,
Read over the first draft.,
Show the draft to others.,
Revise the draft for action, suspense, and plot.",How to Write a Thriller Novel," There are several different types of thrillers. Choosing a type can help you determine the plot of the novel. The most common types of thrillers are:Psychological thriller: This type of thriller focuses on the psychological motives of the characters in your novel. Psychological thrillers usually include a main character who is mentally disturbed. (Ex. Family problems, the death of relatives, etc.
Mystery thriller: This type of thriller focuses on the solving of a mystery, but in a fast-paced, intense environment.(Theft, murder, suicide)
Science Fiction thriller: This type of thriller uses a lot of the themes and ideas in the science fiction genre. (Ex. Mutation, zombies, monsters, etc.)
Spy thriller: This type of thriller focuses on spies and espionage.(Ex: Assassination, elimination, kidnapping, etc.
Military thriller: This type of thriller is based on wars, whether real or fictional.(Ex: Wars, nuclear projectiles, hacking, etc.;
, A good thriller comes from a strong story idea. Most thrillers are built around a protagonist who falls victim to another character or has to fight against another character. Sit down and brainstorm story ideas for your novel that are specific to you and your perspective.For example, you may have a story idea about death and rebirth, where a character comes close to death and then reaffirms themselves. Or you may have a story with a hero who prevents a crime.
Another option is a story idea where a character prevents a disaster and improves society by solving a problem or dilemma.

, Good thrillers will also have interesting, engaging characters to carry the story forward. Your protagonist or main character should be complex and have a detailed backstory, which is the history of a character or their past. Avoid using stock characters in your novel, as this can take all the energy out of the story and make it feel predictable for the reader.Avoid stock characters often found in thriller novels, like the hard-boiled detective, the cold, button-downed FBI agent, or the eager young reporter. Make your characters more complex and specific.
For example, you may have a detective that is blind and travels everywhere with a service dog, or an FBI agent who has a shady past and is eager to solve a difficult case. Think about different traits and qualities you can give your characters to make them unique and not a stereotype.

, To get a better sense of the genre, read examples of thriller novels. Try to read a variety of different thrillers and different types of thrillers so you get a sense of what is being published. You may read:The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris

The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson

Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier

The Talented Mr. Ripley by Patricia Highsmith

The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson

, To make writing the novel much easier, plot out your novel. Use a plot diagram to plot out the novel, making sure you keep the stakes high and the conflict going in the plot. A plot diagram will have exposition, the inciting incident, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.


You can also use the snowflake method to plot out the novel. The snowflake method consists of a one-sentence summary, a one paragraph summary, character synopses, and a spreadsheet of scenes.

, Start the thriller novel with a scene right in the action. Starting with action will throw the reader into the scene right away and assure them they are in for some major thrills. Introduce the crime or describe the protagonist in a the middle of a dilemma or major issue.Avoid including backstory or exposition in the opening pages of the novel. You can do this later. Start with the most interesting or engaging moments first.
For example, you may start a thriller with a description of a killer hunting down a victim. This will immerse the reader in the world of the story right away.

, As the novel goes on, make sure the stakes are always high for the main character and for the reader. This means putting your main character in situations that are difficult or risky. Keep conflict going between characters. Create obstacles that get in the way of the character solving a crime or achieving what they want. Make the main character’s life full of complications or issues.For example, maybe you have a thriller where a young, eager FBI agent wants to solve a difficult case. You may make it difficult for the agent to achieve their goal by causing evidence to be lost in a fire or by having a witness go missing.

, Do not include any unnecessary information or information that does not further the plot. Make sure the action moves forward continually in the novel and that the pace is always fast. Thriller are at their best when they are action packed and focus more on plot than anything else.For example, rather than include long sections of backstory for your main character, focus instead on getting the main character from scene to scene. Weave in backstory into a scene when necessary and keep the plot moving at all times.

, Most good thrillers will have an exciting climax, often three-quarters of the way into the novel. The climax is the moment when the stakes are the highest and the story is at its highest point of suspense and tension. Your main character may confront the antagonist of the novel in the climax. They may solve the main problem or issue in the story. Or they may come to a realization that shifts or changes their world view.


For example, the climax of the novel may be the moment your main character unmasks the killer. Or it may be when the main character realizes the solution to a major issue or problem in the story.

, Wrap up the novel on a high, suspenseful note. Rather than try to wrap up all the loose ends in the book, focus on ending on a scene that will keep the reader guessing. Show the main character making a decisive act in the last scene. Or have the main character come to a realization in the last scene that shows they have changed or shifted in the course of the novel.For example, you may have a long, elaborate foot chase at the end of the novel, with one last scene between the FBI agent and the killer.

, Once you have completed the novel, read over the first draft. Read it out loud to yourself. Notice if the draft moves quickly and efficiently. Check if there are any plot holes. Look for any moments where you can sharpen or deepen your characters.

, You can also get feedback from others on the draft to make it stronger. Show the draft to a writing group or to a writing mentor. Enroll in a thriller writing class and have the draft workshopped there.


You can also show the draft to friends and family for their perspective and advice. Be open to constructive criticism, as it will often make the novel stronger.

, Once you have received feedback on the draft, revise it for action, suspense, and plot. Ask yourself, is this scene as suspenseful as it could be? Is there enough action in the novel as a whole? Does the plot make sense and keep readers on the edge of their seat?"

, They will, most likely, teach you some great info about creepy novels.

, Make sure they sell antique novels, such as an old copy of Dracula or Frankenstein. People like you will be attracted to the same place(s).

, Try searching for stuff under 'suspense', 'mystery', or 'horror'.

,,, For example, if you decided that you were going to write about when you got abducted and had intercourse with a female alien, think of words like 'green', 'interesting', 'blob', and 'foreign'. Use these words to create your title, such as ""My Dinner Date With The Foreign Green Blob.""

, Be sure the opening sentence grabs the attention of your target readers. If we were to write, ""My Dinner Date With The Foreign Green Blob"", our opening sentence would sound something like: ""He kissed me and screamed out, 'Urgumbablappp! SHEEEEEEEEOUH!'"" This immediately draws the reader in, making them want to read further.

, For example, in ""My Dinner Date With The Foreign Green Blob"", the main character is King Flapshunaba from the Planet Volkenar who visits earth for one night only. During his stay, he meets the lovely Audrey Rosenthal of Kansas City, Kansas. The two make love in the spacecraft after enjoying a romantic dinner in the starlight.

, For example, in ""My Dinner Date With The Foreign Green Blob"", Audrey Rosenthal is abducted by King Flapshunaba's brother, Prince Itchubadachako and traded as a sex slave in the outskirts of Uranus. Sad right? Sad, depressing endings are best for creepy novels.

, You have finally completed your creepy novel! Chances are, no one is going to want to read the piece of crap that you wrote.

Hell, why don't you even start a book club! Education is key! Stay in school, kids.

, For example, the sequel to ""My Dinner Date With The Foreign Green Blob"" could be titled, ""My Life As An Extraterrestrial Prostitute"", where Audrey Rosenthal sneaks out of the sex slave shop, but begins to sell herself for money, because she is so used to foreign sex.

Consider self-publishing your novel.",How to Write a Publishable Novel," There are many different genres in publishing, from literary fiction to mystery to romance to thriller. Choose a genre to write in so you can target a specific audience. Having a target audience can make your novel more appealing to publishers, especially if you choose a genre that is popular with readers.Genres like romance and mystery, for example, are popular with a large number of readers and are often read very fast. This means that publishers tend to accept more novels written in the romance or mystery genre to keep up with demand.;
, You want your novel to stand out among the stack of unpublished novels on a publisher’s desk. To do this, you should strive to create a story idea that is unique and not like other novels that have already been published in the past. Go for a unique idea that will catch the eye of publishers and the reading public.You may want to go on a tour of your local bookstore and look at the books that have been published in the genre you are writing in. You may flip through the first few pages of the books and read the synopsis on the back cover to get a sense of what is being published and what is being read.
You should then think about how you can create a story idea that is different from what has already been published. Maybe you add a unique twist to a common story idea, such as a thriller story about a serial killer who is a computer, rather than your run of the mill loner type killer.
Or, perhaps you pull from your own experience, where you use moments in your life to create a romance novel that stands out from what’s already out there. You may add in details from your personal life, for example, to create a romance novel that is about the pitfalls of finding love, rather than the more familiar images of fulfilling love in the romance genre.

, Your novel can also stand out by having a main character that is compelling and memorable. Give your main character unique traits or specific quirks that make them come alive on the page and feel different from characters that have been written before. You may also have supporting characters who are also strange and unique in your novel. This can make your novel feel distinct from what has already been published.You may include teenaged characters that identify as queer, for example, or characters that are biracial in your novel. This can make your characters more unique and compelling to readers. It also allows you to appeal to readers who have never seen themselves represented in a genre of writing before.

, Make your novel feel distinct by approaching plot in a non-traditional way. Though you can still use a plot outline to help you plan out your novel, you may play around with the standard idea of plot. This can help your novel stand out and allow you to expand your creativity as a writer.Rather than have the events in your novel appear in chronological order, for example, you may go back and forth in time. This can make your novel feel experimental and unique, especially if you are writing in a popular genre.

, Writing a novel takes discipline and focus. You will be more likely to complete your masterpiece if you follow a writing schedule, where you write a certain number of words or pages a day. You may also choose a certain time of day to write and commit to writing during this time every day for weeks, months, or years, depending on how long it takes to finish the novel.For example, you may set up a schedule where you write 500 words a day in the morning at your desk before you go to work. Or you may create a writing schedule where you write 10 pages of your novel when you get home after work, before dinnertime.

, Regardless of which genre you decide to write in, your novel should have some kind of central conflict. Having a central conflict will ensure your novel is engaging for publishers and readers. The central conflict should involve the main character of the novel in some way and it should make their life difficult or tricky. The central conflict should also propel the action of the novel forward.For example, if you are writing a novel in the mystery genre, you may have a strange murder that occurs at the beginning of the novel. The murder could then be the central conflict of the novel that causes the main character to get involved in the case. The main character will then need to deal with the central conflict throughout the novel.

, A strong novel will have a strong narrative voice. The narrative voice of your novel could be the first person narrator who is also the main character in your story. Or you may use a third person narrator who comments on the action of the story. Having a strong, distinct narrative voice in your novel will make it stand out to publishers and be more attractive to potential readers.For example, your mystery novel could be narrated by the person who has been murdered at the start of the novel. Your narrator may then watch the action from above as a ghost and follow around the main character, a detective trying to solve the case. This is a unique approach to narrative voice that could help your novel stand out from other mystery stories.

, A novel riddled with cliche will likely not grab the attention of publishers or readers. As a writer, you should strive to create the most original descriptions and details you can come up with. Avoid cliches in your writing, which are phrases that have become so familiar they have lost their meaning.You should try to describe your characters in ways that are not cliche or familiar. For example, rather than use vague descriptions like “he was tall, stunning, and handsome”, be more detailed and specific. You may write, “He was tall for being so young, with green eyes and a dark complexion that would be considered ‘attractive’.”
Use sensory details in your descriptions of settings and scenes, where you describe how something or someone smells, sounds, feels, tastes, and looks. For example, you may describe a room based on how it smells and how the furnishings feel against the hands of one of your characters.

, Though you can try playing around with plot in your novel, it should still build to a strong ending. Having a memorable ending to your story can leave a lasting impression on a publisher and on your readers. You want to leave your readers satisfied by your ending but also a little unsettled. This will make your ending linger in the mind of your readers and potentially make your novel more likely to be published.For example, you may have a twist ending to your mystery novel, where the killer turns out to be the detective herself. This type of ending could leave your reader unsettled and surprised.

, Once you feel your novel is in good shape, you should take some time to polish it so it is at its best. This means reading the novel to yourself and out loud to ensure it reads well on the page. You may also show the novel to others to get feedback on it so you can improve it and make it as good as it can be.You may join a writing group or find a writing partner and get your novel workshopped. You can then take feedback from the group or your partner and improve your novel.
You should also make sure there are no spelling or grammatical errors in the novel, as you do not want to send it to publishers with typos.

, To increase the chances of your novel getting published, you should try to get into the hands of editors who are interested in the genre and style you are writing in. You should research published authors whose writing is similar to yours. You may then send your novel to the author’s literary agents and publishers.You may also make a list of the major publishing houses and then send your novel to an editor there who is interested in your genre of writing. For example, you may look for the editor of mystery novels at a publishing house if you are writing a mystery novel.
Keep in mind you may end up sending your novel to many different publishers and literary agents before you find the right fit. Be patient and be smart about who you send your novel to, as you want to try to contact editors and publishers that you think will show interest in your work.

, A query letter will be your first contact with potential agents and publishers. The letter will be a one-page summary of why your novel is worth reading and publishing. It should be concise, professional, and grab the reader’s attention. You should try to create a query letter that will really sell your novel, as this will increase its chances of getting published.Your query letter should include the title of your novel, the genre, the word count and a short summary of the novel. You can also include a short biography and mention any published work you have done in the past.

, You can improve your chances of getting published by attracting the attention of a literary agent. A literary agent acts as the go between publishers and writers. They will act on your behalf to help sell your novel to publishers. You can send in your work to literary agents or publish your work in respected magazines and literary journals. Your work could then catch the eye of literary agents who may offer to represent you.


Many literary agents take a small percentage of your book deal with a publisher. You may negotiate this with your agent once the time comes.

, If you do not seem to be able to land an editor, a literary agent, or a publisher for your novel, you may consider publishing the novel yourself. As a self-publisher, you will be responsible for the editing, distributing, marketing, and selling of the novel. But you will have complete control over your work and get your novel in the hands of readers.If you decide to self-publish your book, you may not reap as much money from your novel as you would if you landed a big publishing deal with a major publishing house. However, you may be eager enough to get your book out there that making money or getting the approval of a big publisher may not matter to you.

Identify the sections in a plot diagram.,
Create a strong set up.,
Identify the inciting incident.,
Create rising action.,
Write out the climax of the story.,
Identify the falling action.,
Create a resolution to the story.,
Play with moving around the sections of your plot diagram.",How to Write a Plot Outline1," One of the more traditional ways to structure a story is to use the triangle plot diagram, also known as Freytag's Pyramid. Freytag’s Pyramid is broken into six sections: the set up, the inciting incident, the rising action, the climax, the falling action, and the resolution. The diagram appears like a triangle or a pyramid, with the set up at the bottom of the triangle, followed by the build up of the inciting incident and the rising action. The tip of the triangle is the climax of the story, which is then followed by downward slant of the falling action and flattening out of the triangle, or the resolution of the story.This type of plot diagram is often used in novels to help structure the action of the story. It can be a useful way to make sure you have all the necessary elements of a story in your novel and many readers will respond positively to a text that is structured based on a plot diagram that has a rise and fall.
You can draw your own plot diagram and write out each section or plot point directly on it. Sometimes it can be helpful to have a visual reference as a guide for your story.;
, Though many novels start by folding the set up into the inciting incident, it may help you to write down your set up during the planning stages of your story. Identifying the set up of your story could also help you identify your protagonist as well as the themes or main ideas in your story.Your set up should include the setting of the story, information about your protagonist, and introduce the protagonist’s conflict. It may be a few lines that address these elements or an actual scene where your protagonist is speaking to other characters and moving around in the setting.
For example, the set up for the first book in the wildly popular Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, focuses on introducing the reader to the protagonist of the series, Harry Potter. It also introduces the reader to the world of the Muggles and the world of wizards at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

, The inciting incident in your story will be the event that changes the course of your main character’s life. It should take the protagonist by surprise and feel risky to the protagonist. Often, the inciting incident appears right after the set up is introduced in a novel.For example, in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, the inciting incident is when Harry is visited by Hagrid the Giant and told that he is a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts. This information changes Harry’s life and his trajectory as a character. He leaves his unhappy situation with the Dursleys in the Muggle world and journeys to Hogwarts with Hagrid. This incident then sets off a chain of events in Harry’s life.

, The rising action, or the upward slope from the inciting incident to the climax, is often the longest section of a novel or a story. In the rising action section, you will develop your characters, explore their relationships to each other and pace out all the important events that will allow you to get to the climax. The rising action should get more suspenseful the closer you get to the climax.Because the rising action section is often made of a series of events, you can outline each event in your plot diagram. Make sure the events become more suspenseful and continue to up the stakes the closer you get to the climax.
For example, the series of events in the rising action of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone could be outlined as follows:

Harry goes shopping with Hagrid for his wizardry supplies on Diagon Alley, including his magic wand.
Harry leaves the Dursley home and takes the train to Hogwarts on the 9 ¾ platform. He then meets three main characters in the series: Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry’s nemesis, Draco Malfoy.
Harry is given the Invisibility Cloak.
Harry finds out about the Philosopher's stone and shares this information with Ron and Hermione.



, The climax of your story is the high point and should feel like the most important moment for the protagonist. It could be a major setback or challenge that the protagonist has to deal with or a big decision the protagonist has to make. Often, the climax will be an external event that the protagonist has to survive to get to the falling action and the resolution of the story.For example, in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, the climax of the story appears when Harry realizes there is a plot afoot to steal the Philosopher’s stone. He then teams up with Ron and Hermione to try to protect it.

, The falling action is usually the most action-packed part of the story, where your story is speeding down the tracks of the roller coaster to reach the resolution. The reader should be in suspense throughout the falling action and learn how the protagonist deals with the climax of the story.Your falling action may occur over several chapters, especially if the protagonist is dealing with a big climax. The falling action can feel like a journey, albeit a fast paced one, that gets the characters to the resolution of the story.
For example, in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry has to make a series of life or death decision to save the Philosopher’s Stone from falling into the wrong hands. This quest is spread out over several chapters and is paced so that Harry has to defeat several obstacles to achieve his goal.

, The resolution to a story is sometimes called a conclusion, as it occurs at the very end of the novel. It should let the reader know if your protagonist is successful and achieves what he wants, or if he fails. Often, the resolution also reveals how the protagonist has been changed over the course of the book. This could be a gradual change that is physical, mental, psychological, or all of the above. Your protagonist should view their world differently at the end of the novel than they did at the beginning of the novel.For example, in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, the resolution occurs when Harry confronts Professor Quirrell in the final room that contains the Philosopher’s Stone. Quirrell is soon revealed to be possessed by Lord Voldemort and Harry struggles with Voldemort for the Stone. Harry passes out during the struggle and wakes up in the school hospital, surrounded by his friends. Dumbledore tells Harry he survived because of the power of the love of his mother. The Stone is then destroyed, Voldemort goes back underground, and Harry returns to the Dursley’s for summer break.

, Though starting with the standard plot diagram can be useful in the drafting stages, you should also consider adjusting the sections and moving them around in subsequent drafts of your story. Consider starting with the inciting incident right away and then moving into the set up, or moving the climax so it appears at the very end of your story, rather than in the later half of the story. Playing around with the plot diagram can make your story feel more unique and dynamic.Keep in mind not all stories have happy endings. In fact, some of the best stories have very unhappy endings. Consider the resolution as a way to explore the changes in your protagonist, even if they are small, rather than giving the protagonist exactly what he or she wants. Sometimes, a resolution that ends with failure can be more interesting than one that ends with success.

Write a one sentence summary.,
Create a one paragraph summary.,
Create character synopses.,
Make a spreadsheet of scenes.",How to Write a Plot Outline2," The Snowflake method is often used to structure novels, but it can be used to structure short stories too. This method allows you to work through the plot of your story in increments and structure the scenes required for your story in a spreadsheet. To get started with this method, you will need to come up with a one sentence summary of your story. It should sell your story and highlight the big picture.Keep the summary short and sweet, using non-specific descriptions and terms with no names. Try to use 15 words or less and focus on tying a larger theme with character actions.
For example, your one line summary might read: “A seemingly perfect marriage is disrupted when the wife disappears.”

, Once you have your one line summary, you should expand it to a full paragraph that describes the story set up, the major events, the climax, and the ending of the story. You can use the structure of “three disasters plus an ending” where three bad things occur in the story and build up to the climax of the story. The idea is that things only get worse and worse for the protagonist until they reach the climax and then the ending or resolution of the story.Your paragraph will be made up of five sentences. One sentence should describe the story set up. There should be one sentence for each of the three disasters. Then, one final sentence that describes the ending.
Your paragraph may read: “Nick and Amy have a seemingly perfect marriage and appear happy to those who know them. But one night Amy disappears under mysterious circumstances and foul play is suspected. Nick is soon accused of her murder and must defend himself in court. Nick discovers that Amy faked her own murder and is still alive, but determined to put him in prison. Nick confronts Amy and they argue, but ultimately, Amy blackmails Nick into staying in the marriage.”

, Once you have your summary, you should focus on fleshing out your characters. Create a storyline for each of your main characters, noting important characteristics like the character’s name, the character’s motivation, the character’s goal, the character’s conflict, and the character’s epiphany. Each character’s storyline should be about one paragraph long.Your character synopses do not need to be perfect or polished. You will likely go back and tweak them later or deviate from them when you start writing scenes of the novel. But at least the synopses will help you get a better sense of your characters and where they fit within your story.
An example character synopsis might be: “Nick is a thirty five year old reporter who is laid off from his job after ten years in the business. He has been married to Amy for ten years and views her as his golden bride, his ideal wife and partner. He struggles with his lack of employment, especially because Amy comes from a wealthy family and has recently inherited a large sum of money. He believes he needs to be the provider in the marriage and is threatened by Amy’s financial independence and success in her career. When Amy disappears, he is conflicted by his need to find her and his unhappiness in his marriage to her. He eventually realizes that Amy has set him up and is trying to frame him for her disappearance.”

, Once you have written character synopses for each of your main characters and have your one paragraph summary, you should try to expand your summary into scenes using your characters. The list of scenes will help you get a better sense of the overall plot of the story.


Use a spreadsheet program to organize the scenes, as this will make it easy to write out each scene in order. Depending on how long your story is, you may have 50 scenes or over 100 scenes. Create two columns in the spreadsheet, one for the POV character in the scene and another column to explain briefly what happens in the scene. Then, list the scenes one by one, using your summary as a guide.
For example, one entry might read: “Nick discovers Amy is missing. POV character: Nick. What happens: Nick comes home for a long night working at the bar and finds the front door has been kicked open. He also finds a pool of blood in the hallway and signs of a struggle in the living room, with turned over chairs and scratches on the walls. He searches the rest of the house but finds no sign of Amy.”
Continue to do this, creating scenes that correspond to your plot summary. You should then have an outline of your plot and a list of scenes that correspond to your plot. This should make it easier to then put the scenes together and form a cohesive story.

"
"
Divide the outline into three acts.,
Summarize the opening scene and the inciting incident.,
Describe the main problem or conflict.,
Summarize the major disaster or climax.,
Describe the resolution or wrap up.",How to Write a Plot Outline3," To create a plot outline for a text that you were assigned in a class, not an original text, divide your outline into three acts. Most novels and books can be broken down using the three act structure.Use a word processing document or a piece of paper to create three distinct sections, titled Act 1, Act 2, Act 3.
Plot outlines are usually one to two pages long, depending on the length of the book. Aim to be concise and focus on the key points of the plot.

, Start Act 1 by describing the opening scene of the book. The opening scene will often establish the characters and the setting. The protagonist of the book is usually in the opening scene as well. Keep the summary short, about 100-150 words. Note the key details of the opening scene, including the names of the characters, any physical details or personality traits mentioned, and the setting.The beginning of your plot outline for Act 1 should also include the inciting incident, which sets your character on a quest or mission. The inciting incident may also lead to the main conflict in the novel.
For example, in Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, the inciting incident of the book occurs when Atticus agrees to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a white woman.

, The final section of Act 1 will focus on the main problem or conflict in the novel. The main problem or conflict will be the biggest obstacle the protagonist has to deal with or face. It will raise the stakes of the story and cause the protagonist to make a decision or act in a certain way. The inciting incident usually feeds into the main problem or conflict.For example, in Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, the main conflict occurs as a result of the inciting incident, as Atticus’ decision to defend Tom Robinson leads to the abuse of Jem and Scout by the other children and members of the community.

, Act 2 will usually build up to the major disaster or climax of the novel. The disaster or climax often occurs about ¾ of the way into a book or 75% of the way into a story. You may note several smaller incidents that occur as rising action, leading up to the climax.For example, in Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, the rising action occurs as the trial for Tom Robinson begins and then plays out over a series of chapters. Though Tom Robinson is acquitted of the charges, the white woman’s father, Bob Ewell, still seeks revenge against Atticus. The climax of the novel occurs when Ewell attacks Jem and Scout. Luckily, Jem and Scout are saved by Boo Radley.

, The final Act of the novel, Act 3, will contain the resolution of the novel. The resolution or wrap up will indicate the end of the protagonist’s journey. The protagonist usually reaches a new understanding or a realization that she did not have at the beginning of the novel.For example, in Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, the protagonist, Scout, realizes that she misunderstood Boo Radley and comes to sympathize with Boo as a person. She also embraces her father, Atticus’, advice to demonstrate sympathy and understanding for others, rather than hatred or prejudice.

Look at how the prologue fits with the rest of your novel.",How to Write a Prologue for Your Novel," One way to use a prologue is to provide backstory on a character or several characters. This can help you, as the writer, avoid using other tricks like flashbacks or inserted backstory in the novel. This option is useful if you are struggling to cover the details of a character’s past within the action of your novel.However, many writers argue against using a prologue as a way to dump a whole bunch of backstory, or past information, on the reader. Instead, the backstory in the prologue should feel essential to the rest of the novel and contain information that could not be placed anywhere else in the novel.
A backstory heavy prologue should reveal the origin of the quest or mission in the novel and provide the reader with information about the past that leads up to the present action in the novel. This could be the history behind an event, like a war or a conflict, that is touched on in the novel or the history of a character who is important to the novel., Many writers use a prologue as a hook that intrigues the reader. This type of prologue should raise compelling questions in the reader’s mind. It should give the reader a reason to turn the page and set up the reader with questions and/or images that will be addressed in the novel.A hook prologue could present a scene that introduces character and action that become very important in the novel. It could also foreshadow what is going to happen and allow your reader to briefly meet one of your characters or several of your characters.

, Some writers will use a prologue as a framing device, where a character is motivated to sit down and write the novel. The character in the prologue will then serve as the narrator for the novel.This method can be effective if your novel is voice driven and dominated by one narrator or one to two narrators. Writers will use prologues this way if they feel they need to let the reader know why the story is being told.

, Sometimes, a prologue is used to introduce a character’s point of view only once. The rest of the novel may be told from another point of view or several other point of views, and never focus again on the character in the prologue. This option is usually only done out of necessity or for a compelling reason, as you want the character's perspective to contribute to the novel as a while or reinforce themes or ideas present in the novel.This type of prologue gives you the opportunity to use a point of view that is not used much or at all in the rest of the novel. It also prevents you from violating your POV later in the novel, as you have already addressed the one character’s point of view in your prologue.

, To write an effective prologue, you need to first consider which prologue type fits with your novel. Often, prologues are written after the novel has been completed or when a novel is in its finishing stages. If you are writing a prologue cold, with no other chapters written, you should still think about how the prologue is going to affect the rest of the book.Think about how the prologue is going to enhance your novel and feel integral to the story. Will it reveal character, setting, or point of view? Will it provide backstory or frame the rest of the novel in a particular way?
If you are writing a prologue for a completed book, you should also think about how the prologue will interact with your first chapter. The prologue should hook your reader in and be just as strong as the details and scenes in your first chapter, if not better. The prologue should not regurgitate details in the first chapter or feel redundant in any way, as this will likely lead to a boring and dry prologue.

, Often, prologues are set within a scene, especially in action and thriller novels. This gives the prologue a fast pace and helps to engage the reader right away. You should think about which scene or scenes you would like to use in your prologue. This may be based on the character voice you decide to use for the prologue.Use the five senses to make the scene come alive for the reader, with a focus on what the scene smells like, feels like, sounds like, and of course, how it looks. Have your character interact with these elements in the scene and use your character as a way for your reader to access the scene.

, Most prologues are successful if they are short and to the point. Try to use only one to two scenes in the prologue, as too many scenes can make the prologue feel too long and drawn out. Often, using one powerful scene as the prologue can be very effective and draw the reader in right away.Avoid hopping around in time a lot in your prologue, as this can make the prologue feel confusing or jumpy to the reader. Try to stay in one time period or within one to two time periods so the prologue does not become too long.

, If you decide to use your prologue as a way to access a certain character’s point of view, make sure you get into the voice of your character. Think about how the character might speak to others and to themselves. Consider the age, background, and gender of the character, and how this might inform the character’s voice or style of narration.If you are using the prologue as a way to access a character that does not appear again in the novel or only appears as a minor character, use the prologue to really explore the character’s perspective. This is your opportunity to show the reader more about the character and delve into what makes the character tick.

, If the purpose of your prologue is to reveal the past moments in a character’s life or to discuss the history of a character, you should make sure there is enough backstory in the draft. Include engaging details from the character’s past and have the character show why these details are important or necessary to the rest of the story. Though the backstory should be about the character, it should also connect to the larger themes or ideas in the novel., A good prologue is usually no more than three to four pages total. Read over your draft and trim it down. Remove any details are are not necessary to the overall story or nice to have. Keeping your prologue short and to the point will make it that much more effective and ensure your reader stays engaged enough to move on to chapter 1., The pace of the prologue should be quick and brisk. Avoid over explaining something or giving away too much information to the reader, as you will have an entire novel to do this. You do not need to cram the prologue with information that might fit somewhere else in the novel. Keep only the essential details.One way to check the pace of the prologue is to read it out loud to yourself or to someone else. Mark any run on sentences or awkward moments in the draft and work them over until they sound smooth and to the point.

, Once you have edited your prologue, you should place it in front of your chapter 1 and look at how it fits. Does it feel like an engaging start? Does it contain any information that is also in chapter 1? Does it strengthen the novel overall?Your prologue should be strong enough to stand on its own, separate from the novel. It should almost read like a short story, with a contained story line and a conflict. However, unlike a short story, the ending of your prologue should remain open. It can introduce a conflict that will be resolved or addressed later in the novel, leaving the reader wanting more.

Use the proper style.,
Make sure you hit the most important points.,
Avoid wordiness.,
Start the synopsis with your main character.,
Focus on the beginning.,
Make sure your transitions flow.,
Edit, edit, edit.",How to Write a Novel Summary," You can write a synopsis before you write your novel, although be prepared for it to change and you to have to rewrite the synopsis. However, the synopsis can be helpful to avoiding plot holes and making sure the story flows.


If you find, as you're writing your synopsis, that your story has plot holes and things that don't make sense, you may need to go back and do some rewriting for your story.;
, You have to think of the synopsis as a distinct thing, separate from the novel or query letter. It's the summary of a novel's narrative structure, that has a clear beginning, middle, and end. It describes the main characters and the main conflicts.


Different agents and publishers will detail different page lengths for a synopsis, although rarely over 3 pages. A good rule of thumb is to keep your synopsis as short as possible while still covering important plot and character developments.

, Before you get writing your synopsis, go back through your novel and note down the most important plot points in each chapter. You're not going to write a chapter by chapter plot summary, but this will help you when you're detailing the over-arcing plot.


Give each chapter a couple sentences. For example (if you had written Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) for Chapter 1 you might say: Harry Potter, whose parents, Lily and James Potter, are murdered by the evil wizard Voldemort, is sent by Professor Dumbledore to live with his estranged aunt and uncle. Although a baby, Harry managed to defeat Voldemort when he tried to kill him.
You'll want to give more space and attention to the first chapter and the chapter with the climax of the story, as these chapters will have more background information on characters and plot, as well as an emphasis on plot resolution.
Make sure that you include the ending. The point of the synopsis is to explain the story in a clear manner so that an editor or literary will know that they can market it. If they don't know how the story ends (along with the character development that takes place), they won't know if they want to sell the story.

, You need the editor or literary agent to know what happens in your story in the most succinct way possible. This means, you have to focus on the main plot and the important points that drive the story. Since you'll have to leave out a lot of things, you'll need to make sure that the main plot has enough of the plot points to make sense.Use a because/then type structure. Picture each sentence beginning with ""because/then"" as you write. For example (using Pride and Prejudice): Elizabeth is overcome with worry for her sister Lydia's elopement with Mr. Wickham, which she tells to Mr. Darcy. (Because Elizabeth is overcome...then she tells Mr. Darcy).
Focus on character arc, or rather focus on the evolution of the main character from the start of the book to the end. How are they different at the end of the book as opposed to the beginning? What has caused these changes?

, You don't want to start naming every single character that appears in your novel, because otherwise your synopsis is going to balloon out at an alarming rate. Instead, only discuss the most important characters (like the main character(s) and the antagonist(s), etc).


Bold the first mention of each characters name, so that it makes it easier to see.
Give each of these important characters a quick character sketch, which can even be as simple as a few descriptive words. To use the Harry Potter example again: you would name Harry Potter (11-year old wizard, Harry Potter), Ron Weasley (Harry's best friend, who feels overshadowed by his large wizarding family), Hermione Granger (Harry's other best friend, a know-it-all witch, who strives to be the best in every class). Then you would name Lord Voldemort, Professor Dumbledore, Professor Snape, and Hagrid. You would probably include Malfoy, as well.

, There is a specific writing style that is necessary for writing a proper synopsis. If you don't follow along with it, your writing will come off as unprofessional and will make the editor or agent less likely to consider your work.Use active voice and third person, present tense. For example: Harry catches the snitch in his mouth, thus winning the Quidditch game for Gryffindor.
Strive for clarity. You have to make sure that you're presenting a clear and concise picture of your novel's main plot and character development. Don't get sidetracked into side plots and minor characters.

, There are four basic things that you need to make sure that you've gotten across in your synopsis. These are core conflict, main characters, what's at stake for the main character, how the conflict is resolved.


For Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the core conflict is keeping Voldemort from rising again. Everything else (Quidditch, Snape's hatred of Harry, Harry and Malfoy's hatred of one another) is side plot.
To use Harry again: what's at stake is him confronting the person who tried to kill him and who killed his parents, as well as saving the wizarding world from Voldemort.
The conflict is resolved (spoiler) by keeping the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort.

, Wordiness is one of the biggest problems that can make your synopsis look unprofessional and bad. Really work to cut down your descriptors and your descriptions of scenes so that only the most pertinent information is there.


For a too wordy example (using Pride and Prejudice): After sitting in silence for a while and making awkward conversation, Mr. Darcy proposes marriage in the worst way possible to Elizabeth, who rejects him by telling him that he couldn't propose to her in a way that would make her want to marry him. They have a big argument, involving slander against Elizabeth's family, Mr. Darcy's treatment of Mr. Wickham and his taking Mr. Bingley away from Jane.
For a more concise example: When Mr. Darcy proposes marriage to Elizabeth, she rejects him, by bringing up his bad treatment of Mr. Wickham, as well as her sister, Jane.

, Just like you want the first paragraph of your novel to hook your reader into the story, you want the first sentence of your synopsis to hook your reader into continuing. A good way to do this is to start with your main character in the beginning.


For example (using Lord of the Rings): When Frodo's guardian passes along a magic ring, he is drawn into the ultimate conflict between good and evil and the conflict's outcome rests in his hands.

, The beginning is incredibly important because it is where you set up things like character, background for the story, where it is set, what are the problems that the main character is facing. The beginning of the novel is the foundation and you have to make sure you include enough of that to explain what is going on in the story.For example: The arrival of a new eligible bachelor in town changes Elizabeth Bennet of Longbourn's life. Elizabeth, the second eldest of five daughters, comes from a family of moderate income and little sense, which makes her unlikely to ever marry well.
The who is Elizabeth, the background is her town and family, the problem is that her family is ridiculous and she's unlikely to marry in a time when that was incredibly important for a woman.

, Take your chapter by chapter summary and condense this down so that only the most important points, the ones detailing main character or main plot development, remain. You'll need to make sure that everything flows into one another.Each paragraph has to segue logically into the next paragraph. If you need switch ideas, make sure that you transition appropriately. For example: if you talk about Elizabeth's refusal of Mr. Darcy, and the revelations about Mr. Wickham, you can transition into what is happening at home in Longbourn and Elizabeth's sadness about her sister's missing Mr. Bingley.

, Once you've written it all out, read your synopsis multiple times. Check over the flow of your plot and make sure that everything makes sense and leads in a logical direction. Read over with an eye towards character development and whether everything follows logically there.


Have a trusted friend or family member look it over, preferably someone who has also read your novel. They can let you know of anything you're missing in the synopsis.
Cut any extraneous word choices and try as best you can to further condense everything, while still maintaining clarity.

Do not decide on the title first.,
Think of the time the book happens.,
Decide upon the viewpoint and tense.,
Think up of some characters.,
Choose a name for your vampire character or characters.,
Decide on the vampire's abilities.,
Decide how your vampire feeds.,
Decide whether to give your vampire character a family.,
Alternatively, decide that this vampire is totally alone in the world/region/wherever.,
Write a plot outline before you start writing the book.,
Start writing.",How to Write a Novel About Vampires," You can do this as the story develops.;
, Is it modern? It can be set at any time at all.

, Will it be first person (I, me) or third person (he, she, it). You won't usually find a book written from second person point of view, which is you, you did, you will. That is really breaking the fourth wall (talking to your reader). The tense is usually either past or present. Past tense (was, happened) is the common tense for writings; it's common and works well, and is comfortable reading. Present tense is with current timing (is, is happening) and can work well, but carries a risk of uncomfortable reading along with it.

, Are you going to focus on a single vampire among humans (or elves, dwarves, aliens, or whatever)? Or, do you want a whole cast of vampires? Each character will need to be developed fully, so start out with a few until you're more experienced with writing.

, Names like Dracula sound cool but are unrealistic (unless you want your story to branch off from the original). Why can't a vampire have a normal name like Liam? You can also do a portmanteau of names, like if you are stuck between Katherine and Madeline, you could name her Catherine.


It also helps to decide how old your vampire is. Vampires may be be immortal or they may not be - interpretations differ on the subject - which means they don't necessarily have to be born in the current time period. So, your vampire character could easily have grown up in Victorian times, or during the Great Depression. Therefore, it stands to reason that your vampire would have a name consistent with the time in which they were born.

, Can he change shape? Can he fly? It is up to you on the abilities of your vampire(s). Dracula and other historical vampires can float, go through locked doors, no reflection and can melt away into the shadows. Feel free to use these basics to help build your character.


Describe how the vampire feels about what he is doing. Is he proud? Is he ashamed or scared? How does your vampire feel about being like this? Does he/she try to hide it, or run free and kill those who find out?
A general rule is that vampires are burnt by sunlight. However, it is possible to have a vampire not burnt by sunlight. Look at authors like Stephanie Meyer (Twilight series) and Christopher Pike (Last Vampire Series). But, it's best to have some sort of reaction to sunlight. Or, you could let your vampires wear a special necklace or something that makes them have no effect by the sun.

, Most of the time, tradition requires that a vampire drink blood. While this is the most globally accepted idea about vampires, this too is up for negotiation when you're writing fiction. Some would argue it should always be the case but some artists have found ways around it––think of Count Duckula, the vegetarian duck vampire––as one alternative. And there are various ways of surviving off the blood of non-humans. Whatever you're take, be sure to sort out this aspect of your vampire character too.

, This can help to develop the character considerably, by allowing exchanges with other family members.


Are there siblings? If so, how many?
Come up with interesting names for the family members. In particular, what is the last name for your vampire family?
Is this family noble, middle class, hard laborers or a bunch of rogues? Try to avoid the ""rich and famous"" line; perhaps for a change, these vampires have never known wealth and have a penchant for frugality!
Has your vampire created a vampire? You could also make a sire or 'child' for him. Vampire ones, of course. Does he/she hate his sire/child? Do they hate him/her? Does he have a close relationship? Are they friends, rivals, or lovers?

, This can create a lot of the reason behind why the vampire chooses to pursue certain people, out of loneliness or seeking a sense of belonging, etc.

, The plot will give you kind of a guideline, necessary to make a focused book. It's harder to write the book with no sense of direction than it is with a solid idea of the backbone of the plot. That said, some people do prefer the directionless style and it is highly dependent on the way your own creativity comes through. Do a little experimentation.


Even with a plot, sometimes your character will surprise you. That's the art of good writing, letting your character inform you as he or she changes through writing.
Remember that your vampires aren't human, so they will see things differently. That includes humans. This is an excellent chance to describe human nature the way you see it if you see it in an unusual way.
When explaining how the people were changed into vampires, tell it from their point of view, it's okay to change the viewpoints once in a while, especially in a vampire story.

, Develop your own method for writing regularly––this varies from author to author. The main thing, is to get started and then to find ways to motivate yourself to keep writing.


The way you write your story is up to who is going to see it. If you're posting it on a website, it's okay to have a few minor mistakes, but if it's being published, it needs to be near perfect, so be prepared for editors to pull it apart in some places.

Know what Homestuck is.,
Read Homestuck.,
Know quadrants and how they work.,
Know the characters.,
Be prepared for new terms.,
Be a part of the fandom!",How to Be a Homestuck Fan," Homestuck is a webcomic written, drawn, and animated by Andrew Hussie and is the fourth overall webcomic published on the website MS Paint Adventures. The comic started in April of 2009 and ended on April 13, 2016.;
, Homestuck is split into several ""acts"", with the first few acts often being the hardest to get through initially as they can seem rather boring. If you want to be a Homestuck fan, though, that'll be worth it. But be careful not to binge-read the entire thing, as you may miss on a lot of sleep!


It's best to read Homestuck on a computer, rather than a phone's internet browser. This may not seem important immediately, but a few acts into the story, you'll begin getting interactive flashes, some that need to be clicked on in order to go to the next page.
Don't skip over any pages, no matter how long or seemingly pointless it is - you may miss key parts of the story.
Make sure you don't skip over any logs, such as pesterlogs or dialogues. These contain the bulk of the story - you'll miss a lot if you ignore the text, and will cause later events to make very little sense.
Watch the flashes. Some of them can last quite a while, but they contain vital parts of the story. If the flash has mini-games, play them - they can be quite entertaining!
Read the intermissions. They show other characters not as included in the story as well, but play a role in the background. The intermissions, especially the first, may seem incredibly complex, but you don't fully need to understand everything that's happened in order to understand the later story.

, Quadrants are a complicated system of four types of troll romance. If you don't know the quadrants, you won't be able to understand the relationship between the trolls. Don't panic, though, as these don't appear for a while.



Matespritship, or the flushed quadrant, is known for being romantic love, and is the only quadrant that the humans know and consider to be romantic. It's the equivalent of dating or marriage, and involves two trolls. The symbol used to represent it is <3.

Moirallegiance, or the pale quadrant, is considered a best-friend type of relationship. It isn't romantic in nature, but the trolls are very close, with one sometimes serving the purpose of calming the other one down, and involves two trolls. The symbol used to represent it is <>.

Auspiticism, or the ashen quadrant, is similar to a ""mediated"" relationship - two trolls may severely dislike each other, but another one will step in and mediate the relationship. It involves three trolls, and the symbol used to represent it is c3<.

Kismessissitude, or the caliginous quadrant, is when two trolls hate each other, are constantly trying to best each other, and will do anything to infuriate each other. It involves two trolls, and the symbol used for it is <3<.

, Every character plays an important role in the story, even if they seem like very minor characters. There are many parts in Homestuck where someone thought to be quiet or unimportant turns around and practically becomes the star of the show!


Be aware that everyone has different typing styles - and the trolls in particular can be quite difficult to understand. However, most characters always type in the same way throughout the story, so it's easy enough to decipher what's meant to be what.
It can be easy to slip into hating a character because of their actions or due to them not appearing enough to get a good handle on their personality, but try to think of their redeeming qualities. No character is ""all good"" or ""all bad"", regardless of who they are.

, There are several words that may not make sense before reading Homestuck, and if you skip through parts of Homestuck, you won't understand a word when a troll is talking about their lusus or what it means when someone has gone ""trickster"". This is another reason not to skip through parts - you'll miss out on vocabulary. However, if you can't remember the vocabulary from Homestuck, you can search it or bookmark any relevant pages.

, The comic is incredibly long, so you've shown perseverance simply by reading it. Feel free to contribute to the fandom through cosplays, digital art, fanfiction, crafts, or anything else - and remember, you don't have to understand everything or to have read the whole comic to call yourself a Homestuck fan!

Talk to successful comic self-publishers about how they handle comic-cons.",How to Sell Your Own Comics at Comic Con1," If you only have one or two, the comic-con may not prove to be financially successful and could even put your finances in the red. Ideally, you want potential fans to pick up a series of your comics at a somewhat discounted price.;
, Popular conventions sell out over a year in advance. Each comic-con has a website with a section for exhibitors, so that you can fill out the form, pay a fee and choose to be listed as a small press or an exhibitor.


On some forms, you may have the choice of table. The sooner you sign up, the more ""early bird"" discounts on tables you will receive. You can also request placement by high traffic areas, such as the entrances and food tables.
Read all of the terms and conditions––make sure that you qualify properly.

, It's usually held in mid-July. Go to comic-con.org and click on the exhibitor section. As you fill out the form, check the small press section, which gives prime booths to people who publish their own and a few other comics.


San Diego's Comic-Con has a Small Press Committee that decides who will be granted small press space in the exhibit hall. You may need to submit your comics for consideration, well in advance to choosing. Then you will be able to purchase space in the area.

Get to know other comic-con regulars as well. Many people travel to the same conventions, many of whom may be involved in different parts of comic promotion. As well as trading advice and ideas, they can watch your table when you need to leave and you can do the same for them.
Networking is a big part of marketing and selling books. People are more likely to promote or recommend your comics if you know the people in charge and the successful sellers. Go early to the booth and talk to people regularly.

, You may want to make large banners with illustrations of your characters, as well as character write-ups, brochures and handouts. You need to have an attractive booth to attract customers.


Work on your elevator pitch. It should be less than 30 seconds and explain the inspiration and creation of the comic. Include anything that differentiates your comic from any others.

, Display is your marketing weapon bar none at the actual convention. Comics sitting flat on a table aren't anywhere near as captivating to passers-by as comics standing upright on a stand. Set up your table at home as if you were attending a comic-con. Stand back and observe it and have some friends and family members check it out too. Then ask for everyone's opinion, as well as your own. It's likely that you will find constructive ways to make changes that improve the attractiveness and draw of your display.


Consider covering the table with a cloth to make it look more uniform and warm.
Use book stands to put the display copies front and center of your display.
Consider using framed art as a conversation piece and attraction.
Include information cards in front of the comics.
Add business cards, flyers with URL links, etc. for free takeaways from the table.

Be aware of some common issues that can arise when selling your comics at a convention:


You may get flustered and accept a bad deal for a stack.,
Be careful about what you do when there are no customers at your table.,
Note that you may find the popularity of your comic content varies across the states.",How to Sell Your Own Comics at Comic Con3," Either be very good at doing math in your head or have your calculator with you and all of your costs and expected profits. If someone comes up to you and tries to hustle a really good deal for a stack of your comics and you can't work out quickly whether or not you're still making a profit or selling them for less than it cost you to produce them, saying yes can cost you financially. Be sure to say ""no"" or ""come back later and I'll seal the deal"" if you feel rushed and unable to work this out with care.
Expect low offers and don't be offended. Play the game and reach the bargain that works for you.
Be prepared to pitch your comics. Use the elevator pitch you've already decided upon and embellish it as required. Do not be afraid to sell the comic's virtues––otherwise, how else will people know it's worth reading over other ones? Also, don't expect customers to ask you questions first––in most cases, they won't as they're waiting for you to do the opening.
Large crowds of people, people thumbing through your wares and people simply passing right by your stall can be an exhausting and sometimes demoralizing experience. Be prepared for this and stay positive. This is no different from any market stall experience and if you're prepared to have fun with the experience and simply go with the flow, you'll enjoy yourself and feel less overwhelmed.

, If you're drawing or reading, polite customers (the vast majority of people) will feel awkward about ""disturbing"" you. Moreover, it is better to stand than sit, to be closer to the front of your table than way back behind it, or even better out in front of it, and to be ready to talk to people as they pass by, holding out an open comic. Try to put yourself in the shoes of the customers and think about what would make you feel most comfortable.

, You may find that one comic does well in eastern US, while another is doing better out west. You'll only discover this by traveling to the various comic-cons.

Become a San Diego and other Comic-con regular, if you find them to be financially successful.",How to Sell Your Own Comics at Comic Con4," They are often held at expensive hotels and they involve a registration fee and travel expenses. If you have little money to spend on marketing, lower your costs by staying with friends and carpooling.

, Pick up the books and encourage people to look through them. Experiment with the balance between being friendly and being confrontational. Learn to respect body language signals quickly that tell you when someone wishes to observe the comic alone or is happy to engage in further conversation with you.

, If you plan to continue producing comics throughout the years, this is also a great way to release new issues, collectables or editions.

Look for moments that felt powerful to you.,
Use personal experiences that are funny or disturbing.,
Create a plot using your journal.,
Get creative with the material in your journal.",How to Write a Novel Using Your Journal1," Read through your journal and search for any moments that jump out at you. Highlight or underline moments may have been powerful and intense for you at the time. You could then turn these powerful moments into the beginnings of your novel.For example, maybe you have a vivid journal entry about the first time you experienced sexual desire as a young person. The entry may be full of powerful, confusing emotions. You could then use this intense moment in your life as the beginnings of a novel about a young person’s first sexual experience.;
, You can also generate a story idea that is funny or disturbing by using entries in your journal that come across as hilarious or unsettling when you read them now. Though the “you” at the time of the writing may not have realized how funny a situation was, the “you” of now can recognize this and use the situation in your novel.For example, you may have a journal entry on how and when you lost your first tooth. You may detail how terrified you were to lose your tooth and how your father removed it without hurting you. You may then use this experience as part of a novel about the relationship between a father and a daughter.

, If you are searching for a plot for your novel, you may be able to piece together one using your journal entries. The beauty of writing is that you can mix and match different moments and experiences in your real life to create a fictional story. Try stitching together several moments from different entries in your journal to create a plot for your novel.


For example, you may use several entries from your childhood as well as entries from your teenage years to create a plot that follows the evolving relationship between a father and a daughter.
You can then put these entries in a plot outline and add in details or moments that are entirely made up to add to the tension and conflict in your novel.

, Though you may feel the experiences and moments in your journal are real and important to you, you should be willing to play around and experiment with your journal entries. Just because something happened in real life does not mean it belongs in your novel. In fact, you should feel free to get creative and adjust or twerk real life moments so they are more engaging in your novel.For example, you may embellish a real life entry about your first day at high school. Though in real life your first day may have been uneventful or only mildly embarrassing, in your novel you may add details that make a character’s first day at a high school more dramatic and intense.

Protect comic books in plastic book bags.,
Prevent creases in bagged books with cardboard backing.,
Seal away rare comics in hard shell cases.,
Safeguard the value of comics with certification and slabbing.",How to Store Comic Books1," Wrapping your collection in comic book bags will be more than enough to maintain its condition. Buy bags at your local comic or hobby shop or purchase them online, and when you do, keep these three main comic book sizes in mind:

Current (1980 to present) size: 6 7/8″ x 10 1/2″
Silver Age (1950 to 1980) size: 7 1/8″ x 10 1/2″
Golden Age (pre-1950) size: 7 3/4” x 10 1/2”;
, Cardboard backing can also be bought at most comic and hobby shops. Be sure to verify the backing you buy is acid free. Cardboard that has acid won’t likely give your comics superpowers – expect damage instead., Hard shell cases are going to cost you a couple dollars apiece, if not more. Because of this, it’s only really worth it to store rare or valuable comics in containers like these. Buy these cases from comic and hobby shops.

Hard shell cases will be easier and safer to display. You may be able to attach an adhesive hook to the case so you can display the comic on a wall.

, To have this done, you’ll need to send your comic in to a recognized authority in rare and vintage comics, like Certified Guarantee Company. Your comic will be returned to you safely encased in plastic with its condition certified by an expert.

Each certified, slabbed comic should have a protective hologram and barcode. Should these be tampered with or damaged, the certification is invalidated."

Make a person from your journal a character.,
Use the voice and tone in your journal for a character.,
Combine several real life people to create a character.",How to Write a Novel Using Your Journal2," You can also use your journal to help you develop characters that feel real. Using the real-life details of a person you know well to create a character in your novel will allow you to make them feel more believable. They will also come across as more relatable to your reader.Look for real-life people in your journal that you find interesting or fascinating. Often, interesting characters will have specific habits and traits that may go against what is considered ""normal"" by society. This could be a weird quirk, like an intense interest in outer space, or a unique physical trait, like two different colored eyes or a unique sense of style.
For example, maybe your journal is dominated by times you have spent with your best friend during childhood. You could then turn your childhood best friend into a character in your novel, using physical details and mannerisms of your friend that you wrote about in your journal.

, You can tap into the deeper elements of narrative by using the voice and tone in your journal for a character in your novel. You can use the voice in your journal to create the voice of a character or the narrative voice of your novel.The voice in your journal, narrated by you, may shift with age. You may sound more young and dramatic in your teen years and then more resigned and mature in your older years. You could then use the voice in your journal entries from when you were a teen to create the voice of a teenage character in your novel.
You may also notice your tone shifts in your journal based on your age or your experiences at a certain point in your life. You can then use this tone if you are creating a character based on you at a certain age or a character going through similar experiences as you.
For example, you may notice you have a more immature tone during your teenage years, where you describe experiences as ""awesome"", ""sick"", or ""super dramatic."" As you get older, you may notice your tone shifts into being more mature and developed, describing experiences as ""difficult"", ""challenging"", or ""enjoyable.""

, Do not treat the material in your journal as sacred. Be willing to combine several real life people in your journal to create one character. This will make your character feel more detailed and nuanced.For example, you may cherry-pick certain slangs or ways of speech from several individuals in your journal to create the dialogue for one character. Or you may use the physical traits of several people to create the physical traits of one character in your novel.

Look for entries about traveling to a foreign country.,
Describe a certain place using notes from your journal.,
Include sensory details from your journal.",How to Write a Novel Using Your Journal3," Your journal can also be a good source to turn to when you are creating a setting for your novel, especially if you have traveled to different areas or countries in your life. Search through your journal for entries on your experiences while traveling in a foreign country. You could then use these experiences to inform a character’s experience in a foreign country.For example, perhaps you have always wanted to set a story in a small town in New Zealand. You could then look at entries from a family trip you took to New Zealand and use information from your journal as part of your research for your novel.

, You can also lean on your journal to help you describe place in your hometown or your local area, especially if you go there often in real life and write about it in your journal. Drawing on real life settings can help you create scenes that feel detailed and engaging in your novel. Use your journal to do this well.Maybe you use notes from your journal about a local diner to help you write scenes set in the same diner in your novel. Or perhaps you use your childhood home as a setting in your novel and use notes from your journal to help you make the setting feel realistic.

, Make sure you pull as many sensory details as you can from your journal, especially if you are setting your novel in a place you have been before. Often in our journals, we tend to describe how we felt in a certain moment, as well as what we smelled, tasted, touched, and saw. Use all of the sensory details in your journal to make a setting in your novel feel more alive.For example, if you are writing a scene in your novel about a fight between the father and the daughter characters in a local diner, you may include sensory details from your journal about a local diner in your area. Look at journal entries on time you spent in the diner and use the details in these entries to inform the scene in your novel.
Or, perhaps you are writing about a character's experience swimming in the ocean for the first time and you use your own experiences as a guide. You may lift notes from your journal that describe how it felt to dive into the warm water, feel the sand under your toes, and smell the seaweed and salt in the air. You could then use these sensory details in your novel to describe a character's first time in the ocean.

Store regular editions in cardboard boxes.,
Use plastic containers in place of cardboard for valuable comics.,
Keep books out of sunlight and away from the elements.,
Avoid stacking containers and storing them on the floor.",How to Store Comic Books2," Cardboard is cheap and fairly durable as long as its kept dry, which makes it ideal for your less important books. Slide bagged books into boxes so they’re standing upright. Avoid acid treated cardboard and packing too many books in a box, as both can cause damage.Generally, you want enough space left in a box so you can comfortably separate comics with your fingers to read titles, but not so much space that the comics are loosely upright.
Use a bookend or a suitable paper weight to hold comics in place for boxes with too few comics. Damage may occur if you allow books to flop around in the boxes.

, Plastic containers will generally offer you a little more protection than cardboard. These are also more resilient to water damage, and some may even offer an airtight seal to protect your comics from the elements.Comic books should be stored in plastic containers similar to cardboard ones: upright and firmly, but not tightly, packed.

, Sunlight causes pages to yellow and ink to fade. Too much moisture or dry heat, on the other hand, causes paper to warp or become brittle. A cool, dry, dark storage location will keep your comic books in the best condition for the longest time., Damage frequently occurs to comics when piled high stacks of containers collapse. Avoid stacking if it can be helped. Keep containers of comics off the floor with pallets and milk crates to prevent potential water damage.

Even cement that is dry throughout the year will conduct cold and draw moisture to your books."
"
Handle comics with clean hands, always.,
Control the storage environment.,
Keep books in a filing cabinet.,
Lock away ultra-valuable titles in safety deposit boxes.",How to Store Comic Books3," If you’re a collector, this needs to be your golden rule. After all, an errant speck of dirt or smudge of chocolate could drastically reduce the value of your collectible. Similarly, have any friends or prospective buyers wash their hands before touching comics.You may feel self-conscious making this simple request. Remember, you spent a lot of time and effort building your collection. Try saying, “This one’s pretty rare, would you mind washing your hands first?”

, Temperatures that are too hot or cold could damage the glue in the binding of some comics or cause the quality of the paper to change unnaturally. Humidity, as you probably already know, is another enemy your comic book must be protected from.


A dehumidifier in your comic book storage room is a great way of ensuring low humidity, which is ideal for book health.
An indoor storage location might be best if you’re concerned about the condition of your collection. It’ll be much easier for you to control the climate., A filing cabinet keep your bagged and backing boarded collection well-organized and protected from damage. If you have a filing cabinet with a lock, comic books stored inside will also be less likely to be stolen., These books should still be bagged and boarded, at minimum. Though if a comic is rare enough to be kept in a safety deposit box, you should really look into having that beauty certified and slabbed."
"
Look for quality service you can count on week after week.,
Look for the atmosphere you enjoy.,
Find out if the store is ""kid-friendly."",
Watch the way your money and security are handled.,
Look for value.,
Ask about their return policy.,
Decide if it's a ""good fit.""",How to Pick a Local Comic Book Store," It may take a little while to honestly appraise each store, but you will know what's right for you in a very few visits. Are you greeted and/or helped - or left alone, as may be your wish, to browse? If you have a reserve box or a pull list on file, are all your books available when they come out, or does your shop often sell them out from under you and make you wait? Do they miss your books often? It can take a week or two to iron out kinks because you're new, but after that, things should straighten out and you should be able to relax and breathe easy, knowing your books are being held for you.;
, Is the decoration of the store bright and welcoming? Clean? Well-organized? Or do you prefer a darker design, something with a bit more of a garage-sale feel? Or do you just like the whole Android's Dungeon & Baseball Cards vibe, where the sales clerk/owner is kind of a jerk, but knows everything? To each his own! Everyone is different. If you really love digging through bins of back issues, try to find a store that has some. After awhile, the staff should know you - do you get an opportunity to chat with some of them about what you're reading, what they're reading, news of the hobby, etc.? To some people, a visit to the LCS each week is a chance to meet and talk with others involved in comics. If the culture of this store is more of a ""silent treatment"", find another, where you will be welcomed and where someone can often take the time to chat, even if they work as you talk.

, If you have a family, you will want to make comics something you enjoy together. Some shops reach out to kids, while others are decidedly UN-friendly to children. This is one of those times when a little more driving time could be indicated - if your closest local shop is decorated in black, with flaming, naked women on all the posters adorning the walls, if the owner and staff are often regaling customers with off-color jokes or stories, then you might need to consider a different store. All stores are different, each has its own culture, but some are actually actively reaching out to kids - they're the next generation of comic book fans!

, Many stores that offer a pull box also ask you to either pay into an account (this is a pre-paid account) or leave a credit card number on file. This allows the store to order your books (most stores must pay for your books the day they are received) and hold them for you until you can get there to pick them up. Sometimes after a specified amount of time has elapsed, the store will charge your card for the items you ordered, even if you can't make it in to pick them up by that day. That's fine - you don't want to miss titles just because you got busy, and that's what a pull box is all about. But you do want to be certain that your money is handled responsibly. An occasional mishap is to be expected - everyone is human. But if you find that you're often trying to straighten out wrong charges or your money goes missing more than once or twice in a year (or more), you might want to look into another store.

, All stores are different. Some stores offer a discount in exchange for a yearly fee. Some offer a free copy of Previews, or the reserve box mentioned. Some don't discount at all. The reality is, it's not so much about the price you pay for your comics as it is about the overall value you get for your money. If it's important to you to visit a clean, organized, friendly shop where you can come in and hang out and chat awhile, then maybe if that shop doesn't offer a discount, pennies are not so important to you. You get other perks for patronizing that store. Or maybe it's all about the bottom line for you - if you don't care about clean, organized space, or about friendly staff or fellow enthusiasts, maybe you just want to find a dealer online - these typically offer the deepest discounts. However, dealing online and through the mail, if you get a damaged copy, you're stuck - you have to return it and pay shipping again, and then again when they ship the replacement - ugh. If you find a bad copy of something from your local shop, you can just handle it with them.

, Most shops offer credit only. Some will allow cash refunds. Maybe you'll never need it . But if you find yourself returning items often, it will be important to be aware of your LCS's return policy and be sure you can live with it.

, After you've taken a couple of weeks to introduce yourself, sample the service and merchandise, and just come in a few times, you'll have a feeling as to the ""rightness of the fit."" Maybe there's a store a few miles further away, but is a better fit for you. There's no harm in spending the extra couple bucks on gas if you find that you're much happier or more comfortable at a shop that isn't the closest to where you live. This is your hobby, and comics come weekly. If you're uncomfortable once a week while you're trying to enjoy your hobby, it's not a good fit. Whatever you decided, remember that this is what you do for fun and enjoyment, and be sure that you're having fun and enjoying yourself!

Understand satire.,
Be a good cartoonist.,
Learn what other satire cartoonists have created.,
Stay well informed about political and social events.,
Become known.,
Look for work but don't ditch the day job.,
Expect a rigorous selection process.,
Know the rules concerning defamation in your relevant jurisdiction.,
Expect potential repercussions.",How to Become a Satire Cartoonist," Satire is humor that relies on using irony, exaggeration or ridicule to expose and criticize vices or ridiculous actions either by an individual or by an institution of society or society in general.Not to be confused with sarcasm or spoofing, satire is much more refined. It seeks to highlight or expose the absurdity, inconsistency, or hypocrisy of behavior, attitudes, beliefs, or practices of a person, government, corporation, organization, etc. It's also humor that can get you into trouble, and crafting it can be hard to create as you seek to balance the irreverent with the political correctness or sensitivities surrounding the context.Satirists exist in all artistic fields, including novels, poems, plays, sculpture, movies, etc., as well as cartooning. In contrast to some of the other means for portraying satire, cartooning proves to be an excellent and fast medium for conveying short, witty messages that can be enjoyed by many people.
Cartooning is a natural vehicle for satire. Even those cartoonists who don't set out to deliberately focus on satire frequently rely on it as a form of humor.
Dave Brown thinks that satirical cartooning is ""a way of taking back a little power from the bullies who run our lives. A cartoonist is a lone assassin who keeps on firing away at them and hopefully, if he manages to get enough direct hits, he might find a little weak spot and help to bring them down"".;
, The ability to draw well is clearly a useful aspect of cartooning but a cartoonist has plenty of artistic leeway because it's expected that you'll develop your own eclectic style. Indeed, you may prefer to work with graphic art programs to create your satirical imagery and commentary, allowing you to combine many elements to create new images or recreate well known images in a satirical mold. Some things to keep in mind about being a good cartoonist over an average one include:


What you are depicting must be obvious and clear to the viewer.
Your style must be appealing to a viewer. Knowing how to draw caricatures well can be very helpful.
Understanding subtlety and nuance is essential in satirical cartooning.
Developing the ability to use both art and words well. Sarah Gillespie from United Feature Syndicate explained that while the skills of drawing well and writing funny are completely distinct, they are vital for a good cartoonist and it's hard to find such a combination.Be aware that you're combining journalism and art as one. Even so, it may feel that neither a journalist nor an artist will see you as fully integrated into their world. This shouldn't deter you, as visual commentary is an amazingly powerful way to engender public understanding; Andre Pijet suggests that: ""The satirical art is a product of intelligence and interior intellectual poetic sensibility, as any other form of artistic expression, but enriched with a wit and spicy seasoning."", Gain inspiration by looking through the work of existing and past satire cartoonists. While the idea is to still to develop your own style and satirical commentary, learning the approaches and humor styles of other cartoonists will benefit your knowledge and understanding greatly, enabling you to see tactics that you might not have considered before.


As well as looking at what works, also consider what cartoons were most controversial or didn't work, and why. For example, cartoons that depict religious figures have caused much controversy not only in recent years but throughout the ages. Some reasons for why cartoons don't work include poor context or lack of notoriety of the subject matter. Seek to understand what makes effective satirical cartooning, as well as knowing how far you're willing to challenge or conform with public sentiment.
Look at magazines, websites, and books that use satire regularly, such as The Onion, Mad (magazine), National Lampoon, etc. It can also help to watch comedy TV shows for ideas.
Look at other cultural depictions of satire over time. You'll discover that tolerance of satire and the extent of satire waxes and wanes over time, according to the culture and country in question. It will also help you to better understand that some cultures are more accepting of satire than others, although even under oppression satirists will attempt to speak their mind.

, Returning to the reality that a satire cartoonist is a ""visual journalist"", you'll need to be well informed about what's happening around you, every day. Spend some time each day reading and watching the news or relevant information streams, and forming your own opinions about events and issues as they unfurl. You'll also need to learn how to prioritize news stories so that you can run with the ones that seem to be striking a chord with audiences and if you work for a paper, it's likely that you'll also be discussing the news with the editor to reach a decision on what to go with; this will mean that you won't always be commentating on your pet topics, so be prepared to be flexible, well-rounded, and open minded.


Real life is often stranger than fiction; knowing current events well can avoid your work being overtaken by the even weirder reality!, Being known will increase your influence and the chances of receiving further work in this field. The idea is to expose your work to as many viewers as possible so that you start to build a reputation. Some suggestions include:


Creating your own publications and distribution, such as through a blog or website (like Deviant Art).
Do cartoons for local newsletters, local papers, and other local publications that are always in need of content. Keep a copy of every published cartoon for your portfolio.
Enter local, regional, national, and international festivals and competitions that accept cartoons or graphic artwork. This is the way that Andre Pijet gained increased recognition for his work,and the prize money can be handy to help your continued development. Look for newspaper competitions too: Dave Brown got his first cartooning job as a result of winning a competition run by The Sunday Times.
Broadening your repertoire to include comedy writing and not just cartooning, if you'd like to. This might increase your chances of being ""satirical"" for a living.

, If you're aiming to become a satirical cartoonist for a career, expect a hard path with many rejections, along with the possibility that you may not ever manage this goal. There are few full-time cartoonists working in what could be viewed as satirical or editorial cartooning positions, and those who are in such jobs tend to keep the position for a long period of time. Also, the publication has to be one that reflects your ideologies, beliefs, and views about society and its institutions. For example, Dave Brown says he fits well with The Independent but would be an uncomfortable and unlikely fit for The Telegraph. However, don't let the lack of positions dissuade you. Not only will a vacancy in such jobs come up now and then (for which you should already have positioned yourself well) but there are a lot of other possible outlets for your talent:


Apply to a newspaper for any cartooning or graphic design work. Once you're in, you can start working your way up, and can gradually develop your ""satirical"" style, persuading others to give you a chance.
Start a blog and regularly add your cartoons to it. Try to develop a large following through the usual methods of advertising blogs (for example, linking it to your Twitter and Facebook accounts, doing guest posts, etc.)

Freelance in as many publications as possible to build a reputation and portfolio. It is highly likely that any potential publisher will want to see a portfolio and a demonstrable timeline of satirical cartoons representing recent news events, to get a feel for your style, and the manner in which you translate newsworthy items into satirical commentary.

, If you do get noticed by a publisher keen to take on your work, don't sit on your laurels. The selection process is the hardest part of all this! Those making the decision about your ability to take on a role as a regular satirical cartoonist will be keen to find our what sort of a person you are. To this end, they'll seek to get to know you better with the aim of finding out if you can sustain providing the cartoons regularly over a set period of time.If you can already demonstrate this by way of a regular blog, publication in a school or university paper, etc., this will help you a lot.


Satire works best when people expect it.As such, you're best off looking for work with publications, both print and online, that normally carry satirical cartoon work. While a seriously focused publication might occasionally publish a satirical cartoon, this is rare and won't provide you a steady stream of income or much renown.
Expect a lot of competition. There are thousands of comic and cartoon submissions to newspapers, syndicates, and other publishers every day.You need to stand out from the rest.
Don't expect to be hired as a full-time employee. At the beginning, you'll be on probation to see if your style works out with readers. Even if your cartoons survive this test, it's likely you'll be freelancing for most publications.

, Although it might seem like drudgery to have to be across the legal issues behind satirizing situations and people, this aspect is vital to sidestepping potential lawsuits or even criminal charges under hate speech or blasphemy legislation (depending on your jurisdiction). Defamation laws will differ from country to country, but with the event of the Internet, some complainants might be willing to pursue matters across the borders, so keep in mind the basics of defamation. At its most basic, defamation laws seek to ensure that a person's reputation is not lowered or harmed when broadcast to other people; defamation seeks to balance free speech with an individual's right to enjoy a reputation free from indefensible attack. The defenses are as important as the ability of the offended party to take the action, as these may protect you from being sued successfully. Satirical cartoons sit in a bit of a gray area because the facts behind the cartoon may imply defamatory intent.


Focus on the intent principally. If your intent is good humor or a joke and not derision or insult, then there is less likelihood of it being defamatory. Dave Brown explains this as being about your motive: ""he difference between caricature and insult is the motive. You don't draw Nicolas Sarkozy as short just to laugh at the short man. It's to make a point about his political or philosophical inadequacy. You're saying he's a man of small stature not in inches, but in intellect. An insult is just based on a person's physical look. In a cartoon, you make that visual aspect a metaphor for what you think of them.""

Read up on the defamation laws in your country. Media help and legal information sites for laypersons are good places to start, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation., Being a satirical cartoonist means that you'll be pushing the boundaries a lot more often than cartoonists preparing merely humorous cartoons. The areas of politics and religion are especially touchy topics to satirize, as are social institutions deeply routed in cultural and historic practice.


Take note of your country's latitude on social commentary. In a democratic country, satirizing visible and powerful persons or topics has a high level of acceptance. However, this cannot be said for authoritarian or totalitarian societies, where criticism of anyone in authority or government activities can bring terrible repercussions.
Select your subject with care. When satirizing individuals, more care needs to be taken because it is easy to insult the person, causing them to seek recourse. Be especially careful when satirizing lesser known people; not only will it be much harder to satirize them because only those local people familiar with the person in question will get the message, but they're more likely to be concerned about their individual reputations than public figures who are aware that their high profiles leave them open to ""robust"" commentary.
Have a hide as thick as a rhino's. You will be criticized for making fun of sacred cows. Be well-informed, ready to stand by what you believe, and be able to take as good as you give!
Sometimes being a satirical cartoonist is life-threatening. For example, when the Danish publication Jyllands-Posten printed cartoons depicting a revered religious figure, death threats were issued against the cartoonists and various acts of violence followed."

Alphabetize each box of comics separately.,
Number each box prominently on the front (not the lid).,
Create your spreadsheet.,
Count your box and transfer your info to the spreadsheet.,
Access the data.",How to Organize Your Comic Collection with Excel," Rather than trying to keep the boxes in one consecutive alpha order spanning your collection (Example: All the ""A""s in Boxes 1 and 2, all the ""B""s in Box 3, etc.) just make each box its own domain. Whatever comics you have in a single box, alphabetize them within that box. Don't shuffle them around, because then what will happen if you get too many ""B""s in Box 3, and you have your ""C""s in Box 4? Do you make a Box 3.5 for your extra ""B""s? A collection is much harder to maintain that way.
, It doesn't matter how many you have, or what's in them, because you'll use the spreadsheet to figure out what box has which books inside later., You'll need 4 columns: Title, Issue #, Box #, Comments. In the screen shot supplied, there's also one for # of Copies. Make a Header Row and use the Freeze Pane option to make sure you don't scroll past it - this will keep it always visible so you know where you are at all times. It's all about making it fast and easy down the road.

, This is pretty straightforward. Go through each box, review each comic book, and record the information on the spreadsheet. It's helpful to use a simple tally sheet as shown to count up your box manually first (unless you can sit your boxes right next to your computer) and then transfer this data to your spreadsheet. Make sure to keep the comic books in alphabetical order (in the box - don't worry about the order as you're writing them on the sheet, because Excel will sort later).

, From here on, you'll be able to sort quickly through your collection for what you want, and you can sort by title, box number, or issue number. Here's the best way - you won't want to do the normal A-Z simple sort with a program like this.
Highlight your Title column, and then choose DATA from the toolbar at top, and Sort.






Excel will tell you that there's data next to the data you selected which will not be sorted, and asks What Do You Want To Do? Choose to expand the selection, then click Sort again.






It will ask you what to sort on next - there will be a window that says sort by, and has a field with a little drop-down menu that shows the names of your columns, so you'll want to choose title as your first search criteria, then issue #, then box # from the other two drop-down menus, as shown. They should all be checked as ascending for sort order. If you created a header row in a previous step, then be sure the little check box for header row is checked, or if you did not do it, be sure it's un-checked.






After the first time, it will always come up the same way. Now you can hit OK, and Bob's your uncle - All your comics are now in alphabetical order on your spreadsheet, and the program tells you where you put them. It's a very economical solution, both money-wise (because most people already have Excel) and time-wise, because who wants to start moving comics in Box #7 in order to make room in Box #2?

,How to Write a Children's Book1,
"
Read many children’s books.,
Consider which age group interests you as a writer.,
Decide whether your book is mostly words, mostly pictures, or a bit of each.",How to Write a Children's Book2," As you begin thinking of ideas for your children’s book, it’s very helpful to read others’ work. Go to your library or children’s bookstore and spend a few hours browsing. Think about which books appeal to you most, and why.


Do you want your book to have illustrations, or will it be text-only?
Do you want to write fiction or non-fiction? Non-fiction or informational books require research or knowledge of the subject matter and can be good if you're an expert about something like dinosaurs, meteors or machinery.
For good fiction inspiration, read the classics. Don't limit yourself to recent works––go back in time and read stories that have withstood the test of time and try to find for yourself what it is about them that is so everlasting. For example, check out such books as: Goodnight Moon, Where the Wild Things Are, The Polar Express, and other favorites.
Check out fairy tales. The entertainment industry is currently experiencing a greatly revived interest in fairy tales and turning them modern. Since the majority of fairy tales are in the public domain, you're free to snaffle up characters and plots and take them to completely new places with totally new attitudes!

, The term “children’s books” covers everything from board books with one word on a page to chapter books, novels and non-fiction factual books written for kids in middle school and teens (young adults). The plot, content and themes of your book need to be age appropriate for your intended readers for them to be appealing (remember that parents are the ultimate gatekeepers who can determine whether or not a child reads your book).


Picture books are suitable for younger children. They tend to be in full color, which makes them more expensive to print, so bear that in mind. On the plus side, they tend to be shorter, but then your writing needs to be very good to grab interest and keep the story tight.
Chapter books and non-fiction/informational books are for older children. Starting with easy-readers through to teen novels, there is a great deal of scope here but there is also likely to be a lot more writing and researching involved.
Don't neglect the potential for a book of poems or short stories. If you write either, you'll find children love both too.

, If your book is for younger readers, you’ll want to include a lot of artwork that complements your writing. If you’re an artist, you may draw your own illustrations - many children’s book authors do. If you’re not, you may want to hire a professional illustrator to create the artwork for your book. For older children, diagrams, drawings and occasional bright images may be sufficient; in some cases, no images at all might work too.


Before seeking an illustrator, sketch your ideas for the pictures that will go along with each page. This will help you with the next stage of editing, and you’ll be able to give the sketches to the potential illustrator to give him or her an idea of what you want.
Illustrators have very different styles, so it’s important to conduct thorough research before making a choice. Do an online search for illustrators and look at professional portfolios. If hiring a professional isn’t in your budget, you might want to ask a friend or family member who is artistic to create artwork for your story.
Consider photography as another option for adding images to your book. If you enjoy taking photos, you can use real life scenery, stills using stuffed toys and so forth. You can also use a digital photo program to add elements that you can't photography easily.

"
"
Decide on the main components of your story.,
Consider incorporating a message for fiction works.,
Be creative.",How to Write a Children's Book3," Write down your ideas in a notebook. Some basics to bear in mind include:


Whether they’re geared toward children or adults, most great stories share a few basic elements: A main character, supporting characters, an interesting setting and a plot that includes a central conflict, trouble brewing, a climax, and a resolution.
For non-fiction or informational works: The book needs to inform the reader about history, people, events, real things or how-to instructions.
Picture books: These require a lot of illustration, usually in full color, which can make printing more expensive. Text is limited but needs to be both good and original––there is quite an art to limiting words and still putting across and excellent story.

, Many children’s books include a positive message, ranging from simple standards, like “share with others,” to more complex life lessons on topics like handling the death of a loved one or how to think about big issues like caring for the environment or respecting other cultures. It isn’t necessary to include a straightforward message, so don’t force it––if you do, your lesson may come off as heavy-handed, which won’t be appealing to kids.

, If writing fiction, this is your chance to write something silly, strange, nerdy, dreamy, fantastical. What inspired you as a child? Go there, explore those ideas. This doesn’t mean you should throw in something wacky for no good reason, though. Tap into feelings that are sincere and actions that make sense for your character. Readers can immediately pick up on writing that seems false, and that’s when they put down the book. And if writing non-fiction, this is your chance to share your knowledge and research with future generations of chefs, engineers and artists! Importantly, be creative but also accurate––it's a fine balance between keeping it light and still ensuring that the content is fact-checked thoroughly and understandable or doable by children.

"
"
Write your first draft.,
Be aware of the age of your readers as you write.,
Provide a resolution or realistic outcome at the end of a fiction book.",How to Write a Children's Book4," Don’t worry about how it sounds - you won’t be showing it to others just yet. Concentrate on getting your story or book outline on paper, and worry about honing it later. Many a book has failed to eventuate thanks to wrong-end perfectionism––let the red pen come out after the words are down on paper.

, Your vocabulary, sentence structure and sentence length should be appropriate for the age group for whom you’re writing. If you're unsure, talk with various children of the age group you're writing for, and share some of the words you're keen to use, to gain an idea of the extent of their comprehension. While it is good to push children's learning a little, there is a limit to having every second word require a dictionary!


Write concise sentences that clearly communicate the ideas you want to share. This is a basic tenet of good writing for all ages. And it's especially important for children who are learning to grasp meaning from ever-increasing complexity.
Don’t underestimate the intellect of your readers. Children are fiercely intelligent, and if you make the mistake of writing “down” to them, they’ll quickly get bored with your book. Even though the themes are age appropriate and the sentences are simply written, your writing concepts should captivate your readers.
Keep up-to-date. Just because something doesn't interest you or seems too technical doesn't mean you can avoid it. Children want to read what's current in terms of language and concepts, so if that means learning about innards of such things as programming or texting lingo so that your story or information comes across as genuine, embrace the learning opportunity with enthusiasm!

, The ending doesn't always have to be happy––that can be a real disservice to a young reader, as life isn't about constant happy endings. The ending should be as strong as the rest of your book and not feel abrupt or disjointed. Sometimes it helps to take a break and come back to the book later, when a suitable conclusion will have shaped itself in your subconscious in the meantime; while for others, the conclusion is known well before the book begins!


For non-fiction, always seek to provide a conclusion of some sort, to end the work neatly. It might be an observation of where the topic is likely to head in the future, or a summary of what main points can be taken from the book, or perhaps a whimsical reflection about what the reader might like to do/read/learn next. Whatever your approach, keep it short as a young reader is not likely to want to read anything more than about a half page long by the end of a non-fiction work.

"
"
Revise your manuscript.,
Show your manuscript to others.",How to Write a Children's Book5," This step should be repeated over and over until your manuscript is polished. You may discover that entire portions of your story aren’t working, or that you need to write in a new character. If you’re working with an illustrator, you’ll find that the addition of artwork can change the tone of your story. Go through several passes until you have a manuscript you’re ready to show people.


Learn to let go. While it can be hard to discard work you've spent hours and hours perfecting, only to find it doesn't fit or really work, it's part of being a writer. Knowing what to leave out is an essential part of the art of writing. To gain objectivity, take time away from your work and come back refreshed.
Check spelling and grammar as you go. Every refinement helps to improve the end quality of your book.

, Start by giving your manuscript to family and friends. It isn’t always easy to get a straightforward reaction from loved ones who might want to save your feelings, so consider joining a writing workshop or forming a writer’s group so you’ll be able to get honest feedback on your manuscript.


Remember to show your book to your primary audience: children. Read your manuscript to kids and pay attention to whether they seem to “get it,” which parts make them bored, and so on.
Consider whether your book appeals to parents, teachers and librarians. They are the ones who will be purchasing your book, so it should be interesting to them, too.
Once you’ve got feedback from a variety of sources, edit your manuscript again.

Self-publish.,
Find a literary agent.,
Publish for local consumption only.",How to Write a Children's Book6," This is a viable and respectable option in today’s publishing world. Search online for companies that will help you self publish your book. You may want to create an eBook, or you may want to have copies of your book printed. You can spend as little or as much money as you want on self publishing, and you’ll be able to avoid the lengthy process of publishing a book through more traditional means.


Some self-publishing companies provide higher quality services than others. Before choosing a company, look into the type of paper they use, and try to obtain samples of other books they have published.
When you self-publish a book, you still have a shot at getting it published by a traditional publishing house down the road. In fact, you’ll have a sample of your finished book to send them with your pitch. If it looks beautiful, this can give you an edge over other submissions.

, If you have your heart set on publishing your book with a traditional publishing house, it’s best to find an agent to help you through the process. Research agents who work with children’s books in the United States can be found at www.writersmarket.com. Similar agent organizations will exist for other countries too.


Send agents a query letter and a book synopsis. If agents are interested, they’ll reply with a request to see the manuscript. It may take weeks or months to receive a reply.
If your book is not picked up by an agent, you may send your query letter and synopsis directly to publishers that accept unsolicited manuscripts. Research companies that publish books like yours before contacting publishers.
If your book is picked up by an agent, he or she may ask you to make revisions to the manuscript to make it more appealing to potential publishers. When it’s ready, the agent will send pitches to publishers that seem like the right fit. Again, the process can take months, and there’s no guarantee your book will be published.

, Writing a children's book is by itself a huge accomplishment. There's no need to seek wide publication if you don't want to. Sometimes it's more personal to just share it with the people who matter. Consider printing the manuscript at the copy store and binding it to give to a few friends, or to children in your family. Many copy stores have services that allow you to print and bind full-color booklets that look very professional.

Self publish your comic.",How to Make a Comic," A comic is, at its most basic level, a narrative told through sequential images, called frames or panels. Even a single-frame comic has to have a sense of forward movement. In that sense, a comic is not really different from any other form of storytelling, and thus follows certain conventions.


Setting. Every story is set somewhere. Even if the background is just plain white, that’s still a setting. The setting is the backdrop for the actions of your characters, and depending on your story can be an integral part of the narrative.
Characters. You need actors for your story. Your characters move the action, they speak the dialogue, and they are who the reader connects with. Develop your characters over time; this is especially important for strips that form longer narratives.
Conflict. Every story needs a conflict to drive it. This is the basis of the story, the “why” of what your characters are doing. This can be as simple as checking the mail or as complex as saving the universe.
Themes. The theme of your comic is what drives the day to day creation. Your theme will also dictate your audience. If you’re writing a comedy strip, what are the nature of the jokes? If you’re writing a love story, what are the lessons of love learned?
Tone. This is the vibe of your comic. Are you writing a comedy? Is your story more of a drama? Maybe you’re looking at doing political cartoons. Your possibilities are endless. Combine comedy with drama, make it dark, or light-hearted. Write a romance, or a gripping political thriller.
Your tone will be expressed through dialogue, narrative text, and visuals.

, One of the best ways to make your comics feel “true” is to write about what you know. This will also help you keep your own voice in your writing, and prevent you from copying too much from other comics. , Because you are creating a comic, your visual style will be the first aspect of your comic that the reader encounters. Choose a style that matches both the tone of your story and the image you have in your head.


Experiment with various styles until you find one that feels natural to draw and to write for. There are a variety of popular styles that you can practice and then adapt to your own needs. Here are just a few examples:

Anime/Manga
American Superhero

Sprites/Clip art
Noir
Stick figures
Sunday funnies


Dramas usually necessitate a more elaborate visual style than a comedy. There are exceptions to this, however, as with every rule when it comes to creating something.

, There are no set conventions when it comes to format, though comics typically fall into three categories: Single frame, Strip, and Page length (comic book). Experiment with different formats until you find one that suits your story, characters, and setting.


A single frame comic is typically reserved for comedy. These comics do not require much setup, and rely on visual gags and one or two lines of dialogue. It can be difficult to form a narrative using single frames, so most can be read in any order. Political comics are also typically one or two frames.
A comic strip is a sequence of frames. There is no set length for a strip, though most are usually one or two lines of 2-4 frames each. This is one of the most popular formats for many webcomics and daily funnies, as they allow for narrative development but are still short enough to produce regularly.
A comic page is a larger undertaking than a strip. Having the whole page to work with provides more freedom to manipulate frames, but also means you need more content per page. Creating full pages is typically the result of making a comic book or graphic novel, where you are telling a longer, more cohesive story.

, The length and detail of the script will vary depending on the style of your comic. A single frame comic may only have a line or two. Regardless, write it out to help you judge how well the story reads.


Write your script as a sequence of frames. Treat each frame as a separate scene to help you manage the flow of the story.
Make sure that the dialogue does not dominate the frame. Comics are a visual medium, and so a lot of your action and implied meaning will be coming through in the illustrations. Don’t let the text overpower the images., Don’t worry about accurate sizes, details, or quality. You will be creating storyboard thumbnails. Do this as you write the script. This very rough sketch will help you visualize the flow of the comic.Focus on how characters will be placed in the frame, where the action is occurring, and how the dialogue will fit in the drawing.
Once your thumbnails are drawn, you can try swapping their order or making adjustments to change the impact of the strip.

, The layout should guide the reader’s eyes naturally through the panels. Always remember that readers will move from left to right, top to bottom, except when reading manga which is read from right to left. Use different sizes and shapes for panels to help guide the reader., Beyond dialogue, text can be used in many different ways. These include:


Thought bubbles for a character’s inner thoughts
Narration boxes allow a narrator to set up a scene or describe some aspect of the story.
Sound can be displayed through the use of sound effect words.
Exclamations can occur outside of regular speech bubbles to add extra impact.

, In film, you’re never supposed to keep a scene that doesn't matter. The same is true for a comic. If the frame doesn't move the story or the comedy or the conflict forward, then cut it and either replace it with something that does or scrap it.

, A lot of successful comics break convention when it comes to frames. If you are publishing the comic yourself, feel free to explore as many different framing options as you like. Just remember that any stylistic choices should always be in service of the story.

, Use the ruler to draw your frames. Do this on a suitable paper. For panels that will be inserted at odd angles, or that don’t fit in the general flow, you can use separate sheets for these and then combine everything after scanning.


If you are looking to create a comic to be published in a newspaper, the standard size is 13” x 4” for the entire comic, with four 3” frames. Newspaper strips are drawn at double the actual printed size, so the finished comic would be 6” x 1.84”. Working at double size makes it easier to draw details.Web comics can be any size you would like, though you should keep in mind the typical viewer’s display size. If you make your comic visible on a monitor with a resolution of 1024x 768, most users will not have an issue.Many viewers will not enjoy scrolling left and right in a web page to view a comic. Keep this in mind when laying out the comic. Scrolling up and down is typically much more acceptable.



, Draw in light pencil so that you can easily erase and make adjustments. Continue adjusting your drawing until you have the outline for your final ink.


Make sure to take the space needed for your dialogue into account. Leave blank space to include dialogue bubbles, thought bubbles, narration boxes, exclamations, and sound effect words.

, Many comic artists go over the pencil lines with ink. This allows the artist to erase the remaining pencil lines after inking is finished. Take time to make sure the final lines are polished.


If writing dialogues by hand, add them now. Make any final revisions to the dialogue and text as you add it to the page. Chances are things will change as they make the transition from script to comic.

, Once the inking is done, you can scan the comic onto a computer. This will allow you to add typed text as well as use image editing software to color the comic if you choose. Scanning the comic also makes publishing it online much easier.


Scan your picture in at 600 DPI (dots per inch). This resolution will keep your drawn lines intact and crisp looking. If your comic is too large to scan at once, scan sections of it and use the lasso tool in Photoshop to move and combine the frames back together.
When scanning black and white images, make sure to choose the grayscale options. This is especially important for pictures with lots of shading.

, Once you have the drawn comic scanned, you can use Photoshop to erase small mistakes or pencil lines that you may have missed. You can use Photoshop tools to add extra shading and stronger lines as well.

, One way to help your comic stand apart from others is to use a custom font. There are a wide variety of font creation programs available online, both for free and for purchase. One of the most popular is FontCreator.


Create a font that complements the tone of the writing as well as the visual style. You can also use different fonts for different characters, though too many variations can become distracting.

, Use the layers tool in Photoshop to create a layer for the text and a layer for the speech bubble. Both of these layers should be separate from the layer that your drawing is on.


Your text layer should be on top, followed by the bubble layer, followed by the original drawing on the bottom.
Open the Blending options on the bubble layer. The Blending option will create an outline of the speech bubble at the end of the process. Select Stroke and set the following options:

Size to 2px
Position to Inside
Blend Mode to Normal
Opacity to 100%
Fill Type to Color
Color to Black


Enter your text on the Text layer. This is the text that will go inside the bubble. Use the font you created above or select a font appropriate for your visual style. Comic Sans is a popular font.
Select the bubble layer. Use the Elliptical Marquee tool to create a selection bubble around the text that you wrote. Place the cursor in the center of the text, and hold the Alt key while dragging the mouse in order to create an elliptical selection bubble that is evenly placed over the text.
Select the Polygonal Lasso tool, and hold the Shift key while clicking to create a sharp triangle tail in the selection.
Select White as your foreground fill color.
Press Alt + del to fill the selection on the bubble layer. The outline will automatically be created when this happens, and the speech bubble is complete.

, This is optional, as many successful comics are printed in black and white. There are a couple of options when coloring comics. You can color directly onto the page, using physical coloring tools, or you can color digitally after scanning the comic into a computer.


More and more comics are being colored through digital means. Programs like Illustrator and Photoshop make the coloring process much less tedious than in the past.
Remember that the reader will see both the entire comic and individual frames at the same time. Try to keep a cohesive color palette throughout your comic to keep frames from being distracting.
Use a color wheel to make sure that the colors you pick work together harmoniously. A color wheel helps when confronted with the millions of colors available on modern computers.

Colors opposite of each other on the color wheel are complementary. These colors are high contrast, and should be used in small amounts to avoid becoming overbearing.
Analogous colors are located next to each other on the color wheel. These are typically very pleasing sets of colors to the eye.
Triadic colors are three colors evenly spaced around the wheel. Typically you would use one color as the dominant color, and use the other two for accents., If you just want to share your comic with some friends and family, uploading it to an image host will be the cheapest (free) and easiest way to do it. Create an account with a service like PhotoBucket, ImageShack, or imgur and upload your creation.


Send the links to whoever you want, post them on your social network feeds, tweet the URL to anyone who will read it. Find comic enthusiast forums and post your links for people all over the world to see.

, DeviantArt is one of the most popular places online for posting art. They have an entire section devoted to cartoons and comics. When you post your images, fans can leave comments, giving you a chance to interact with your audience.


Interacting with other artists on DeviantArt can give you new ideas and perspectives on your own creations.

, If you feel like you have enough content to share with the world, start your own web comic page. This is the best way to grow an audience for your work without having to go through traditional publishing channels. It will require more time and dedication than simply using an image hosting service, but the benefits are far greater.


Create a website that looks good. If the website does not function properly and does not match the aesthetic of your comic, you will drive users away. Take some time and look at how successful web comics have integrated the style of the comic into the website design.
Have your website designed professionally. This can be cheaper than you think, especially if you enlist the aid of up-and-coming designers. Use resources such as DeviantArt to find a like-minded person who will help you design your web comic page.
Update often. The point of a web comic is to keep people coming back. Set a regular update schedule for yourself. If readers know when to expect the next release, they will often come back even without you advertising it.
Interact with your readers. Beyond simply updating the page with new comics, take some time and write blog entries and respond to reader comments. This will help advertise you as the creator and form strong bonds between you and your audience.

, If you feel like your strip would be a good fit for newspapers, talk to a syndicate. These are publishing groups that sell their comics to papers around the world. Syndicates receive thousands of submissions every year, and typically only pick about 3-4 strips.The major comic syndicates are:


Creators Syndicate
King Features Syndicate
Washington Post Writers Group
Tribune Media Services
United Feature Syndicate

, If you have a non-newspaper strip or comic, you may want to consider sending it to traditional comic publishers. The comic publishing industry has expanded significantly over the last few decades, and now includes all manner of graphic novels and comic collections. Note that DC and Marvel do not take unsolicited submissions. You will need to make a name for yourself elsewhere first. Some major publishers:


DC Comics
Image Comics
Dark Horse
Beyond the major publishers, there are numerous independent publishers that are always looking for new submissions.

, As tools for self publishing become more widespread, the ease of publishing material has greatly increased. Resources such as Amazon’s CreateSpace allow authors to easily. CreateSpace will automatically list your comic on Amazon, and will print copies to match orders. This takes a lot of the manufacturing and distributing work off of your shoulders.

Edit your story at the line level.",How to Create an Epic Fantasy Story," Many novice fantasy authors rely too heavily on the fantastical elements of the story and neglect to develop the actual story itself first. Before you can write a compelling piece of fantasy fiction, though, you'll need all the elements of a strong and compelling plot.For this reason, it may be helpful to create at least a skeletal outline to help you track what happens and to whom in your story.Every plot should have some element that sets the story in motion. This may be an external conflict or an internal one, but something needs to happen in order for the action to progress.
Rising action (in which the story develop and tension builds), the climax of that action, and the subsequent falling action are all crucial elements of a strong plot.
The denouement (or ""unraveling""), in which all of the tension is completely resolved, is essential to move the story towards its logical ending.

, A good conflict is critical if you hope to write a strong plot for any type of fiction. Conflict motivates the characters, catalyzes the story, and creates tension that the reader will engage with.A common strategy is to depict the antagonist's motivations in direct conflict with the protagonist's. This creates a tremendous amount of tension and allows the reader to further identify with the protagonist.
Conflict can be between a person and himself/herself, between two people, or between a person and an abstract concept (society, God/gods/goddesses, etc.).

, Characters are arguably more important than the plot. Even if a reader doesn't find the plot particularly interesting, he or she may continue to read a story because of its compelling and/or relatable characters.Characters should have a clear, well-defined motivation. This can be a need/desire, a goal, or simply a personality trait, but it should be clear what makes each character tick.
Try to make your characters contradictory or otherwise complicated, as this can make them more realistic.
Remember that no one in real life is always good or always evil, so fictional characters shouldn't be, either.
Make your characters vulnerable somehow. Whether it's a physical vulnerability or an emotional one, some type of human suffering/vulnerability makes characters more relatable.
Map out more characteristics and motivations for each main character than you'll actually explicitly include in your story. Just knowing what makes your characters happy/sad/frightened/etc. can influence how you write that character in subtle ways.

, Infusing your plot with vivid details and complex developments will help bring your story to life for readers. Try to incorporate as many sensory details as you can so that readers get a real sense of what your characters experience and what your fictional world is like.You'll obviously want to include the sights and sounds of your world, but don't neglect the smells, tastes, and tactile feelings of that world.

, Don't drag your story on for chapter after chapter once the tension is resolved, but don't rush to be finished either. Figure out where the story should logically end by considering what readers may want to know about your characters in the chapter or two that follow the resolution of tension.Make sure your characters resolve their conflicts. Don't try to have acts of nature, a new character, or some divine element fix all the conflicts, or readers will be turned off very quickly.
If your story is part of a larger saga, you'll have to balance the logical ending for this story and the hint of what's to come in the next story.
If your story is a free-standing piece of fiction, think about what questions might linger after the tension wraps up. Consider what happens to the principal characters, as well as what might happen to the world you've created after the central conflict is resolved.

, If you want to write an epic fantasy story, it's a good idea to read extensively within the genre. Trying to write within a genre you've never read will only produce mediocre work, and dedicated readers of the genre will recognize the lack of authority in your writing.Some popular and widely-adored fantasy authors include C.S. Lewis, T.H. White, Fritz Leiber, J.R.R. Tolkien, Susanna Clarke, and Kelly Link.Ask a librarian at your local library or an employee at your local book store to recommend some classic, influential fantasy novels for beginners to the genre.

, Not all fantasy novels include magic, but those that do typically establish a sense of order for the realm of magic. There needs to be some type of method and logic to the magic, and it should be clear and unambiguous for readers.Plan out the magical elements thoroughly. Consider whether those elements need explanation or exposition in order to make sense to readers, and decide what the ""rules"" or limits of that magic is in your world.
If your story takes place in an historical society (or a fictional society based on some real historical culture), make sure you thoroughly research that society/culture so you can write about it honestly and accurately.

, Catching a reader's interest from the start is important for any story, but especially in fantasy fiction. Dedicated readers of the genre will want to know that their efforts will be rewarded, and failing to hook your audience from early on may result in your readers losing interest as the story goes along.You don't necessarily need a huge, ""bombshell"" reveal early in the story. However, you should at least hint at exciting and intriguing things to come.
You'll need to deliver on the things you hint at later in the story, so don't offer false promises of something exciting that never unfolds.

, Many fantasy authors open a story with some type of battle scene. While this can be exciting and may show off certain characteristics of the principal characters, the reality is that readers won't know who those characters are or why their deaths (and triumphs) are meaningful.It's okay to have a battle scene at the beginning, but be aware that readers may not be invested enough yet, and may not find it as compelling.
If you do decide to open with a dramatic scene, step back after a paragraph or so to let the characters come alive on the page.
Name your characters when they're introduced. Don't try to be mysterious by only using ""he"" or ""she,"" as this may lose a reader's interest.

, Details are an excellent way to strengthen and develop your narrative. However, too much description can bog down the story with diversions and tangential information. Let your world come to life on the page by choosing which details are the most important and relevant.Rather than explicitly writing out each and every detail, work on finding ways to introduce details through exposition, reflection, and dialogue. This can make the narrative feel less heavy and allow it to flow better.

, When you've just finished a story, you're probably still very attached to the characters, world, and plot you've created. This can make cutting things out difficult, since everything feels perfect and essential. Because it's fresh in your memory, you may also be filling in gaps in the story with your own intimate knowledge of the narrative, but those gaps will be confusing to readers.Set your story aside for a few days to a week before you begin editing/revising it. Don't read your story during that time, and resist the urge to even look at it.
If you don't trust yourself to approach the story with fresh eyes, consider asking a trusted friend or colleague to read your story. Ask someone whose opinion you value and who you know will be honest and straightforward.

, Throughout the course of writing a short story, it can be easy for you to lose track of your tone. This may be particularly true if you work on your story in short bursts over a period of several weeks. Reviewing your story and keeping a consistent tone will help make it come together more clearly and eloquently for readers, and it will ultimately create a stronger story.Find one paragraph from your story that you feel embodies your ideal tone. Then print out a copy of that paragraph and hang it by your computer, or simply re-read it before you begin working on your story again.

, One of the most common phrases in creative writing circles is ""Show, don't tell."" This means letting the reader see things unfold on the page, either through the narrative or through well-placed details. Showing the reader that someone is sad (by describing that character's body language, reactions, etc.), for example, instead of telling the reader that a character is sad will make a huge difference in your story., Revising a story will inevitably require you to cut out some sections. Those sections may end up being rewritten, or they may simply not work for your story. Either way, you'll need to read your draft with a fine-toothed comb and ask yourself whether certain sections are necessary for the story in its current form.If anything is unclear or confusing for a potential reader, consider rewriting it if it's vital to the story. If it isn't vital, then simply cut it out.
Look for needless and irrelevant tangents, descriptions, and other distractions. Cut these out and see if the story still makes sense without them.

, Once you've worked out the bigger issues in your story, you'll need to turn your attention to the smaller, line-level details. While bigger issues can turn a reader off right from the start, line-level issues may frustrate readers consistently throughout the story, and should be reworked accordingly.Check your story for proper spelling and grammar.
Ask yourself whether the adjectives you use are actually descriptive, or if they're boring ""empty"" adjectives.
Cut out unnecessary adverbs. Generally speaking, too many adverbs bog down a story.

Use a pen and paper or a computer to take notes. Take notes on the structure and style of the show, how many lines each characters’ dialogue has, and the length of each act and the script as a whole.Pay close attention to the alignment of commercial breaks with scene breaks.
In addition to watching TV shows, study old scripts, especially the scripts of the types of shows you want to write for.;
, Start with a short description of the show. For example, “Henry, an average high school student living in Los Angeles, wakes up to find himself abducted by aliens.” Then, create a detailed outline that describes the teaser, as well as the acts., A one-hour TV show typically consists of a teaser and four acts. However, sometimes it consists of more acts, for example five acts. On the other hand, 30-minute sitcoms typically contain three acts. Therefore, the number of acts your show has usually depends on the show’s length.A teleplay for a one-hour TV show is typically 59 to 66 pages long.

, Teasers are one to five minute mini-acts at the beginning of the show. They often occur before the opening credits. Teasers are typically used to set-up the episode and catch the audience’s attention. Introduce the main character, their world, and the conflict.In the teaser, you should Introduce the conflict by depicting the main character in peril, or confronted with a problem. For example, the teaser could consist of a scene where Henry, who has been abducted by aliens, is lying in a laboratory with bright lights, and strapped to a medical bed. He could begin to say something like, ""Where am I?"" This could be followed by an unknown being putting a gas mask on his face, making Henry fall unconscious.
Teasers are typically two to three pages, but can be as many as five pages.

, In act one you will need to set the stage. Describe the setting, i.e., where the characters are, and what year and time of day it is. Provide more detailed backgrounds for the main characters and other characters in the story, i.e., sub-plots. Set-up an immediate goal for your main character. By the end of the act, your main character should either reach or fail to reach the immediate goal.For example, act one could be a flashback to 24 hours before Henry is abducted. In the scene, describe who Henry is and his life leading up to the moment before he is abducted. Describe the flashback as a peaceful, happy place. A stark contrast to Henry's new reality.
Act one needs to lead up to act two. Therefore, end act one with a cliffhanger or hook, i.e., a strong dramatic moment.
Each act is typically 14 to 15 pages or 10 minutes long. Each page should follow the general rule of thumb of one page per minute., Raise the stakes in act two by having your character struggle with the conflict. Your main character should be dealing with the conflict, i.e., trying to find a solution. At the beginning of the act, they should have some hope that they will succeed in dealing with the conflict. However, end the scene with another cliffhanger.The cliffhanger should trivialize the character’s solution or strategy forcing them to face the fact that they might not succeed. It should introduce another conflict.
For example, in act two, the flashback could turn into a nightmare before he begins to wake up again. Before Henry regains conscious, he might here voices speaking in a language he has never heard before. You could describe other smells, sounds, and textures that are unfamiliar. He might even hear a familiar scream of someone nearby.

, In act three, your main character is at their lowest point. In other words, the conflict is winning or getting the best of your character. For example, the hope that your character had in act two is proven to be false.By the end of this act, your audience should want to continue watching to see how your character will prevail against such odds.
For example, once Henry has regained full conscious he realizes he has been abducted. Then, he realizes that his girlfriend has been abducted, as well. Perhaps the alien beings are preparing to operate on his girlfriend, or run lab tests on her. Your main character feels powerless because he cannot do anything to protect his beloved girlfriend.

, In act four, your main character, against all odds, should begin to prevail again. By learning from their mistakes in the second and third act, they are able to find a better solution to the conflict. By the end of this act, your main character should begin to triumph and ultimately win.For example, Henry is at his lowest point and about to give up when a math formula he learned in calculus the day before flashes across his mind. He realizes that the solution to the formula will free him and his girlfriend. While the aliens are preparing to operate, he inputs the solution into a computer system nearby. It turns out that the solution is the key to shutting down the alien's system. He frees himself and his girlfriend, and together they jump into a capsule that will teleport them back to earth.
Alternatively, you can end the fourth act with another cliffhanger, which will set up the next episode or a final act five.
If you are only writing three acts, then combine act two and act three into act two, and make the fourth act the final act three.

, Every script needs to have a title page with one contact address. The title should be centered and closed in quotation marks. Underneath the title write “written by”, hit enter, then write your name. Place your contact address in the bottom left hand corner.The contact address should include your name, email, and phone number. If you have an agent, their contact address should go in the bottom right hand corner.
Above the title it should also say in all caps: SCREENPLAY FORMAT FOR TV SHOWS. This should be underlined, as well.

, Capitalize “Fade in” and follow it with a colon. “FADE IN” also needs to be followed by a scene heading. Capitalize all scene headings, as well. Your scene heading must also indicate interior or exterior, the location, and time of day. Abbreviate interior and exterior with “INT.” and “EXT.”For example, INT. LOS ANGELES – 10 A.M.

, Double-spaced underneath the scene heading is the scene action in upper and lower case letters. If there are paragraphs in your scene action, they need to be separated with double-spaces, as well.Scene action should only outline what is happening on the screen, and be kept at a five line maximum, for example, “Deborah enters the café.”
Always follow a scene heading with a line of scene action.

, Following the scene action you can begin the characters’ dialogue. Indent the characters’ names to the middle of the page, but do not center it. The characters’ names should appear above the dialogue in all caps, for example, “TINA.” Designate the character with either their first or last name.Alternatively, you can designate a character with a role, for example, “DOCTOR.” However, whatever you use to designate a character should be used consistently throughout the script.
Dialogue appears in regular text and it is not centered, either.

, If a character’s dialogue continues to run onto the next page, only split the dialogue if at least two lines appear on the previous page. Only split the dialogue after a sentence, as well. State, “CONT’D” in parenthesis after the character’s name if the dialogue is split.If there are instructions like pause, smile, or clap, then write the instructions in parenthesis and in lowercase letters in the body of the dialogue, for example, (smile). Never leave a parenthetical hanging at the end of a page.

, Always conclude the act or teaser with a “FADE OUT.” Fade out must be capitalized and followed by a period. Double-spaced and centered below “FADE OUT,” write, “END OF TEASER (or ACT ONE),” in all caps and underline it.For example: END OF TEASER.
You do not need to indicate where the commercial breaks will go when formatting and writing your teleplay. However, keep in mind the length of ad breaks so you can adjust the length of your teleplay accordingly.

Name your character.,
Note your character’s gender, age, height, and weight.,
Describe your character’s hair and eye color.,
Create distinguishing markers or scars on your character.,
Note your character’s style of dressing.,
Determine your character’s background and class.,
Conduct research on your character's profession or career.",How to Create a Realistic Fiction Character2," A big identifier of your character will be their name. Think about people you know in real life who remind you of the character or who inspired the character. You can also play on an existing name you feel fits with the character and change the spelling. For example, Kris instead of Chris, or Tara instead of Tanya.Look for names that fit with your character’s background and don’t seem odd in terms of your character’s role or position. A soccer mom who lives in suburban Portland and identifies as Caucasian is likely not going to be named Esmeralda. And an evil sorcerer from another planet will likely not be named Joe or Craig.
There are several character name generators online that you can also use, filtering by background and gender., If your character was to fill out a census or a form at a doctor’s office, what would they specify for gender, age, height, and weight? Though you may not use this character information in your story or novel, your character’s gender, and age will affect their character voice and their point of view.For example, the young child character, Scout, in Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird will view the world of the novel differently than her father, Atticus Finch, an older man., It’s important to specify your character’s physical characteristics, especially their hair and eye color. Often, description of characters focuses on hair color or eye color, and these details can help signal to your reader that your character has a certain ethnic background or appearance. These descriptions can also indicate a certain type of character.


For example, describing your character’s physical appearance as: “She had dishwater blonde hair and gray eyes that glazed over when she was bored” not only gives your reader a clear physical description, it also shows the character’s personality.

, Harry Potter’s lightning bolt scar is a good example of a distinguishing marker that identifies his character and makes him unique. You can also use birthmarks, like a mole on your character’s face, or a marker due to an accident, like a burn mark or a scar due to stitches. These scars or markers can make your character feel distinct to your reader. They can also tell the reader more about your character.


In To Kill a Mockingbird, Scout’s brother Jem is characterized on the first page of the novel through a description of his broken arm: “When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem’s fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn’t have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt.”Harper Lee uses the injury, or physical marker, to introduce Jem’s character and tell the reader that he has a shorter left arm, a distinguishing characteristic that makes him a more nuanced and believable character.

, Clothing can be a great way to show the reader more of your character’s personality and preferences. A character who wears punk t-shirts, black jeans, and Doc Martens will come across as a rebellious character, while a character who wears a sweater set and loafers may come across as a more conservative character.


Be specific when you are describing a character’s clothing, but don’t repeat descriptions too much in the narrative. Establishing your character’s style of dress once will create a clear picture in the reader’s mind that they can refer back to.
In Raymond Chandler’s The Big Sleep, the main character Philip Marlowe describes his clothing in two concise sentences: “I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn’t care who knew it.”Chandler uses very specific detail to paint a clear image of Marlowe and he injects the description with Marlowe’s voice, “I didn’t care who knew it,” adding more depth to the description.

, Your character’s station in life will affect how she navigates certain situations and how she will react to everyday occurrences. A young African American man living in Washington, D.C. will have a different experience or perspective than a young Southern man living in Little Rock, Arkansas. And a middle class woman living in New York will have different daily experience than a woman living on food stamps in New York. Your character’s background and class experience will be an integral part of their perspective as a character.


Though it is not essential that you announce your character’s background and class to the reader, your character will feel more realistic and true if their station in life factors into their point of view. The characters in the fiction of Junot Diaz, for example, uses colloquial terms that indicate class and background to the reader.
In Diaz’s short story “The Cheater’s Guide to Love” he notes: “Maybe if you’d been engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita you could have survived it—but you’re not engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita. Your girl is a bad-ass salcedense who doesn’t believe in open anything; in fact, the one thing she warned you about, that she swore she would never forgive, was cheating.”In this story, Diaz uses Spanish terms to indicate the character/narrator’s background, without having to tell the reader directly that the narrator is Spanish.

, Another way to make your character more believable on the page is to delve into the details of their profession or career. If you are writing a character who works as an architect, this character should know about how to design a building and may see a city skyline in a unique way. Or if you are writing a character who works as a private detective, this character should know basic P.I. protocol and how to solve a case. Use library books and online sources to make your character's career convincing in your story.


If possible, try to speak to someone who is in the profession you would like to use for your character. Interview them about their daily habits at work to make sure you are getting the details of their profession right.

Give your character a purpose or desire.,
Consider your character’s strengths and weaknesses.,
Give your character a past trauma or fear.,
Create a nemesis for your character.",How to Create a Realistic Fiction Character3," One of the most distinguishing aspects of your character should be their purpose or want in the story. Your character’s goals should drive the story and their goal should be unique to their character. For example, your character might be a young African American man who is trying to get into the NBA. Or your character might be an old woman who is trying to reconnect with her long lost son. Making your character’s purpose or goal specific will help them seem more realistic and believable.Another key aspect of your character’s goal is that your character should have a small goal, such as trying to get a girl, and a large goal, such as confirming love is real. Try to give your character a small and a large goal so their story feels specific and also general, or universal, to your reader.

, A hero with no flaws or a villain with no heart will be flat characters on the page. Give your character strengths and weaknesses to create a well rounded character who is also relatable to your reader. If you are creating a main character who is going to be your protagonist, make a list of strengths and weaknesses for the character. The protagonist’s weaknesses should be out weighed just slightly by your character’s strengths, especially if they are going to be the underdog or underachiever in your story.For example, your character may be shy or introverted, but has a good mind for solving riddles and puzzles. Or your character may struggle with anger or rage, but tries to maintain control over their emotions.
Balancing your character’s strengths with weaknesses will make your character more endearing and relatable to your reader, which will then make the character feel more realistic.

, Not all characters have to be motivated by a past trauma or fear. But creating a backstory for your character with events which may have harmed or damaged them can create tension in the character’s present life. A backstory is events or moments in the character’s life that happens before the story begins.A backstory can also allow you to make the character more believable on the page. A character who refers to previous events will widen the scope of the story and give the character a more well developed presence in the story.
For example, in Diaz’s short story “The Cheater’s Guide to Love”, the reader is told of backstory, the narrator’s past transgressions while he was with his girlfriend. This backstory becomes the reason why the narrator’s girlfriend leaves him. So the backstory is doing two things in the story: it is showing the reader more about the narrator and it is a major plot point in the story. It also widens the scope of the story, as the reader is dropped into the narrator’s immediate drama (the girlfriend leaving him) but this drama stems from past events that the narrator must face in the present.

, Another way to create a more realistic character in your story is to create a person or force that is working against your character. A nemesis will add an element of reality to the story, as in real life, we are often faced with opposing forces or challenging individuals.The nemesis could be in the form of a nosy neighbor, an annoying family member, or a troublesome partner. Your character’s nemesis should correspond with the character’s purpose or desire.
For example, a character who is trying to land a basketball scholarship may have a nemesis in the form of a rival teammate, or an overbearing coach. A character who is trying to win back a girl he cheated on may have a nemesis in the form of his inability to control his own desires or be monogamous.

"
Don’t be afraid to use colloquial terms.,
Think about code switching.,
Use dialogue tags.,
Read the character’s dialogue out loud.",How to Create a Realistic Fiction Character4," Colloquialisms are informal words, phrases or slang in a piece of writing.Your characters should sound as unique as the individuals you encounter every day, and that includes any slang or informal terms they might use. For example, two teenage boys likely will not greet each other with: “Good day, sir.” Instead, they may say “What’s up?” or “What’s goin’ on?”


Be careful about using too many colloquial terms in your dialogue. It can begin to feel distracting or gimmicky if it is overused. Strive for a balance between proper, English terms and slang or colloquialisms.

, Code switching is a language shift made by a character in response to who they are speaking to.It occurs often in everyday life, especially for individuals from different backgrounds or classes who are trying to assimilate or blend in.


If you are writing a character from a certain background, setting, or class, you should consider how they will might use local slang in their dialogue and description depending on who they are speaking to in a scene. A Jamaican man speaking to another Jamaican man, for example, will likely use patois and slang like “Yah, mon” or “Stay ire”. But the same Jamaican man speaking to a white police officer may use more formal speech like “Yes, sir” or “Stay cool”.

, Dialogue tags, or speech tags, are like signposts. They attribute written dialogue to characters. Some of the more commonly used dialogue tags are “said” and “told”. Dialogue tags don’t need to be fancy or overly descriptive. Their primary purpose are to show which characters speak and when. But you can also build believable characters through dialogue tags.Each tag should contain at least one noun or pronoun (Scout, she, Jem, he, you, they, we) and a verb indicating how the dialogue is being spoken (said, asked, whispered, remarked). For example, “Scout said to Jem…” or “Jem whispered to Scout…”
You can add adjectives and adverbs to tags to provide more information about the speaker. For example, “Scout said quietly to Jem” or “Jem whispered harshly to Scout”. Adding an adverb can be a quick and useful way to indicate a certain mannerism or emotion in a character. But be wary of overusing adjectives or adverbs in your dialogue tags. Try to only use one adjective or adverb per scene for one character’s dialogue tag.

, Your character’s dialogue should feel unique to their character and representative of how they interact with others. Good dialogue in fiction should be doing more than simply telling the reader how a character gets from A to B, or how the character knows another character. Read the character’s dialogue out loud to ensure it sounds like speech a person might say to another person in the scene. The dialogue should also sounds true to the character.


For example, in To Kill a Mockingbird, Lee uses dialogue to distinguish the characters in a scene. She also uses colloquial terms that represent children living in a small Southern town in the 1950s.“Hey.”
“Hey yourself,” said Jem pleasantly.
“I’m Charles Baker Harris,” he said. “I can read.”
“So what?” I said.
“I just thought you’d like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin‘ I can do it…”
“How old are you,” asked Jem, “four-and-a-half?”
“Goin‘ on seven.”
“Shoot no wonder, then,” said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. “Scout yonder’s been readin‘ ever since she was born, and she ain’t even started to school yet. You look right puny for goin’ on seven.”


Lee makes Jem’s dialogue distinct from Charles Baker Harris’ dialogue and Scout’s dialogue by using slang terms and colloquiums. This establishes Jem as a character and creates a dynamic between all three speakers in the scene.

Consider using style and formatting patterns to format a screenplay.,
Select a line of text.,
Open the Styles and Formatting pane.,
Select text with similar formatting.,
Select the format you want.,
Create a new style.",How to Write Screenplays Using Microsoft Word2," If you’re unhappy with the template layout provided by Word, you can modify the style and formatting of your document in order to create new formatting patterns. These patterns could be used again if you save them, or you can create a new template based on a document which uses these style and formatting rules. You could think of formatting as creating your own template.

, The text might be a character name, a piece of dialogue, or some stage directions. Select the line of text by clicking the left button on your mouse with your cursor at the left edge of the line of text.Alternately, you could highlight the text by clicking the left button of your mouse to the right or left of the line of text you want to adjust.
Finally, you could highlight text by bringing up a blinking cursor within the text you’ve written and holding down the shift key and an arrow key to highlight the text you want to format. To highlight text to the left of the place your cursor is, hold the shift key and the left directional button. To highlight text to the right of the place your cursor is, hold the shift key and the right directional arrow.
If you have multiple lines of text, you can select them at one time and apply the formatting changes you desire to all highlighted lines.

, With your text highlighted, click on the word “Format” on the menu bar. The drop down menu will display several options. Click on the words “Styles and Formatting.” This will open the Styles and Formatting pane.


Alternately, you can open the Styles and Formatting pane by clicking the Styles and Formatting button on the toolbar. Just click the Styles and Formatting button located next to the script character drop-down menu to open the pane. The button is found at the far left edge of the toolbar. It contains two letter “A”s, each of a different color, with one positioned above and to the left of the other.

, Right click on the still-highlighted text you selected initially. A drop-down menu will open with a number of options. The bottom-most option reads “Select Text with Similar Formatting.” Click on this option with the left button of your mouse. All text with formatting similar to that which you highlighted originally will become highlighted.


So, for instance, if you have all character names in a certain font and size centered exactly above a line of text, you can highlight a single instance of any character’s name, then use the “Select text with similar formatting” option to adjust all character names in your screenplay at once.

, After you’ve highlighted all the text you want to assign a given style, choose a style from the pane on the right. The Styles and Formatting pane should still be open on the right of the screen. Choose the style format you want to change the highlighted text to by left-clicking on it.

, If your highlighted text does not conform to an extant style, you can assign the formatting and style within the highlighted text a name by clicking the button near the top of the pane which reads “New Style.” You can then assign a name, align the text to left or right, choose your font, and make other adjustments as you see fit.

Decide the story.,
Brainstorm your idea.,
Choose a genre.,
Write A Pilot.,
Develop a Setting.,
Develop characters.,
'Develop a Character Relationship List.,
Pitch, again and now more than ever.,
Develop the details.",How to Write a Television Show Script2," This is probably the most important part of your work, as it's where the guidelines for the rest of the project should be set. Most of the steps on this section will be developed at the same time, you must try to keep ideas sorted all the time to ensure coherence and prevent mistakes. There are no rules about how to do this, but you should look for a method that works for you. Some people will draw on a sketch book, others will write everything on cards, mind mapping, software assisted, etc., you should try what works better for you.

, Once again, write a list of ideas for your story. This is where you should think of the overall storyline of the show. For example, Glee is a wildly popular and amazing show about high school students with different personalities and they all happen to be in a glee club. With romance, comedy and drama you become hooked to the mini musical every Tuesday/Friday. An interesting and original plot is vital for a captivating show, so put a lot of thought into it.

, Consider the plot of your show and try to decide on a genre that best fits. Is it a mystery, soap opera or comedy? The possibilities are endless and it's possible for your show to fit into multiple categories. Glee, for example, would be a musical comedy drama. Then you must carefully define your objective market, there is a world of differences between writing a show targeted for kids from 2-5 years and a teenagers soap opera, or between a show that should be broadcasted on an American TV station, and one that will be watched by Asiatic people around the world.

, You'll need a pilot if your show ever gets filmed. The pilot is what gets people interested in your show. It has to be filled with detail but at the same time, you have to leave your audience craving for information so that it gets viewed they will want to see another episode.

, Describe some of the main settings in the show so that later on you can reference to it if your show ever gets filmed. Timeline, epoch, weather, locations, dresses, languages and idioms...

, Every show needs interesting characters to entertain an audience and to contribute to the show itself. It's important to consider both the plot and the genre when developing characters. Make sure your audience can connect with a character. That will make your audience even more eager to watch your show.

, With this step, you need to make three lists. A Conflict or Disagreement list- this will be a list of two or more characters that just simply cannot stand each other. You may want to include on the list why they fight and what they fight about. A Friendship List- Write down groups of characters that are friends. Also write how strong their friendship is and if it will last the whole show. A Love List- write down two characters that are dating, married or like each other and will eventually get together during the show.

, It's really critical to get your work done right on this stage. If you make a mistake here it will be harder and more expensive to repair it later. For this reason it is strongly recommended to get help from some other people with more experience.|}}

Short vs Feature film.",How to Write an Effective Screenplay for a Short Film1," Short films and feature films are very much alike but also different. The main differences are feature films are made up of many scenes which give you the space to develop more complex characters and face an increasing array of obstacles. Technically much is the same when you start out with your idea however you may consider doing a treatment after your outline and using beat sheets to help you with structure.

Break the log-line down into four elements:


A subject
A verb
An action
An outcome;

Take a look at the following example from the reality show: The Baker Girls: Sealed with a Kiss!,
Play with the order.,
Take time to develop your log-line, but develop it first before your concept.,
Write at least 12 different log-lines for your show.,
Ask your friends and relatives which of the 12 log-lines you created sticks with them.,
Be open to suggestions from others if they come up with one.

, Log-lines do not have to be written in the same order as the examples. You could start by stating the outcome first. The point is to have a log-line that sounds great and is easy for you to recite.

, Then hone it and polish it throughout the writing of your business plan. Up to the last moment, consider it a work in progress.

Choose a TV show.,
Track down a script.,
Study the show.,
Organize your ideas.",How to Write a Spec Script for TV1," Choose a TV series to write about that you enjoy watching and feel in tune with. Consider different genres and decide which one you feel you'd be more apt to write. Opt for a currently-running show that is popular with both audiences and critics, but that you are not trying to work for.Note that spec scripts can also be pilot episodes for new shows.;
, To really get to know the show that you will be writing about, look online for scripts. Make sure that the scripts are not just transcripts of episodes, which essentially present the dialogue without stage directions and descriptions. Visit a site like http://www.simplyscripts.com/tv.html to see what scripts are available, most for a small fee., Even if you are already a fan of the show, make a point of watching as many episodes as you can to note all of the integral information and details. Consistency is important in television shows, particularly with regard to character development. Take note of important details about characters, like:.


Catchphrases (for example, Homer Simpson saying ""D'oh!"" on The Simpsons)
Phobias (the character of Sheldon Cooper on ""The Big Bang Theory"", as an example, has several phobias, including germs and birds)
Habits (e.g. excessive coffee consumption by the titular characters on ""Gilmore Girls"")
Vices (for instance, Agent Booth's gambling addiction on ""Bones"")

, Find a creative way to brainstorm and organize your ideas before writing the script. Use a whiteboard to write things as they pop into your head and erase them when they not longer fit into your vision. Buy note cards to write down individual thoughts in a non-linear way and organize them into a cohesive story.Different color note cards can be helpful in visualizing elements by tone (e.g. comedic, dramatic, informative, neutral) or organizing plots (e.g. main plot and sub-plots).

, By breaking down screenwriting into manageable chunks and working out a deadline it will give you motivation.


Time. A micro-budget short film should take a few weeks to conceive and edit. Don't feel too pressured though as this may put you off instead just focus on writing 10 minutes a day.

Formulate a premise.",How to Write an Effective Screenplay for a Short Film3," The right film title is crucial as it will make it easier to market your screenplay and convey to the audience what the film is about. This can be established at anytime of the process.

, If you are unsure what the theme is, it's the key lesson the protagonist has learnt by the end of the film.

, Write a short sentence (15 words or less) of the fundamental concept which drives the plot.


Whose story is it?
What do they want?
What’s stopping them getting it?

, This is an important part of development. The key areas of developing a character are:


1.Name
2.Appearance
3.Traits. Sociological, Psychological and physical.

",How to Write an Effective Screenplay for a Short Film6," Write for 10 minutes each day.


Structure. There are different ways of structuring a short film, but most importantly keep it simple, so you follow the journey of the protagonist and have no subplots. For example you could follow the three act structure (beginning, middle and end), or you could structure it like a joke following a moment in the protagonists life which ends on a punchline (twist).
Action. Keep this simple. Don't write camera angles, instead infer them.
Dialogue. Add dialogue in after you have written the rest of the script, this way it will be more visual. Keep it simple and remember that it should not sound like real conversations.

"
Pick an interesting antagonist.,
Make sure you have a clear protagonist.,
Choose the setting(s).",How to Write a Spec Script for TV2," The key to any good story is conflict - it is a catalyst for action and change within a narrative. A good script will feature a strong antagonist to stir things up, albeit not always a human character (e.g. a storm that strands characters together). If the show you are writing for has a regular villain or other recurring troublemakers, use them to instigate conflict, which will demonstrate your ability to work within the show's parameters.For example, choose a well-established villain like Professor Moriarty if you write a spec script for the ""Sherlock"" television series.

, Some television shows have one, clearly-identified protagonist (e.g. Olivia Pope on ""Scandal""), while others feature an ensemble cast who alternate leading roles in different episodes (e.g. members of the Bluth family on ""Arrested Development""). Be sure that your spec script focuses on one character within one main story-line. If the episode features sub-plots, make sure they operate as their own story an do not upstage or confuse the main narrative.As a general rule, the person reading your script should always be able to answer the question, ""Whose story is this?""

, Most television series follow their characters through a few main settings on a regular basis (e.g. home, work, and a local cafe). Decide whether your spec script will focus heavily on one setting or follow the episode's protagonist through them all. The former would be best suited for a plot driven by one of these settings itself, such as an office shake-up that creates the drama needed for the episode.

Choose a good writing environment.,
Write it to be filmed.,
Trim and edit.,
Get feedback.,
Rewrite the script.",How to Write a Spec Script for TV3," Sit down to write your spec script in an environment that inspires your creativity without distracting you. Choose a large work space where you can map out your note cards to organize your story (e.g. a study room in a library or a home office). You might also opt for a space where you will be free to watch an episode of the television series for reference, or in case you need inspiration.

, Even the best story ideas will make for a bad spec script if your ideas are not viable for television. Keep the camera in mind at all times when writing, and remember the value of an easy-to-film episode - for instance, if you are writing a spec script for a science fiction or fantasy series, do not incorporate elements that would require too much man power or expensive effects to make. Similarly, make sure to write brief but clear set directions and practical descriptions., After writing your script, make sure to pare it down and streamline it. An ideal spec script should be about 90-110 pages in length - keeping within this limit will demonstrate your knowledge of the industry standards. Remove any extraneous detail about mood, costumes, or elaborate set details, and keep paragraphs brief (3-4 sentences)., Feedback is integral to the writing process, particularly from other writers or people in the television industry. If possible, ask at least 3-4 people to review your work to give you a range of opinions from different perspectives. Ask for detailed criticism and notes - if any note is given by multiple people, you will know that it needs to be addressed.Notes will allow you to identify aspects of the plot that might be unclear, incomplete, or simply not enjoyable to the reader.

, Taking all of the feedback into consideration, rewrite your spec script. Allow yourself ample time to incorporate changes, and to do multiple rewrites if necessary. To approach the script with a fresh perspective, try leaving it for a short time (several days at least) and rereading it before starting your edits."
"
Get an agent.,
Apply at the right time.,
Get into the industry elsewhere.",How to Write a Spec Script for TV4," Given the volume of submissions, most television shows only accept spec scripts through professional colleagues - i.e. agents. Agents serve as a filter, vouching for quality candidates and weeding out applicants that have no chance of being valuable. Visit the Writer's Guild of America's website at https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-write-a-spec-script-1283509 for a list of reputable, signatory agents., Most television shows hire new writers only once a year, during staffing season. For network television shows, this period lasts roughly from April-June. Cable shows don't necessarily follow the same schedule, but also hire writers once a year.The rising trend of internet-based television shows (e.g. Netflix original series) may mean more flexibility and variety in terms of hiring periods.

, The television industry can be very insular in terms of hiring; showrunners tend to hire friends or promote writing assistants or other trusted, low-level employees to writing jobs before hiring outside talent. Get into the industry by means of any job you can find in it (for example, an administrative assistant at an agency) and work on creating and building relationships while in that position. Do your best to charm agents, executives, producers, and other writers, and approach them with your spec script once you have won their favor."

Know the length.,
Create the log line.,
Be aware that there are two ways to proceed from here:


Some writers expand the story like an outline, letting each bullet point represent a story beat or a scene, so that the final product approximates a rough scene outline of the entire story.,
Don't be hung up on rules.,
Understand that the form should suit the reason for which you are creating the treatment.",How to Write a Script Treatment," Treatments can be as long as 30-40 pages, but 1-10 pages is probably most common. There is no correct ""length"" for a treatment the way there is for screenplays because treatments are for a certain audience. Generally as a rule of thumb you want one page for every 2 minutes.;
, Most screenwriters begin with a one-to-two sentences description of their story. Ideally it includes the main character, the main antagonist, the nature of their conflict, genre elements (if it's a comedy, it should be humorous; if it's a thriller, it should thrill; if horror, it should horrify, etc.), and hints of the plot through, without revealing the end.


Usually screenwriters flesh out this log line further into a paragraph or more. At this point they are leaving behind the straitjacket of the log line and entering the more free-wheeling realm of the treatment.
You can follow the format, , Some may keep gradually fleshing out these bullet points, the way a painter colors in trace lines, until they've filled the whole thing out into a full rough draft.
Other writers prefer a more categorical approach, where they explore different aspects separately, not necessarily in chronological order. For example, they may have a list of major characters whom they describe with a paragraph or two. They may have entire back histories of the main characters that run a page or two long. They may describe key locations with a paragraph each. They may also describe the plot but have it deconstructed, perhaps with the main plot in one group of paragraphs and various subplots described separately, not interwoven the way they would be in the script.

, Screenwriting is a fairly rigid craft with countless rules. Treatments are one of the few areas with no rules. It's just a summary of the plot, perhaps with a little character study, usually 1-10 pages long.

, if it's a development tool for your own purposes, then follow your own instincts. If it's for a producer's benefit, ask what sort of format he or she prefers. Or again, follow your instinct. You can always think of it as a written pitch you're telling someone as simply as possible, while making sure to convey the elements that make it stand out.

Before any script can be formed, the writer must have an idea of a story.,
Develop a storyboard, which is basically a series of rough drawings that comprise a story.,
Start the script.,
Document your desired camera angles: If you want, you can even add in camera angles in your script.",How to Write a Script for an Animated Cartoon," If you don’t have an idea yet and need some ways to find some, try looking at comic books, novels, your favorite cartoon shows, fairy tales, movies, anime, and so forth. Maybe you want write about superheroes, or cowboys, or aliens, or detectives.


Here is another idea. Maybe you could animate your favorite joke? Since cartoons should be simplistic, it wouldn’t be a bad idea. Purchase a joke book online or get one at the library so you can add some good gags and jokes into your script. Even in serious cartoons like anime, there is usually an element of humor. Once you have the idea, write it down before it goes away. Make a series of rough notes to flush out the idea. These notes don’t have to be very detailed just yet, just enough to form a story.;
, Some animators choose to do a storyboard after the script is written, but others find that it helps the animator figure out the pacing and how it should look on screen. The storyboard could even be a series of stick figures or even simple shapes designating people or objects. As long as it works for you, anything goes. Take your time developing a story, because if the animation is crude but the story is well written, it is still a good movie. If however the animation rocks but the story is terrible, than it is a bad movie.

, Here is a good example of a good script layout:


Title
Scene (Whenever your characters are in a new locale or a new set of characters are introduced in a new spot, a new scene begins.)
Description: (Add the characters in the scene, their interactions, and their reactions to what is happening)
Dialogue: (Whatever talk is going on and who is talking)
SFX: (Sound fx you plan on adding later)

,  Here are some choices:


Close-up: A close-up shot is when the camera gets really close up on someone or something, like a person’s face or a telephone on a table. 
Long-shot: A long shot is a camera angle that takes in all the characters of the scene and a view of the scenery. Say your characters are standing in a field or a mountain. This is when you will want to use this shot. 
Overhead (or bird’s eye view): This is a shot from the point of view of a bird or someone up in the air. These dramatic shots can add a lot to your movie. 
Worm’s eye: Also a very dramatic shot. This is a shot from the point of view of a worm. Think about looking up at a huge building when you are really up close to it. Use these shots for menacing monsters or villains. 
Extreme close-up: Use this shot when you want to get up front and personal into a shot. Maybe you want to focus on the eyes of a person who is glaring or in distress. Maybe you want to focus in on a character’s smile or frown. Maybe you want to focus in on the violence of a tragic scene. 
Pan: This is when the camera moves across the whole scene quickly, from left to right or right to left. 
Silhouette: This is where your characters are in shadows and can see their side profiles or shapes of their bodies. If you are doing say an eerie cartoon or a gritty noir type cartoon, this might be a good type of shot to use.

Re-send the touched-up script.",How to Write a Script to a Teenage Sitcom," You will need to try to come up with as many ideas or situations as you can. Try to think of some typical situations, as well as some wacky ones. It is good to have a variety to work with.


Be sure to not worry about the content of the ideas. At this point, you just need to get a basis for an idea, then run with it later on.
Make a plan beforehand. Prior to starting you brainstorm session, know or jot down who your characters are and know their defining traits. This will make the brainstorming easier.

, You should eliminate some of your weaker ideas or ones that couldn't be elaborated on very well. You should narrow your list down to about 4-7 workable ideas.


Act some out if you need to. Do what you need to do to determine if an idea is workable or not. If that means acting a scenario out, then by all means do it. The final goal is to get a few great ideas.

, To do this, you need to start writing a small draft. Remember to let the script flow to you, and if you aren't feeling an idea, dump it. This is why it is good to eliminate all but about 6.


This is the part where you really start to incorporate the characters, so it is good to have a plan off attack for this step, even though you are making very rough drafts.

Start the draft by writing a bit out in ""story form"". Just write it like you would see in a novel. From here you should start determining what the characters say and do, or react, to the situation. Remember to make your situation seem bad to the characters, yet funny to the viewers. In the end, it should end up being funny for both parties.



, You will need to take a few things into consideration with this. Those factors include:


What type of situation it is. Will you affect your decision because of the time of year (holidays, seasons, tradition, etc.)?
Who is involved. What characters are involved and do they work in this situation well together? There is an old rule in writing comedy that says ""opposites attract"". This means that in a sitcom, two different types of people will make for a funny situation.
Your gut feeling. What does your gut tell you about the idea? Deep down, do you think it is a winner? It is key to personally believe in the idea.

, This is the first stage of the final product. Use the rough draft you have as a basis for writing the script. Elaborate deeply on the situation. Remember to add every little detail, as the episode (when aired) will be around 21-23 minutes long.

, Weather you are working on a team for this or not, get input from others and don't be afraid to ask for help if you are stuck on an idea.


Sleep. This may seem silly, but sleeping can help you come up with ideas for a script. If you are having dreams about the sitcom, that means you are really getting into the episode and that is when your mind will come up with some great ideas. If you do start having those dreams, keep your mind open to dreaming.
People. Other people may come up with some great scenarios that even you couldn't think of, so there is no harm done in asking for some other opinions.
Other shows. Many teenage sitcoms are based around the same ideas, so if you are having trouble, watch some shows and pay attention to the big picture (what the episode is trying to say as a whole to the viewer) and the details (some of the smaller quirks that makes the show its own).

, Once you have ""finished"" the script, take a break for a few days, then come back to edit it. Editing the script should not take very long, but just remember to take your time. Don't be afraid to change some things around or even re-write some sections. Use a color like red and make your edits visible.

, Plug in the revisions you made and then re-read. If you find anything else you figure worth changing, don't be afraid to change it. Some writers do this dozens of times before they think they have it just right.

, Weather it is a ""publisher"" or producer, send the script in to be finalized. Know that whomever you are sending the script in to will more than likely change it up a bit.



Be confident. Try to be confident, but not over-confident, while awaiting a response from the producer or publisher. Although it won't physically improve your chances, it may help if you do get rejected of have to change things up.

, This will give you a list of what you need before you send it back in.


Make sure you do exactly as the producer says. Even though you may disagree, he/she is the boss, and you need to try it their way if they didn't like yours.;
, Use the same guidelines as described above for editing.

, As always, be confident when doing this. At some point it will be good enough.

Learn the proper formatting techniques if you are planning to make this a professional career.,
Look around at all the different sitcoms on the air.,
Choose your genre and audience.,
Plan your characters.,
Write a basic plot line in your notepad.,
Start to write the script.,
Read it thoroughly.,
Write some more scripts without making any public, and always copyright them.,
Get an agent.",How to Write a Sitcom," The easiest way to do this is get some software that will format what you type into it appropriately (for example Celtx).


At the beginning of every scene write where it is, and whether you are indoors or outdoors (Int. = Indoors Ext. = Outdoors). Stage directions are written in blocks of text spanning from the margin on the left to the margin on the right. Text is in blocks at the middle spanning from the centre (imagine the page is split into three equal thirds, you would be writing text in the center). Always have characters' names in capitals except within dialogue.;
, Look at where they come from. The show's nation usually dictates the comedy used. For example, American comedy is mainly slapstick and what happens to the characters, whereas British comedy is more about what the characters do to each other and fooling the audience. Of course, there are many other styles, so just look around and find an amusing balance.

, You can have sci-fi, adventure, or something as simple as the misadventures of two friends (also known as slice-of-life).

, Get a notebook and dedicate a page to a character. Explain how they act and behave, how they talk, and most importantly, why. The characters are the basis of your story.

, You will want about 15 to 20 plot points, and this may sound daft, but make sure they are in chronological order. You don't want to write any jokes here as this comes with the script.

, Get your laptop, computer, book, anything! Just start writing. Use the format if you're planning on selling this. Type in Courier New, size 12, since this is the industry standard. This is where you put the jokes in. Make them true to your character and to your style. You want to write about 25 pages (the general rule of thumb is one minute per page).

, Look for character consistency and plot holes. Once you have read that, revise it into the second draft. Always save every draft as a different file. This is so that you can read them all through, and if you think the humour starts to slip somewhere, go back to where it started to slip and revise!

, However, you'll want about 5 scripts, at least at first. Do not let anyone but critics and friends see them. This is to build up a small portfolio and avoid plagiarism.

, Search for some agencies and try to get an agent. Look for an agent with a good history and a nice price. This is where your scripts come in, as the agencies will probably want to read some of your work. If they don't, ditch them.

, You will need to use Courier font (typewriter font) (12 point) when writing your script. This will give it a more professional appearance but it is also key for making it easier to read. Similarly, you should use the correct indentations for each part of your script, as it will help the reader differentiate between dialogue, scene description, etc., Use slug lines before each scene. These say whether the action is taking place inside or outside, what the location is, and if it is day or night. A character's name should go in all caps above, or next to, their dialogue (depending on what you're writing for). You can also put instructions, such as pauses, in parentheses.

, If you want to write a movie script, then you will have to write your script in that format. If you want to write a play script, then you will have to write your script in that format. While they are largely similar, there are distinct differences and learning them all can take time. Read lots of scripts in your intended medium to see how the pros do it.

, Scripts usually last about one minute per page, though there is certainly some wiggle room.Scripts are not like books in that word counts. It is a definitive way to gauge length.

, Write a short sentence or phrase of the fundamental concept which drives the plot. This can be something which is the message or idea behind your story, an extremely short plot idea, or something else to give you a goal and unifying idea to work toward.

, Before you begin actually writing dialog and script, it might help to create a basic road-map/story of what will happen in your story so you don't get sidetracked and can work out any plot holes or kinks. Sketch out a general plan and envision how events will unfold. This should be told in the third-person.

, Write the entire premise of the play, movie, etc. with lots of details and ideas, paying no mind to style, format, repetition, or anything else that gets in the way of your creative flow. Your finished product should cover the plot, personalities, relationships, character arcs, and a larger point to the story. Sometimes, drawings or diagrams may be used as a temporary storyboard to show to other persons to demonstrate facets of your plot and characters, etc.


Your characters should drive the action on the stage or screen, so make sure they are interesting and innovative. It may not be necessary for you to fully develop them right away, however, as they tend to take on lives of their own as the script-writing continues.

, Now that you have everything on paper, look for dead weight, weak links, irrelevant details, over-explaining, sidetracking, elements that drag, and anything else that weakens the overall trajectory. Be harsh; just because you fell in love with something you worked on in the exploratory phase doesn’t mean it should survive the revision phase.

, Watch plays, tv shows, and movies which are similar to the work you’ve just written. Examine your own work in comparison to these others. Do you fall into to many tropes? Is your story over done? See if you can find ways to distinguish yourself from these works.


Work on making profound contributions to the subject you’ve written. Take a philosophical approach to the topic and challenge conventional ideas. This will make your work much more engaging.

, You don’t need overly fancy dialogue or crazy scenes to keep your audience engaged. Much like with writing a book, our work shines the most when we are showing, not telling. Make your character’s choices speak for them and put more meaning into what they don’t say than what they do., The exact format will vary depending on whether you’re writing for theater, TV, or the silver screen – and in what country. (For example, the American TV industry’s standard script format is modeled on the business plan.) Use proper headers to introduce scenes, identify each speaker, and so on; many production companies won’t even look at a script if it isn’t properly formatted.


Consider purchasing script-writing software for this phase of the process. There are several programs that will guide you through the formatting or even convert an already-written script into the correct layout.

, Remember, scripts are all about action and dialog. Make sure your characters speak realistically, and try not to mix styles of speech and vocabulary too much unless you are going for a certain effect.

, Don't forget to include important details such as time of day, setting, and actions of the characters in the scene. These are nearly as important as the dialog that occurs.

, Provide a sense of what’s happening on screen, but leave it to the director to fill in the details. Writing out all of the action is not the writer’s job. Trying to include too much of this will only leave you disappointed when things are changed.

, Dialogue will make or break your characters and their relationships. What’s worse, dialogue is extremely difficult for most people to write. To get your bearings, write down or record real conversations to see how people really speak and which expressions they use.


Be sure to listen to a variety of speakers so that you can give your own characters more flavor and individuality.
Ensuring that different characters have their own ""voice"" and ""persona"" based on their background will keep them from blending into one another. Remember, their persona will affect their attitude, word choices and dialect.
Read your dialogue aloud as you go, paying extra attention to whether or not it sounds halting, stereotyped, over-the-top, or totally uniform.

, Polish it, but don't be a perfectionist; work toward perfection, not to it.

, Choose people who not only come from different backgrounds and have varied personal tastes, but are also willing to provide honest feedback.


Don't let yourself feel insulted, controlled, upset, or angered by a critiques or remarks; they’re opinion, not fact. Laugh and be enthusiastic about help and advice, but weigh your critics’ opinions against your own judgment before implementing any changes.

, Painful as it may be, you’ll be glad when you’re finally able to convey your vision.

Write the logline.,
Introduce the main characters and setting.,
Summarize Act I.,
Cover Act II.,
Finish with Act III.,
Think of a title that fits your story.,
Designate it a synopsis.,
Add your contact information.,
Keep it brief.,
Write in the present tense.,
Use third-person point of view.,
Use single spacing.,
Stick to a standardized typeface and font.,
Avoid extravagant language.,
Give your synopsis to other people to proofread.,
Prepare to make edits.",How to Write a Screenplay Synopsis," The logline is at most two sentences that sum up your screenplay. Include the identity of the protagonist (the main character/hero), the challenge(s) they’re trying to overcome, and why they must overcome them.If you can, follow the logline with a paragraph describing why your screenplay is attractive from a filmmaker's point of view.


For example, if it can be shot on a small budget using a limited number of locations near Los Angeles, your movie might be more attractive than one that will require a distant location, elaborate sets, or a lot of special effects.

, Limit this part to one paragraph. Include the names (who), their occupations (what), where they live and work (where), the time period of the story (when), and the reason you’re telling their story (why).Type the names of the characters in all capital letters the first time their names appear. After that, type the character names in the usual way.Characters that should be included in the synopsis are the protagonist, the antagonist (villain), the love interest, and any important allies of the protagonist. Leave out the names of lesser characters., Limit this summary to about 3 paragraphs or half of a page. Act I is the setup. Introduce the characters and the main conflict that drives the story., Dedicate about a page to Act II. Show all the conflicts your characters face. Show how these conflicts lead to the crisis, or the characters’ reversal of fortune., Limit this part to no more than 3 paragraphs (about half a page). Describe how the ultimate conflict ends and what happens to the characters afterward. Don’t worry about spoilers. Your reader needs to know how the plot ends. Tie up all loose ends when finishing your summary of Act III., You can try to make the title catchy and interesting, but the director of the movie studio will probably change it, so don't work on it too hard. Put the title at the top of the page.

, This might seem obvious, but it’s easy to overlook. In the header of your document, write out the word “Synopsis” and the title of your movie. Under the title, inform your reader of the genre of you screenplay (drama, horror, comedy, etc.).For example, a synopsis for Star Wars might include “A science fiction adventure” beneath the title.

, At the top of the first page beneath the header, enter your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address. Include your Writers Guild of America (WGA) registration number.Always register your completed screenplay and/or treatment with the WGA to establish your authorship

, Make sure your synopsis is at least two pages. A one-page synopsis might seem less time-consuming, but your reader will see it as lacking the necessary details. At the same time, keep it at no more than three pages.This will allow your reader to finish your synopsis in about 15 minutes.

, Even if your plot is set in the past or the future, use present tense verbs. For example, in a screenplay for Star Wars, you might write “Obi-Wan Kenobi fights Darth Vader.” This is because the action in your screenplay happens as you write it, not in the time period you set it in., Even if you have a narrator doing voiceovers in the screenplay, the camera always takes an all-seeing viewpoint. Use pronouns like “he,” “she,” and “they.”For example, you would say, “When Little Teapot gets all steamed up, he shouts to tip him over and pour him out.”

, Keep each paragraph single-spaced. Place an extra space between individual paragraphs. When you start a new paragraph, don’t indent. This will allow your reader to “digest” the material more efficiently.

, If your reader can’t read what’s on the page, your synopsis will end up in the recycling bin. For this reason, you should avoid script- or handwriting-style typefaces. Stick to defaults like Times New Roman or Arial. Keep your font size at 12, unless the submission guidelines specify something different., Write in plain, succinct language that any audience can understand. In order to sell your screenplay, your reader must first understand what your plot is about. If you use jargon or flowery language, your reader probably won’t bother going past the first few paragraphs. If you pad your synopsis with unnecessary adjectives or adverbs, it’s no longer a synopsis. Stay brief, and you’ll be one step closer to your goal., Ask them to look for errors in spelling, grammar, and any information that isn’t clear to them. This could be a friend, family member, or colleague. If they have any questions or if something isn't clear to them, change your synopsis to make the story clearer. If your reader finds something in your synopsis that’s unclear or confusing, they won’t request your full screenplay.

, Many organizations you may submit your synopsis to publish submission guidelines. Change your synopsis, if necessary, to fit those guidelines. The agent, movie studio, or other reader will likely request changes to fit established word counts or page counts. Follow those suggestions exactly if you want your synopsis to pass the next round."

Choose your characters: Nothing is more irritating than starting a script and then not realising who it's about, so plan out the characters carefully.,
Plan it out: There are several ways that you can plan out a story.,
Put together the setting: Where is your story set?,
Don't drag: Nobody wants to read a 100 pages on one small conversation about what Marge is planning for dinner, so keep small things short and sweet.

,
Don't rush: It can be bad enough to have too long a script but people don't want to read a short script without any plot or thought either.,
Stay relaxed: Don't write your script if you're frustrated otherwise it can be rather a challenge to keep things at bay.,
Criticism: If you type up your Simpsons' script (If you haven't already typed it on the computer) and decide to post it on the internet (Use the Spell Check on word too) you may get criticism for it, don't get in a state.,
Feel great: At the end of the day it's up to you how you feel about your script.,

Face it, not all kids will agree on one thing between the ages of 5-12, but maybe something that's a common like with kids will work.;
, That makes it a lot easier, because you could introduce songs with little jokes, like for example, if ""We wish you a Merry Christmas"" was going to come on, you could say something like, ""We're going to play We wish you a Merry Christmas, because it's coming up! And I certainly hope all you viewers have a merry Christmas.""

, Have cute contests with prizes like webkinz or toys R us gift cards. The questions should be fairly easy, but not so easy they don't have to think it through. And remember most kids won't want to be given educational questions. Also let them request songs, and call the phone number of the phone in the room you're broadcasting from. Be sure to tell them to request appropriate songs!

, And boys may like hearing about Pokémon, Bakugan, or Nickelodeon TV shows.

, There's nothing like a good joke to break the ice. Make sure it's not corny, like any joke about the chicken crossing the road! Every kid has heard that joke before! Kids may like gross out jokes (But not too gross, for the parents' approval.) and other jokes. Knock knock jokes are great, too!

, This is the most important rule! Don't bring up anything inappropriate or else you'll be getting plenty of calls from parents! And trust me, they won't be good conversations! Never swear or say any name calling words, never mention drugs or alcohol, and never say anything too gross.

, One thing about kids is that they get bored easily. Have cute activity ideas for them like games they can play (That they don't already know, like tag or cost money, like board games.) or crafts they can do.

, Have two types of countdowns. A countdown of the top 10 kids' songs of the week and countdowns to kid-popular holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas.

Determine what the scene needs to say or accomplish.,
Choose the characters that you need for the scene.,
Find an interesting or exciting setting for the scene.,
Start the scene with a strong hook.,
Sketch the scene out roughly by hand.,
Build your scenes around action and events, not thoughts.",How to Write a Scene1," You need to know what your scene adds to the larger work. A scene should be able, in large part, to stand on it's own as a mini-story. Your characters, and the reader, need to be at a different place at the end of the scene than the beginning. If you haven't shown growth or exposed something new to the audience then the scene likely isn't necessary. The best scenes accomplish many things at once, often very subtly. Common uses for a scene include:Moving the plot forward.
Establishing or resolving conflict/tension.
Illuminating new character traits.
Showing how characters have changed.
Exposing or illustrating a new location or new character.
Telling a joke or hitting an important emotional beat.;
, Once you know what the scene needs to accomplish, you need to find out who needs to be there to accomplish it. If you're writing a screenplay or script, you want as few characters as you need. You may not notice a character hasn't spoken in five minutes on the page, but you will notice them sitting around silently on stage. Remember that, while you want your characters to behave realistically, you still need your scene to accomplish it's goal. Instead of bending a character to fit your plot, leave them out of the scene or find a way to make them fit into the scene without betraying their character.If you're writing a stand-alone scene, like a skit, spend some time brainstorming characters. You might write out a few sentences, or do a full character sketch.


, Try to think of something beyond the obvious for the best results. What kind of location would best highlight your conflict, tension, or theme? Where can you believably set the character while still exposing new sides of them. Oftentimes, the setting you choose provides conversation topics for your characters, especially in the beginning of the scene. You can try and make a slight metaphor between the location and the actual scene, such as Invisible Man's famous, metaphorical white paint factory scene playing on ""white-washing"" race relations.


While most dates take place in a park or at a nice restaurant, Rocky's famous courtship scene is extra powerful because it is in an abandoned ice-skating rink, which mimics the shape and feel of a boxing ring.
The violent ending of There Will Be Blood is extra shocking because it takes place in the most innocent setting of the entire movie -- a home bowling alley.
The turning point of the North Korean set Orphan Master's Son takes place in Texas, putting the characters in perhaps the least North Korean location imaginable to spur their rebellion., You want your first lines of the scene to pull the reader immediately in. Oftentimes, writers have the first line or two of the scene already in their head, spurring them on to write. But that doesn't mean the first choice is necessarily the best. Write down 4-5 different openings, keeping in mind your goals for the scene, and then move forward from your favorite.How many lines can you cut at the very beginning of the scene before you get to essentials? It's best to dive right into the story instead of following your character through a normal day.

, Free yourself from perfection and just take off writing. Once you have an opening, even one you're not sure you want to keep, write out the scene quickly as it comes to you. Let your characters speak and react to the position you put them in, even if it doesn't conform to your original plan. Take a detour or unleash a surprise on your characters during a moment of inspiration. Remember that this is just a quick draft. You will pick and choose the best moments later on.


The goal is to start visualizing the scene, playing the movie or novel in your head as you write., Monologues are not scenes, and neither are philosophical discussions. Both have their place in movies and books, but they don't have their place in scenes. When writing scenes, you need to think in concrete terms, letting tangible events shape the scene and propel your characters and plot forward. Even a good conversation can be a scene, as conversation can reveal surprising insights and trigger new events. However, a middling conversation between two best friends that doesn't show us anything new is not a scene. Some tips include:


Thinking in terms of action and reaction, not random chance, to make more dynamic scenes.
Leading with the action. If someone thinks about doing something, then does it, like hitting a character, start with the punch first. Then follow up with ""she'd wanted to do that for a long time.""
Revealing inner thought through action. Hemingway was a master of this, using small actions to show bigger emotions. For example, a character leaning back in a chair suddenly leans forward, putting all four chair legs down, as he has just heard news of his long-lost lover, who he pretends not to know, in ""The Big Two-Hearted River."
"
Find the scene's central conflict.,
Choose the ""third option"" to surprise readers.,
Make your characters speak in unique, differentiated voices.,
Use details and descriptions to help with pacing.,
Reread the scene through each character's perspective.,
Cut the scene to bare bones.,
Ask yourself if the scene is essential to the larger story.",How to Write a Scene2," The general arc of the scene, or how it changes from beginning to end, is the most obvious layer of a scene. But underneath that layer, in all good scenes, is conflict. At its most basic level, conflict is the difference between what a character wants (money, love, power, a steak) and what he/she can get. Conflict is usually between two characters, and is often not talked about out loud. But you need to identify it as a writer and find a way to incorporate it into the scene every time.


Shakespeare was the master of hidden conflict. Look, for example, at Macbeth, who as the reader knows, is hiding a murderous guilt under every act of kindness or political speech.
Conflict is often created out of character traits. On Parks and Recreation, we know that libertarian Ron Swanson hates the Federal Government. This makes his decision to ask for a job at the US National Parks Service in one scene much more poignant.
Conflict does not have to immediately resolve. Every scene of Memento is built upon a conflict between what we remember and what we think we remember. Each scene plays subtly between the two opposing sides.

, In most scenarios, characters face two choices. They might marry the girl, or remain single; save the town or retreat to safety; take the big promotion, or stay with their family, etc. But the real world is not so black and white. The most effective scenes set up this dichotomy and then abandon it for a completely surprising and more satisfying third option. This could be a new plan, a compromise, or even a disaster that ruins or changes everything. Not every scene should choose the ""third options."" Still, try to keep your mind open to alternatives when writing.


Of course, the ""third option"" could be the fourth or fifth option. The larger goal is to choose something hidden or unsuspecting, instead of the obvious outcome.
Make a list of 25 different endings or options, even dumb or improbable ones, if you get stuck.

, You want your characters to sound vibrant and different from one another. If you were to remove all of the dialog tags, such as ""Maggie said"" or ""DAVE:"", you should still be able to tell who is actually talking. The better you know your characters, the easier it will be.


Slang, expressions, accents, and even punctuation are good ways to differentiate characters' voices.

, When you add details, like the color of the room or the people passing outside, use them to slow down the pace and give the scene some room to breathe. For example, instead of writing, ""they sit in silence,"" take some time to describe what the characters do with their silence. What do they look at, smell, touch, or think?


Details are best when the reflect the inner lives of characters. For example, a sad character is likely to notice an abandoned storefront. They might not notice the happy people at the cafe, or they could complain about how happy everyone looks.
In general, scripts and plays should only have the essential details. If you want silence or calm moments, show it in your action lines, such as ""he pours his coffee silently."", Some writers even draft up short versions of the scene from different perspectives. The goal is to ask yourself if each character is behaving realistically. If your audience can stand up and say -- ""that person would never do that,"" you'll deflate the energy from the scene instantly. Find ways to get believable reactions that are true to each character and the scene will shine.

, This is often the hardest part of writing a scene, but it is absolutely crucial. Readers bring their imaginations to the scene, filling in the smaller details and even the tone of voice. The temptation to put your exact vision for the scene is strong, but is ultimately impossible. Instead, let your reader fill in the gaps. Most importantly, this makes your real moments shine even brighter when left on their own., Ignore whether your like the scene or not, whether it is hilarious or heart-wrenching. If you removed the scene, would the larger plot of the story change in any way? If not, then you may want to remove the scene altogether. Save the funny bits or the beautiful monologues and see if they can fit into other, more useful scenes. Ultimately, if the scene is just spinning its wheels, you'll get more mileage out of these little snippets in more powerful scenes."

"
Create a visual picture.,
Use the narrator device.,
Create action through dialogue.,
Make the most of sound effects.,
Use Mixer effects.,
Include music.,
Create believable characters.,
Be precise and clear with your language.",How to Write a Radio Play," Writing for radio requires you to paint a picture in the audience's mind. This means the use of descriptive words to build up images that enable the listening audience to identify with the characters, the world the characters live in and the atmosphere for each scene. Use of color is very important to create the image in the listener's mind; for example, have the characters mention such things as ""the vast blue sky"", ""the shimmering red evening gown"", ""the bright yellow VW"", ""the luminous orange iPod"", etc.;
, A narrator is very useful in the context of radio:


The narrator can lay out the scene, explain action sequences and wrap up the scene.
If you are writing a radio serial, the narrator can summarize the previous episode's action.
The narrator can switch between scenes: ""And meanwhile, back at Joey's pad, the dogs had eaten all the party food....""

, Since all you have to work with is dialogue rather than props, a setting, or visual cues, your dialogue will need to work hard. It can be used to describe action as it is taking place: for example, ""Oh look! Jenny's car is rolling through the fence of that field and into a ditch. And George is running after it as fast as he can! Should we help?"" Use verbs to paint your active scene and be as descriptive as it is possible to be in a conversation or discussion to describe the scene occurring around the action.

, Sound effects are the radio playwright's best friend and also the entertaining part. Work in sound effects to bring the play to life. Consider such sound effects:


Doors - opening and shutting them creates options for bangs, squeaks and knocking; doors in the wind create the opportunity for a relentless soft banging or a creaking etc.
Street sounds - children's cries, school bells, scooter zooms, freeway traffic, street vendor's cries etc.
Kitchen objects - a kettle whistling, a toaster popping up, knife scraping butter into toast, lids of jam jars being popped open etc.
Astounding noises - things to wake up your audience such as an explosion, a car crashing, an angry mob shouting etc.

, You can use effects which are built into the mixing desk to help create actualization. When it comes to producing your play, and if you are producing it, be sure that you do a sound check with the effects, to ensure the sound levels and effects are how you want them:


Panning - Use to portray the position of specific sounds, or to portray movement. This can be achieved by moving the Pan control into the desired position you want the sound.
Reverb - Use this to set the acoustics of a location. For example, empty rooms, caves, halls and basketball courts to name a few.

, Music in the background can help to set the mood of your play. Obviously, you can match music to feelings, such as sad music for sad occasions featuring death or loss; happy music for good news; suspenseful music for a scary or worrying moment and fast music for increased action or a chase. Music also sets the opening and closing tone of a radio play, serving as the aural curtain for your play.

, As with any play writing, you need characters who are believable. Yet, radio allows you some leeway; you may write quite a number of characters into your play but when it is produced, the actors may be able to change their voices to cover quite a few of the characters without needing a large cast. Therefore, do not feel hemmed in by worrying about the lack of recording space!

, Everything must be clear in the language because your listener cannot view a character using facial expressions, waving arms about or throwing objects etc. Silence must be used carefully so as not to convey an empty space; silence cannot be used for great effect on the radio as it makes listeners think the power has gone off. Use it sparingly.

,How to Write a Properly Formatted Screenplay1,
"
Put “FADE IN” on the first page.,
Begin every scene with a scene heading.,
Include short action lines.,
Capitalize all character names on their first appearance.,
Format the dialogue properly.,
Include a transition note at the end of every scene.,
Indicate when dialogue is continuing to the next page.,
Add in shot notes.",How to Write a Properly Formatted Screenplay2," The first page of your screenplay should always include a “FADE IN” note at the top of the page as the first item on the page. Make sure the letters are in all capitals and are flush to the left margin of the page.Opening your screenplay with this note will indicate the screenplay has been formatted correctly, as you do not want to simply launch into your story right away. You should give the reader a sense of how the scene will open on the very first page.

, The next item on the page should be a scene heading, also known as a slugline, which is a one line description of the location and time of day of a scene. If the scene takes place indoors, you would have the heading: “INT.”, short for “interior.” If the scene takes place outdoors, you would have the heading “EXT.”, short for exterior.The scene heading should also indicate the location of the scene, such as “LIVING ROOM” or “HARDWARE STORE” and the time of day, such as “DAY” or “NIGHT.”
Make sure the scene headings always appear in all capitals, flush to the left margin of the page. You should always have a scene heading at the beginning of every new scene in your screenplay so the reader knows where they are.
For example, if your scene is outdoors at night in front of a hardware store, your scene heading would be: “EXT. HARDWARE STORE - NIGHT.”

, Underneath the scene heading, you should have a very short line of text that describes the first images we will see on screen. Action lines should be no longer than three lines at a time and only give the reader the most concise amount of information. Do not include long, convoluted action lines in your screenplay, as this is considered an amateur move.The action lines should give the reader a sense of setting and one to two strong images. These lines do not need to be in all capitals.
For example, you may have the action lines: “In a small, Canadian town, the streets are empty and covered in snow. The window display of the local hardware store is dimly lit.”

, You should make sure all character names appear in all capitals the first time they appear in the script. After the first appearance, you can revert to using regular punctuation for the character’s name.For example, if you are mentioning a character named Barb Hersh for the first time, the name would appear as “BARB HERSH” in the script. After the first time, you can refer to the character as “Barb” or “Barb Hersh.”

, The dialogue should appear properly formatted in your screenplay, especially as you will likely have a lot of dialogue and it should appear right every time. You should place the name of the character who is speaking above the dialogue and then have the dialogue appear below the character’s name.Make sure the name of the dialogue always has a left margin of 2.7” and a right margin of 2.4”. It should not be flush to the left or right margin of the page and should appear more in the center of the page.You should also include any notes on the attitude or demeanor of the character’s dialogue in parentheses underneath their name. Avoid including too many parenthetical notes in the dialogue and only use it when necessary. Try to limit the use of parenthetical notes to one time per a scene.
You may also extensions, which should be placed in parenthesis next to the character’s name. Extensions let the reader know how the character’s voice will appear on screen. Your character’s voice may be heard off screen (O.S.) or as a voice over (V.O.).
For example, the dialogue in your screenplay may appear as:
BARB
What are you doing out so late at night, Max?
MAX
Oh you know, couldn’t sleep.
BARB
Nightmares, again?
MAX
(agitated) No. (pause) I mean, good night.
BARB (O.S.)
Good night, Max.



, Transition notes are used in screenplays to let the reader know how the action will transition from scene to scene. Transition notes will also be useful for the editor of the film in post-production, as they will have a better sense of how you would like to transition from scene to scene.Common transitions used in screenplays include “FADE IN”, “FADE OUT”, “CUT TO”, and “DISSOLVE TO”. You may choose “FADE IN” or “FADE OUT” if you would like to gradually open and then gradually close a scene. “CUT TO” means a quick jump to a new scene. “DISSOLVE TO” means that as one scene fades out, a new scene fades into place.
Scene transitions should have a left margin of 6.0”. They should be in all capitals in the script. #*You should include a new scene heading after a transition note so the reader is situated in a new setting or scene.

, If a character’s dialogue continues onto the next page, you should indicate this in the screenplay. You may place the word “MORE” or “CONTINUED” in parentheses underneath the dialogue so it is clear that the dialogue is not done and continues on the following page.


For example, your dialogue may appear as:
BARB
I just don’t understand what he was doing out so late. He looked scared of something, like he had seen a ghost.
(MORE)



, You should include notes on how a shot will look on screen, especially if you feel it is important how the shot appears and want to notate this to your reader. Rather than include shot notes for every line of dialogue or throughout every scene, pick key moments in a scene to include a shot note.Common shot notes include “CLOSE UP” or “TIGHT ON”, which indicates a close up on a person or object on screen. For example: “CLOSE UP on Max’s face.”
If someone or something is going to be inserted into an ongoing scene, you may put in an ""INTERCUT."" Notate the intercut on its own line to the left margin of the page and then specify what is being inserted. For example, ""INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION.""
You may also note if there is going to be a montage on screen. A montage is a series of images that reflect a theme, contradiction, or passage of time. Notate a montage with the word “MONTAGE” and then a list of the images in the montage. For example, “MONTAGE: Max grabbing a can of gasoline, Max holding a box of matches, Max putting a nylon stocking over his face, Max walking up to the hardware store.”
You can also notate if you are going to use a tracking shot to follow a person or an object on screen. You may write “TRACKING SHOT” and then have a brief action line explaining the shot. For example, “TRACKING SHOT: Max walks up to the hardware store with the can of gasoline and the matches.”

"
"
Include a title page.,
Make sure the margin spacing is correct.,
Use the right font.,
Put in page numbers.",How to Write a Properly Formatted Screenplay3," Your screenplay should have a title page, as this will make it appear more professional and polished. The title page should contain the title of the screenplay, the writer’s name, and contact information. Do not include any other information on the title page, as you do not want to appear cluttered or unprofessional.Make sure the title appears in quotation marks and in all capitals in the center of the page. For example, “FIRE ON MAIN STREET.”
There should be four blank lines between the title and the author’s name. The writer’s name should be centered and appear one line below “Written by.”
You can include your basic contact information at the left margin of the title page. The last line of your contact information should appear one inch from the bottom of the page. You do not need to include a draft date on the title page.

, If you are adjusting the margins in the screenplay manually using your keyboard, you should make sure your margins are always correct for each notation in the script. Do not try to narrow your margins in an attempt to cram in more content into the script. Scripts with incorrect margins may be seen as unprofessional and inaccurate, as it is difficult to determine the running time of the film if the margins are off.Make sure all scene headings have a margin of 1.7” to the left and 1.1” to the right. Leave two blank lines before every scene heading.
Check that all dialogue has a left margin of 2.7” and a right margin of 2.4”. The names of characters over dialogue should have a left margin of 4.1”.
All parenthetical directions within the dialogue should have a left margin of 3.4” and a right margin of 3.1”.
The top page margin should be 0.5” or three single lines before the page number. The bottom page margin should be 0.5” or three single lines from the end of a scene.

, You should always use 12-point font in black colored type in your screenplay. Go for a font called Courier, not Courier New, or Prestige Pica, as these are the standard fonts used in screenplays.You should make sure the fonts are fixed-pitch so they create ten characters per horizontal inch and six lines per vertical inch.

, Your script should include page numbers at the top of each page. The page numbers should align with the right margin and be followed by a period. You do not need to put “Page” before the number.Make sure the page numbers are the same typeface and size as the body text. Start the page count on the first page of the screenplay, not on the title page.
Your screenplay should be between 100-120 pages, with about 55 lines per page. Try not to go over 120 pages, as shorter, punchier scripts tend to be more appealing.

In other words, what are you trying to inform or persuade people of? Pinning down why you want to start a newsletter in the first place will allow you to proceed with a definite aim.Newsletters can be used to share news updates, market products or services, current events, explain religious beliefs or scientific principles, comment on pressing issues or simply entertain. You’re only limited by what you can envision.
It may be useful to outline a literal mission statement for your newsletter and yourself as chief editor. A tagline like “to spread the love of stoneware ceramics” or “helping victims of abuse achieve inner peace” will provide a reference point for all that follows.

, Despite what their name suggests, not all newsletters are used to convey news. Think about what you plan to fill the pages of your newsletter with. In addition to updates and announcements, your publication might also contain special interest pieces, like self-help editorials or reporting on local politics. Since you’re the creator, the topics and scope of your newsletter are entirely up to you.In addition to traditional writing, newsletters can make use of many different forms of media (interviews, photos, video clips, sound bites, etc.), especially when they’re distributed electronically.
Your newsletter could be an overview of the local music scene and contain reviews of new record releases and live performances, or it might be filled with recipes and DIY craft projects for hobbyists.

, Bear in mind who your key readership is likely to be. If you’re launching a fine arts digest, for instance, it will most likely attract the attention of artists and art aficionados who live in your town. Your job is to offer this audience information and perspective on a subject of mutual interest. You’ll want to make sure the tone, writing and presentation of your newsletter matches the sensibilities of the people who will be reading it.It’s possible to tailor the message of your newsletter for an audience that doesn’t agree with your viewpoints. For example, you could publish a monthly periodical on the virtues of vegetarianism designed to reach people who eat meat, or use your content as way to convince those who are opposed to your beliefs on social issues.

, The frequency of your publication will depend largely on the topic and content you’ve selected, the availability of new information worth sharing and the amount of time you’re able to devote to production. Commit to releasing your newsletter weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or even semi-annually. Running a newsletter can be a lot of work, so make sure you’re able to deliver in the time frame you choose.You could come out with a new email newsletter as often as every couple of days if you’re covering an exhaustive or rapidly-developing topic.
Those who are working alone should consider taking a more infrequent approach to releasing their newsletters (perhaps bi-weekly or monthly), since they’ll have to manage everything themselves.

, Now that you’ve got your general objective and content mapped out, it’s time to get into the specifics of how your newsletter will be presented. Spend some time trying out different potential looks and titles. Sketch out some basic designs on a piece of paper, or play around with a text editor until you find a layout you like. Once these elements are in place, it will just be a matter of plugging in specific content.A newsletter describing the operations of a real estate business will probably contain more plain text and straightforward information than one on nature photography, which will feature lots of photos and more a aesthetic package.
If you’re at a loss for ideas, search for sample newsletters on the internet and study them for inspiration., Draw up a course of action regarding how to best go about planning, writing and finalizing the newsletter. Take into consideration factors like the length and depth of the info you’re providing, how much time you have to write or compile articles and how long it will take to complete each copy from start to finish. Stick closely to your timetable so that you can have each issue finished in time for it’s scheduled release.In order for your production schedule to be precise, you should aim to make your newsletter roughly the same format and length each cycle.
Try not to get behind. Setting small goals (such as giving yourself one week to write articles, or imposing a strict deadline for the finished product) and resolving to meet them will prevent you from having to play catch-up later on.

, If possible, recruit a friend or associate to give you a hand with the responsibilities of putting the newsletter together. This could include handing off the formatting duties to someone who is good with computers, or seeking written or visual contributions from like-minded creators. Not having to handle every aspect of production yourself can really lighten the load and make creating the newsletter a more enjoyable experience.Ask others with similar interests whether they would be willing to help out with the undertaking. Chances are, someone out there has had a similar idea and is looking for a way to make it happen.
Be sure to credit your colleagues for any content or service they provide.

, The final step of production is to actually create the newsletter’s physical form. If it is to be a basic print periodical, run off copies of each page and staple them together. If you have a more elaborate or unorthodox format planned, like a punk rock fanzine, assemble the copies by hand, adding unique touches as you see fit. Work in batches or ask for some assistance with the nitty-gritty labor so that you don’t get overwhelmed.Printing and assembling copies of your newsletter will take time. Make sure your production schedule accurately reflects the demands of this phase.

, Start small by giving out newsletters to friends, family and acquaintances. Put a stack in your backpack, briefcase or car so that you’ll have them on hand whenever you encounter an interested party. With any luck, or with enough copies, word of mouth will spread and so will your publication.Try passing out copies of your newsletter at public events and spots where lots of people tend to gather. The more relevant your newsletter is to the event or locale, the better.
With a limited budget and exposure, this is how most fresh, low-level publications will manage to find a foothold with readers.

, Gauge interest in your newsletter by having potential readers sign up with their mailing addresses. That way, you can send a copy straight to their home whenever a new one releases. A mailing list allows you to set up a direct channel through which to provide your reader base with new materials regularly.If someone isn’t interested in subscribing to your newsletter, don’t be pushy. Nobody likes to be harassed.

, Find an establishment where area periodicals are sold and ask the owner whether it would be okay for you to advertise your newsletter at their place of business, newspaper style. In many cases, places like coffee shops, bookstores, libraries and internet cafes have a kiosk where they offer a selection of printed publications. Your newsletter might find a home in one of these businesses.You’ll probably have more luck at local businesses than corporate chain stores, which are usually forced to follow certain regulations about other activities they allow to go on in their buildings.
Be sure to obtain express written or verbal permission before attempting to distribute your newsletter through another business.

, In today’s increasingly busy world, most information transactions are made via technology. Get with the times by hooking your reader base up with a hassle-free electronic newsletter delivered straight to their email. Simply save your finalized newsletter as a .doc or .pdf file (or scan and convert hand-produced newsletters) and upload them as an attachment when you send out your regular emails. What could be easier?To facilitate the process of sending out an email newsletter, compile a master list of reader email addresses and select the option to “send all.”
Not only will digital newsletters save you countless time, labor and expense, they will also likely be preferable to your readers, as they won’t have to deal with the clutter of traditional print newsletters."

Buy copies of the magazine you are published in.",How to Submit a Story to a Magazine," Whether you’re submitting your story over the internet or printing it and mailing it in, including a cover letter helps the editors keep tabs on your submission and remind them what it is about after reading other submissions. The cover letter should include your name and address, maybe your bio, as well as a quick look at the story.The brief look at your story is not a summary. Rather, limit this to 25 words and quickly explain who the main character is and what the conflict is about.
Address the letter to the editor by name. You can usually find the names of editors in the “About” sections of magazine websites or in books previously published.;
, In case your submission is chosen, the editors may want to include a short bio about you, about 3 sentences long. To prevent them from having to do more work by asking you for a bio once they are ready to publish, furnish them with one in your cover letter. Keep this bio about your work, not your likes and dislikes.You may want to list where you live, work, and where else you have been published. If you’ve never been published, focus on your experience and education.

, Decorative fonts like script or cursive make your writing unprofessional and your words difficult to read. Since the industry standard is plain, clear fonts like Calibri and Times, your submission should reflect understanding of this. If you want to be taken seriously, be serious about your font.Also avoid creative font colors and varying sizes of font.

, No matter what writing style editors prefer, they all like to get stories that are polished--and that means proofreading. Also look at your story for awkward wording and redundancy to boost the story's appeal.


Take into account that many editors don't like to see overwriting. Paring down your extra adjectives and being conservative with adverbs can keep your language simple yet engaging.One way to trim the fat from your writing is to use simple dialogue tags like “said” instead of flowery verbs like “uttered.”

, Write down or type up a list of where you send your stories and when. This way, if you send the same story to multiple magazines, it will be easy to figure out who to tell if your story gets accepted. You can’t have your work published in more than one place at a time.If you do submit the same story to different magazines at the same time, inform the editors in your cover letter that it is a “simultaneous submission” and assure them that you will inform them if your story is chosen elsewhere before they get to it.
Some journals and magazines do not accept simultaneous submissions. Such magazines will sometimes automatically reject your story if this is the case. Read closely when you send in your story to make sure it is ok to send it to more than one place at the same time.

, One of the best ways to reduce your risk of getting rejected is to read the magazine you want to be published in. Some writers refer to this as “research,” and it truly is the only way to tell if your story will be a good fit for the magazine. Read the short stories they publish and look for tone and writing style. If yours doesn’t match, it is doubtful you will be published.Another way to find a magazine that will fit the style of your story is to look at the publication history of your favorite contemporary author and see what magazines they submit to. Chances are that your style models theirs, so magazines that took their story might accept yours.

, Another way to make sure you don’t get immediately rejected is to read the submission guidelines. For example, many magazines only publish particular genres, and others change what kind of stories they want every few months. If your story doesn’t meet the guidelines, you will quickly be rejected and perhaps even labeled as a lazy submitter.Submission guidelines are usually posted on the same page as the online submission portal or near the address where editors want stories received.

, Literary magazines, usually either university or indie presses, are mainly the ones who take short stories. There are many other magazines out there, from scientific to pop culture, but most of these magazines aren’t looking for short stories. Focus on finding literary magazines.


Literary magazines aren’t the only magazines that take short stories. The New Yorker, for example, has a short story section.
There are many articles on the internet that compile lists of magazines that accept stories. Find one of these lists to get started.Some magazines advertise for submissions to “contests” rather than directly to their magazines, so include the word “contest” in an internet search for magazines to submit to.

, Look on the websites of different magazines to figure out how and where to submit your story. Some websites have submission portals where you simply upload your story, whereas others require you to mail in a paper copy.


If the latter is required, the address to send the story will be published on the magazine’s website or can be obtained over the phone and in previous magazine printings.

, It can feel devastating to be rejected by a magazine, especially when you have put a lot of work into a story. But don’t shut down. Rejections can happen for more reasons than simply that your story “wasn’t good.” You may have misinterpreted the submission guidelines or been a bad fit for the magazine. Get back out there and find other magazines to submit to.


Don’t try to contact a magazine that has rejected your story. This displays immaturity and a misunderstanding of how the publishing industry works.You don’t have to steer clear of a magazine just because they rejected one story. Unless they ask you to stop submitting, you can continue to submit other stories.
The truth is that the publishing industry is very competitive, and even small presses get flooded with submissions. As a result, almost all submissions get rejected. Don't take it personally.

, Keep submitting your stories to magazines. If you are a strong writer, one day you will most likely be accepted. Find other writers to encourage you when you get discouraged, and revise your stories. You can even tailor a story to fit the style of a particular magazine to increase your odds of being accepted., Once you get accepted, the editors might want additional items from you, like your approval for edits they want to make. These will more than likely be formatting and proofreading changes rather than changes to the meaning of your words.


Send a thank you letter when accepted. A thank you email works, but a real letter makes more of a lasting impact, which can increase your reputation and odds of getting published again., Even though you are a writer in a publication and may receive free copies of the magazine as a result, it is polite to purchase a few copies. This helps the magazine stay running and gives you more copies to circulate among friends and colleagues."

Figure out where you can find a printer equipped to print out a paper. You can ask a local newspaper if you can use their printer. You can also stop by a local print shop, such as a FedEx, and see how much they charge.

, Your paper should have some kind of mission statement and goals. What sort of content will you produce? What kind of newspaper do you want to create?Think about what genres of writing you will include. What kind of news stories would you want to tackle for your feature articles? Do you want to stick to unbiased reporting, or include some editorials as well? Should you just include the basic news or look for interesting or controversial stories?
Think about lighter subjects you wish to include. Will you have someone to cover sports? Entertainment? School events? Will these be on the front page of your paper, or kept in a separate section?
Write up a mission statement. It can begin with something like, ""The goal of our paper is to provide students a unique voice and report on issues relevant to our school.""

, Once you know the kind of resources you need, you'll have an idea of the kind of meeting space you want. Talk to your school's principal about booking a classroom to meet for the newspaper.Make sure you get a room with the right resources. If you're doing a digital paper, for example, you probably want a room with computers.

A whiteboard or chalkboard may be necessary to jot down notes as the meeting progresses. If you plan on giving a presentation overviewing the plans for the paper, you may want a room with a projector.

, You should have a sense of how much money you need. Make a list of everything that will cost money. Decide about how much money you will need for each aspect of the paper.If you're printing your paper, figure out how much printing will cost. Are you printing at your school or at a print shop? Do you have to pay for paper? How much paper will you use? Figure out the total number of pages you're printing and how much it will cost.
You will also need other supplies. You may need pens and pencils for editing. You may need to pay for some graphic design software for the technical side. Figure out the costs of these expenses as well.

, Contact local businesses. They may be willing to give you money for your paper if you're willing to give them ad space.Go to businesses trying to attract a teenage audience. The grocery store where your mom shops may not benefit from advertising in a student newspaper. However, the coffee shop that high school students frequent may be interested in ad space.
Approach managers politely. Explain to them you're starting a newspaper and need funds for printing and other costs. Give them specific details about ads. How big will the ad space be? Where in the paper will the ads appear?

, They may be able to provide you with funding. School boards often have a certain amount of money they can pass out to student clubs.How you request money will vary by school. Ask someone on student council or the school board about the formal requirements for requesting money. In some cases, you may have to register your club with the school before requesting funds.
You will probably have to explain your plan for the paper. You also may have to explain how it benefits the school. A newspaper can be a great way to teach students about reading, writing, and journalism. It can also help the student body stay informed about current events. These are things worth mentioning when requesting funds.

, You can raise money on your own. There are many fundraising outlets you can engage in to gain money for your paper.Try planning an event like a bake sale, car wash, or talent show. You can sell tickets or goods and services for money.

Try an online fundraiser. Sites like GoFundMe can be used to ask for money for a variety of projects.

, Once you've gained funds, begin work on your paper. The first step is assigning articles. Make sure each writer has an article that matches his or her skills.Pick articles that match each writer's skills. A student that tends to be the class clown my be best suited to write a comedic article. A politically inclined student could write an op-ed about current events.
Make sure you're covering everything you want to cover. You cannot give everyone their first choice article. Some news stories may not be interesting, but remind your staff there are no small parts. Everyone makes a valuable contribution to the paper, and there's always the next issue to get a better article.

, You want to know what your paper will look like. Schedule a meeting with the students working on graphic design. Talk over what you want the layout to look like like.Think about where you want to place stories. Which stories will be on the front page? Will you have separate sections for things like sports, politics, arts, and entertainment?
Are you going to print in color? Are photographs included? How will these be integrated into the articles?

, A newspaper would be a little boring if it only had written content. Think about other things you could include in your first issue.You should include photos. A photographer can add a visual element to articles.
Do you have anyone who likes to draw? Including some cartoons can help.
Think about including things like puzzles. A crossword puzzle or word scramble can be a fun addition to your paper.

, It's always good to give your paper a quick proofread and edit before sending it out. Assign teams to edit everyone's content carefully. You can give writers advice for revisions, and also proofread for general clarity.


It's not unusual for people to miss their own errors when reading their work. Therefore, it may make sense to have students swap articles with one another., In the days before your release, make sure students know your paper is coming out. You want to make sure the paper is widely read.You can hand out flyers at the beginning your classes. You can also put posters up around the school.
If you're doing an online paper, see if you can send your school a mass email the day your paper comes out.

Keep the area clean.,
Avoid folding the newspaper.,
Avoid contact with possibly damaging items.",How to Preserve Newspaper1," Handling delicate newspapers that you want to preserve requires a lot of care and extra precautions. This means washing your hands before touching the newspapers to remove any possibly damaging residue on your hands. You should also have a clean workspace – like a big, clean table – to use while handing the newspapers.Make sure your hands are dry before touching the newspaper, especially if you just washed your hands.
Keep food and drinks away from the area while you are working with the newspapers.;
, When handling newspapers that you intend to preserve, try to never fold them except on their original middle crease. Keep the edges aligned neatly so that the center fold remains intact and other portions of the newspaper don’t get folded inadvertently.Additionally, you should avoid folding the corners of newspapers, even in a dog ear fold to mark a certain passage, as this will further damage the newspaper.

, Newspapers are extremely fragile and can be permanently damaged by contact with most other surfaces or items that aren’t intended for use with newspaper conservation.This includes paper clips, rubber bands, adhesive tape, or any kind of glue.

"
"
Shield the newspaper from light.,
Separate newspaper pages using acid-free paper.,
Consult a professional conservator.",How to Preserve Newspaper2," Light has an incredibly damaging effect on newspaper pages and the print that appears on them. Over time, prolonged exposure to light will cause a newspaper to become brittle and the content to fade.Keep your precious newspapers out of light (both natural and artificial) whenever possible. Don’t store them in a bright rooms or leave them outside in the sun.

, Because newsprint has lots of acid, keeping pages pressed together encourages acid to spread and break down the wood pulp fibers. Contact with any acidic materials can cause extensive damage to the pages, so you need to protect them by inserting acid free paper between each page.Alkaline buffered tissue, available from conservation suppliers, is the best option for separating newspaper pages.
A cheaper alternative is acid-free tissue paper which, while not preventing the spread of acid between pages, does reduce the risk of increasing the acidity of the newspaper.

, For especially valuable newspapers, it may be advisable to contract the services of a professional conservator. Conservators can remove acid from newspapers and provide top-notch storage equipment; their services, however, will likely run into the hundreds of dollars. Lists of available conservators can be found at the website of the American Institute of Conservation.Additionally, there are products available for de-acidifying old documents, such as Archival Mist spray. However, unless your newspaper is very new, you should always consult a conservator before using such products, as you may unintentionally damage your newspaper in your effort to conserve it.

"
"
Place the newspaper in a shallow, rigid box.,
Store the newspaper in a dry, dark, cool area.,
Display newspapers behind UV-resistant glass.",How to Preserve Newspaper3," You want to protect the newspaper from air, light, and pests. Newspaper-specific storage boxes are available from conservation suppliers and most craft stores; however, a simple cardboard or wooden box will do as long as it is acid-free.Boxes and sleeves used for storing film are also appropriate.

, To prevent the degradation of the newspaper material, you need to store it in an appropriate place. This means somewhere dark and cool with no humidity or moisture in the air. There should be no light, natural or otherwise.Your newspaper storage area should be between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (or between 15 and 21 degree Celsius). Humidity should be between 40 and 50 percent.
Places that fluctuate in temperature or acidity – like garages, basements, or attics – are not ideal.

, If you wish to have the newspaper out of a box, consult a framer for the best type of glass and frame. You will want a backing board that is acid-free, and you will want your glass to block UV light. Remember that when you display newspapers you still need to keep them in dry, dark, cool places.If you are framing a newspaper clipping, mount it to an acid-free and lignin-free album page using acid-free and lignin-free paper photo corners. Using tape, glue, or paper that is not acid-free can cause damage to the clipping."
"
Scan newspapers.,
Take digital photos of newspaper pages.,
Use a copy of the newspaper for display.",How to Preserve Newspaper4," Another option for preserving newspapers is to use a scanner or copier to reproduce the document. Scanning allows you to create a digital copy of the newspaper that you can keep on your computer and then view digitally or make copies of it whenever you want. Copies made on regular printing paper will be more durable than the original newspaper itself.


Make sure that you don’t run the newspaper through an automatic feeder as it could damage the original document. Instead, carefully place the newspaper on the top glass for scanning, being careful not to press down too hard on the cover., In addition to scanning your newspaper, you can also preserve it by taking digital pictures of the newspaper pages. This will create a digital image that you can save on your electronic devices for future use.


To do this, you can use a digital camera or even the camera on your smartphone.

, If you want to display your newspaper, consider using a printed photocopy for the actual display instead of the original. A photocopy, even one made on standard printing paper, will hold up better over time as it is exposed to the light and other elements.Then you can store the original newspaper in a storage box so that it will be preserved more safely.

Identify the audience.,
Clarify the purpose of the newsletter.,
Look at the layout of the newsletter.,
Read over the last two or three copies of the newsletter.,
Take a fresh look.",How to Make an Organizational Newsletter Professional and Interesting," Who currently reads the newsletter? Are there other people who should be reading it? A newsletter intended for all employees, but currently read only by management needs a new format and content. Newsletters already reaching their target audience may only need some minor adjustments.;
, Every newsletter has a purpose, although sometimes it's been forgotten over the years. Is the newsletter to share news of the organization's activities? Promote company morale and loyalty? Inspire volunteer activity? Solicit funds or donations?

, Does the current layout encourage recipients to read it? Are the font styles and sizes easy to read? Are the headings and illustrations attractive? If there is an index, is it easy to use? If there is no index, would it help to add one?

, Is this something you would choose to read? Is it informative? Inspiring? Are the contents newsworthy or are they reiterations of things everyone knows already? Even if you write the newsletter, try to take an objective look at the contents.

, Once you've identified the purpose, audience and possible weaknesses, think about how you can best correct the problems and convey the information you need to share. Consider the some changes, including:


Fresh voices Get more members of the organization involved in writing elements of the newsletter. New writers bring a new style and outlook to what may have become a one or two person project, and can inject a fresh perspective to the issues presented.






First person accounts Whether it's the story of a family helped by the organization, or an employee's experience in the company, first person accounts break up the dry tone common to so many newsletters.






Stories from related or auxiliary organizations Many companies and non-profits work with partners in the community or in another location. Include information and stories about those organizations to place your company in a larger perspective, and let employees/members see where you fit within the industry.






Humorous stories When presented in good taste, humorous stories from within the company can make newsletters more enjoyable to read. Be sure to avoid sexual or ethnic stories, or anything that mocks a specific member or employee.






Improve visual appeal Make the newsletter attractive to look at at. Clear, readable, modern fonts, appropriate photos and illustrations, and an easy-to-follow layout all make newsletters more attractive to readers.






Include a calendar If your organizations has events on a variety of dates, include a calendar within the newsletter. It's often hard to keep track of up-coming events if readers have to find the stories in the newsletter. A calendar readers can post above a desk or on the fridge can keep people on track and events well attended.






Contests and challenges Including trivia challenges, photo contests or story requests in your newsletter gets readers actively involved in the newsletter. Whether you offer prizes, or simply print the winner's names or winning submissions, people will check back to see the results.






Consider an e-mail version Many people post their events to a Google or Yahoo calendar. An e-mail version of the newsletter allows them to add those dates and other information directly to their computer calendars.






Include related news articles If a current news story relates to your company or organization, share it with your readers. Be sure to include the proper credit for the source of the story.






Ask for reader input The people who read your newsletter are your best source for information about what they like and do not like. Ask them for suggestions and ideas. Find out what they find useful and what they find annoying.

Or a range of mountains, the Foggy Mountains. Words like ""gloom"" and ""foggy"" have been used and stretched over too many novels. Try something like ""The Impassable Mountains"". After you have created the geographical world, divide your world into the Governmental world, add kingdoms and countries, and create races to inhabit these.;
, Norse Sagas are wonderful resources for fantasy writing, even J. R. R. Tolkien used things from the Norse. Such as Mirkwood, was in the Volsung Saga, as ""Myrkwood"". Borrow from the ancients as much as you like, but DO NOT use other author's writings.

, Take notice of peoples habits in real life, such as chewing their fingernails, or biting one's lips. To make your characters seem real, you must create unique and original people. Taking note of people's talking habits are also great ways to define different characters.

, A good way to come up with a high quality plot is to use the same technique as in step two. Celtic Myths, Norse Sagas (especially the Poetic Eddas) are good writings to find ideas in.

, You may choose to type on a computer or write in an exercise book. Some authors prefer an exercise book as it is a more practical way to write, and the words might just flow through the pen, onto the paper.

As you walk around, keep a notebook with you and jot down short descriptions of scenery to describe your story's location. Later, you can combine them together when you begin to write.


Be creative when describing your story's setting. Fusing together different locations is no easy task, but your imagination can help bring your fictional world to life. Don't hesitate to add fictional places, even if the locations you visited don't contain them.;
, Ask them what they find romantic and horrifying, as well as their thoughts on a perfect date. Gather inspiration from their thoughts and memories to add ideas to your story. Record their answers in your notebook.

, Consider what you would want from a partner. Think about ideal personality traits, such as the willingness to be considerate or the ability to listen well. Since everyone has different preferences, you can use your own ideas and other people's thoughts to support your story.

, Include both good and bad books in your reading list, because you can learn what looks best and what doesn't. Draw inspiration from a variety of authors. Doing this will teach you to use both genres well while finding a way to stand out.


Cheap paperback romance stories have worth. They tell you what women want out of a romance. However, be careful when reading these, as some may glorify abusive relationships.
Read authors who give stylistic influence. If you like detailed description, read Steinbeck. O'Connor, Faulkner. Then, read Hemingway just for contrast. Find people who do it well, and learn from them.

, Create an outline of their appearances and personalities, as well as a history of their past and any major experiences that influence their present lives. In order to allow each one to stand out, give them different quirks and habits that obviously set them apart from one another. Be sure that each character contributes to the plot and relationship.


Give your characters unique names. While you should avoid overly strange or difficult ones, it's good to have names that stand out and capture your readers' attention. For example, a name like ""Kellen"" would stand out better than ""Mark.""
Set up goals for the characters. In order to show readers that they have a purpose in the story, give them an objective that they'll work to achieve throughout the entire book. For suspense, add a consequence of not meeting that goal.
As you figure out your story, your characters' personalities can be tailored to the needs of the plot.

, Love is driven by more than physical appeal—each character adds something important to the relationship. You can make your characters appealing by creating nuanced personalities. Plan out their strengths, vulnerabilities, and histories.

Take the time to understand your characters. When writing an outline and filling in their information, include small details that make them stand out. Although you might not include them in a story, being able to see them as unique people is important when writing as realistically as possible. If your enthusiasm and love for them bleeds into your story, readers will be able to feel the emotions and emphasize with them.
One good way to understand your characters better is to write down their backstories and motivations on a separate sheet of paper.
Skills should be balanced between characters. In order to have working relationship, their abilities must complement each other. Perhaps the man has the charisma and bravery while the woman has the brains to form strategies against the villain. By showing that they need each other, readers will be able to emphasize with them and enjoy their relationship.

, To add suspense to the story, create an opposing force that strives to prevent the characters from reaching their goals. Who or what is fighting these lovers, and why? What does the antagonist gain out of antagonizing your main characters? Consider introducing the horror aspect through the enemy, using their actions and plans to bring suspense into the novel. Several examples include:


The homophobic pastor is motivated by hatred of lesbians. He draws upon supernatural forces to fight the lovers, believing that they are God's angels. In reality, they are from Hell.
The heroine is a witch, and a pair of witch-hunters are after her. The hero wants to protect her.
After getting lost in the woods, two lovers are stalked by a frightening beast.

, Uncertainty is an important aspect of horror. Therefore, give your readers brief glimpses of the antagonist to cause suspense and mystery. At first, your main characters should have no idea what they're up against. As the story continues, drop hints and pieces of the puzzle. Leave the readers wondering what terrifying monster the couple is facing. Initial encounters could include:


Threatening messages scrawled on walls
Rocks thrown through the window with ominous notes attached
An attack from a huge creature at night
Strange letters and/or packages in the mail

, Most readers will immediately peg the mentally ill, disabled, religious minority, etc. character as the villain. With your suspense lost, the story will become dull since your readers have figured out the identity of your antagonist. It also hurts people who belong to those minority groups since it reinforces prejudices against them. It will alienate them as readers. Instead, try casting marginalized people as heroes or helpful minor characters. Examples are:


The hero is a handsome Latino man.
The mentally ill librarian seems withdrawn and reclusive when questioned. But via email, she shares crucial information about supernatural occurrences in the town.
The effeminate gay man leads them to a safe house and provides protection while they figure out what to do next.

, It is a literary device used to mislead readers, causing them to make the wrong assumptions while being distracted from the truth. In order to cause more mystery and build up to the climax of your story, set up obvious suspects so that readers accuse the wrong person of being the enemy. The real antagonist will be working behind the scenes against the main characters, ready to complete his or her goal.


For example, one of your characters could strongly voice his homophobic opinions, resulting in the readers believing that he is the threat. However, he could turn out to be a coward while the quiet pastor is the real enemy.

, By creating a stable structure that includes the main points, you will have a solid sense of where your plot is going as you write. Give yourself a general sense of the beginning, the rising action, the climax, and the resolution. Be sure that the suspense grows throughout the plot until it finally reaches the point where the plot twist occurs or all the mysteries are explained.


In order to drop appropriate hints, it is important to understand the enemy and their moves as their plan progresses.

, Often, the first opening paragraphs of stories include information about the setting, as well as the main characters. It establishes the fictional world and the people in it, forming images in readers' heads so they are drawn into the book. However, it is important that you write a hook that grabs attention. Without a compelling opening line, readers will not have the patience to read through pages of information. In order to ensure that they continue reading, be sure that you capture their focus by including a unique, out-of-the-ordinary line.


Understand that the beginning is one of the hardest parts to write. You may have to create a sloppy one before later fixing it up. Realize that you do not necessarily have to write the story's events in order. If you feel inspired to write one that occurs in the middle, do so before you lose your ideas. Don't hesitate to skip around if it works best for you.
Your first sentence is your hook. Brainstorm some different attention-grabbing first sentences, and keep them in your notebook.

, Once you have grabbed their attention with your opening line, it is your job to ensure that they keep reading. Introduce interesting scenes into the story, as well as some action to keep them on the edge of their seats. Not all readers will have the patience to wait until the plot becomes captivating. Therefore, it is best to continue providing them with interesting dialogue, unique descriptions, and compelling events., One of the biggest turnoffs in a story is paragraphs of words. Not every reader will have the patience to sort through giant chunks of information. Breaking them up with dialogue is a good move, as you can take the opportunity to also introduce your characters' personalities. For example, a confident character might be more talkative or blunt while a quieter one might say less and seem more hesitant. As you write, ensure that your dialogue is realistic and of an appropriate length., In order to give readers an idea of what book they're picking up, you should suggest both horror and love in the title. For the horror aspect, consider the scary motifs in your story, as well as the type of hints you drop. It can take a while to pick a title, so you can devote a notebook page to random ideas.


Combine elements of warmth and fear. A Little Love Story doesn't sound like horror while The Destroyer doesn't suggest love. Nightmare at Rose Lane is an example that uses both.
Realize that the book jacket will be there to help do the work. The title can be a strong hook, which will lead readers to look at the back cover for the summary.
Many writers use working titles until they think of a good one. You can save your document as ""Romance Persecution Story"" or ""Love Horror Story.docx.""

, An alpha reader is a trusted person who readers each chapter as you finish it. They can provide suggestions to improve your story, as well as encourage you to keep writing. Their job is to mainly provide support and give you motivation to write when you're slacking off. It is best to choose a trusted family member or a friend to be your alpha reader.

, Find a patient family member or friend who will tear your piece apart and help you strengthen it. They can find your plot holes, point out grammatical errors or typos, and give you tips on fixing dilemmas. Accept their criticism, and understand that—no matter how harsh it may seem—it will help improve your story in the long run. Although you may not want to change parts of your writing, it is necessary to be flexible in order to ensure that readers will enjoy your work.


Be prepared to handle criticism. A good critic will not only find grammatical errors but also point out major plot holes and problems. Be sure that you can listen to critiques without taking it personally.
Expect to rewrite your story once or twice. Understand that your hard work will eventually build up to a great reward. Even professional authors must do this a few times before they finally get it right.

, Understand that writing a story takes time, and the first few drafts may not also be the best. Sometimes, you may face writer's block or lose the motivation to write. You might not always love your story, and you may sometimes consider giving up. However, the harder you work at your writing, the better you will become. Realize that the greatest rewards are often the hardest to achieve.

Give yourself breaks. If you find that you have a hard time writing, you may need to take some time off. It is best to come back with a clear mind and fresh perspective.

, Go to the internet or your local library to look for similar books. If your idea is fairly original and you didn't find anything too similar, you may begin writing.

Keep shooting.",How to Sell Photos to Magazines," You likely already love some magazines. Use that to your advantage, and find out to submit to them. The more you know about the magazine, the more likely you'll find one of your photos that will be the perfect fit.;
, If you are looking for a particular subject, try picking up magazines at a local store. You can find ones focused on particular topics, plus you can see what kinds of photos different magazines accept without spending large amounts of money to subscribe to all of them.

, Every magazine has a different style, and you need to pick one that fits your photos. For instance, if you take dark, grainy pictures, you may not want to submit to a nature magazine that mostly publishes sun-filled, sharp landscapes., Pick magazines that align with what you like to photograph. You can branch out, but don't try magazines that are beyond your current capacity.


Remember, you may not have the perfect image for the magazine at the time, but you still want to be in their general subject area. You don't want to send a picture of schoolkids to a culinary magazine or a picture of a city skyline to a nature magazine. You want to show them that you can give them what they want in the future, even if you don't already have the perfect image.

, If you're a beginner, you may not make it into big national magazines right away. However, you can start out trying for smaller magazines. For instance, maybe your local nature conservatory puts out a monthly magazine, and that may be a great place for you to begin.

, Most magazines will post guidelines for what they want from photographers on their website or somewhere in the magazine. For instance, they may want a particular file size or format, or they may want you to style them in a particular way. It will also tell you how they prefer for you to submit and how much they pay.


If you can't find submission guidelines, you can still submit to the magazine by finding an email or physical address. Generally, you can find this information on their website. When looking through staff members' emails, look for the photo editor or art director, and direct your query to that person, if the magazine is big enough to have such a person., Get an idea of what kind of photos they want, so you know what to submit.

, Make sure they are good quality and fit the style and subject matter of the magazine.If you don't have any that fit their style, choose another magazine, or try a photo shoot to capture what they want.

, The letter should explain who you are and what you want (to have your photos printed or to receive future assignments or both).You can do so in print or online but follow any guidelines the magazine offers. If you submit in print, be sure to include both printed images and a CD with high-resolution images, so they are ready to go if the magazine wants them.You should also include a thumbnail page, a caption sheet, and a picture of yourself.You can also send a sample of your work so you are placed on their mailing list. You show a collection of your photos, and they may contact you when they have assignments.Keep your letter professional and to the point. For instance, you could write something like: ""Dear Ms. (name), My name is Jo Jones, and I am a freelance photographer. I have been a fan of your magazine for over 10 years. I love the work you do, which is why I am submitting a portfolio of photographs to be considered for publication in your magazine. I feel like my style is in line with your current aesthetics. I hope that one of these photos fits your current needs, but if you don't find one to your liking, please keep me in mind for future projects. Regards, Jo Jones""

, Once you've sent an initial query letter, contact the magazine again within a month to make sure your name pops up when assignments come up.


You want to keep up with the magazine, but don't bombard them. If you send them a new set of photos everyday, they may get annoyed and reject your work.

, If they make an offer, review the details and accept or reject the offer. If you're new to the scene, remember the offer could be fairly low for someone first starting out.

, If a magazine rejects you, don't send an angry reply. Thank them for their time. You may have better work in the future that they do like, and you want them to be receptive to it.

, Your camera's manual will assist you in moving beyond the auto settings, and as you learn more about photography, you'll need to know where things are., As you learn, don't be afraid to play around with the settings. All it will cost you is time, and it will teach you what each setting does.

, Exposure affects how light or dark your picture is, and it is dependent on aperture, ISO speed, and shutter speed. Aperture is how much light your camera lets in, while shutter speed is how long the shutter is open, exposing light to your photograph.


To blur the background in photography, use a low f-stop for your aperture, while a high f-stop creates a crisp photo.Use a short shutter speed to capture an image quickly, creating a sharp, still photo even when your subject's moving. However, if you want to show how your subject is moving, use a slower shutter speed. In the first situation, the shutter will open and shut quickly, while in the second, the shutter will open and close more slowly. With a long shutter speed, you must keep the camera as still as possible.ISO speed tells your camera how much light to use for a photo. A lower ISO speed tells it to not detect as much light. Use a low speed when it's bright out so you don't overexpose the picture, and do the opposite when it's dark. However, too high an ISO speed will make your photo grainy, not sharp, so set it at the lowest setting for the light.

, Composition is how you arrange a picture and where you take the shot. Do you zoom in on someone's eyes, or pan out to the whole woods with the person small in the corner? It depends on what you're trying to do with the photo. Taking a picture of eyes creates intimacy, while a small person in a large, empty space can create a lonely, surreal feel.


One important rule of composition is the rule of thirds, where you mentally divide the image into thirds both horizontally and vertically. The best place to situate your subject is where the lines creating these divisions intersect. Essentially, you want the subject to be off center, both horizontally and vertically, because it creates a more interesting photograph.Pay attention to visual lines, as it can pull the viewer in to different parts of the photograph. You don't want to pull a viewer away from the focus., You can find fairly cheap classes at your local art museum or community college. In a class, you'll receive feedback on your photograph and learn new skills.

, You'll learn skills from other photographers, and you can post your photographs for review.

, For instance, in San Antonio, Texas, you might photograph the River Walk, the Alamo, and Texas Hill Country landscapes, because those are pictures that magazines might look for to fill up pages., Every piece of the photo is part of what you're trying to convey, so make sure each part says what you want it to say. For instance, if you're trying to show beauty in the midst of drudgery, a flower in a dirty old tire works well. However, if you're trying to catch a pristine photo of your nephew, you might want the dirty tire out of the frame., Taking photographs from interesting angles and distances can change how the viewer sees the subject. For instance, if you take an aerial shot of your yard from your roof, you might see patterns you didn't know were there.Always be safe when taking photographs. Call in extra help if you are climbing ladders.
Alternatively, try taking a shot of something by getting up close and personal. Having the subject take up the whole frame can make the shot more interesting., That is, be on the same level as your subject. If you're photographing a child or a pet, get on your knees to get the best shot., Just like setting is a part of a story, light is an important aspect of any photo. Natural lighting can illuminate photos with a glow that surrounds subjects. However, even if you're in dark conditions, try using lamps and other light sources to create interesting shadows with your subject, such as lighting the subject from the side., If you're taking photos of people, making them laugh will create joyous expressions., When processing your photos, experiment with different filters to make the photo more interesting. However, always be sure to save a copy of the original, so that you can go back to it if you want, especially if a magazine is more interested in a plainer style., Take a little time everyday to go shoot. Walk around your neighborhood, go to the park, or visit a local bar. Always be on the lookout for interesting shots.Remember to ask permission before taking shots in businesses or of people you don't know., That is, don't stop to fiddle with your camera or to look at every shot. Just keep taking photos from different angles so you stay in the moment."

, You will refer back to this page very often. Include very detailed descriptions and anything that inspired you.

, This will help you determine the genre of your story. Don't feel like you must be restricted to one genre. If you have an idea for a Sci-fi story with Fantasy elements, by all means DO IT!

, The purpose of pre-writing is to organize all your ideas BEFORE you write.

, Theme is almost like a moral to your story. It's the message you want to convey to your reader.

, This is especially useful if your characters will be traveling. If the story takes place in the real-world, use a map of the area when writing your story. If the land is made-up, create your own map of the area. It does not need to be very detailed, but it must include information you will need for the story.

, Some people argue that setting is the least important part of a story, but the truth is, setting MAKES your story. For example, take this scenario: A teenage girl embarks on a quest to search for her parents, who mysteriously vanished several years earlier. Now imagine this story taking place in Medieval times. How would that story differ from a story taking place 1,000 years from now? See my point? Research the culture, customs, geography, EVERYTHING about where and when your story takes place. If you are creating the setting, pay special attention to these things. How will they affect the characters? How will they affect the plot?

, Create a page about each one so that you can refer to it later on. Include information such as their name, physical appearance, favorites, motivations, fears, goals, and a short bio about them. If you can, include a picture of them. You can draw a picture, clip one from a magazine, or make one of your lame friends dress up as your character.

, Write all the events you have thought of so far in order.

, Conflict creates plot. Remember not all conflicts are between characters. Conflict can be character vs. environment, character vs. society, or even character vs. self. Knowing your character's motivations and goals can help you figure out what kind of conflicts will arise during your story.

,, Now is time to Brainstorm!!! This is the fun (and challenging) part!!!

, Think about people you know. Would your boss make the perfect antagonist? Write down all the traits of theirs. Some might include being shy, controlling, moody, whatever! Now repeat this with other people you know. You should end up with a long list. Mix and Match these traits, and you should come up with some good ideas for characters. One important note: STAY AWAY FROM STEREOTYPES!!! Everyone has heard of the nosy next door neighbor, the boss whose only goal in life is to make your life pure misery. If your character shows any signs of being a stereotype, add some traits that make them unique, and make sure your readers are aware of these traits.

, This should give you ideas regarding conflict and plot.

, You should now begin to see your story unfold.

, Do you need to create another antagonist? Does your plot need work? Should you research your setting? Write a To-Do list for your story, and try to accomplish at least one thing a day, depending on how large the task is.

, How can you show that theme throughout your story? DO NOT COPY OTHER STORIES. It is fine to have the same theme, but do not use the same scene or plot to prove it. Not only is this annoying for readers, it is ILLEGAL. Make sure your story is not a reincarnation of another story.

, Are you happy with the result so far? If you read your story back then, would you have enjoyed it? What would you have changed? Now is your chance to edit your story.

, Use your timeline as a guide. By now you should be able to play your story in your head like it was a movie.

, You can finally write your story! I recommend writing it on a computer just because it is so much easier to correct mistakes. However, when you write your rough draft, turn off the spelling and grammar check. These will probably distract you from writing your thoughts down. When you finish your rough draft, let it sit for several days before you begin editing. Give a copy to someone good at editing, but also make sure they won't want to steal your story. Be sure to get their opinion and accept feedback. Not all of it will be positive, which is why it helps to have several critique your work, that way you can hear several opinions about your novel.

, Now I use the term ""final"" very loosely, because chances are, you will write hundreds of drafts before you come up with one you like. Remember, always do your best when writing a story. Write like nobody is reading!!! (Okay, even I admit that phrase is rather lame)

, When writing about a specific subject or genre, it's important that you thoroughly research to find reliable sources and facts. Failure to do this could even lead to you unknowingly duplicating a plot and could lead to copyright business.

, Tell close friends or family the general idea in your head before you pen it, that way you can gain structured criticism too improve and chip your work to a fine art.

, Always think after writing something, 'Is there another way I could write this?'. For example, instead of, 'He thought about it' you could restructure it to write a more effective sentence like, 'He pondered about it in agonizing silence'.

, Every writer struggles from, what is known in the creative literary world, as 'Writers Block'. Allow yourself breaks and make sure you give up sometime just to think about ideas instead of instantly writing them, who knows, you might end up with a better idea all together.

, Always plan out your story to successfully link subjects or points, otherwise you may end up with a very confusing and unappealing story-line.

, Read over every paragraph. Make sure everything you write is to the best of your ability.

, If it's a journal or diary from a person's point of view, don't let your writing turn into a recurring cycle.

, The best writers always have a fresh and clear mind to successfully express what they envision. If you cannot express this, then seek help from a friend.

Allow the ideas to percolate in your mind for a few days afterward.,
Repeat as often as needed.

",How to Plan out a Novel," This can be done either on your computer or in physical file folders. Choose whichever one you want, or you could even use both, so you have a back-up. Make and label one file folder for each of the following categories:


Goals/Deadlines: Even if you don't have a publisher or editor breathing down your neck, it's a good idea to create personal goals and deadlines for completion. Create a master list for your folder and update both calendars if anything changes. For example, if you have an interview with a veterinarian, place that on the calendars and review your master list as to how that alters your goals.
Characters: One for each major, secondary, and recurring minor characters as well as another for a ""master character list."" If your story is one that has character ""types"" (such as aliens or monsters) make a folder for those as well.
Maps/Settings: Not just for large scale settings (such as a ""story world"" map so you can differentiate between galaxy sectors in a sci-fi tale or which neighbor lives next door to the other one) but for each major household so you don't have your main character with the master bedroom on the first floor in one chapter, and then five chapters later it's on the second or third floor.
Scenes: One for your ""Master Scene List"" (see tips) for a quick overview and one for each scene in your novel. You may eventually wish to combine scenes into chapter sections, but until you're sure exactly what form your novel is going to take this technique makes it easier to mix and match until the novel is solid.
Research: Start with a list of questions on areas in your novel that you are unsure about and use secondary (encyclopedia etc.) as well as primary resources that you can frequently acquire through a few phone calls whether by using the phone book or by contacts you know from work or your personal life.

, File major categories (character, etc) alphabetically and then by sub-categories (specific characters). If you're doing this on your computer, do the same thing - make one large folder with your novel title, and then inside of that, make many smaller folders.

, Have dictionaries, thesauruses, books, etc. on hand so that you don't spend an hour looking for them should you need them while writing your book.

, To get an idea of whether or not your novel has the ""right stuff"" start with a rough outline or ""Master Scene List"". To do this, write the numbers 1-30, list style (skipping a line for each number) on a piece of paper. By number 1, write a sentence or two about your opening scene. By number 30, write a sentence or two about your closing scene. Now that you know how your novel starts and the general direction you're headed in, write a sentence or two for the remaining numbers.

, The point of this kit is so you can grab needed supplies whenever you leave the house. You never know when you'll run across a reference source, be inspired, or, more importantly, be able to grab a few extra moments to work on a bit of your novel. For your ""On the Go"" Kit, you'll need to place the following inside of a tote bag or briefcase:


Paperback dictionary
Spiral notebooks
Tape recorder and peripherals
Various office supplies (pens, pencils, erasers, etc.)
Small calendar

, Brainstorming can allow for the introduction of new ideas that weren't an original part of your plan. They can also help you get over writer's block at any stage of the writing process.

, Go somewhere you enjoy being, such as a local coffee house with a great vibe, the beach, the woods, your favorite reading corner. It's important to feel comfortable and at peace. If you're working with a friend or group of friends, find a place where you all feel comfortable and can speak freely without feeling self-conscious.


Even when resting you can brainstorm. Lie down when you're tired and think about your novel and let the ideas run freely.

, Let the ideas flow freely, and don't stifle any of them. You never know which newly surfaced idea might develop further. Record all of the ideas as best you can (writing, recording on a device, filming, etc.).

, Which ideas have traction? Allow these ones to flourish and turn into real elements within your novel.

, ""Stolen"" as in someone already beat you to your writing idea. If needed, go back to step one. If not, then your idea is original. If your idea is not original, it is possible to add an original ""spin"" to it (for example, change it from the way it is usually done), but the key is that this will not be exactly the same as the idea has always been.

, Is there going to be a series? What time era is it? Magic? Fiction or non-fiction? You've got this far! Don't stop now!

, Of course, don't think you are just going to type it once and be done with it! It's far more complicated than that. But now you need to find a computer to type on. You can write it instead of typing, but it's not as quick, though some people prefer it for practical (can write anywhere if one has no laptop) as well as personal (""flows"" better) reasons.

, Start typing things like how the character started out. Once you do that, try to type the little summary that's on the back of the book. It will be edited later, but it helps you to think and get rid of those pesky writers blocks!

, Made a mistake? Don't worry; you will have to type it all over again and edit it later anyway. Separate your story into chapters. A chapter consists of a specific event in the reading. Make sure it does!

, If not, that's okay! Everyone writes differently. Once you've finished typing, well, now it's time to edit. Make sure your grammar and meanings are correct. Re-write the ENTIRE book, make everything better. Yes, there are parts that you are not going to edit but you will be editing a lot!

, You will need to find a publisher to find out if your book is going to be put on the bookshelves of a bookstore. He or she will probably read the whole book, and if you did well on it, he'll buy it and put on the market.

, Congratulations! You did it! Everyone will be happy for you and you will live life knowing you wrote a book!

Determine the opening scene.,
Come up with an inciting incident.,
Identify the main conflict.,
Determine the rising action.,
Identify the climax.,
Finish with a resolution.",How to Outline a Novel1," A narrative outline can help you break down the plot of your novel and make it easier for you to keep track of each element of the plot. Start by determining your novel’s opening scene. This scene should establish character, setting, and a conflict or problem that is plaguing your main character. The opening scene will be the start of your first act and help to immerse your reader in your story.For example, you may start with a scene that introduces the reader to your main character and the setting of the novel, such as “Susan Miro who lives in seclusion in the jungle.” You may then note a problem or conflict facing your main character, such as “Susan is struggling to survive in the jungle alone with very few supplies.”;
, The inciting incident is the problem or conflict that sets your main character on a specific path. This incident will then tie into the main conflict, allowing your reader to feel more tension as the story goes on.The inciting incident in your story may be the arrival of a new character that throws your main character off balance or a sudden change in the main character’s surroundings that leads to a conflict.
For example, you may have an inciting incident in your story when Susan gets an unexpected visit from the daughter she never knew. This could then lead into the main conflict of your novel.

, The main conflict should be intense for the main character and create a big issue that the character has to address or deal with in some way. Some writers call the main conflict the point of no return for the character, where they must take action and make a decision.For example, you may have a main conflict in your story where Susan has to decide to leave the jungle and live with her daughter in the city. This could create feelings of confusion, anxiety, and tension for both characters.

, The rising action in your outline should look at how the character acts after they have been confronted with the main conflict. There should be obstacles or challenges for the character during the rising action that make it difficult for them to achieve a goal or stick to their decision. Having rising action will help to up the stakes of the story and encourage the reader to keep reading.For example, you may have rising action where Susan fails to get a job in the city and does not seem able to bond with her daughter or her daughter’s lifestyle. There may be a series of small incidents in the rising action that make Susan feel upset, anxious, or confused about her situation.

, The climax of the story is perhaps the most crucial element of the plot. It should be the most intense and important moment for your characters, where everything in the story comes to a head. The climax may be dramatic and intense or it may be more subtle. Either way, it should be the moment where the character is feeling the most emotion and the stakes are the highest for the story.For example, you may have a climax where Susan gets lost in the city and almost gets mugged. She may then have an emotional breakdown and tell her daughter she needs to return to the jungle.

, The final element in your narrative plot outline is the resolution. You may have falling action after the climax that then leads into a resolution of the conflict for the characters. The falling action may include the results of the climax. The resolution will tell your reader how each character ends up dealing with the climax of the story.For example, you may have falling action where Susan goes back to the jungle and tries to go back to her old way of life, away from her daughter. The resolution of the story may then be the daughter’s decision to live with Susan in the jungle and adopt a more traditional lifestyle with Susan.

Consider writing an outline for each individual chapter.",How to Organize a Mystery Novel," Murders are the most common, but what type of murder? You can read crime blogs or the local newspaper to get ideas—life is often stranger than fiction. You could also write about political intrigue or spy fiction.


For this article, the example will focus on a murder mystery novel.;
, Details are extremely important in mysteries. Where did it happen? What was the weapon? What was the time frame? What kind of evidence got left behind? Create a list of what happened, but also draw things out if you need to. How is the scene laid out?


Draw a map of the room or space.
Draw a diagram of the weapon if it helps. Add colors.

, Give the person a name. Put that name at the top of a sheet of paper. Begin to fill in details for the character.


Start with physical characteristics and basic facts. How tall is this person? What’s her height? What type of hair does he have? Where was she born? Are his parents still alive? Does she have any siblings?
Next, go for personality traits. Who is this person? What are her favorite past times? What does he eat for breakfast? What kind of pet does she have? What’s his favorite color? What are her personality quirks? What makes him afraid in the middle of the night? What drives her to do what she does? Is the crime an accident or intentional?
Even though this person is a murderer, you don’t want him or her to be one-dimensional. He or she still needs to be a fully developed character, and it’s the little things that make a person seem real.

, Once you've created the murderer’s character, create a sheet with the protagonist’s (or hero’s) name on top of it. Ask yourself the same questions that you did when creating the murderer’s character.


Decide what makes him or her tick. Why does she want to catch the murderer? Is it personal or just another day on the job?

, Don’t forget to include other characters who could potentially be the murderer. That’s part of the suspense of the story—nobody is sure exactly who committed the crime (except for you). So you will need equally as compelling characters who didn’t commit the murder but who plausibly could have.


Don’t forget to include diversity in your characters. Real life is diverse, and your characters should be, too.

, Basically, the arc is his or her personal story throughout the novel. How is she or he going to change in the novel? How is he or she going to change other people? What is going to happen to him or her?


Decide what perspective you will use. Are you going to tell it from the protagonist’s perspective or the villain? Are you going to mix the two? Will you use an omnipresent third voice?

, Think about the setting, as well.


What leads into the crime?
What makes the murder personal to the protagonist?
Will the story follow both the protagonist and the villain or just one or the other?
Where will it all take place?
How does that affect the crime?
Why did you choose that setting in particular?

, How does the protagonist get involved? Is she a cop, or does she become involved in some other way? What pieces of evidence does the protagonist find at the scene? What is she able to put together at this point?


Your protagonist doesn't have to be right about what she “knows”; that could easily change throughout the storyline.

, What are the major events in the middle? Maybe the protagonist follows up on a lead only to find it was a dead end. Maybe he has things going on in his personal life that dive bomb into the crime story, such as his family is threatened or he finds out his child is somehow involved in the story.


Decide what the antagonist is doing throughout the middle. Is she running? Hiding out? Trying to find details to prove her innocence? Does he narrowly escape being caught? Is she taunting the protagonist by sending tantalizing clues or notes or by making phone calls?

, However, make sure not to make it too obvious. The reader should have pieces of evidence just like the protagonist.

, Throughout the story, you are building up suspense. The suspense resolves in a climax, or the high point of the story. In the case of mystery, the climax is usually the villain getting caught. However, how that happens is up to you.


Usually during the climax there is some doubt as to whether the protagonist will succeed, which creates suspense.

, What happens to each of the characters at the end? Though you don’t have to tie it up with a nice bow, your readers will want to know at least a little bit about what happens to each character.

, As you write, your story is going to change. You’re going to come up with new ideas and details. As you go along, take notes on what you change.


If you decide on something about a character, add it to his or her character page(s).
If you change something in the plot, make a note of it, and change any subsequent storylines to reflect it.

, If things get complicated, create charts of how things are related. For instance, you can create family trees for characters to show how they are related, both by family ties and by events in the book.


You can also create charts for things like pieces of evidence to show what they are and how they relate to the rest of the book.

, An effective way to organize a novel is to begin with an outline, both of your characters and the plot. If it helps, you can go chapter by chapter creating an outline of what happens in each one. Some writers find that helpful, while others find that just creating a general outline is fine. Do what works best for you, and continue to keep track of details as you write.

Create a one sentence summary of the novel.,
Expand the summary into a detailed paragraph.,
Write profiles for each main character.,
Make a spreadsheet of scenes.",How to Outline a Novel2," Start by trying to distill down your novel idea into one sentence. You may need several minutes to one hour to create a one sentence summary. Aim for 15 words or fewer and avoid any character names in the summary. The summary should include the central conflict or issue at the heart of the novel.For example, you may write “A woman living in seclusion in the jungle gets a visit from the daughter she never knew she had.”

, Once you have the one sentence summary, you should try to expand it into a paragraph that is detailed and specific. Use the summary as a guide to write about the major conflicts or issues in the novel as well as the ending of the novel. Aim for five sentences total, one sentence that discusses the story set up, three sentences on the major conflicts or issues, and one sentence on the ending of the novel.For example, you may write “A woman, Susan, lives in seclusion in the jungle where she tries to live off the land. She gets an unexpected visit from a daughter she never knew she had and they develop the beginnings of a relationship. She makes the decision to move with her daughter to the city, but realizes she does not fit into her daughter’s lifestyle. She struggles to connect to others and adopt a modern way of life. In the end, Susan leaves the city and her daughter behind and returns to the jungle.”

, Now that you have a one paragraph summary of the novel, you can start to dig into the details of your characters. Create profiles for each main character, including details about the characters like their age, their physical appearance, their way of speaking, and their general disposition.For example, you may have a character profile that reads, “Susan, 37, dark hair, Latin features, dresses plainly in practical clothing, speaks Spanish and English, keeps to herself and tends to be solitary in nature.”
You may also include storylines for each character and note how they intersect with one another. For example, you may write, “Susan was planning to live in the jungle forever, away from people. But the arrival of her daughter shifts her plans for the future and she is put in a position where she has to decide to be with her daughter in the city or remain alone in the jungle.”

, Use a computer program to create a spreadsheet where you can write down each scene in the novel. You may start with the crucial scenes and then fill in the more minor scenes later. Try to include specific details for each scene so you can use the spreadsheet as a guide once you start writing the novel.For example, you may write, “Scene 1: Susan walking through the jungle hunting a small animal, her dinner for the night. She uses primitive tools to shoot the animal, gut it, and prepare it for dinner. She moves around her one room home with ease and with a sense of solitude.”

Determine if you are using chapters, sections, or both.,
Create a table with chapter headings.,
Fill in the basic details for each chapter or section.",How to Outline a Novel3," Chapter outlining, also called flashlight outlining, is useful if you have a sense of how you are going to break up your novel. You may decide to use chapters to break up the content in your novel. Or you may use sections, such as Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3. Using chapters or sections can be a good way to make the content more reader friendly and allow you to structure your novel in a clear way.You may decide to use chapters if you are using different character voices in your novel, for example, and each chapter will be use a different character voice.
You may decide to use sections or parts to break up the novel if, for example, there are different time periods in your story or if there are different periods of a your main character's life you are exploring.

, Sit down and create a table with one column for chapter or section headings. You can also write each chapter heading or section heading on index cards or sheets of paper.You may title the chapters using ""Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3..."" etc. Or you may use specific titles for each chapter, such as the name of each character voice that is narrating the chapter, such as ""Chapter 1: Susanne, Chapter 2: Susanne's daughter, Chapter 3: Susanne..."".
If you are using sections for the novel, you may put headings for each section in the table in one column. For example, you may have the ""Part 1, Part 2, Part 3..."" or you may use specific titles for each part, such as ""Part 1: Birth, Part 2: Life, Part 3: Death..."".

, Once you have created the table with the chapter or section headings, fill in basic details on the events that occur in the chapter or section. Use character names and describe the basic action in each chapter. You may also note the purpose of each character or section with the larger novel.For example, you may write:

""Chapter 1: Susanne tells us about her life in the jungle. She mentions her lost daughter and her isolation as well as her lack of supplies for survival.""
""Chapter 2: Susanne's daughter, Maia, tells us about her life in the city. She discusses her mother briefly with her boyfriend, Tom, and goes to her job at a factory on the outskirts of the city.""


If you are using sections, you may write:

""Part 1: An exploration of the life of a woman, Susanne, who lives in the jungle. She faces challenges like hunger, isolation, and the threat of wild animals.""
""Part 2: An exploration of the life of Susanne's daughter, Maia, who lives in the city. She faces challenges like poor pay, long hours at her factory job, and a longing for the mother she never knew.""

Use your novel idea to create a prompt.,
Write using the prompt.,
Analyze the freewrite.,
Expand the ideas in the freewrite in your outline.",How to Outline a Novel4," If you enjoy having more freedom during the outlining stages for your novel, you can use freewriting to generate ideas and details for your novel. A freewrite is also a good way to get plot ideas that you can then integrate into an outline. Use an idea you have for the novel to create a freewriting prompt that you can write about to get started.You can use a simple prompt, such as “I want to write a novel about…” or “My novel will be structured based on…”. Or you can use a prompt that is more specific to your novel idea.
For example, you may have the prompt, “Susan lives in the jungle and is visited by her long lost daughter. Then…”.

, You may use a timer to set aside a certain amount of time to write on the prompt. Writing on the prompt for 15 minutes can help you focus and let your ideas flow on the page. Try not to re-read what you have written during the freewrite or correct your writing. You want to have a sense of freedom and exploration during the freewrite.


You may try writing on the prompt in a quiet, private spot in your home or at work. Minimize any distractions around you and stay focused on the prompt so you can get the most out of the freewrite.

, Once you have completed the freewrite, read it over and analyze the content. Look for any details that seem interesting or engaging to you. Note any details that surprise you or help open up the structure of the novel. Ask yourself, “What does the freewrite tell me about the structure of my novel?” “How does the freewrite explore plot, character, and setting?”You may make notes on the freewrite about plot and structure or highlight lines that seem to explore these elements. You can also underline or note any details that focus on character and setting, as you can then integrate this information in your outline.

, After you have analyzed your freewrite, you should expand on any ideas that you found interesting to create a loose outline. The outline may be based on the narrative structure or the snowflake method. Or you may create a loose outline that reads like a sketch or a summary of the main events in the novel.Another option is to create more freewriting prompts from lines you liked in the text and doing freewrites on these prompts. Doing more freewriting using your own texts can help you explore and expand your ideas for the novel.

",How to Write an Autobiography for School Without Feeling Conceited," We'll worry about writing and the introduction later on. Try to think of things that helped shape your view of the world and affected who you are as a person. Sort your list chronologically.;
, For each event that you wrote down, write about it as if you are writing only about that topic.

, After you have completed step 2 for every event, begin to tie the events together, explaining how they relate to one another and how they have influenced your life.

, After you have written the body of the work, go about writing the introduction. It is suggested that one takes a humble, yet not self defeating stance. Explain why your autobiography is of importance to the reader. Pull them in to the work.

, After writing your introduction and body, reread the work and sum everything up in the conclusion. Explain how this has brought you to where you are today, how these events have truly affected your present way of life for better and for worse.

, Go through your paper now and eliminate and redundancies, errors, and items that are not accurate. Check for spelling, grammar, and style errors as well.

, Remember to add important details, like who was there with you during an important event, but don't add in things that won't affect the story, like the color of the shirt you wore that day.

, Ask this of people who have known you for a while as well as newer acquaintances. This way you get an objective standpoint.

Just introduce yourself.,
Start with a short list of your talents and interests, If you're not sure what to choose to start, or if you're only allowed to pick one thing for the assignment, try listing out as many as possible and brainstorming good details that will help you decide.,
Narrow your topic.,
Use a few good details.,
Be humble.",How to Write About Yourself2," Writing about yourself can be tough, because you've got a lot to say. Your whole lifetime of experiences, talents, and skills in a paragraph, or a couple of paragraphs? Whatever kind of writing you're planning on doing, whatever your purpose, just think about it like you're introducing yourself to a stranger. What do they need to know? Answer questions like:


Who are you?
What is your background?
What are your interests?
What are your talents?
What are your achievements?
What challenges have you faced?

, Answer the questions in the previous step, then sketch out as many different answers as possible.

, Pick one specific topic, describe it in detail, and use that to introduce yourself. It's better to pick one thing and use it to describe yourself in lots of detail, than to give someone a big long list of general topics.


What seems the most interesting or unique? What describes you the best? Pick that topic.

, When you've got a specific topic to narrow in on, describe it specifically, giving us something unique to hold onto. Remember, you're telling us about you. The more details, the better:


Bad: I like sports.
Ok: I'm a fan of basketball, football, tennis, and soccer.
Good: My favorite sport is football, both to watch and to play.
Better: When I was growing up, I would watch Big Ten football with my dad and brothers every Saturday, before we'd go outside and toss the football around. I've loved it ever since.

, Even if you're very accomplished, talented, or cool, you want to come across like a down-to-earth person. Don't write about yourself to brag. List your accomplishments and your successes, but temper them with some more humble language:


Braggy: I'm the best and most dynamic worker at my company right now, so you should want to hire me for my talents.
Humble: I was lucky enough to be awarded three employee of the month awards at my current job, more than any other employee.

Come up with an excellent story to tell.,
Stay focused on a single theme or purpose.,
Write about complex topics, not cliches.,
Limit the timeline as much as possible.,
Use vivid details.,
Start in the middle of the story.,
Connect the details to the big theme.",How to Write About Yourself3," Personal essays are commonly used for college applications and school assignments. It's dissimilar from a cover letter in that the purpose of a cover letter is to introduce a candidate for employment or admission, while a non-fiction essay is for exploring a theme. Basically, this type of assignment requires that you tell a story about yourself, using specific, real-life details that highlight a particular theme or idea throughout the essay.


Common themes or prompts for autobiographical essays include overcoming obstacles, great successes or spectacular failures, and times you learned something about yourself.

, Unlike a cover letter, an autobiographical essay shouldn't jump around quickly between different themes or events that you'd like to highlight to make yourself look good, but stay focused on a single event or theme that makes some greater point.


Depending on the assignment, you may need to connect a personal anecdote to a reading or an idea from class. Start brainstorming topics that are connected to that idea to give yourself a variety of options to choose from.

, An essay doesn't need to make you look good at all. When you're thinking of topics to write about, think about your triumphs and successes, but also give some thought to parts of your life that could use improvement. The time you forgot to pick up your sister from practice while you were partying with friends, or the time you skipped class and got caught might make for great essays too.


Common autobiographical essay cliches include sports stories, mission trips, and dead grandmothers. While these can all make for excellent essays if done well, it's difficult to stand out telling the story of the time your lacrosse team lost a big game, then practiced hard, then won. We've read that before.

, It's almost impossible to write a good five page essay about your entire life up to your 14th birthday. Even a topic like ""my senior year"" is much too complex to actually pull off in a good essay. Pick an event that spanned no more than a day, or a few days at most.


If you want to tell the story of your nasty break-up, start with the break-up, don't start with the star-crossed way you met. You've got to get immediately to the tension in the story.

, These types of essays are better the less you include. If you want to write a good non-fictional essay, it needs to be chock-full of vivid details and specific images and senses.


When you have some idea of your topic, start writing a ""memory list"" of specific things that you remember about the event. What was the weather like? What did it smell like? What did your mother say to you?
Your opening paragraph will set the tone for the rest of the essay. Rather than telling the dull biographical details (your name, your place of birth, your favorite food), find a way to express the essence of the story you're going to tell and the themes you're going to explore in your essay.

, Don't worry about ""building suspense"" in an autobiographical essay. If you want to tell the story about the time you accidentally ruined Thanksgiving dinner, then recover? How did people react? How did you move on? That's the essay.

, If you're writing an essay about a disaster at Thanksgiving some time ago, don't forget that you're writing about more than a burnt turkey. What's the point of the story? What are we supposed to be getting out of this story that you're telling us? At least once every page, you need to have some thread that ties us back to the main theme or focus of the essay you're writing.

Find the prompt.,
Match the style to the purpose.,
Describe why you're writing in the first paragraph.,
Structure the cover letter as a cause and effect.,
Detail your talents and skills specifically.,
Describe your goals and ambitions.,
Explain how both parties will benefit from your selection.,
Don't mistake the cover letter for the resume.,
Keep it brief.,
Format the letter.",How to Write About Yourself4," If you need a cover letter for a job or internship, for college, or for some other application opportunity, there will sometimes be a description or prompt of what's expected in the letter. Depending on the nature of the application, you may need to describe your readiness to complete the job, your qualifications, or other specific criteria. Possible prompts may include:


Outline your qualifications and highlight your talents in a cover letter.
Tell us about yourself.
In a cover letter, describe how your education and experience qualifies you for this position.
Explain how this opportunity will benefit your career goals.

, Different employers and situations will call for different styles and tones in a cover letter. If you're applying to a university, it's always best to use a professional and academic tone throughout the letter. When you're applying to blog for a tech start-up that tells you to ""Explain three things you rock at!"" it's probably better to use a looser and more informal style of writing.When in doubt, keep it brief and keep it serious. If you're unsure whether or not telling an amusing anecdote about your friend's bachelor party would go over well in a cover letter, it's probably best to leave it out.

, The first two sentences should explain the purpose of your cover letter and your application clearly. If someone reading your cover letter is unclear about what it is you want, your application will quickly get chucked in the trash.


""I'm writing to apply for the entry-level position with Company Inc. advertised on your website. I think my experience and training makes me an ideal candidate for this position.""
Contrary to popular belief, it's not necessary to include your name in the body of the letter: ""My name is John Smith and I'm applying...."" Your name will be included in the signature, as well as the header of a cover letter, so there's no need to put it in the text itself.

, A cover letter should explain to the potential employer or admissions board why you are the best candidate for the position, or why you should be admitted to the university or program to which you're applying. To do this, you need to make sure every cover letter describes what you bring to the table and how that will help satisfy the ambitions of both parties. Make sure all cover letters describe the following details clearly:


Who you are and where you come from.
Where you want to go.
How this opportunity would potentially help you get there.

, What makes you the ideal type of candidate for the job or position you're applying for? What experiences, skills, training, and talent do you bring to the table?


Be as specific as possible. It's ok to write that you're ""A passionate leader in all walks of life"" but it would be much better to write about an example of a time you lead in a surprising way.
Stay focused on skills and talents that connect specifically to the thing you're applying for. Extracurricular involvement, leadership roles, and other types of outstanding achievement may be important to you personally and may tell the readers about you, or it may be totally extraneous. If you include something, make sure you connect it specifically to the goal of the cover letter.

, Where do you want to go from here? Both admission boards and employers are more interested in people with ambitions for themselves, self-starters who will be motivated to achieve at a high level. Describe what you want and how this position will help you achieve that goal.


Be as specific as possible. If you're writing a university cover letter, it's obvious that you have to have a degree to get a job as a doctor. But why this degree? Why this school? What, specifically, do you need to learn?

, What do you bring to the table that other candidates don't? How would the university benefit from having you as a member of the student body? How would you benefit from getting that new job? Your readers will be interested in knowing what's at stake for both.


Be careful about using a cover letter to critique a business. It's not the time to describe the suffering of a particular brand over the previous fiscal quarter, then promising that you'll be able to turn it around with your ideas. That might not go over well at the office, and you might not be able to, if you do get the job.

, While it's important to list your best skills, as they apply to the job you are interested in, a cover letter isn't a good place to list the minute details of your education, or other information that belongs on the resume. Since most places will ask for both, make sure the resume and the cover letter contain different information.


Even if it's impressive, a high GPA or class ranking doesn't belong in a cover letter. Highlight it on your resume, but don't include it in two different places on the application.

, Ideal cover letters should be no more than one or two pages, single-spaced, or somewhere between 300-500 words. Certain places may call for longer letters, in the neighborhood of 700-1000 words, but it's rare that cover letters should ever be longer than that.

, Cover letters are usually single-spaced and word-processed in a normal, legible font like Times or Garamond. Generally, cover letters should include a salutation addressed to the admission board or a specific contact listed on the application, a closing with your signature, and the following contact information included in the header of the document:


Your name
Mailing address
E-mail
Telephone and/or fax number

Meet with the attorney.,
Consider audience.,
Plan a theme.,
Provide concrete information.,
Write in a personable tone.,
Make it concise.,
Include an attorney photo.,
Close with a call to action.,
Proof the bio.,
Upload the bio.,
Share the bio widely.,
Replace old bios.,
Update the bio frequently.,
Rethink the bio every six months.",How to Write an Attorney Bio," Although many attorneys will write their own bios, you may be hired to do it for them. It is important to have a thorough understanding of their practice before beginning the bio.


Before meeting with the attorney, do preparatory research, such as looking at the attorney’s website, as well as performing web searches. Busy lawyers sometimes will forget past accomplishments or cases they have handled. With research, you can help draw this to their attention.;
, Some attorneys market toward the general public. Others focus on selling their services to other attorneys or to corporations. Understanding the target audience will help drive what information to include.


For example, attorneys who market to other attorneys may want to include a long list of publications to establish their expertise. The general public may find this information boring or unhelpful.
Be mindful that some of your pro bono work may alienate some potential clients. Corporations may not appreciate it if your pro bono work shows that your personal commitments run counter to their interests.
Attorneys who market to the general public can include information about what community organizations they belong to.

, An attorney bio should be part of a coherent advertising strategy and not a boring summary of someone’s life. Themes tend to focus on the attorney’s area of specialization: what the attorney can do for the client. Incorporate themes across the website. For example, a bankruptcy attorney may wish to give the firm a nickname, like “Debt Destroyers.” The attorney can then buy the URL for “debtdestroyer.com,” which will take visitors to the attorney’s website.
Newer attorneys may not have chosen a specialty yet. Nevertheless, you can find commonalities across the cases the attorney has completed. A young attorney who has argued pretrial motions in a variety of cases can highlight her experience drafting legal documents and arguing in court.

, An effective bio does more than use general language like, “I will fight for you” and “Your welfare is our business.” Instead, it includes specific information about the attorney’s practice. Concrete information answers the client’s question, “Can this attorney provide effective representation on my case?”


Mention cases the attorney has worked on. Include a brief summary of what the matter entailed, e.g., “Won jury verdict in slip-and-fall case.” Clients want to see that you have successfully resolved matters like their own. Highlight honors and recognition. These will increase confidence in the attorney’s skills. Prioritize honors gained as a practicing lawyer over those earned in law school. If the honor is mentioned in a newspaper article or on another website, link to it.
Consider acquiring certification for any specialties and including those in your bio. Certifications typically require several years of expertise, professional recommendations from judges or fellow attorneys, and completion of additional education or tests. Certifications are valuable additions to your bio, however, because they demonstrate expertise in your chosen specialty.
Include client testimonials. Websites such as Avvo now allow clients to post comments about their experience. A positive testimonial is the best referral an attorney can have.

, Many people are intimidated by attorneys. Proper tone can convey that the attorney is approachable and easy to work with.


Use of technical jargon may impress fellow attorneys, but it can alienate the general public. Instead of using legal terms like ""secured additur at trial,"" consider saying, ""won increase in total compensation for client.""

, An attorney bio is not a memoir. A reader should be able to scan it without being overwhelmed by information. A good length is under six paragraphs. Extensive bios can be broken up using hyperlinks. For example, the main page may highlight a few client testimonials and representative matters. Links can direct the visitor to a more comprehensive list of cases or testimonials.

, A picture helps humanize the attorney. Make sure that it is a recent photograph.


Choose a photo depending on your audience. The general public will be drawn to casual photos, often showing you smiling. Many attorneys will also show themselves in casual clothing.
Corporate counsel and other lawyers, however, may want a more formal portrait. Consider using a studio photograph in which you wear a business suit.

, At the end of the bio, remind readers that the attorney is here for them. End with a statement like the following: “If you’ve been in an accident on the job, you may be entitled to compensation. Call the Law Offices of Attorney John J. Smith today for a free consultation.”

, Do a final check for grammatical and spelling errors. Nothing can undermine your professionalism like a typo!

, After the bio is online, do a quick scan to see how it fits on the page. Anything too blocky or visually unwieldy should be broken up so that the eye can move smoothly down the page.

, Once you have published the bio on your webpage, don't just leave it there. Upload it to social media sites, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google+. The more people who see it the better!

, Many attorneys have old bios on printed materials, such as brochures or flyers. Be sure to update this material with your new bio, including a recent photo.

, As you handle new cases or receive new accolades, include them in your bio. Clients want to see that their attorney is active in the profession.

, If your practice is changing, your bio should also. An attorney who has transitioned her practice from litigation to estate administration should have a bio that reflects her new specialty. Schedule some time every six months to consider whether the bio accurately reflects your current practice.

Write about yourself in the third person.,
Explain your position or title.,
Briefly list your responsibilities or accomplishments.,
Include a bit of your personal life.,
Keep it brief.",How to Write About Yourself5," Short blurb-style bio notes are common in work directories, pamphlets, and other materials. You may be asked to provide one for any number of reasons. They're usually short, and can be somewhat awkward to write.


Pretend you're writing about someone else. Write your name and start describing that person like a character or a friend: ""John Smith is the Executive Vice President of Company Inc...""

, Be sure to clarify your specific role and specialty, taking into consideration the purpose of the bio note. Describe what it is you do and what it is that people know you for.


If you're a jack of all trades, say so. Don't be afraid to list ""actor, musician, mother, motivational speaker, and professional rock climber"" if they all apply equally.

, If you're a frequent winner of awards and distinctions, a bio note is a good time to list them and toot your own horn. Try to keep bio notes focused on recent history.


It's common to list degrees that you've received as well, paying special attention to anything that ties into the work you are writing about. If you have special training, include it here.

, Bio notes don't need to be cold. It's common to end on a small personal detail that will spice up bio notes a bit. Consider including your cat's name, or a quirky detail about a hobby:


""John Smith is the Executive Vice President of Company Inc., in charge of marketing and overseas acquisitions. He received an MBA with distinction from Harvard and lives in Montauk with his cat Cheeto.""
Don't overshare. It can seem funny to immediately start with ""John Smith loves rafting and hates eating Cheetos. He's a total boss"" and such bio notes can be appropriate for some venues, but be careful to avoid awkward oversharing. Telling everyone about your killer hangover might be best left for after work talk.

, Generally, these types of bio notes are no more than a few sentences. They'll usually be included on a contributor page or a list of other employees all together, and you don't want yours to stand out as the person who droned on for half a page, when everyone else used a few sentences.


Stephen King, one of the most successful and popular authors in recent history, has a bio note that just lists the name of his family members, his hometown, and his pets. Consider leaving out the self-congratulation entirely.

Write in the third person.,
Keep it short.,
Employ professional language.,
Edit your bio.,
Consult the theatre company you’re writing the bio for.,
Introduce yourself and your credits.,
List some things you do outside of theatre.,
List previously played characters by name.,
Mention important events and experiences in your life.,
Incorporate interesting personal facts.,
Use caution when expressing gratitude.",How to Write a Theatre Biography," Theatrical biographies are always written in the third person, even though you are usually the one writing it. Introduce yourself using your full name, then utilize pronouns when referring to yourself throughout.


For instance, instead of writing, “I am a student at Brighton College,” write, “Jane is a student at Brighton College.” Use “he” or “she” in following sentences.The following example marks third person language with an underline, ""John Smith is a graduate student in playwriting at XYZ University. He has acted in..."";
, Theatre biographies are always brief. If you see opportunities to reduce excess information or simplify language, do so. Being too long-winded is common and usually requires you to edit down your bio. Get it right the first time by keeping everything concise and to the point.If you’re in a lead role or expected to produce a longer bio, keep your paragraphs roughly three sentences long.Use active voice to keep content clear. For example, ""She was encouraged by her family to pursue acting"" would be stronger as ""Her family encouraged her to pursue acting."", Avoid informal prose, inside jokes, and snark. For instance, do not write, “Wow, this is gonna be a great show, LOL!!!” Instead, use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation.It is acceptable to throw a joke into your bio, but keep it brief and avoid inside jokes. You don’t want to come across as unprofessional to readers or audience members.
Some members of the audience may be connected to the theatrical community. A professionally written bio will give these people a favorable impression of you.

, Once you’ve written your bio, turn it over to a trusted friend or colleague with a sharp eye for grammar, punctuation, and spelling. Double check the names of plays, theatres, organizations, and roles you’ve referenced in your bio.If this is your first time writing a bio, ask the director, producer, stage manager, or a more experienced actor to look over yours. These people will be more knowledgeable about theatrical bio writing.

, All theatre companies set a word limit for bio length. To ensure you’re keeping your bio within the accepted limit, consult your director, producer, or an authoritative member of the crew before penning your bio.In addition to a word limit, some theatre companies provide templates for your bio, limiting you to discussing only certain things.
Some theatre companies have rules regarding what information you can and cannot include in your bio.

, If you’ve never been in a production before, lead with this information. Say something like, “This is Jane’s theatrical debut.”Otherwise, simply write your name and involvement with the production. After that, write out your credits, which are your most acclaimed roles.


Avoid listing every production you’ve ever been in.Instead, focus only on your proudest or most impressive work.
Write a list of your most popular or critically acclaimed roles. Use this list to help you decide which roles to cite.
Refer to your resume if you have trouble recalling roles or remembering which were strongest., Depending on your level as an actor, you may need or want to fill your bio with some extracurricular activities. Include anything from volunteer experiences to sporting leagues you participate in.


If you’re writing a bio for an amateur theatre production, you’ll probably also include information about your vocation.If you’re a student, mention this by saying, “She is a student at the Acme University.” This is especially appropriate if you’re studying theatre or drama with the aim of becoming a professional actor.

, Do this only when you played a lead role. If you were a chorus member or an unnamed character in a production, you can still refer to this experience in your bio, but do not name the character. Lead roles should be listed along with the production.


An example of listed minor roles might look like, ""John has been involved in The Miracle Worker, Jesus, Son of Man, and Showdown at the Sugar Cane Saloon.""
A mix of minor and lead roles could be written, ""Jane has appeared in My Fair Lady, Fiddler on the Roof, and as Fantine in Les Misérables."", This will vary from person to person. For instance, you might write a sentence about where you were born or that you’re the father of two children. Reflect upon your own life experience to determine what special details you'll add.Significant life changes, like graduating with a degree in engineering before pursuing acting, can help you connect with the audience better through your bio.Specialized training you received, like a workshop class in physical theatre by famed mime Marcel Marceau, can illustrate your accomplishments and the range of your skill.
Your involvement with theatre related activities, like a youth theatre outreach, can show readers the kind of person you are without being heavy handed., You might be a chess master or a collector of rare comics, but the audience will never know if you don't tell them in your bio. Perhaps you want to include a tidbit about recently returning from living abroad. Whatever personal facts you choose, try to limit these to a single sentence for simple bios.Longer bios, like those for leading parts of major productions, may require a few paragraphs of information. In this case, you might use a few sentences of personal facts.Highlight facts that give readers a deeper idea of you as a person. For example, you might write, ""John is an avid gardener and hiker,"" which conveys a natural, rugged sense to readers.

, Some theatre companies have explicit rules forbidding expressions of gratitude in the biographies. If you do choose to include an expression of gratitude, keep it brief and limit it to your family, your cast and crew, or both.In some situations, it may be suitable to thank a mentor or teacher in your bio, especially if that person is respected theatrically.
Thanking your family in your bio can sometimes give the impression that you're inexperienced. Serious actors may want to avoid doing this."

Set goals before beginning to write.,
Select a target audience.,
Plan your story in a notebook or in a graphic organizer.,
Write your exposition.,
Write your rising action.,
Write the climax.,
Transition to your falling action.,
Write the resolution.,
Go back and read your story.,
Type the story in book manuscript format.,
Print the story out and send it to a publisher who publishes children's novels in the genre you wrote it in.",How to Make a Children's Novel in a Month," Your main goal, of course, is to write a children's novel in a month. But you should also set minor goals to help you reach your deadline. Promise yourself to sit down and write at least 1 or 2 scenes each day. Stick to this goal throughout the month.;
, Most children's novels are for 8 to 11 year-olds. Stories for children this age should not be too complicated, yet not too simple.

, Establish a basic plot for your story, as well as characters. Be sure to include what genre the story is. Decide which force will eventually triumph: good or evil.


Create a conflict that your character will have to solve or an obstacle that they'll have to overcome.
The setting of the story should go along with the conflict and the plot. Otherwise, the story will go nowhere.

, The exposition of the story is the very beginning, where the setting, characters, and basic conflict are stated (probably the most classic start of an exposition is ""Once upon a time...""). The initiating event is at the end of the exposition. It is an event that sets the plot into motion.

, The rising action of the story leads to the climax: the tipping point of the novel. (In an adventure story, it would be the journey to the faraway land.) Make sure you don't let your story drag on. Add little conflicts and obstacles the character must pass to reach their final destination.

, This should be the most exciting part of the story. Keep it short and sweet; you should need no more than 2 short chapters, or about 10 pages, to start and to finish the climax. (In an adventure story, this would be the epic good against evil battle.)

, This is part of the story should be shorter as well; at this point, you should be about three-quarters of the way through your novel, a minimum of 150 pages in.

, This part of your novel should include how the story ends. If your story has a moral, state it here. The resolution should wrap your story up.

, Make any edits or revisions needed.

,


Pages must have one inch margins on both sides, and the text must be double-spaced and in the Times New Roman font, which is a fixed-space font. Paragraphs must be indented 5 spaces, or a half inch from the left and are left justified.

, On the front cover of the manuscript (before you send it), write the title and your name in the top left corner, as well as your address, email address, and the approximate number of words in the story.

Look up information about your family in the public records.,
Let your family know you are writing about them.,
Create character profiles based on your family members.,
Identify a conflict in your family history.,
Compile the family history.,
Revise the draft.",How to Write About Your Family1," Start by gathering concrete information about your family straight from the source. Ask your family members if you can talk to them about their childhood, their upbringing, and their relationship to others in the family. You may take notes when you interview your family members or record them using a tape recorder or a video camera.Make a point of talking to the older generation in your family, such as grandparents, great aunts, or old family friends. Often, the older generation will have more information on your family history.
You may need to ask your family members for interviews several times, as they may not appear all that interested in the topic. It can be hard for your family to see the value in telling you about the past. Be patient and remind them that you are writing about the family out of interest and a desire to get the history down on paper.;
, Another way you can collect important information about your family is to create a family tree. A family tree can help you organize your family lineage, going as far back as you can. You may need to do research on your own or with help from your family members. Draw out the family tree on a large piece of posterboard and hang it on your wall. You could then use it as inspiration for stories about your family.


There are also several online tools you can use to build a family tree. You may then print out the family tree and use it as a guide when writing about your family., You should also use resources like public records online or in print to gather more information about your family. If your family has lived in the same place for several generations, you may look up the public records on your family’s last name to gather more information. You may also search for your family in the records at your local library or online in newspaper archives.If you are not sure how to search for your family in the public records, you may ask a reference librarian at your local library for guidance. You may also be able to speak to a representative at the city records office for advice on how to search for information.

, As you start your writing project on your family, you should consider letting your family know you are writing about them. Being upfront and telling your family may make it easier for you to dive right into the writing. You may sit your family down and let them know why you are drawn to writing about your family and why it is important to you. Having the conversation with them upfront can allow them to express any concerns they may have and allow you to talk about your project together.For example, you may say to your family, “I want to write about our family because I think we have a valuable story to share with others, a story about perseverance, sacrifice, and joy. I feel like a story like ours is not represented properly right now and I want to try to do it justice.”

, To get writing on your family, start by creating characters based on your family members. Try to use as many biographical facts and details about your family as possible when creating these characters. You may create character profiles for each member of your family, including detailed backstories.For example, you may write a character profile for your father by writing, “60 year old Chinese-American man who came to America in the 1920’s with his mother. Has a fascination with Chinese culture. Tends to speak up only when spoken to.”
Keep in mind that you can share your impressions of your family members when you write about them. Make sure you clarify that you are writing from your perspective and try not to embellish any aspects of your family. You are writing non fiction, after all, not fiction.

, Having a central conflict or question in your family story can help you stay focused when you are writing. You can also use the conflict to keep the stakes of story up and to build tension in your story. There may be several conflicts that you want to focus on or one central conflict.For example, you may realize that you have always wondered why your father is so estranged from his family and why your grandmother left China in the first place to come to America. You may then use this conflict to structure and organize your story. You may also research your family with this question in mind.

, Once you have done your research and spoken to your family about your intent to write the family history, you should put together your family’s story. You may create a plot outline for the family history. Another option is to organize the story chronologically, beginning with your family’s origins and ending with their lives now.You may also have several major conflicts throughout the story, such as the time your grandmother ran off to marry your grandfather, or the moment your great grandmother stepped on the boat to America. Use these conflicts to propel the story forward and make the story engaging.

, Once you are finished with a draft of the story, share it with others and get feedback. You may share it with your family members to get their opinion on it. You may also share it with colleagues or friends who have experience in writing to get feedback. Be open to constructive criticism and revise the draft until it is at its best.


Keep in mind your family members may have more edits or opinions on the draft than others. Try to accommodate their feedback, as you are writing their family history too. But you should also be willing to argue against their feedback if you think it will be detrimental to the overall story or not in keeping with the facts of the family history.

Focus on an issue you feel is important in your family.,
Make a plot outline.,
Write about a family memory or experience from your perspective.,
Revise your first draft.,
Get feedback on the draft from family and colleagues.",How to Write About Your Family2," Writing a personal memoir can be a fun and challenging way to write about your family. You may write a memoir as part of an assignment for a class or as a personal project. To write the memoir, you will first need to do research on your family history. This may mean interviewing your family members, searching through public records for information on your family, and creating a family tree.


As you do your research, you should talk to your family about your plans to write a memoir. Let them know that you are researching your family for a book. Discussing the book with them will make the memoir more compelling and give you more information to work with.
Keep in mind your family may not all be thrilled at the idea of the memoir at first, especially if they are nervous or worried about certain family details coming to light. Be tactful and patient with your family. Explain to them that you are writing a memoir from your perspective and that there is never one side to any story. Assure them that you will let them read the final draft once it is done.

, To get a better idea of how to approach your family’s story, you may read examples of non fiction work about family. You may focus on a writer that has a particular style or voice that you love. Or, if you are focusing on a specific family dynamic, such as an immigrant family story, you may read works that relate to that dynamic. For example, you may read:



Angela’s Ashes by Frank McCourt

The Woman Warrior by Maxine Hong Kingston

Notes of a Native Son by James Baldwin

Running in the Family by Michael Ondaatje

The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls

, You may realize there is a specific issue or theme that keeps coming up when you talk to your family members and do research on your family. You may use this issue or theme to structure your story. You could also include your own reflections on the theme or issue in your piece about your family.For example, perhaps you notice the theme of assimilation keeps coming up in your research of your family. Or maybe there is the common issue of the women in your family overcoming obstacles to raise their children in America.

, Creating a plot outline for your family’s story will help you stay focused and organized. You may make a loose plot outline that is broken into chapters or sections. Or you may go for a more traditional plot outline that is based on a plot diagram. Whichever approach you choose, having a plot outline can make diving into the writing of the story much easier.


A plot diagram contains five parts: the exposition, the inciting incident, the rising action, the climax, the falling action, and the resolution.
You can also try using the snowflake method, where you write a one sentence summary of the story, followed by a one paragraph summary, character synopses, and a spreadsheet of scenes.

, In personal memoir, you are exploring your family relationships from your perspective. You should look at your family memories and your experiences with your family. Perhaps you realize there is a central conflict in your memories and experiences that you would like to explore further. Or maybe there is a particular memory you have from childhood that had a big impact on your family and the rest of your childhood.


If you are writing about a memory or experience that is difficult to confront, such as a memory of abuse or neglect from a family member, you may need to write several drafts of the memory. Take your time and try to focus on sensory details in the memory. Be honest about how you feel about the memory on the page and don't be afraid to dig deep.

, Once you have completed a draft of your story about your family, you should spend time polishing it until it is at its best. Read the draft aloud to yourself. Listen to how each section flows into one another. Pay attention to how you characterize each member of your family. Notice if there are any sections that feel flat or not as full of tension and conflict as they could be.You should ask yourself several questions as you revise, including: Do the characters in the story feel like fair representations of my real family? Is the conflict in the story and is it meaningful? Do I need to include more reflections on my family from my perspective?

, You should consider showing the draft of your story to your family members, especially if you are planning to try to get the story published. Get feedback from your family members. Ask them if they feel the story is accurate of the family’s history. Be willing to listen to what they have to say and integrate their feedback into your next draft.Depending on what you write, some of your family members may be upset or unsettled by your story. This may occur if you are writing about a family secret or a difficult period in your family’s history. You should be prepare to defend or explain the choices you made in your story to your family members.
You may also get feedback on the draft from close family friends or colleagues that you are close to. If you are looking for professional guidance on your draft, you may enroll in a writing workshop that focuses on non fiction and memoir writing. You may then get valuable feedback on your draft from other writers who are also exploring their family history.
You may be able to find non fiction writing groups online or at your local college or university. If you have friends or colleagues who have experience writing memoir, you may approach them and ask if they’d be willing to start a writing group.

Use a writing prompt.,
Create a first draft.,
Show the draft to others and revise it.",How to Write About Your Family3," If you are writing about your family as a way to practice and improve your English, you should use a prompt to get you started. You can create your own prompt or find a prompt online. You may challenge yourself to write a certain number of words about your family, such as 250 words. Or you may challenge yourself to write a certain number of sentences about your family, such as 10 sentences.For example, you may use a prompt like: “Write about your family members” or “My family members are…”
As part of the prompt, you could pretend you are talking to someone you just met who asked you to tell them about your family.

, When you write about your family, use the present tense and write in short, clear sentences. Identify all of your family members by name and discuss where your family members live. Use “brother, sister, mother, father, uncle, aunt, cousin, etc” to identify your family members.For example, you may write: “Let me tell you about my family. I have a mother, a father, two brothers, and one sister. We also have a dog named Pepper. We all live together in a house in Reno, Nevada. We have lived in the house since I was born. After they were married, my mother and my father moved to the house to start a family.”

, Once you have completed the draft about your family, you should show it to others to get feedback. Show the draft to your teacher, your instructor, or to a native English speaker. Get feedback from them on your sentence structure, your word choice, and your spelling or grammar. Then, apply the feedback to the draft.


You may end up adding in more details into the draft based on your teacher’s feedback. By the end of the revision process, you should have a strong, completed draft that showcases your English skills.

Nonfiction writers can focus on topics like biography, business, cooking, health and fitness, pets, crafts, home decorating, travel, religions, art, history, etc. The list of possible subjects for nonfiction writing could be anything and everything.Unlike fiction, which is literature created from imagination, nonfiction is structured around real events, moments, practices, and approaches to a subject.
Memoir is a type of nonfiction that acts as a record of events based on intimate knowledge and personal observation.So if you are writing memoir, you will likely need to do some research around your memories of a particular event or moment. But most memoirists do less research than other nonfiction writers, as the basis for their story is personal memory.;
, Many well written and engaging non-fiction books end up on Best of the Year lists and the best seller’s list. Several topics, such as the war in the Middle East, the scientific developments of the 21st century, and institutional racism in the American justice system have all been popular non-fiction topics. Of course, food writing, home décor, and travel writing are topics of interest too. Take a look at nonfiction books such as:The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History by Elizabeth Kolbert. Kolbert, who writes about science for other well respected publications, looks at the history of life on earth and concludes we’re experiencing the sixth mass die-off, thanks to the changes imposed on the planet by humans. A gripping non-fiction look at the influence of humanity on nature and science.Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption by Bryan Stevenson. Stevenson’s book focuses on the trial of a black man convicted of murdering a white woman in Monroeville, Alabama. With an informative but unsentimental tone, Stevenson presents a new way of thinking about the death penalty and examines the prejudices of capital punishment in America.Sous-Chef: 24 Hours on the Line by Gibney. The restaurant kitchen has been the setting of many popular nonfiction writing. Gibney’s book looks at the egotistical, empowered head chefs and the young wild ones who serve under them, the sous-chefs. Gibney uses sharp prose and solid technical detail to give the reader the sights, smells, tastes, and clashes of a shift in the kitchen.Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Coast Trail by Cheryl Strayed. Strayed’s nonfiction tale about her journey through heartbreak, addiction, and loneliness on the Pacific Coast Trail is a great example of combining a personal story or memoir style writing with factual detail and scenes.DIY Ideas: Projects and Tips for Every Room by Kathy Barnes. This nonfiction book on home décor from Better Homes and Gardens focuses on “Do It Yourself” projects. It contains over 200+ fun, approachable home improvement projects with clear directions and beautiful photographs., Once you’ve read several nonfiction books, think about how the writer uses factual evidence in the book and approaches the topic in an interesting way. Ask questions such as:


What makes the writer’s approach to their topic unique or engaging?
How does the writer use factual information in their narrative?
How does the writer organize the information in the book? Do they use section breaks? Parts? A table of contents?
How does the writer cite their sources in the narrative?
As a reader, what was the most affecting scene in the book? What scene was the least effective for you?

, Maybe you already have a topic in mind, or maybe you aren’t sure how to narrow down your broad range of interests. But it’s important to home in on your topic and the angle you are going to take on the topic. Ask yourself these questions:


What am I passionate about or interested in? Writing a book about a subject you are interested in will make your research more vigorous and your dedication to telling the story much stronger.What is a story only I can tell? Or what makes my view on a subject unique? For example, you may have an interest in pastry making or same-sex marriages. But you need to determine what your unique take will be on these topics. Perhaps for pastry making, you’ll focus on the development of a particular technique or a particular pastry, like the croissant. Or for a current topic like same-sex marriages, maybe you will focus on a particular section of America, like the Bible belt, to see how this subject is affecting these communities.
Who would read this book? It’s important to identify the audience for your book and the market for your book. You want to have a large enough audience for the book to justify writing the book. For example, a nonfiction book about the evolution of the croissant might be of interest to other pastry makers, food critics, and readers with an interest in baking. It may also appeal to historical buffs who enjoy looking at the history of food from a unique angle.

, Take some time to get your creative juices flowing. Take out a blank sheet of paper and a pen, or open a new document on your computer.There are many ways you can brainstorm, such as a mind map, with boxes around the main idea and then lines out to other words or phrases that relate to the main idea.
You can also create a list of possible unique angles on the main idea. For example, a food history of the croissant? the political implications of the croissant? the different types of croissants in Europe?

, One of the easiest ways to organize your thoughts is to create a content outline or a table of contents for your book. A more detailed outline will also help you focus your research on certain aspects of your topic or subject.Make a bulleted list, with the main topic and then sub topics or headings underneath the main topic. For example, for a book about the croissant, the main topic might be The Croissant and the sub topics could be: Origin/History, Development, Establishment of the basic croissant, and Current variations of the croissant.
You can also make a chart with the topics and subtopics, and then add sub sub topic under the sub topics. Try to expand on the idea as much as possible and write down anything (even if it feels a little out in left field) that you feel may be a possible sub topic of the main topic.

, Good nonfiction is based on months, if not years, of research. Besides online research, you may need to use libraries, archives and record offices, newspapers, and even microfilm.You will also need to find experts on your subjects and “witnesses to events”. This means individuals who can share first person accounts of an event. You will then need to follow up on leads, interview people, transcribe interviews, and read a lot of material.For each topic and subtopic in your table of contents, brainstorm possible research you may need. For example, for the origin or history of the croissant, you may want to talk to historians who specialize in research on french food or french food culture.
Ask yourself: What do I not know about this topic? Who is the best person to talk to about this topic? What kind of documentation can I look up about this topic?

, Look over your content plan or detailed table of contents. Take all the research items you listed and put them on a numbered to-do list.Make a list of URLS, books, and articles you will need to look for and read.
Make a list of locations you may need to visit, like a French bakery.
Make a list of experts or witnesses you will need to interview.

, This is a good tactic if you’re working under a deadline and don’t have the luxury of years of research. Order your research to-do list from more important to nice to have.

, Do this first to give your interviewees time to respond to your request for an interview. Be responsive when setting up an interview and be specific about possible times for the interview.If you have difficulty getting possible interview subjects to get back to you about an interview time, don't be afraid to be persistent. You may need to contact them again with a reminder email, especially if they have busy schedules or get a lot of emails every day.
You may also think about talking to subjects that are easier to access, like a family friend who could give you an expert opinion or a person who works in a lower position who can still give you relevant information. Often, establishing a relationship with someone who works with someone you are trying to interview can also help you get in touch with the interview subject.

, Exercise good listening skills during the interview. You are doing the interview to learn more from the person or to get information from the person. So don’t interrupt the person speaking or try to show how much you know.Come prepared with a list of questions for the interviewee. However, don’t feel obligated to stick to your list of questions. The person may give you information you weren’t prepared for or looking for, so be open to moments when the interview goes in a different direction.
If you don’t understand a point made by the interviewee, ask for clarification. And if the person does start to go off on a tangent, carefully bring the focus back to the subject you are researching.
If you are interviewing someone in person, use a digital recorder with background noise cancellation. If you are going to be doing extensive interviews with a person, you may want to hire a transcription service to transcribe the interviews and save you some time.
If you are interviewing someone online via Skype, you can download recording apps that will record your Skype conversation for you. You can then re watch the video and transcribe it, or send it to a transcription service.

, Make the research librarian at your local library your new best friend. Before computers, librarians acted as walking databases and in many ways, they still are.Most librarians can point you to a specific shelf that applies to your topic or to a particular research book that may be useful. Ninety percent of research is done through libraries’ full-text databases, so take advantage of this free information source.

, Most universities have a large, central library and several special-collection libraries. Though you may need to pay a fee to access certain books or online databases, university libraries are a great resource for academic and scientific topics., Public government records and documents can be great research sources. Many of these documents are free to access and can provide key factual information for a particular subject., One of the best ways to conduct internet researchis to use search engines effectively.Type several keywords into search engines to find useful sources of information online. Search engines like Google and Yahoo are a good place to start. You can also try metasearch engines like Dogpile and MetaCrawler, which tend to search lesser known and specialized websites. Keep in mind the downsides of metasearch engines, as they usually only allow you to search keywords and can pull from paid for content, full of advertisements.
Try to look past the first page of your search. Some of the better sources may actually be on page 5 of your search.
You will then need to confirm the sources are reputable by looking at the “About Us” section of the website and checking that the URL of the website ends in “.edu” “.gov” or “.org”.

, Use an online folder on Google Drive to keep all your research documents in one, easy to find place. Or start a running Word file with your notes.You can also use post it notes on paper documents to notate important information. You should keep a physical folder or several folders to store other important documents, like photographs, newspaper clippings, and handwritten notes.

, Take some time to look through your notes, your interview transcripts, and any other documentation you have collected. Determine if your angle on your topic is supported by your research, or if your research sheds a different light on your original angle.


For example, you may have thought a book about the evolution of the croissant was a unique idea, but in the course of your research, you come across books on pastry making, including croissants. Think about how your book will differ from what is currently available. So, your book about the evolution of the croissant could be unique because it looks at how crescent shaped breads from the Middle Ages then developed into the French and Austrian croissant we enjoy today.

, This will help you determine how long it is going to take you to write a draft of the book. If you are working under a deadline, you may make your schedule more tight than if you have the luxury of more time to write.If you are writing a nonfiction book from a memoir perspective you will likely have less research to integrate into the book. Instead, you will spend a lot of time writing about a process you created, your own life story, or your area of expertise.
A research based nonfiction book will take longer to write, as you have to study, evaluate, and summarize your documentation. You also have to draw on information from interviews with experts and witnesses.
Try to organize your schedule around word count or page count. So, if you normally write about 750 words an hour, factor this in on your schedule. Or if you feel you may actually write two pages an hour, use this as an estimate in your schedule.
Determine how long it will take you on average to compose a set number of words, or number of pages, per a day. If you are working towards a final word count goal, like 50,000 words or 200 pages, focus on how many hours per week it will take you to reach this goal.Allow more hours than you think you may need for “unforeseen circumstances.” You may have slow days, or research you didn’t realize you needed to look closer at or an interviewee you need to follow up with on a certain detail.
Set weekly deadlines. It could be a word count, a page count, or a completion of a certain section. But set weekly deadlines and stick to them.

, Though you are writing non fiction, following the principles of plot development can help give your book form and shape. It can also make it easier for you to organize your research materials in a way that is engaging and interesting for your reader. A story’s plot is what happens in the story and the order it happens in. For there to be a story, something has to move or change. Something or someone goes from point A to point B due to a physical event, a decision, a change in a relationship, or a change in a character or person. Your plot outline should include:A story goal: The plot of any story is a sequence of events that revolve around an attempt to solve a problem or attain a goal. The story goal is what your protagonist (this could be you if you are writing memoir) wants to achieve or the problem she wants to resolve.
The consequence(s): Ask yourself, What disaster will happen if the goal is not achieved? What is my protagonist afraid will happen if she doesn’t achieve the goal or solve the problem? The consequence is the negative situation or event that will result if the goal is not achieved. The combination of goal and consequence creates the main dramatic tension in your plot. This is what makes the plot meaningful.
The requirements: These are what must be accomplished to achieve the goal. Think of it as a checklist of one or more events. As the requirements are met in the course of the novel, the reader will feel the characters (or if you writing a memoir, the first person narrator) are getting closer to attaining the goal. Requirements create a sense of anticipation in the reader’s mind, as he looks forward to the protagonist’s success.

, Armed with your research, your writing schedule and your plot outline, you can now start to write. Find a quiet, secluded spot in your home or in a studio. Limit your distractions by turning off your internet, putting your phone away, and telling everyone to leave you alone.Some writers avoid revising the manuscript as they write to prevent getting stuck on a certain section or part and deviating away from their writing schedule. However, every writer will have their own process of writing and re-writing.
If you do find yourself in a moment of writer’s block, look through your research. You can use this time not writing to follow up on a research idea or to look over a section of your research that may be useful later in your book., When you use the passive voice, your writing will end feeling long winded and dull. Look for signs of the passive voice by circling all the “is” “was” and other passive verbs like “begin” “have” “seems” and “appears” in the manuscript.


Use your grammar check (or an app like Hemingway app) to count the number of passive sentences in your manuscript. Aim for 2-4% maximum.

, Instead of “utilize” you can just put “use”. Focus on simple language, with one or two syllable words. The only time you should be using higher level language is if you are using scientific terms or describing a technical process. Even then, you should be writing for the average reader.


It may help to identify the reading level of the ideal reader of your book. You can determine the reading level based on the grade level of your ideal reader. If you account for ESL readers, you should aim for a grade 6 or 7 reading level. If you are writing for a higher education audience, you may write at a grade 8 or 9 level. You can use the Hemingway app to determine the reading level of your draft, or other online reading level tools., Unless you are writing memoir, your audience will respond more to the process, event, or topic you are trying to describe if it is in the third person. So try to remove as many “I” sentences as possible., Engage your reader by showing them a specific process or scene, rather than narrate directly to them. For example, a scene that shows the process of how to make a croissant, with details on how the baker prepares and rolls the dough on the table, will be more engaging than telling the reader: ""This is how you prepare the dough.""You should also steer clear of adverbs in your writing, as it usually weakens the sentence. For example, a sentence like: ""When the baker saw the dough was rising too fast, he yanked open the oven door"", shows the urgency of the scene without having to use adverbs like ""suddenly"" or ""quickly"".

, Find a few sympathetic ears (friends, colleagues, a writing group) and read sections of the manuscript out loud. Good writing should engage readers as listeners, with details and description that create visceral images and a strong narrative.Don't try to impress your listeners or put on a ""reading voice"". Just read a natural, slow way. Ask for a reaction from your listeners after you finish reading. Note if there were sections that felt confusing or unclear to your listeners.

, Before you send out your book to publishers, you need to edit the manuscript. You may want to hire a professional proof reader to give the book a good once over for common errors or mistakes.Don't be afraid to cut at least 20% of the material. You can likely get rid of certain sections that go on for a bit too long and cause the reader to tune out. Don't be shy about cutting chapter sections or pages that may be deadweight.
Note if each scene in your book uses the power of the senses. Are you engaging at least one of the reader's senses in each scene? The power of enhancement through the senses (taste, touch, smell, sight, and hearing) is a trick both nonfiction and fiction writers can use to keep the reader interested.
Check the timeline of the book. Do you explain the complete process or procedure of your topic? Do you explore your angle to the fullest extent? For example, a book about croissants should explain the process of making a croissant from beginning to end.
The sentence level. Check for the transitions between paragraphs, are they smooth or jumpy? Look for any overused adverbs or terms and replace them so the sentences don't start to feel redundant.

Read the prompt or job advertisement closely.,
Reflect on your professional experience.,
Write a list of personal attributes.,
Determine your reasons for applying.,
Consider whether photo and video content is a possibility.",How to Write a Personal Testimonial About Yourself2," Mark key words and phrases. Doing so will help you determine what to address in your personal testimony. For instance, if the job advertisement includes a requirement for managerial experience, organizational skills, and familiarity with particular software, you will want to be sure to address these topics in your writing.


If you are applying for more than one position, you may notice some overlap in the job requirements. At this point, it may be helpful to create a list that organizes the positions according to key words or phrases. In other words, make a list of positions categorized according to job requirements (e.g., managerial experience, organizational skills, and so forth). This list can serve as a guide later as you revise your personal testimony to fit each particular position.

, Start with the phrases you have highlighted and create a list of past work experiences that demonstrate your capability in these required areas.


If you have worked a lot during your university years or recent work experience, what have you learned (leadership or managerial skills, for example), and how has that work contributed to your growth? What are your career goals?
Make a list of the skills you possess (e.g. leadership, verbal communication, analytical) and think of an example for each of those skills. Alternately, identify one example that relates to all (or the majority) of the skills you listed.

, You can also create a list of your personal characteristics (e.g. integrity, compassion, persistence) that would relate to the positions for which you are applying, as well as challenges that you have overcome.


Be sure that you can clearly connect these personal attributes to a particular professional example. You’ll need to be able to demonstrate an instance when you were persistent or demonstrated compassion that connects to the job at hand.

, Itemizing your reasons for applying to a particular organization or company will help you identify how your skill sets, goals, and experience align with those of the organization or company to which you are applying.


Questions like these will get you started:

When did you become interested in this area and what has motivated your interest and reinforced your belief that you are suited to this field?
How have you learned about this field? Was it through courses, journals, seminars, work or other experiences, or conversations with other professionals?



, If the testimonial will be submitted online, you may be able to include unique content in your testimonial. If you're applying for a job in a creative field, finding a way to include photos and videos can benefit you. If you're applying for a job as a makeup artist, for example, a few photos of your past clients or a link to your website could help you stand out. If you're applying for a job in film, see if you can include a link to any videos you've produced online."

Answer the questions that are asked.,
Research a company's ethics and culture.,
Find the right approach for your experience.,
Be specific about your qualifications.,
Use evidence to show your talents.,
Overview any specific knowledge you have that would be useful to the organization.,
Include a story.",How to Write a Personal Testimonial About Yourself3," If you are writing to several organizations, you may find questions in each application that are similar. However, craft a personal testimony for each application. You want to make sure you address any specific questions about your qualifications.


If slightly different answers are needed, be sure to create different statements for each application, and make sure your answer fits the question being asked.
You may not need to rewrite your entire statement for each organization or position, however. Start with small changes, such as changing your wording to echo the job advertisement.
You may find that there are overlaps between the questions you need to answer for each statement. In this case, you can reuse sections that you have written for a previous testimony. Just make sure you change the name of the organization or company.

, The organization or company to which you are applying wants to know that you are interested in them. They might even ask you to address this question in your personal testimony. Do some research to find out what sets them apart from other organizations and make your writing reflect that research.


Even if the company or organization does not ask specifically why you are interested in them, your writing should demonstrate your interest. You can do this by including examples and evidence that would be important to them and which are suggestive of what you can do for them in the future, if offered the position.
Specify qualifications you have that would make you a good fit. For example, say you did Peace Corps after college and are applying for a political science master program focusing in international relations. Talk about what you learned about issues in other parts of the world during your service., If you are like many people, your life story may seem to lack excitement. Figuring out a way to make it interesting becomes the big challenge. Finding an angle or providing a storyboard is vital to a quality personal testimonial.Think about what's unique about you. If you were to define yourself as a person, what experience would you draw upon to do so? Maybe your family has a long background in grassroots political action. You've done campaign work for every election since you were seven.
This story could be a great start for a personal testimonial for a job in politics. You could start off writing something like, ""I say, without exaggeration, that I've been involved in the Democratic process since elementary school."" You can emphasize your lifelong commitment to politics, bringing up related education and work experiences as you go.

, Do not simply state that you would make an excellent doctor, sales manager, or graduate student. Instead, back it up with specific reasons and evidence. Your desire to become a lawyer, engineer, and so forth should be logical, the result of specific experience that is described in your statement.What makes you a good candidate for a particular position? This is your chance to brag. Bring up past work experience and any awards or honors you've received. Talk about your publications, if you have them.
Go into detail about your skill set. If you're applying for an administrative position, include your typing speed. If you're applying for a software company, list all the softwares and computer programs you're proficient in running.

, Backing up your claims with concrete evidence helps you persuade your audience. This also gives them reasons to trust you and believe what you are saying about yourself. It's okay to brag a little in this section. This is your chance to prove yourself.For instance, if you claim that one of your strong qualities is your leadership ability, give details about work where you have taken on a leadership role and state how your leadership was integral to the success of the team. If you won any awards for leadership, state them.
If you have worked in a managerial position, state how many people worked under you, and give an example about an initiative that you lead. Emphasize the outcomes of that initiative and link it to work that you could do in the new position for which you are applying.
Use current examples and data.For instance, if you are using a percentage of quarterly profit increases to demonstrate your business savvy, use the most recent data available to you rather than the profit increases from ten years ago. If you use dated data, your potential employers might wonder if you are avoiding a discussion of your current productivity because your numbers are low.
If you are including testimonials as evidence, use ones from experts in your field. For example, say you're applying to a nonfiction graduate program. Mention that John D'agata reviewed your senior thesis and include any positive comments he made., The middle section of your statement might detail your interest and experience in your particular field, as well as some of your knowledge of the field. Be as specific as you can in relating what you know about the area. Use language the professionals use in communicating this information.


Use jargon here that is relevant to the position. Make sure you use jargon correctly, so you look like you have in-depth understanding of a particular field. For example, say you're applying to a graduate program in English literature. Talk about what genres of literature you're most interested in studying, and the type of analysis that most interests you. Are you interested in post-colonial studies, feminist studies, postmodernism, for example?
Highlight your most relevant work experience. If you are applying to work in a biology lab, don’t tell them about volunteering at the local animal shelter. Describe your work experience in a biology lab and emphasize an important discovery you made or skill you gained.

, People are naturally drawn to stories. If you can find a way to incorporate a brief story in your testimonial, this can help set you apart. Make sure you pick a story that highlights what you can bring to an organization. Talk about a time you resolved a conflict at work. Discuss a personal triumph that changed your attitude for the better. Make sure the story is appropriate, however, and try to avoid anything that could constitute over-sharing.

Find creative ways to set yourself apart.,
Make sure your opening paragraph is solid.,
Cut any irrelevant information.,
Stick to the word requirements.,
Proofread carefully.,
Have someone else read your work.",How to Write a Personal Testimonial About Yourself4," If your statement is fresh, lively, and different, you will be putting yourself ahead of the pack. If you distinguish yourself through your account, you will make yourself memorable.


Find ways to write with attitude. It's okay to be a little creative in a personal testimonial. People reading through testimonials likely sift through hundreds each day. A fun opening line can really set you apart. Let's return to the example of applying for a job in politics. You campaigned with your family when you were young. Try opening with something like, ""Picture a 4 foot tall 8 year-old passionately handing out yard signs to middle-aged soccer moms in a typical Midwestern neighborhood. There you have my introduction to the political process in America.""
Address possible objections. This can set you apart. Imagine what hesitations a reader may have about you. For example, ""I may come off as a bit young or a bit naive, but I believe my youth only reinforces my passion and energy for politics."", The opening paragraph is generally the most important. It is here that you grab the interview panel’s attention or lose it. This paragraph becomes the framework for the rest of the statement.


Try for a fun and attention-grabbing opening line. Do not begin with something that sounds too generic. If you wrote something like, ""I'm a 27 year-old content marketer looking for fresh experience,"" try to rewrite it in a more entertaining, energetic fashion. For example, ""I've been in love with the world of marketing since finishing college 5 years ago, and I'm ready for some fantastic new challenges.""
Read through your opening paragraph several times to make sure there are no typos. If readers are shifting through hundreds of personal testimonies, a typo is a good reason to discard one. Make sure you whole statement, but especially your opening paragraph, is typo-free.

, Be sure that every example and every sentence connects to the questions or topics you need to address in your personal testimony. Cut out any extraneous information.


It would be a good idea to return to the job advertisement as you read through your testimony to remind yourself of the key words and phrases you highlighted. Check that everything in your statement connects to the topics and requirements you noted earlier. Delete anything that does not relate.
Delete any references to experiences or accomplishments from high school or before unless you have just graduated from high school.
Look for anything that could be interpreted as possibly controversial—anything, for instance, that suggests a particular religious or political affiliation.
In general, don't include personal information such as your age, marital status, or race, unless it is relevant to the job position.

, Never go over the word limit; be as concise as possible. Going over the word limit shows a lack of consideration for the time constraints of the person reading your document and also suggests that you can’t get to the point in an efficient manner.

, Type and proofread your personal testimony very carefully. If your work includes typos or grammar errors, the person reading your document will think you are unprofessional. You want to be sure to make a good impression, even before people meet you, by submitting a polished testimony.

, Regardless of how good of a writer you are, asking someone else to read over your testimony will help you catch any remaining typos or errors. Ask a friend or family member with good writing skills to help you.


Alternately, pay a professional editor. Spending a little extra money on polishing your personal testimony might just land you your dream job!

Start narrowing it down.,
Pull out old pictures, diaries, and objects of nostalgia.,
Allow your emotions to flow.,
Give therapy a shot.",How to Write a Memoir1," A good memoir isn't a life story; it's a peek into a time in your life when you had genuine feeling, a genuine experience. Try to keep your memoir to a narrow focus on one time period or aspect in your life, ultimately drilling home a larger message. If written well, this one topic or time you went through will become universal and all audiences will be able to relate.Start thinking of writable material.


What's something you can't deny?
What or who did you leave behind?
What's something you did that you no longer understand?
What are you sorry you never did?
What physical characteristic are you proud to pass on?
When did you unexpectedly feel compassion?
What do you have too much of?
When did you know you were in trouble?;
, They will bring to mind the experiences you could write about. If possible, go to the scene and relive the events in your mind.


Just because you can't remember it off-hand doesn't mean you shouldn't write about it. Memoirs are all about self-exploration and there's more to you than just you, after all. You are the places you go, the people you love, and the things you have, too.

, This is one moment when your mind should be playing second fiddle to your heart. And if the emotions are scary, nonsensical, painful, or downright terrifying, all the better. Bringing these to the surface will help you stay in the moment and write with passion, purpose, and clarity.If a train of thought gets close to a nerve, don't close the doors and draw the curtains. If you stop, your writing will go flat and you'll end up dancing around subjects. Take your mind to a place it may not want to go. Hiding behind those first thoughts may be something worth knowing, worth writing about.
Listen to music that can metaphorically take you back in time or noticeably changes your mood. Anything that stirs your emotions and allows your mind to be absorbed back into that moment can shed light on the past.

, This not only gives you one or two hours a week to get mindfully organized, but it allows your writing to be organic and creative and not the therapy itself. A memoir is not to find closure, it's to be shared with others, to expose a bit of yourself.


It's totally normal to feel like you're going crazy. Digging around your old emotions will surely bring them to life and make them feel real. All you have to do, then, is write them down on paper and soak in the catharsis. You may even find that the story is writing itself and the conclusion you never even saw coming is looming right in front of you.

",How to Write a Manual," It may seem self-evident, but knowledge is the key to writing a successful manual. For example, if you’re writing a camera manual, knowing that an f-stop and the shutter speed are not just 2 separate functions—they are—but knowing how they interact with each other will make it much easier for you to describe each function as it relates to the whole.;
, If your role is simply the writer rather than the subject matter expert, involve knowledgeable people throughout the process and make sure they review your work. Their knowledge and advice is invaluable.

, If possible, doing the thing you are writing about will, at the very least, give you a feel for what the user will want to learn.

, Learn to talk the talk, and become conversant in the product you are writing about.


Manuals of similar products will show you how other writers have tackled the subject.

Look for similarities among the writers, which indicates both common functionality and common approaches to describing something.
Look for differences that stand out. Those are likely to be functions that are unique to a given product. Your product may or may not include those functions, or may have alternate ways of solving the problem that you can describe, enhancing the value of your product. While your job may be writing a how-to, showing the customers the value of their purchase is a great way to encourage them to continue reading.


Devour trade magazines. Find out how the people who use the products work with them day-to-day. They may wish there was a function that solved their particular problem, and if your product is the solution, that needs to be highlighted.

, Whether a simple step-by-step instruction sheet, or a manual for a 35mm digital camera, breaking it down into digestible chunks has several benefits:


It lets you focus on individual parts of the whole. Your goal is to familiarize the user with how to learn the process. How to perform the function can be left for a tutorial at the end, if desired, or left for the user to discover on their own.

, It would do no good, for example, to describe how the flash on a camera works until you’ve shown how to attach the lens, load the film, turn on the camera, and adjust the focus. This is especially useful if you do not know the subject matter well.

,, Once you’ve defined the logical sections, review them to make sure everything is covered.

, Have the items that you’re describing on hand and ready to use as described in the manual. If you’re making a paper box, have paper, scissors, tape, glue, and a ruler handy. If you’re writing about a camera, make sure your camera is disassembled. If possible, the product you’re writing about should be back in the box at this point.

, This will set the tone of the entire manual, and will give the user an idea about what sort of manual they are about to digest. Will it be light and amusing, or straightforward and no-nonsense? It depends on your readership. There’s much more room for verbal play teaching children to make a paper box than there is teaching a doctor how to proceed with open-heart surgery. Establish the tone early and keep that tone throughout the manual.

, Not only does this give your writing the air of honesty and authenticity, you also ensure nothing will get left out.


If, for some reason, it isn't feasible to do the steps, think them through thoroughly and consult somebody who is an expert.

, This makes it easier for people to follow along, and to refer back to should they lose their place.


If you’re writing on paper, be sure to leave space for additions between each step. Remember to renumber your steps if you add more in.

, As you’re writing, you may realize that if the user performs a step carelessly, it could cause a problem.


Conversely, if there is some bit of knowledge that will make the user’s task easier or more interesting, add it in.

, Using only your written instructions, do the thing you are writing about. Should you find places where your instructions are lacking, add in the necessary information. Repeat this step until you have all the steps and can do what you are teaching without having to add notes.


Consider having a friend or two use the manual. Watch them closely when they learn how to use the product. See where they zip through it. See where they get lost, confused, or fail at the task. Listen to what they have to say, then adjust your manual accordingly.

, You don’t want to send your final proofreader (be that your agency or your spouse) a manual full of glaring errors.

, Once you have all the necessary steps detailed, go through your manual to find the obvious category heads.


Title them, and note their locations.

, Look at the way wikiHow is laid out as an example. The main page offers many section heads. When you access a section, it lists many subcategories, and the subcategories list articles. The more detailed your manual is, the more categories and subcategories you will need. (How to Whistle needs none, How to Carve a Whistle needs a few, and How to Play the Flute needs many!)

, Yes, you did it thoroughly once already. Doing it a second time will undoubtedly catch a few more minor errors or places where your manual just isn’t clear.


For a more comprehensive manual, you can also take this opportunity to note all the small topics, and use that information to create an index.

Write a headline.,
Create a lead.,
Follow up with details.,
End with a summary.",How to Write a Newspaper Article2," The headline of your story should be a sentence fragment that succinctly sums up its main point. Use catchy wording to attract attention, but make sure the headline is representative of the actual content of the story. For example:


""Community Mourns Loss of Popular Football Coach""
""Powerful Earthquake Strikes Bay Area""
""President to Appear in Town this Weekend""

, The first sentence of a news article is called the lead (also spelled ""lead"") and contains the story's most essential details. Even if people don't read past the lead, they should come away from the story knowing the main gist. The lead is written in third person and answers the classic news story questions: who, what, when, where, why and how? Take these examples:


""An outbreak of flu in San Francisco has led to 3 elementary school closings this week, according to school officials.""
""A missing Jefferson County girl was found Monday taking shelter in an abandoned cabin, the National Park Service said.""

, Fill out the story with details that provide context, the opinions of people you interviewed, and any other necessary facts that readers should know to completely understand what happened. Each follow-up paragraph has its own main point, and no paragraph is longer than about 50 words.


Write follow-up paragraphs in order of importance, rather than in chronological order. Readers should be able to skim through the first part of the article and get the necessary information first. If they're interested, they may read to the end for in-depth coverage of the subject.
Weave in statements you collected from your interviews, relevant statistics, and historical information to back up each point you make.

, The last paragraph brings the article full circle, summarizing the main points and concluding with information readers might need to continue following the story.

"
"
Stay objective.,
Make it readable.",How to Write a Newspaper Article3," Objectivity has long been a fundamental requirement for newspaper journalism. While it's impossible to be completely objective - after all, everything about the story, from its topic to your vocabulary choices, is coming from you - you should try your best to present a complete picture so readers have the chance to form their own opinions.


Don't let your personal biases show in your story. If you're writing about two political candidates running against each other in an election, for example, present both candidates in an equal light, rather than making your preferences clear.
Don't use loaded words that may influence readers' opinions of your subject. Avoid stereotypes and politically incorrect terms.
Don't hyperbolize events, actions or other aspects of a story. Your job is to tell what actually happened, not an exaggerated version of reality.

, Write with a sentence structure and word choices that communicate information clearly, rather than causing confusion. The point of a news article is to quickly convey information, not to impress or entertain people (although you certainly don't want the article to be boring). Newspapers are read by people from all walks of life, so your writing has to appeal to a diverse readership.


Use active, rather than passive, language. It's easier to read, and it gets directly to the point. For example, write ""Senator Thompson held a press conference Tuesday,"" not ""A press conference will be held by Senator Thompson on Tuesday.""
Identify your interviewees clearly. Is he or she a doctor who has done research on a scientific breakthrough? A government official? The mother of a man on trial for murder? The person's role should be clear to your readers.
Don't muddle your writing with unnecessary words. Using uncommon vocabulary serves only to distract and confuse your readers. Choose words that enhance your article's accuracy, rather than the biggest and most impressive words you can find.

"
"
Collect information.,
Conduct interviews.,
Perform a fact check.",How to Write a Newspaper Article4," Once you've decided what you're going to write about, gather the information you'll need to write the article. Presenting a story to readers who may otherwise have no knowledge of the subject is a big responsibility, and you will want to collect as much well-researched and firsthand information as possible.


Read up on the story's background so that you're able to present it in the right context. For example, if you're writing a story about the passage of a new law protecting a forest from getting cut down, find out what the law stated before, why it was passed, who led the movement to get it passed, who opposed it, and so on.
If you're writing about an event, attend it, whether it's a senate hearing, a baseball game or a presidential campaign stop. Take thorough notes while you're there so that you remember what happened later.

, News stories are enhanced by accounts from firsthand witnesses and people with expert opinions. Identify the main players in the story and ask them short, specific questions so that their answers supplement the information you present in your news article.


Make an appointment with the person or people you want to interview. You can interview them in person or over the phone.
Use the interview as a way to verify facts you have collected. For example, if you're covering a tornado that caused damage in a small town and you want to know how many homes were damaged, interview the sheriff. If you want an account from someone who saw the tornado, interview a witness from the town.
Don't use the interviewee's words out of context. The people you interview for news articles are doing you a favor. If you're going to publish someone's words, make sure you stay true to their original meaning.

, When you write a news article, you have a responsibility to your readers to present completely accurate information. Getting a fact wrong may seem insignificant, but it has consequences; aside from trouble that could be caused by misinforming the public, your reliability as a journalist could come into question.


Check numbers and other hard data with an expert source. If you're writing a story about a heat wave, call the National Weather Service to verify the temperatures.
Verify information based on hearsay with more than one source.
Check the spellings of names and other proper nouns. Make especially certain that you have the correct spellings of the names of people you interview.

"
Be honest.,
Have an A and Z.,
Validate the facts.",How to Write a Memoir2," Very few people grew up the son or daughter of a great doctor and spent their formative years in Africa curing blind tigers. If your life seems boring on paper, consider that ""challenge extended."" You are not any more boring than the next 100 people you meet on the street; you're just not looking in the right places. However daunting this may seem, don't lie. Your readers deserve better. And so do you, quite frankly.When we recall things, we often recall how we felt when we recalled the memory than how we felt when the memory actually went down. Make sense? So don't necessarily trust your memory -- ask others about the outplay of events. You'll want as unbiased a view as possible -- after all, you have the power of the pen; don't abuse it.
It is always satisfying to read a writer who sharply and deftly attacks the hypocrisies and delusions of the world around him, but we trust that writer more completely when he also attacks himself, when he does not hold himself to a different standard, or protect himself from scrutiny.Be honest about the outplay of events, but also take an honest look at yourself.
If the reader senses the writer is lying even to himself, or using the essay as a piece of propaganda, a forwarding of his own personal mythology in too clumsy or transparent a way, she will react against it.As long as it feels honest, you're good to go.

, That is, have a straight up, no fuss, no muss, beginning and end before you start writing your story. If your twin sister stole your Judy Jetson thermos on March 14th, 1989 and you finally visited her children in September of 2010, there it is. There's your story. Now you just have to fill in the gaps.


Remember: The story is all yours. Whatever happened can be as insane or as mundane as you see fit; if you write it compellingly, your readers will care (in a good way) either way.

, After all, a memoir is based on truth. Dates, times, names, people, sequences of events, even the tiniest of details are important. The last thing you want is for something to come to light proving you fudged the truth. You may want to change names of people or places to avoid the mess, but put a disclaimer at the beginning if you do so.


Validate what can be validated and imagine what can only be imagined. It's at this time that you get to reinvent who you are. The state you're in at the time of recall will affect the memory to the point where when you go to recall it again, it will have been adjusted. So take the gray area that is your brain and run with it. Your mind exists outside of time.

Review your work.,
Make deletions.,
Let a small group read your work.",How to Write a Memoir3," Has it said what you ventured out to say? Is anything left out? Are questions raised and not answered? Is your wording clear? Does it move you?


A good memoir is entertaining. It doesn't necessarily have to be funny, but it should be deliberately something. What is the reader getting from it? Why would they drop their own worries and start caring about yours?
In addition to checking for content errors, check for grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes. Your computer will not catch everything. If you have a close friend or family member that is particularly good at this, ask them for assistance.

, Not everything you write will be gold. After you've taken a break, start back at the beginning, dissecting and removing. Weed out what's unnecessary and repetitive.


Not every instance of your existence is worth noting. If an event isn't part of a flowing transition into another, it doesn't have to make it to the page. Include only what gets you to your end point without meandering from your path.

, After you have revised as much as you can, give your memoir to some trusted friends for feedback. You may see a pattern in their comments, and that's a good indication of what needs further revision. Don't be shy and seek a professional editor if needed.


If they're in it (or not in it), be careful. Don't hurt anyone's feelings by putting them in a negative light (or not putting them in one at all) and then forcing them to read it. You'll only get a negative reaction.
Constructive criticism is vital to your work. Sometimes you may not see things that others will point out, and it may help you improve your work.

Since it's basically going to be a lot of talking between people, your characters need to be as believable as possible. In great plays, the inner tensions between characters enact themselves in external ways. In other words, the characters need to have problems that show up in their behaviour.


What does your character want? What is keeping your character from getting what they want? What stands in their way?
Thinking of interesting jobs can be a good way of developing a character. What's the hardest job you can imagine? What's a job you've always been curious about? What kind of person becomes a podiatrist? How does one end up with such a job?
Don't worry about the name or the physical description of your character. It doesn't tell you anything about a character named Rafe to know that he is 6'4 and has washboard abs and wears t-shirts some of the time. Stick to one notable and telling physical trait. Maybe your character has a scar on their eyebrow from being bitten by a dog, or maybe your character never wears skirts. This reveals something about them and gives them depth.;
, The setting of the play is where and when the story takes place. Placing your character in a tense situation or location is an important way to create drama. Combining character and setting can also be a good way of developing your character, and figuring out what kind of story might result from their placement in that setting. If being a podiatrist is interesting to you, what about being a podiatrist in Paris, Texas? What kind of person becomes a podiatrist in Paris, Texas, for instance? How does one end up there?


Be as specific as possible when developing your setting. ""The Modern Day"" isn't as interesting as ""Dr. Wilson's Family Podiatry, next to the The West Hillsboro Suburban Mall, just south of town, at 3:15 pm on Good Friday."" The more specific you are, the more you'll give yourself to work with.
Consider what other characters the setting may introduce. Who works the desk at the podiatry office? If it's a family business, maybe the podiatrist's daughter. Who has an appointment on a Friday? Who's waiting? What are they in for?

, The ""inner"" story refers to the psychological conflicts happening within the characters. This is largely hidden throughout the story, but it's important for you to have some sense of as you're writing the play. The inner story will guide the characters throughout their decisions throughout the plot. The more concrete the inner story, the easier the characters will be to write. They'll be making their own decisions.


Maybe your podiatrist wanted to be a brain surgeon but lacked the stomach for it. Maybe the podiatry program had the least strenuous schedule, and allowed the med-school version of your character to stay up late partying while still passing all their classes. Maybe the podiatrist is deeply unhappy and unfulfilled about having never left Paris.

, Bad plots look backward and good plots look forward. It wouldn't be interesting to have a play in which your podiatrist talked endlessly about how she'd rather not be a podiatrist and then killed herself with shoe polish. Instead, find a dramatic situation to place your characters in that will test their mettle and change them in some way.


If it's Good Friday, maybe the podiatrist's retire parents (former podiatrists themselves) are coming for an Easter Dinner. Is your podiatrist even religious? Will she go to Church? Does she have to get home and clean up the house before the weekend starts? Is her father going to make her check out his bunions, AGAIN? Will this be the last straw? What will happen?

, Remember: you're not writing a movie. A play is basically an ongoing series of conversations between people. The focus needs to be on the tension between the characters, the language, and on developing your characters into believable people. It isn't a great medium for gun fights and car chases.


Alternatively, break from traditional theatre and write a play with impossible-to-stage scenes as a way of exploring the writing itself. If you have no plans to actually stage the play, treat it as a different form of poem. Bertolt Brecht, Samuel Beckett, and Antonin Artaud were all innovators of experimental avant garde plays who incorporated audience participation and other absurdist or surreal elements into their drama.

, Just as you wouldn't try to write a novel if you'd never read one, it's a good idea to get familiar with the world of contemporary theatre. Check out plays you've read and liked to see how they transform on the stage. David Mamet, Tony Kushner, and Polly Stenham are all popular and celebrated playwrights.


It's important to see new plays if you're going to write new plays. Even if you've got a good working knowledge and love of Shakespeare, it's important to get familiar with what's going on in the here and now. You don't live in Shakespeare's era, so it wouldn't make sense to write plays as if you did.

, Even if your plan for ""Easter with the Podiatrists"" seems like you're on your way to claiming a Tony Award, you'll still manage to surprise yourself in the writing. You may have the greatest idea in the world, but you still have to actually write the thing and allow for surprise to enter into the equation.


In the exploratory draft, don't worry about formatting the play or writing it ""correctly,"" just let everything get out that needs to get out. Write until you've got a beginning, middle, and end to your play.Maybe a new character will wander into the story that changes everything. Let it happen.

, A play is literally a slice of a life, it's not a biography. While it can be tempting to want to jump ten years into the future or have the main character quit her job in the podiatrist's office and become a successful actor in New York, a stage play isn't the best medium for these kinds of seismic shifts in character.


Your play might end with a simple decision being made, or it might end with a character confronting something they've never confronted before. If your play ends with a character killing themselves or someone else, rethink the ending.

, In the early drafts, you'll probably write a lot of scenes that wander without really going anywhere. That's ok. Sometimes you need to have the character spend a long awkward dinner conversation with their brother-in-law to find out something that gives you a whole new perspective on the drama. Great! That means you're writing successfully, but it doesn't necessarily mean the whole dinner date is important to the play.


Avoid any scenes in which a character is alone. Nothing can happen on stage with a character in the bathroom looking into the mirror.
Avoid too much preamble. If the podiatrist's parents are going to arrive, don't delay for twenty pages. Make it happen as soon as possible to give yourself more to work with. Make it easy on yourself.

, Your characters will reveal themselves with their language. The way they choose to say things is maybe even more important than what they're actually saying.When the podiatrist's daughter asks ""What's wrong?"" the way the podiatrist answers will tell the audience how to interpret the conflict? Maybe she faux-dramatically rolls her eyes and sobs ""Everything!"" and throws a stack of papers in the air to make her daughter laugh. But we really know there's something wrong she's making light of. We'll look at her character differently than we would if she said, ""Nothing. Get back to work.""Don't let your characters shout their inner turmoil. A character should never shout, ""I'm a shell of a man since my wife left me!"" or anything that explicitly reveals their internal conflicts. Make them hold onto their secrets. You want their actions to speak for themselves, and not to force them into explaining themselves to the audience.

, The refrain of the writer? ""Kill your darlings."" You have to be a harsh critic of your early drafts to get the usually-messy early writing crafted into the hard-hitting and realistic drama you want to write. Cut scenes that meander, cut characters that are useless, and make the play as tight and as quick as you possibly can.


Go back through your drafts with a pencil and mark any moments with a circle that pause the drama, and underline moments that move the drama forward. Cut out everything that's circled. If you end up cutting out 90% of what you've written, so be it. Fill it back in with things that move the story forward.

, There's no right number of drafts. Keep going until the play feels finished, until its satisfying for you to read and fulfills your expectations of the story.


Save each version of the draft so you can feel free to take risks and always go back to the old version if you want to. Word processor files are small. It's worth it.

, An act is a mini-play unto itself, made up of several scenes. The average play involves 3-5 Acts. Generally, a scene will have a given set of characters. If a new character is introduced, or if the character's move elsewhere, that indicates that you're moving on to another scene.


An act is hard to distinguish. The podiatrist story, for instance, might end its first act with the arrival of the parents and the introduction of the main conflict. The second act might involve the development of that conflict, including scenes in which the parents argue with the podiatrist daughter, Easter dinner is cooked and Church is attended. In Act three, the daughter might reconcile with the father, giving his troubled foot a once-over. The end.
The more experienced you become at writing plays, you'll be able to think in terms of acts and scenes as you write your initial draft. Don't worry about it in the early-going, though. The formatting is much less important than getting the drama right.

, Each scene should start with stage directions, in which you describe briefly the physical components of the stage. Depending on your story, this might be very elaborate or fairly simple. This is your opportunity to influence the way the play will eventually look. If it's important to have a gun on the wall in Act One, put it in there.


Also include character directions throughout the dialog. The actors will take their own liberties with the dialog and move about as they and the director sees fit, but it helps to have any particularly important (as you see it) physical motions included throughout the dialog. A kiss, for instance, is probably important to direct, but don't overdo it. You don't need to describe every minute physical movement of a character, because the actors will ignore such directions anyway.

, In a play, each character's dialog is marked with their name in all capital letters, tabbed in at least 4"". Some playwrights will center the dialog, but it's up to you. You don't need to use quotation marks or other distinguishing features, just separate the language by including the character's name every time they speak.

, This includes any prologue you'd like to include to the play, a list of characters and a short description of them, any notes you'd like to include about the set up of the stage or other directing guidelines, and possibly a brief summary or outline of the play if you're considering submitting the play to theatre contests."

Are you writing a manual for beginners or experts (or somewhere in between)?
Is the audience going to be involved with a class (using the manual) or self-study?

,


Example: You are writing a manual ""How to Install Doors"". One section might be about sliding doors. Another section might be about front doors. Still another section might be about back doors.

, This is not about a logical order of actions. Some subject may need to be presented first. Tasks that will be included in all parts of the manual should probably be discussed first. If you feel that the reader should already have the skills to complete the task, then consider describing the task in an appendix.

, If it is unlikely the reader will already know the jargon, place the glossary immediately after the table of contents. Update the glossary as you write the manual.


Definitions of terms in the glossary need to be as exact as possible. If the term is an acronym, like ""Scuba"", then fully explain that it means ""Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus"" in the definition.

, An inaccurate manual is a useless manual. Complete your preliminary research before starting the manual.

,


Example: You are writing a manual about such and so computer. You have a section called ""Troubleshooting"". You might write part of it about disk space issues. You might write another about excessive memory usage.

,, Use your organization as a guide, but alter it if it doesn't work.


Write descriptions of different tasks.
Write examples that the reader can follow to gain instruction.
Prepare appropriate illustrations. Do not add them until the manual is completed. The illustrations will need to be fitted to the text.


Modify illustrations to give hints to indicate what the user is looking for.

Nothing destroys a writer's credibility faster than plagiarism. One day, someone may be quoting your writing. How would you feel about someone ""stealing"" your work?

, Fit them into the document. Do not be afraid to use white space.

, Proofreading should be ongoing. Make notes of errors or omissions. Correct them. Make notes of passages others find confusing. Rewrite the passage to make it easier to read. Have a variety of people read your manual to insure the best possible result.




This is the order I recommend you have a completed manual proofread:

Proof your work, yourself.
Have a friend proofread it.
Have an expert (in the field you are writing about) proofread it.
(If the manual is for your company), have your boss proofread it.
Have a novice proofread it.


Why have a novice proofread it? The manual must be understandable to the minimum knowledge level you expect to read it.

Rewrite your draft as many times as needed.",How to Write a Play Script," Though every story is different, most plays fall into categories that help the audience understand how to interpret the relationships and events they see. Think about the characters you want to write, then consider how you want their stories to unfold. Do they:Have to solve a mystery?
Go through a series of difficult events in order to achieve personal growth?
Come of age by transitioning from childlike innocence to worldly experience?
Go on a journey, like Odysseus’s perilous journey in The Odyssey?Bring order to chaos?
Overcome a series of obstacles to achieve a goal?;
, The technical terms for these three parts are exposition, rising action, and resolution, and they always come in that order. Regardless of how long your play is or how many acts you have, a good play will develop all three pieces of this puzzle. Taken notes on how you want to flesh each one out before sitting down to write your play.

, Exposition opens a play by providing basic information needed to follow the story: When and where does this story take place? Who is the main character? Who are the secondary characters, including the antagonist (person who presents the main character with his or her central conflict), if you have one? What is the central conflict these characters will face? What is the mood of this play (comedy, romantic drama, tragedy)?

, In the rising action, events unfold in a way that makes circumstances more difficult for the characters. The central conflict comes into focus as events raise the audience’s tension higher and higher. This conflict may be with another character (antagonist), with an external condition (war, poverty, separation from a loved one), or with oneself (having to overcome one’s own insecurities, for example). The rising action culminates in the story’s climax: the moment of highest tension, when the conflict comes to a head., The resolution releases the tension from the climactic conflict to end the narrative arc. You might have a happy ending, where the main character gets what he/she wants; a tragic ending where the audience learns something from the main character’s failure; or a denouement, in which all questions are answered.

, The narrative of your play is made up of the plot and the story — two discrete elements that must be developed together to create a play that holds your audience’s attention. E.M. Forster defined story as what happens in the play — the chronological unfolding of events. Plot, on the other hand, can be thought of as the logic that links the events that unfold through the plot and make them emotionally powerful.An example of the difference is:


Story: The protagonist’s girlfriend broke up with him. Then the protagonist lost his job.
Plot: The protagonist’s girlfriend broke up with him. Heartbroken, he had an emotional breakdown at work that resulted in his firing.
You must develop a story that’s compelling and moves the action of the play along quickly enough to keep the audience’s attention. At the same time, you must show how the actions are all causally linked through your plot development. This is how you make the audience care about the events that are transpiring on stage.

, You can’t deepen the emotional resonance of the plot until you have a good story in place. Brainstorm the basic elements of story before fleshing them out with your actual writing by answering the following questions:Where does your story take place?
Who is your protagonist (main character), and who are the important secondary characters?
What is the central conflict these characters will have to deal with?
What is the “inciting incident” that sets off the main action of the play and leads up to that central conflict?What happens to your characters as they deal with this conflict?
How is the conflict resolved at the end of the story? How does this impact the characters?

, Remember that the plot develops the relationship between all the elements of story that were listed in the previous step. As you think about plot, you should try to answer the following questions: What are the relationships between the characters?
How do the characters interact with the central conflict? Which ones are most impacted by it, and how does it affect them?
How can you structure the story (events) to bring the necessary characters into contact with the central conflict?
What is the logical, casual progression that leads each event to the next one, building in a continuous flow toward the story’s climactic moment and resolution?

, The one-act play runs straight through without any intermissions, and is a good starting point for people new to playwriting. Examples of one-act plays include ""The Bond,"" by Robert Frost and Amy Lowell, and ""Gettysburg,"" by Percy MacKaye.Although the one-act play has the simplest structure, remember that all stories need a narrative arc with exposition, rising tension, and resolution.


Because one-act plays lack intermissions, they call for simpler sets and costume changes. Keep your technical needs simple.

, The one-act structure has nothing to do with the duration of the performance. These plays can vary widely in length, with some productions as short as 10 minutes and others over an hour long.


Flash dramas are very short one-act plays that can run from a few seconds up to about 10 minutes long. They’re great for school and community theater performances, as well as competitions specifically for flash theater. See Anna Stillaman's ""A Time of Green"" for an example of a flash drama., The two-act play is the most common structure in contemporary theater. Though there’s no rule for how long each act should last, in general, acts run about half an hour in length, giving the audience a break with an intermission between them. The intermission gives the audience time to use the restroom or just relax, think about what’s happened, and discuss the conflict presented in the first act. However, it also lets your crew make heavy changes to set, costume, and makeup. Intermissions usually last about 15 minutes, so keep your crew’s duties reasonable for that amount of time.For examples of two-act plays, see Peter Weiss' ""Hölderlin"" or Harold Pinter's ""The Homecoming.""

, Because the audience has a break in the middle of the play, you can't treat the story as one flowing narrative. You must structure your story around the intermission to leave the audience tense and wondering at the end of the first act. When they come back from intermission, they should immediately be drawn back into the rising tension of the story.


The “inciting incident” should occur about half-way through the first act, after the background exposition.
Follow the inciting incident with multiple scenes that raise the audience’s tension — whether dramatic, tragic, or comedic. These scenes should build toward a point of conflict that will end the first act.
End the first act just after the highest point of tension in the story to that point. The audience will be left wanting more at intermission, and they’ll come back eager for the second act.
Begin the second act at a lower point of tension than where you left off with the first act. You want to ease the audience back into the story and its conflict.
Present multiple second-act scenes that raise the stakes in the conflict toward the story’s climax, or the highest point of tension and conflict, just before the end of the play.
Relax the audience into the ending with falling action and resolution. Though not all plays need a happy ending, the audience should feel as though the tension you’ve built throughout the play has been released.

, If you’re new to playwriting, you may want to start with a one- or two-act play because a full-length, three-act play might keep your audience in its seats for two hours!It takes a lot of experience and skill to put together a production that can captivate an audience for that long, so you might want to set your sights lower at first. However, if the story you want to tell is complex enough, a three-act play might be your best bet. Just like the 2-act play, it allows for major changes to set, costumes, etc. during the intermissions between acts. Each act of the play should achieve its own storytelling goal:Act 1 is the exposition: take your time introducing the characters and background information. Make the audience care about the main character (protagonist) and his or her situation to ensure a strong emotional reaction when things start going wrong. The first act should also introduce the problem that will develop throughout the rest of the play.
Act 2 is the complication: the stakes become higher for the protagonist as the problem becomes harder to navigate. One good way to raise the stakes in the second act is to reveal an important piece of background information close to the act’s climax.This revelation should instill doubt in the protagonist’s mind before he or she finds the strength to push through the conflict toward resolution. Act 2 should end despondently, with the protagonist’s plans in shambles.
Act 3 is the resolution: the protagonist overcomes the obstacles of the second act and finds a way to reach the play’s conclusion. Note that not all plays have happy endings; the hero may die as part of the resolution, but the audience should learn something from it.Examples of three-act plays include Honore de Balzac's ""Mercadet"" and John Galsworthy's ""Pigeon: A Fantasy in Three Acts.""

, In the first two sections of this article, you brainstormed your basic ideas about narrative arc, story and plot development, and play structure. Now, before sitting down to write the play, you should place all these ideas into a neat outline. For each act, lay out what happens in each scene.


When are important characters introduced?
How many different scenes do you have, and what specifically happens in each scene?
Make sure each scene’s events build toward the next scene to achieve plot development.
When might you need set changes? Costume changes? Take these kinds of technical elements into consideration when outlining how your story will unfold.

, Once you have your outline, you can write your actual play. Just get your basic dialogue on the page at first, without worrying about how natural the dialogue sounds or how the actors will move about the stage and give their performances. In the first draft, you simply want to “get black on white,” as Guy de Maupassant said.

, You want to give your actors a solid script, so they can deliver the lines in a way that seems human, real, and emotionally powerful. Record yourself reading the lines from your first draft aloud, then listen to the recording. Make note of points where you sound robotic or overly grand. Remember that even in literary plays, your characters still have to sound like normal people. They shouldn’t sound like they’re delivery fancy speeches when they’re complaining about their jobs over a dinner table.

, When you’re talking with your friends, you rarely stick to a single subject with focused concentration. While in a play, the conversation must steer the characters toward the next conflict, you should allow small diversions to make it feel realistic. For example, in a discussion of why the protagonist’s girlfriend broke up with him, there might be a sequence of two or three lines where the speakers argue about how long they’d been dating in the first place.

, Even when we’re not being rude, people interrupt each other in conversation all the time — even if just to voice support with an “I get it, man” or a “No, you’re completely right.” People also interrupt themselves by changing track within their own sentences: “I just — I mean, I really don’t mind driving over there on a Saturday, it’s just that — listen, I’ve just been working really hard lately.”


Don’t be afraid to use sentence fragments, either. Although we’re trained never to use fragments in writing, we use them all the time when we’re speaking: “I hate dogs. All of them.”

, Use italics or brackets to set your stage directions apart from the spoken dialogue. While the actors will use their own creative license to bring your words to life, some specific directions you give might include:


Conversation cues: Physical actions: ; Emotional states: , , , You’re not going to nail your play on the first draft. Even experienced writers need to write several drafts of a play before they’re satisfied with the final product. Don’t rush yourself! With each pass, add more detail that will help bring your production to life.


Even as you’re adding detail, remember that the delete key can be your best friend. As Donald Murray says, you must “cut what is bad, to reveal what is good.” Remove all dialogue and events that don’t add to the emotional resonance of the play.
The novelist Leonard Elmore’s advice applies to plays as well: “Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.”"

Brainstorm ideas for your essay.,
Narrow down your topic.,
Try writing in different forms.,
Write your first draft.,
Incorporate sensory details.",How to Write Non Fiction1," Unlike writing a memoir about a specific time and place in your life, an essay is not restricted by any limiting factors. An essay works best when it is somewhat specific, but it can ultimately be about anything you want. There are some general guidelines that can help strengthen your essay, though, and as you brainstorm ideas you may want to think about the elements of a strong essay.Think about things that you care about or are passionate about. Make a list of 10 subjects, then decide which subject you will have the most to say about (and/or the subject with which you have the most personal experience).
Don't resist a topic because it will be difficult or require research. If you're passionate about that subject and you think you have a lot to say about it, then go for it.
Be flexible. You may decide to change your mind, or you may find that some items on your list relate to one another (and could potentially be woven together).;
, Once you have a general subject that you're interested in, you'll need to narrow it down to its core elements. In other words, you can't write an essay about a broad concept you're curious about or interested in; you'll need to work out the nuts and bolts of what that topic means to you. Think about why you're interested in that topic, how it relates to your life, and what your authority is on that subject (you don't need to be a scholar, but you should have enough personal experience to talk confidently about that subject).Since you're writing a personal essay, it's important that the topic you choose has some direct, personal significance in your life.
Be as specific as possible when choosing your topic. Narrow it down to a memory, an occasion, etc.
For example, instead of writing about loss, you might choose to write about a specific kind of loss (like death), then choose one specific event (like the death of a parent or friend) as your starting point.
The various elements of your essay should all be related somehow, and you'll need to make that relationship clear to the reader to avoid confusion.
You can always expand your topic to include other related concepts/events, or to become a larger meditation on the larger subject that your event touches on, but it's best to begin with one single topic idea and go from there.

, There are many different ways to construct a personal essay. No form is necessarily right or wrong; it's largely a matter of personal aesthetics and preference. Try out a few different forms and see what fits your essay the best.One common form for writing personal essays is to begin with a very specific image, instant, or memory (zoomed in, to put it in film terms) and gradually expand outward to address the larger subject.
Another common form employs the exact opposite: starting very broad, then zooming in on the specific memory, event, etc. This can be a bit tricky, though, as a broad topic can easily lose the interest of your readers early on in the essay.
One form that's been gaining popularity over the last few years is the lyric or hybrid essay. This combines poetry and essay elements, essentially creating a long-form nonfiction poem.
Try writing your essay in one form, and if it doesn't feel right you can experiment with a different form.

, As you compose your first draft, be aware of the voice and tone that your essay takes. The voice should be your natural voice - in other words, don't try to imitate another author. The tone should reflect the content of the essay. So, for example, in an essay about death and grieving, you don't want to write in a happy, bubbly tone.


Don't worry about typos (unless they'll be impossible to decipher) while you write your first draft. You can fix these minor errors in the editing and revision stage.
Make sure you're using visceral details - what many writing teachers refer to as showing, not telling. For example, instead of saying outright that you were frustrated, describe the way you narrowed your eyes and furrowed your brow at someone.
Think about whether the form you're using is working for the essay at hand. If it's not working, try something different, as the overall form will be more difficult to work with during revision.
Consider whether or not you adequately address every aspect of your subject. As you complete your first draft, you should also think about whether or not you've left anything unresolved and make any necessary corrections.

, Sensory details are the bread and butter of any narrative piece of writing. Just because you're writing a nonfiction essay or book, it doesn't mean you can't get creative. Think about how your favorite fiction authors portray a scene and try to apply those same skills to nonfiction.Try to incorporate all five senses. You won't be able to make the reader see, hear, smell, taste, or touch the things you have, but if you craft your piece of writing skillfully, the reader should feel like he/she has experienced them first hand.
Build your images in a linear, narrative way. In other words, don't fill every tangent with long-winded descriptive passages - save that for the main ""story"" thread of your book or essay.
Make sure your details are relevant. If you're just throwing in details to make the essay or book ""pretty,"" it's probably just a distraction.

React to the play as a whole in paragraph 5.",How to Write a Play Review," A play review is a subjective and educated response to a piece of theater. The reviewer should have a strong background in theatre so their opinion is informed and credible. Though this is not a requirement for writing a good play review.The review should also give potential audience members a sense of the play. It should let readers know if spending their hard-earned money on a ticket to the production will be money well spent.
Noting that you thought the play was “good” or “bad” will not create a strong play review. Instead, you should be specific in your critique and have a thoughtful analysis of the production. Your opinion on the play should be supported by a discussion of the production elements and how they worked together as a whole.
The review should also describe the situation or plot of the play without giving too information to the reader. Avoid spoiling any plot twists or turns for potential audience members in your review.

, The standard play review contains five paragraphs. There are other approaches you can use, such as comparing two plays in one review or writing longer reviews for one play. But traditionally, a play review will analyze several elements of the production in five paragraphs, including:Paragraph 1: Your introductory paragraph should describe what you saw on stage. You should also give context for the play, such as the playwright or composer of the play and where the play is being staged.
Paragraph 2: Briefly summarize the plot of the play.
Paragraph 3: Discuss the acting and directing. React to the performers playing the characters in the play.
Paragraph 4: Describe the design elements of the production, such as the lighting, sound, costumes, make up, and set and props.
Paragraph 5: React to the play as a whole. Would you recommend the play to potential audience members? You can also include a recommendation, like a star rating or a thumbs up/thumbs down.

, Do a google search of local plays in your city that have reviews online. Pick up a newspaper and check the Arts & Culture section for play reviews. You can also access example reviews online.Read the review(s) and ask yourself:How does the reviewer structure her review? Does the review follow the traditional structure, with an introduction in paragraph 1, a plot summary in paragraph 2, a discussion of acting and directing in paragraph 3, a discussion of the production elements in paragraph 4, and an overall critique in paragraph 5?
Compare two reviews of the same play. How do the reviews compare and contrast? Are they structured differently or have different critiques of the play?
Is the reviewer overly critical of the play? Does their analysis seem well supported by scenes in the play, or a discussion of design elements of the play?
How does the reviewer wrap up the review? Is there a recommendation at the end of the article, such as a star rating or a thumbs up/thumbs down?

, If you are reviewing a popular play, like “Hamlet” or “The Little Shop of Horrors”, you should be able to find a hard copy of the play. Newer or more obscure plays may be harder to find in hard copy. Reading the play will help you get familiar with the subject matter and how it appears on the page before you see the production live.


Note the stage directions, the setting notes, and the line breaks or pauses in the dialogue.
Pick out any problematic points in the play that you might want to watch for during the production. For example, if you’re going to see Shakespeare’s “Hamlet”, you may make a note of ways the director might stage the pivotal Ophelia drowning scene. Or if you are going to a musical like “The Little Shop of Horrors”, you might note how the director will transition from the song numbers to the dialogue in the production.
Your instructor may also ask you to pay particular attention to certain elements, like the lighting or the costumes, so make sure you are prepared to recognize them.

, You don’t want to do too much research around the production as it may influence your viewing experience. But you should have a sense of the context of the production; which theater company is putting it on, who is directing the play, and what liberties, if any, have they taken with the original content.For example, you may be seeing a version of “Hamlet” that is set in contemporary times and integrates technology in the production. Or you may be seeing a production of “The Little Shop of Horrors” that is set in a record store, rather than a theater. This setting change will change the context of the play, and you should then note how the setting choice is used in the production in your review.

, Try to get to the theater or production setting 15 minutes before show time. Flip through the play’s program. Look for a director’s note and the cast biographies. You should also check if there are any understudy replacements for the production, especially if the show is promoting itself based on the popularity of a certain performer.Note if there are any write ups in the program about a directorial choice, like setting “Hamlet” in contemporary times. There may also be notes on the lighting or the sound design.

Don't: judge the premise of the play based on your personal tastes. Your readers can decide for themselves whether it appeals to them.Do: consider the goals behind production decisions and be prepared to evaluate whether the play achieves them.


, Its important to write down any striking details during the production. But try not to bury your head in your notebook during the entire production. You may miss certain details or a key moment. Use the intermission, which usually happens between acts in a play, to take more detailed notes. Consider:The set design. Look at design elements like lighting, sound, costumes, makeup, and props.
The acting and directing of the production. If a certain casting choice seems important, write it down. If a line of dialogue strikes you, make a note of it. Look at the way the actors say their dialogue and move around the stage. Are they serious, comedic, formal? Do they use modern slang or speech, even though the play was originally set in an older time period?
Any “special effects” used, such as special lighting, sound or technology. Note if the production also uses audience participation to keep the audience engaged.
Right after the performance, you should jot down any concluding notes, including your initial impressions of the production and how successful or unsuccessful you think the production was.

, The longer you wait, the less you’ll remember your experience of the play. Remember your role as a critic is to describe, analyze, and judge. In your review, you will need to:Describe what you saw in detail and make the reader see what you see. Be specific and thorough in your descriptions.
Analyze what you think the director or designer was trying to achieve. Why do you think they designed the movements, lights, sounds effects, and costumes a certain way? What do you think they were trying to make the audience feel or think?
Judge how effective the play was as a whole. Don’t be afraid to give an honest opinion of the production but be sure you can back up your critique in the body of your review (paragraphs 2-4).

Don't: make your persona opinion the main feature.Do: state your opinion honestly, grounded in specific points.


, You may start with a summary of the play if it is a re-staging of a production your audience is familiar with.For example, in this review of “The Little Shop of Horrors”, the reviewer begins with the line: “This Fringe classic pops up most years, with songs such as ‘Somewhere That’s Green’ and ‘Don’t Feed The Plants’ bringing the house down.”This opening line works because it allows the reader to dive right in. In one line, the reviewer has introduced the play, noted the play is a “classic” and told the reader it is a popular musical.
You can also start with a hook that challenges the audience’s expectations of a familiar production. For example, in this review of “The Little Shop of Horrors”, the reviewer begins with the line: “Not many musicals will issue you with a sing-a-long book with the lyrics to chorus numbers so you can join in, but this interactive production of The Little Shop of Horrors has a few surprises in store.”This hook works because it tells you that the play is a unique take on a classic production and is interactive.

Don't: write an exciting hook that has nothing to do with the rest of your review.Do: take risks with bold statements or an unusual opening.


, The introductory paragraph should cover basic information about the play, including:


The full title of the play.
Where did you see the show? Name the theater or setting where you saw the play.
When did you see the show? Maybe it was opening night, or the last week of the show’s run. Be specific about the exact date you saw the show.
Who wrote the show? Who directed the show? Name the playwright, the director, and the name of the production company.
If the show is a re staging of an existing play, such as “The Little Shop of Horrors” or “Hamlet”, you should note this in your introduction. If the show is a new or original production, you should also note this.

, Briefly summarize the plot of the play, including the setting, the main characters, and the story arc of the characters. Try to keep the summary to one or two lines. You should give the reader just enough information to get a general sense of the play’s plot.For example, you may summarize the plot of “The Little Shop of Horrors” with: “The Little Shop of Horrors is such an entertaining musical because of its hilarious plot involving a plant which grows to an incredible size and the romantic love story of Seymour and Audrey.”, React to the performers playing the characters in the play. Use their real names and their character names. Write about the acting based on questions such as:Were the performers believable? Did their relationships or chemistry with the other characters seem natural and appropriate? Did the performers stay in character throughout the play?
Did the performers have a vocal quality (volume and articulation) that fit the context of the play? Did their body movements and gestures stay true to the character they were playing?
Were the performers engaging and interesting to watch? If so, why did you find them engaging?
For example, in your review of “The Little Shop of Horrors” you may note: “The main credits of this production go to the lead roles Cath Snowball (as Audrey) and Chris Rushmere York as Seymour who created a really tangible but very shy and coy chemistry.”Don't: discuss an actor's personal appearance or insult to the point of cruelty.Do: describe misguided or failed performances honestly.


, The design elements are a big part of a production and should be discussed in detail in your review. Focus your analysis on:The set and the props: Did they establish the correct mood for the play? Did they add to the development of the characters, the plot, and the setting? Were they convincing and well-made?
Did the blocking on stage make sense? Blocking means how the actors are positioned on stage within the set. Were there any awkward movements by the actors on stage? Did the set help or hinder the performances?
The lighting: Did the lights convey a mood that fit with the tone of the play? Did they draw attention to characters or props that seemed important in the play?
The costumes and the make up: Did the costumes and the make up of the performers suit the time period of the show? Was there a unique approach to the costumes or the make up that affected the context of the play?
The sound: How did the music, if any, contribute to the show’s mood? Were there sound effects used in the show, and if so, how did they add to the production? If you are reviewing a musical, you should note if there was a live orchestra or if the music was pre recorded, and how that affected the tone of the play overall.
Try to be as detailed as possible in your discussion of the design elements. For example, in a review of “The Little Shop of Horrors”, you may note: “A quirky directorial decision was to have the props and cast in grey scale. These performers were caked in grey and black make up to contrast the monstrous green plant as it ate people alive, growing bigger and bigger as the play went on.”, Here is where your final critique should be in the review. Avoid clichéd phrases like “the play was bad” or “the production wasn’t very entertaining.” Instead state your opinion of the performance as a whole, and show why your response to the play is valid and significant. The rest of your review should support your overall judgment of the play.Note if the audience seemed attentive and interested throughout the performance. Also point to any possible adjustments or changes that could have been made to the production to make it stronger or more engaging.
For example, you may note: “Though the production was clearly taking some creative risks by having all the performers in grey scale, not bringing in bright green plants for the show-stopping “Something Green” number felt like a missed opportunity to capitalize on this contrast.”
Leave your reader with a clear sense of your opinion on the play and with more questions than answers about the play. For example, you may wrap up your review of “The Little Shop of Horrors” with: “This new production takes some creative risks and emphasizes the singing skills of the performers, who manage to pull off this tale of love and a monster plant with passion and conviction.”

Decide on your subject matter.,
Choose a format.,
Outline your book.,
Conduct the necessary research.,
Treat each chapter like a work of fiction.,
Stick to a writing schedule.,
Produce your first draft.",How to Write Non Fiction2," Unlike an essay, which can either stick to one single topic or expand into other related topics, a nonfiction book should be focused on one specific subject. That subject may be some particular aspect of your life (with a specific time and place), or it may be about other people/places that interest you. It doesn't necessarily have to be your story like a personal essay. It's up to you to decide what subject matter you find most meaningful, and find interesting ways to talk about that subject.Think about the things that you find most captivating.
Unlike a personal essay, you do not have to be the main subject of a nonfiction book (though you can be!).
As you consider your subject matter, remember that you'll need to be able to write a whole book about that subject. Think about whether you'd be able to say that much about a subject before you commit to it.

, There are a few different ways to write a nonfiction book. Which format you choose depends largely on the subject matter. Before you start writing your book, it's best to think about what format would work best for the type of book you're imagining for yourself. Some examples include:A memoir (from the French word for ""memory/reminiscence"") is a detailed retelling of some part of your life. Unlike an autobiography, which can cover a whole life, a memoir is usually rooted in a specific theme, event, or time and place in your life.A travelogue discusses a place and its people, culture, and/or food. It tends to be very heavily based upon the author's experience and therefore is a subjective personal account (unlike a travel guide, which seeks to objectively convey information without any personal experience).Nature and environmental writing should revolve around a personal experience with nature. The writing should ultimately promote some degree of awareness of current environmental issues and should ideally foster a sense of wonder, adventure, and advocacy in readers.A biography is a retelling of someone else's life, and it may cover a specific time period (like a memoir of someone else's life) or that person's entire life. Biographies can be captivating narrative reenactments of a person's life, and can really bring the subject's story to life.If you have a series of related personal essays, you can organize them into a book-length essay collection.

, Once you've narrowed down your topic and chosen a format, you'll want to outline the project. Some writers find it helpful to narrow down what each individual chapter will cover during the outlining phase. This is not a hard-and-fast rule, but you may find it helpful. At the very least you should have a simple structure (even a list) that lays out what you would like to include in your book. This way you won't forget about those aspects when you're immersed in the actual writing of the book.Think about where you could best begin your book, and what the logical conclusion of that story should be. If writing a biography, for example, the book might end with a retelling of the subject's death.
If you're writing a memoir, the book should adequately frame the chosen time and place in your life. It's up to you to decide where the logical conclusion of that part of your life should be, and how to tell it best.
If you're writing a travelogue, you'll need to include details about yourself, as well as where, when, why, and how you traveled. You should make yourself easy to relate to for readers and write in a way that brings your experience to life on the page.When writing about nature or the environment, you'll need to show a genuine engagement with nature (ideally through some form of outdoor activity), balance nature facts with your subjective thoughts and feelings, and show a level of curiosity that makes everyday objects in nature seem new and exciting., Every nonfiction book requires some research, whether that entails actual encyclopedic research or simple interviews with others.Even if you're writing a memoir, you'll want to ask other people about their memories of that time/place/event so you can cross-check your own memories.


If you're writing a biography, you will most likely need a lot of factual information. This may require reading through textbooks and other biographies, or even visits to a museum or historical society.
If you're writing a memoir, talk to other people who knew you during that time (ideally a close relative, friend, or someone who was with you as you experienced that part of your life). You'd be amazed at how many details you've forgotten, misremembered, or completely fabricated.
A travelogue should draw heavily upon your notes and journals from the trip, but you'll also need to conduct research on the subjects you write about. For example, you'll want to learn as much as possible about the culture and people of that region, the food most frequently associated with that culture, etc.
A nature or environmental project should involve researching the names and descriptions of the plants, animals, and geographic areas you describe. You may also want to research how ecosystems work together in complex and unique ways in the areas you write about.

, Treating the book like a work of fiction does not mean fictionalizing the story. Rather, it means employing the skills and tools that fiction writers use.Create scenes within your essay or book, the same way a fiction writer would portray a scene in a short story or novel.
Think of the people in your nonfiction essay/book as characters. Are they fully developed on the page, and do readers get a good sense of their overall personalities?
Write strong dialogue. No one can remember the exact, word-for-word transcript of every conversation they've ever had, but your recollection of conversations should be as truthful as possible and written in a way that's easy to follow.

, Writing schedules are invaluable to every writer, but they're pretty much a necessity when you're writing a book-length project. Consider your designated writing time an extension of your job - you'll need to show up and do your work, no matter how you feel or what other distractions may present themselves.Make sure you work in a quiet place where you won't be distracted or disturbed.
You can measure your writing time temporally (by how many hours have passed), or by word or page count.
Be consistent with your schedule. It doesn't necessarily have to be every day, but it should be the same days and the same times, week in and week out.

, Remember that no one's first draft is perfect, and that includes now-famous authors. The well-polished works of nonfiction you love so much were re-written and revised many times until everything fit perfectly into place. Be patient and don't get discouraged.


Focus on larger issues as you hammer out your first draft. You can correct line-level issues during the revision/editing process.
Make sure everything is tied up by the end of the book. Don't leave anything unresolved, and make sure the reader will have a sense of closure and completion by the end of your book.

"
Write an informational book.,
Put together an academic book.,
Compose an instructive book.",How to Write Non Fiction3," Informational books are somewhat similar to how-to books. However, instead of providing step-by-step guidance, an informational book might simply cover a subject thoroughly enough that the average reader could walk away having learned something.If you're going to write an informational book, you'll need to know a lot about that subject. Most informational books are written by experts in that field.
If you're not an expert, that's okay. You'll just need to make up for it with exceptional and extensive research.
Informational writing should provide readers with clear definitions of terms, detailed descriptions of what something is and how it works, and information on how to engage with that object (using it, finding it, etc.).Make sure you'll be able to write a whole book on the subject you've chosen. Again, you don't need to know everything about that subject, but it should be something that can be written about at length if you want to fill a whole book.

, An academic book is usually written with the intent of being used as a scholarly textbook. This means that any academic book you write will need to be fact checked, proofread, and cover every aspect of that subject. Extensive and exhausting research should also go into any book that will be used for academic purposes.Think about the intended audience/readership for your book. You'd write a much shorter and easier to read book on history for elementary school or middle school students than you would for a graduate course, for example.
Academic texts should be written formally, avoiding any slang or colloquialisms. Academic writing should also include complex language that is technical and specialized when necessary.You'll need to make connections clear to the reader so that seemingly disparate concepts are explicitly related and clarified.
Remember that your textbook will be influencing the minds of countless students. Having any errors, omissions, or personal bias on the subject could affect those students' educational potential.
An example of an academic book would be a history or biology book.

, There are several different types of instructive nonfiction books. Two of the most common include how-to guides and cookbooks. Though very different in subject matter, both books must deliver complex information in simple, step-by-step instructions for readers of every possible background.Writing an instructive book will require a good deal of research as well, but it will be research that will help you relay steps in a project (rather than research that will create the definitive book of World History, for example).
An instructive book should break down the basic concepts of a project, define any unique terms, and give readers a thorough, step-by-step guide on how to complete that project.
Do your research, talk to experts, and take extensive notes. Then, when the time comes, you'll be able to break down those notes (informed by the research you've done) into a simple how-to guide.
An example of an instructional book might be a hunting guide, written for someone who's never been hunting before. The book will need to explain the ins and outs of hunting, from its most basic concepts to the most complex ways of preparing the meat, for example.

Prepare the proposal package.,
Research editors.,
Submit your book pitch to the editors who have an interest in the subject you are writing about.",How to Pitch a Non Fiction Book to an Editor,"


Unlike a pitch for a work of fiction, a non-fiction book does not have to be completely written before you pitch it to an editor. You can prepare your proposal after writing 3 to 5 chapters. While a fiction proposal consists of a 1 page query letter describing the story and the author's background, your non-fiction book pitch will include several components.
Overview: The overview or query letter is a brief 2 to 3 page introduction that informs the editor about the subject of your book, provides some information about you as an author, and describes your target audience.
Proposal: Your proposal page should include the expected length of your completed book and the planned date of completion. You may also include a short explanation of how your book is different from similar ones currently in the market.
Synopsis: The synopsis is a 2 to 3 page summary of your book as a whole including the primary theme, the questions it will answer for the reader, and how the material will be helpful to your reading audience.
Author Biography: Your biography should include the qualifications and experience that make you the right person to write the book you are pitching. Your biography should answer 2 questions: why are you writing the book, and what makes you qualified to write the book. Include the titles of other books you have written. In this section, you will also report your promotional experience such as television, radio, and print media interviews and appearances as well as seminars and/or speeches you have presented.
Marketing: This section should include research you have conducted on your potential audience including who your audience is and what they will get out of your book offers. Focus on a narrow audience that your book can be marketed to directly.
Competition: Choose 4 to 5 books on the same topic as yours, list the title, author, publisher, page number and price of the books and write a summary that includes an explanation of how your book will be different from each one.
Outline: The outline consists of a table of contents and a summary of each individual chapter of the book. Also include a description of any charts, illustrations, tables, etc. that will be a part of the completed book.
Sample Chapters: The final component of your book proposal is the inclusion of 3 sample chapters. Be sure to include the first chapter and 2 of your strongest chapters that will provide the editor with a solid understanding of your book.;
,


Read the dedication pages of books that are similar to yours and identify the editors who worked with the authors. You can also search for editors in writer's directories that list book publishers and the names of editors who work for them. Research the editors on the publisher's website and gather current contact information, submission guidelines (whether they want pitches sent via email, regular mail or through an online submission form), and information on the subject areas they are interested in publishing.
Create a list of editors along with their contact information and submission guidelines. You will refer to this list when sending out copies of your book pitch.

,


Send your complete book proposal package to the editors on the list you compiled during your research. Make sure you have proofread and edited every page of your package. Include your contact information (name, addresses, telephone number and email address) on every page of your proposal and a self addressed stamped envelop for the return of your proposal if the submission guidelines require a hard copy. Digital submissions will either be submitted through an online form or as an attachment to an email.
Be persistent in submitting your book pitch to editors. Send your proposal to all of the editors on your list. While you are waiting for responses to your proposal, add editors to your submissions list as you continue to research books similar to yours.
A response to your book pitch can take 4 to 6 weeks. If you have not heard from an editor within that length of time, send him or her a short email or letter to inquire about your proposal and when you can expect to receive a response.

Summarize the subject's most memorable actions.,
Describe the subject's impact.,
Discuss the subject's legacy.",How to Write a Conclusion for a Biography1," The conclusion of a biography should remind the reader of the subject’s achievements or actions. Briefly describe their greatest achievements so that the reader can remember why it is beneficial to learn about their life.A conclusion in Jane Austen’s biography, for example, should mention that she wrote six novels, some of which are regarded among the memorable and influential works of English literature.;
, It is important to describe the impact the subject had during their lifetime.If their actions caused political reform, describe the laws, changes, or conflicts that that took place because of their actions. If they enacted important societal changes, mention how their actions changed the cultural mindset.


A biography about Martin Luther, the sixteenth-century monk who lead the Protestant Reformation, should mention his impact on the development of religious beliefs throughout Europe. Not only did he challenge the ruling Catholic Church, but he made the Bible more accessible to all individuals, not just the clergy. A conclusion should mention that his actions influenced religious beliefs during the Renaissance., If your subject’s work, actions, or opinions had a wide-reaching influence that impacted future generations, mention that in the conclusion. Perhaps their work lead to the development of laws that are still in use today, or perhaps their opinions helped eradicate unfair societal norms.


A biography of Susan B. Anthony, for example, could mention that her actions and beliefs influenced generations of women and their continued fight for gender equality.
A conclusion of the biography of Albert Einstein could mention that his theories and publications have influenced the development of quantum theory and generations of scientists who work toward unifying his theories of the universe.A biography of author Upton Sinclair could mention that his novel The Jungle influenced the American public health system and helped create laws for regulating the food and drug industries."
"
Set your work aside for a while before revising/editing.,
Read your draft out loud.,
Make sure everything is resolved by the end.,
Ask a trusted friend or colleague to read through your manuscript.,
Find areas that need expansion and/or clarification.,
Cut anything that's not necessary.",How to Write Non Fiction4," Whenever you need to edit or revise any piece of writing, it's best to let it sit in a drawer or on your desktop for a short while first. Jumping right into the editing and/or revision stage can make it much more difficult to polish your piece of writing into a masterpiece, in part because you're still very attached to the work you've done and the details are still very clear in your head (meaning you're not approaching it like a reader would).Give yourself anywhere from a few days to a few weeks after finishing the project before you attempt to revise/edit your work.
If you try to edit/revise right away, you'll be less likely to notice issues within the writing (typos/errors, as well as things that aren't clear or don't make sense), and you'll have a harder time cutting things that aren't necessary.

, Your brain is hardwired to connect patterns without even thinking about whether anything is missing. It's why you're able to read short notes upside down, for example, without having to turn the page right-side up. The same is true of typos and missing words in a sentence: you are so familiar with the concept you're writing about (and subsequently reading about) that you might not even notice that you left out some vital part.Read your draft slowly out loud to yourself.
Take your time and circle, highlight, or otherwise mark anything that is incorrect or incomplete. Don't make revisions as you read, though, or you could lose your place many times.
As you read, make sure you're only reading what you've written on the page, word for word.
In addition to typos and incomplete thoughts, look for any sentences that trip you up or confuse you as you read aloud. These sentences should also be marked for revision.
Once you've gotten through the whole thing (or a good chunk of it, like an entire chapter), go through and make the necessary changes.

, Resolving things doesn't mean that all the problems you or others experienced throughout the book are suddenly gone. By resolving things in your book, you should be making sure that all loose ends are tied up, so to speak. Nothing should be confusing or unfulfilled for the reader, and the reader should finish the last page of your essay or book and know that the nonfiction story you've told is complete.


This is another aspect of why approaching the work after a short intermission will give you the best results. You may not realize that something hasn't been resolved because you've connected all the dots in your head (which a reader obviously can't do).

, Having someone else's eyes looking over your work is a great way to catch errors and omissions in your writing. As you write an essay or a book of nonfiction, you probably have a clear picture in your head of what your project is going to cover, as well as what the final product will look like. This is good for keeping you on track, but it can also color your reading of the final product.


If something hasn't been fully explained or resolved, you're less likely to notice it than an outside reader. Your mind will fill in the gaps precisely because you were the author and you know what you meant to say.
Ask your friend to help you proofread your manuscript for typos, errors, and other line-level problems.
Let your friend know that you want honest, critical assessment (not just praise).

, As you revise your essay or book, you'll most likely find sections that are not as complete as they could or should be. As you wrote your manuscript, that section no doubt made sense to you, in part because your mind was able to fill in the gaps and connect the subject to other larger ideas that weren't explicitly written. A reader will not have those gaps filled in, though, and will require some further explanation and elaboration.If anything was rushed through or not fully explored, revisit that section and think about ways to flesh out the subject so it's more comprehensive.
Rearrange certain sections to see if they can complement one another. A sparsely-written section may end up being much fuller and more complete by being rearranged near another section.

, As you revise and edit your writing, you'll need to make some tough choices on what stays and what goes. You will likely be very fond of your own writing, so this part of the process can be difficult - which is why it's so important to set aside your writing before you attempt to edit or revise a manuscript you've completed.Use clear, concise language. Cut out any flowery prose that distracts from the rest of your book or essay.
No matter how fond you are of the way a sentence sounds, if it is not necessary or relevant, it shouldn't make the final cut.

Humanize the subject.,
Mention their challenges.,
Describe their hobbies or passions.",How to Write a Conclusion for a Biography2," Sometimes reading about important figures or influential people can make the subject appear unrelatable to the reader. Use your conclusion to briefly mention personal details, stories, or accounts that you mentioned throughout the biography. Bringing these personal details into the conclusion can make the subject more accessible to the reader.Discuss how they loved visiting their grandmother, or mention that their favorite place was a quiet cabin in the mountains.

, While reading a biography, the reader may forget that each person has had their own difficulties and personal struggles to overcome. If a subject has been greatly influenced by a personal tragedy or was fired from several jobs during their lifetime, consider mentioning that in the conclusion.


The late Nelson Mandela led an influential, prominent, and successful life as a South African activist and former president. Although he earned many awards and honors, he admitted that he was not a very good student when he was trying to earn a law degree.A reader may be able to better understand that Nelson Mandela had to work hard during his life.

, If the subject’s hobbies, passions, or interests played an important role in their life, incorporate that into the conclusion. Perhaps reading particular books inspired them to write their own popular novel, or maybe their love for animals inspired them to work to protect endangered animals.Weave their personal interests into the conclusion by acknowledging how those interests influenced their work or life decisions.

Recap your key points.,
Refrain from introducing new ideas or details.,
Cite brief examples to support your thesis.,
Use direct quotes from your subject to strengthen your thesis.,
Avoid using transitional phrases.,
Provide closure.",How to Write a Conclusion for a Biography3," Your thesis, or the main point or claim, most likely guided how you organized the biography. To remind the reader of your thesis, summarize its key points within the conclusion.Reminding the reader of your thought process will help make a stronger case for your thesis and help the reader understand the goal of the biography.


Briefly remind the audience of the key points that influenced your thesis. Perhaps your subject moved a lot as a child, and you believe the subject’s bestselling novels were influenced by this. Point out that the main character in the novel is often on the go, and that was the basis for your thesis.

, Do not use the conclusion to add new details, facts, or stories that were not referenced in the biography.Introducing new information at this point may confuse the reader or leave them with unanswered questions. Focus on referencing information that you already discussed.

, The biography’s main idea should be reinforced and supported in the conclusion. Briefly remind the reader of the evidence you provided in the biography. Use the biography’s themes, patterns, or messages to support your thesis.


If you believed that the subject’s actions later in life were a result of their experiences during war, briefly reassert what major decisions you think were affected. Perhaps they participated in anti-war protests, founded an organization that promotes peace, and worked to uphold human rights. Make a note that their actions revolved around establishing peace.
Remind the reader what makes the subject unique or special and what life events demonstrate these qualities., Pull quotes from the subject’s letters, interviews, or essays to support your thesis or your belief in their impact.Choose a pertinent quotation, but do not take a quote out of context simply to add strength to your thesis., Avoid including phrases like, “in conclusion,” “therefore,” and “finally” in your conclusion. Phrases such as these may make the reader feel as though the ending is abrupt and has been hurried along. Try to leave your reader with an ending that seems natural.Instead of saying, ""in conclusion,"" try to provide your reader with a subtle transition instead. Conclude by saying, ""Because of the magic and popularity of her novels, I believe that J.K. Rowling will continue to influence young readers for generations to come.""

, Give the reader a satisfactory and fulfilling conclusion by offering them a sense of closure. Revisit the opening scene from the biography so the reader can experience it again now that they have more information. Reiterate a key event, important publication, or central accomplishment that encapsulates their life story.Conclude with a sense of hope or continued progress. Allow your reader to imagine that this person’s life story will continue influence the lives of others. If your subject is still alive, for example, provide a hopeful ending by saying “Elizabeth continues to fight for the rights of those who have been repressed by being a vocal leader in the United States Senate.”

Do a script read-through, and try to perform a small show.

",How to Write a Play Based on a Book," This will allow you to get a taste for the plot, to know the story and to even decide whether it's deserving of being transferred to the stage.;
, This time focus only on the characters. Are these characters going to turn into good characters on stage? Are they believable, enjoyable, interesting, etc.?


Create a ""cast"" of actors/actresses that would be good with the roles. These could be people you want to work with and know already, or maybe even actors you know from real celebrities if you're going to pitch the play more widely.

, Are all of the props doable within your budget or within the realm of stagecraft? In particular, make sure the book isn't totally outlandish or only in the realm of screen special effects. While you can make people fly in plays as well as many other things, it's a little harder to make lightening fly from their hands or have them rescue people in distress from skyscrapers. If you're interested in transferring a more fantastical book, you may want to try making a film instead.

, You may need to add some lines, as books can get away with explaining things without a character talking about it, but try to make it sound natural.


Don't quote the book exactly. While you want to make the play as close to the real story as possible, don't just take the dialogue from the book and stick it into your script. Often this won't work well and you will need to be more creative to bring the dialogue to life.

, We see it in the movies all the time and plenty of people hate it, but this is what makes a book adaptation more interesting than just a retelling of the book. If you're writing a play out of a classic that has been turned into a play, film, or musical many times before (e.g. Alice in Wonderland) you can make more changes than if you were making this play out of a really modern, new book (e.g. the Twilight series) and even add characters.

, If you are planning on making this a public performance, many people will be unhappy if their favorite characters are acting in ways that they would never act. Read the parts in the book where the character plays a large role and see how they deal with events. This way, you can make them react to your own events in a way that isn't completely unbelievable.


Avoid creating Mary Sues.

,, Keep in mind that if this is a very obscure book that only you and a few friends know about, you should be listening to what the friends who have not read it have to say because they represent the main portion of the audience. Likewise, you would do the opposite if the play is based on a very popular book like Harry Potter.

, Obviously, include a copy of the play for the author to read through. Also explain whether you're performing it as an amateur or whether you have wider commercial intentions, as this will affect the author's decision. If they say yes, congratulations! You are a playwright!

Decide what to write about.,
Choose your character(s).,
Think of a situation.,
Sometimes it helps to pick a word or a sentence you want to put in that one shot.",How to Write a One Shot," It can be romantic, dramatic or whatever you want it to be.;
, It's easier to pick people from a fandom (for example Harry Potter) because then you don't have to describe them. If you want to write a prose one-shot you should use simple characters, but if you do and if you wanna write a description - keep it short.


Going into details about your characters would be better suited for a chaptered story, so if you find yourself heading down this path, don't be afraid to break that ""one-shot"" up into chapters.

, It could be a first kiss, a car crash, a dream, etc. Make this situation real, and write down the emotions of your main character so that your readers can feel them.

, You can build your story around it, and it can be your inspiration.

Brainstorm ideas.,
Create a one line story summary.,
Study other musicals for inspiration.,
Determine the emotional core of the story.,
Make storyboards.,
Write the music.,
Create the lyrics for the songs.,
Put the music and the story together.,
Run through the musical.,
Add in stage directions.,
Get actors to perform the musical.",How to Write a Musical," Start by sitting down and writing out a few ideas for the musical. Think about a question or problem you can address in the musical, such as “What is love?” or “How does it feel to be an outsider?” You can also think about a personal experience that upset you, unsettled you, or made you question your values. This experience could serve as the inspiration for the musical.Consider why an idea might work better in the musical format than in the short story or novel format. Music and singing need to feel necessary to the story idea in some way. For example, you may realize that you can only tell the story of your parents’ meeting in New York in the 70s through the music they loved in that time period.
You may also try going for a walk in a park or sitting in a public square to get inspiration. Watch people interact and notice any behaviors or actions that seem interesting to you. You could then create a storyline based on the lives of other people in your everyday life.
Try to choose a story idea that you are truly passionate about. Having a story that you really care about can help you stay motivated to write the musical and see it performed one day on stage.;
, Once you have a story idea, you should try to create a one line summary so you have a clear sense of the story. Try to answer the question, “What is the story about?” Focus less on character names and more on the dramatic moment in the main character’s lives that create the story.For example, a one line story summary for the musical Fiddler on the Roof could be, “A Jewish peasant tries to marry off three of his daughters and deal with anti-Semitic values that threaten his village and their way of life.”
This summary includes the major plot points of the musical and also includes key themes, such as “a way of life” and “anti-Semitism”, that play out in the musical.

, To get inspiration for your musical and come up with a story idea, you should study other musicals. Go to musicals, read musicals on the page, and study the ways in which they combine song, music, and dialogue to create an effective show for the audience. You may read and watch a production of several classic musicals, including:Cats
Fiddler on the Roof
The Phantom of the Opera
My Fair Lady
Sweeney Todd
Guys and Dolls
Hamilton

, Once you have the story idea, think about what is at the heart of your story. Ask yourself, “What are the themes in the story?” “What larger issues does the story address?” Identifying the emotional core of the story will help you focus your writing and create content that addresses the emotional aspect of the musical.For example, the musical Sweeney Todd is, at the surface, about a Victorian barber out to kill the men who stole his wife and sent him to prison on false charges. But at the heart, the musical is about the high cost of revenge and how anger and resentment can ruin your present day life.

, One way to help you write the musical is to create storyboards or visual representations of each scene. You can draw on regular sheets of paper or get larger paper to write on. Storyboarding each scene can help you get a better sense of your character’s actions and motivations. It can also make it easier to write the music and the songs for the musical.You may try writing down a rough list of scenes for the musical and then creating storyboards for each scene. Try to get the essential visual elements for each scene on the storyboard. Don’t be afraid to use many storyboards for each scene, as the more detailed you are, the more depth the musical will have.

, The most important element of a musical is the musical score. There are four types of musicals: all-sung, operas, integrated, and unintegrated. Musicals that are all-sung means there is no dialogue at all and the entire script is sung. Operas are also all sung. The most popular form is integrated, where the music and the dialogue are integrated together in one show.If you have written music before, you may try writing music for each scene that you have storyboarded. Or you may start by writing one to two pieces that you feel are key to the musical, such as the musical theme for the show.
You may also try using music writing software on your computer that helps you translate humming, singing, or whistling into written music. This may be ideal if you have never composed music before but are musically inclined and want to somehow translate your ideas into a score.

, You may be able to write the music and the lyrics for the musical, especially if you know the story well and feel confident about your music writing abilities. If you are not musically inclined, you may look for a writing partner who is skilled at composing music for the stage. Many musicals have been written in pairs or teams, with one person writing the music and one person writing the lyrics.Once you have written the music for the musical, you should create a list of songs. Notice if you have more songs than scenes in the musical. Having many songs is not a bad thing, but you want to be sure that the musical flows well from dialogue to song and from scene to scene.

, Organize the musical so there are scenes, music, and lyrics in the same document. Order the music within the scenes of the musical so it all feels cohesive and well put together. Check that you have smooth transitions from spoken dialogue to a song.For example, you may notice that you have a scene between a father and daughter, followed by a song that is sung by the daughter. You should make sure the song relates somehow to the scene and that the daughter addresses her relationship with her father in the song. This will make the musical flow smoothly.

, Do this on your own or with a friend. If possible, get access to a piano or a musical instrument that is important in the musical score. Then, read all the dialogue out loud and sing the songs to the tune of the musical instrument. Notice how the dialogue and the songs sound aloud. Pay attention to any dialogue that feels confusing or clumsy. Check that the songs relate to the dialogue in someway and sound polished.


You may underline or mark any sections that feel off to you. You can then go back and revise them so until they are at their best.

, Stage directions tell the actors where they are situated on stage and how they are approaching a scene or a song. Keep the stage directions concise and to the point. Do not include stage direction that feels long winded or convoluted.For example, if you want to notate that there is going to be a musical number in a scene, you would add in “Music starts playing (insert musical number here)” into the script. This will signal to the actors that a song is going to be performed.
You should also include details about where the actors enter from into a scene, such as STAGE RIGHT or STAGE LEFT.
You should include notes about a character’s reaction, but only if it is an important reaction in the scene. For example, “VELMA (aghast) How could you do that?” or “JOHN (crying) I can’t sing anymore.”

, Once you have a polished script, you should try to have it performed on stage. You may contact actors in your area and hire them to perform the musical at your local theater. Or you may try to get the musical performed by a prominent theater company in your area.


You may also seek out actors and playwrights who have had success to get advice on how you can get your musical produced.

Have an actor perform the monologue for you.",How to Write a Monologue for a Play," The monologue should be from the perspective of one character in the play. Focusing on the point of view of one character can help to give the monologue purpose and a distinct character voice.You may decide to write a monologue for the main character of the play to give him/her the chance to speak on their own, separate of the other characters. Or, you may write a monologue for a minor character who has not had much stage time to give them a chance to finally express themselves.;
, You should also consider what the purpose of the monologue is, as it should serve a key purpose within the rest of the play. The monologue should reveal something to the audience that cannot be revealed through dialogue or character interaction. This could be a story, a secret, an answer to an ongoing questions in the play, or an emotional release by a character. Your monologue should serve a clear purpose and act as a revelation for the speaker.The monologue should also up the stakes of the play in some way. It should add tension, conflict, or emotion to the rest of the play and give the audience new insight into an issue or problem that already existed in the play.
For example, perhaps there is a character in your play who has been mute through the entire first act. You may then write a monologue allowing her to speak and reveal the reason why she is mute. This may then up the stakes for the second act of the play, as the audience now has the knowledge of why the character is mute.

, You should determine who your speaker will be talking to or addressing in the monologue so you can frame the monologue with the audience in mind. The monologue may be addressed to a specific character in the play, the speaker may be addressing themselves, or they may be addressing the audience.You may decide to use the monologue to address a specific character, especially if the speaker has emotions or feelings they want to express to a certain character in the play. It may also be useful to use the monologue as a way for the character to express their own thoughts or feelings about an event in the play for the benefit of the audience.

, A good monologue will have a clear beginning, middle and end. Like a mini story, the monologue should also include a clear shift from the beginning to the end, where the speaker has a revelation or a realization. Your monologue should begin and end with purpose.You may create an outline that includes a rough beginning, middle, and end for the monologue. You may jot down roughly what will occur in each stage of the monologue. For example, you may write: “Beginning: Elena the mute speaks. Middle: She tells us why and how she became mute. Ending: She realizes she prefers staying silent to saying her thoughts out loud.”
Another option is to create a beginning line and an ending line for the monologue. You may then create the content between the beginning and the ending to generate ideas and thoughts for the monologue.

, You can get a better sense of structure for your monologue by reading example monologues. These monologues have been written with the larger play in mind but they can also stand on their own as contained dramatic pieces. Several examples include:


Hamlet’s monologue in Shakespeare’s Hamlet.The Duchess of Berwick’s monologue in Oscar Wilde’s Lady Windermere’s Fan.Jean’s monologue in August Strindberg’s Miss Julie.Christy’s monologue in John Millington Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World.“My Princesa” monologue by Antonia Rodriguez., Your monologue should get the listener’s attention right away and draw them in. You want to hook your audience so they are willing to listen to your character’s monologue. The opening line of your monologue will set the tone for the rest of the piece and give the audience a sense of the character voice’s and language.You may start the monologue with a big revelation right away, such as Christy’s monologue in John Millington Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World.It begins: “Up to the day I killed my father, there wasn't a person in Ireland knew the kind I was, and I there drinking, waking, eating, sleeping, a quiet, simple poor fellow with no man giving me heed.”
This monologue tells the audience right away that the speaker killed his father. It then discusses the events leading up to the killing and how the speaker feels about his actions.

, The monologue should be written from the perspective of one character and should feature their unique language and voice. A strong character voice in a monologue can go a long way to adding color, interest, and perspective to the piece. Use your character’s voice when you write the monologue and include any slang or particular phrasing they might use.For example, the “My Princesa” monologue by Antonia Rodriguez is written from the perspective of a Latino father. The character uses terms, slang, and sayings that are specific to his perspective, such as “whoop his ass”, “I wanna know”, and “Oh hell naw!” These elements make the monologue engaging and adds character detail.
Another example is The Duchess of Berwick’s monologue in Oscar Wilde’s Lady Windermere’s Fan.The monologue has a more conversational, chatty tone and the character voice seems to simply be talking to the audience casually. Wilde uses the character’s voice to reveal plot and keep the audience engaged.

, Many monologues discuss the present action of the play by reflecting back on past events. You should strive to have a balance between reflection on the past and discussion of the present in your monologue. The past details should illuminate an event or character dilemma in the present. The character should try to use memory to address an issue in the present.For example, Christy’s monologue in John Millington Synge’s The Playboy of the Western Worldtries to address his murder of his father by reflecting back on his past life. He discusses past decisions and moments that may have lead to his pivotal decision.

, Keep in mind your audience will not have the luxury of flipping to a visual image of what is happening in the monologue. All they can rely on is the words you use in the monologue to describe a certain moment or a certain detail. You should try to tie in as many of senses as you can in your monologue so the audience becomes immersed in the events in the monologue.For example, Jean’s monologue in August Strindberg’s Miss Julieopens with striking images of Jean’s childhood, “I lived in a hovel provided by the state, with seven brothers and sisters and a pig; out on a barren stretch where nothing grew, not even a tree, but from the window I could see the Count's park walls with apple trees rising above them.”
The specific details in the monologue really help to paint a picture of Jean’s childhood “hovel”, complete with a pig. These details also add to Jean’s character and help the reader get a better sense of his past, or backstory.

, Your monologue should include a moment of discovery or a revelation. This could be a moment of discovery for the speaker or a moment of discovery for the audience. Having a revelation in the monologue will give it purpose. The revelation should also up the stakes of the play so it contributes to the play as a whole.For example, in Christy’s monologue in John Millington Synge’s The Playboy of the Western Worldthe speaker reveals to the audience that his father was not a very considerate person or a very good father. He then acknowledges that he did the world a favor by killing his father, a disturbing but matter-of-fact revelation.

, The monologue should have a clear ending or a button ending, where the thoughts expressed in the monologue are brought to a conclusion. The speaker should accept something, overcome an issue or obstacle, or make a decision about a conflict in the play. The decision moment should be clear and the speaker should speak with decisive action by the end of the monologue.For example, in Jean’s monologue in August Strindberg’s Miss Juliethe speaker reveals that he tried to kill himself out of anguish for being born too low to be with Miss Julie. Despite his attempt, he lived. Jean then ends the monologue with a reflection on what he learned about his feelings for Miss Julie: “You were unattainable, but through the vision of you I was made to realize how hopeless it was to rise above the conditions of my birth.”

, An effective monologue will not be too long or expansive. It should include the essentials of the monologue and hit the reader with just enough information to move the play forward. You should read over the monologue and revise it so it does not seem long-winded or overdone.Remove any redundant lines or awkward phrases. Cut out any words that do not add to the character’s voice or language. Try to include only the essential details in the monologue.

, A monologue is written to be read out loud to an audience so you should test its effectiveness by reading it out to yourself or to a sympathetic audience. You should listen to ensure the monologue has a distinct character voice and uses language that suits the speaker.


You should also note moments where the monologue is confusing or too wordy. Simplify these areas so the monologue is easy to follow for the listener.

, If possible, you should try to find an actor who can perform the monologue with you as the audience. You may ask a friend to perform the monologue or hire an actor. Getting a professional to read your monologue can help bring it to life and allow you to revise it for the stage.

Do not over-quote.",How to Write a Character Analysis," For a character analysis assignment in school, your character may be assigned to you. But if you get to choose, make sure you only consider characters who play a dynamic role in the story. Those characters who appear flat (one dimensional - someone who is only good or only bad and has no complex motivations to consider) are not good choices for a character analysis.For example, if you are reading Mark Twain's classic Huckleberry Finn, you might consider choosing Huck or the runaway slave, Jim, because they are dynamic characters who show a wide range of emotion, who often act in unpredictable ways, and who move the plot forward with their actions.
It might be less effective to choose the duke or the king, the tricksters Huck and Jim meet in Arkansas, because they have fairly minor roles in the story, they don't show a wide range of emotions, and, more than anything, they're simply stock characters (the story needs a humorous detour and a way for Jim and Huck to be separated, so that Huck can have his infamous All right, then, I'll go to hell! moment, and the duke and the king fulfill that role).;
, Even if you've read the story before, you need to read it again because you'll notice new things now that you have a specific task in mind. Notice every place that your character appears and consider the following:


How does the author describe them?

For the Huck Finn example, you might think about how Huck is described as a backwoods boy, but he clearly wrestles with larger issues that have complex social implications - like slavery and religion.


What kinds of relationships does your character have with other characters?

Think about how Huck relates to runaway slave Jim, both in the beginning of the novel and at the end. Think about Huck's relationship with his drunk, abusive father and how it shaped his identity.


How do the actions of your character move the plot forward?

Huck is the main character, so obviously his actions are important. But what, specifically, is special about the way Huck acts? How does he make different decisions than someone else in the same situation might? You could talk about how Huck decides to rescue Jim from the people who intend to return him to his owner because he decides that slavery is wrong, even though this idea contradicts everything society has taught him.


What struggles does your character encounter?

Think about how Huck grows and learns throughout the story. In the beginning, he is more likely to get caught up in schemes (like faking his own death); but later on, he avoids the trickery he observes (like when he tries to ditch the deceptive duke and king).



, As you read, take notes on all important elements that add to the depth of the main character as you read the work for a second time. Make notes in the margins and underline important passages.


You can also keep a notebook handy while you're reading to help you keep track of your thoughts about the character as you read.

, Gather all of your notes about the character and try to think of the main idea relating to them. This will be your thesis statement for your character analysis. Think about their actions, motivations, and the outcome of their story line. Maybe your thesis idea will be something about how the character embodies the struggles of growing up as a young boy, or about the inherent good in people. Maybe your character shows readers that even people who make horrible mistakes are capable and deserving of redemption.


For the Huck Finn example, you might choose something about the hypocrisy of civilized society since, in essence, the novel is about a boy who was brought up to support enslaving blacks, but decides, through his experiences with Jim on the river, to value Jim as a person and a friend rather than just as a slave. Similarly, Huck's own father captures and ""enslaves"" Huck, a situation that Huck eventually escapes and mirrors Jim's own quest for freedom. Society views Huck's escape as moral and just, but Jim's escape is a terrible crime to the townspeople. In this contradiction lies a major crux of the story.

, Once you have decided on your main idea, make a brief outline of all of your supporting material. Make note of each place in the text where your character displays the characteristic you've chosen for your thesis. Include complicating evidence that allows the character to have more depth.An outline will help keep your thoughts organized and maintain an effective flow as you move through the analysis.

, Keeping your thesis idea in mind, prepare an introductory paragraph about the character you have chosen and the role that he or she plays in the literary work.


Your introduction should provide the topic of your analysis, enough background information to inform and intrigue your reader, and your thesis idea/claim.

, Describe what your character looks like and explain what their appearance reveals about them as a person. Make sure to quote or paraphrase directly from the work.


Think about Huck's ragged clothes and what that says about his character. Discuss how Huck dresses up like a little girl to find out the news in town and how this altered appearance influences your analysis of Huck.

, If provided, include details about the personal history of the character (some of these details may have to be inferred). People's histories inevitably influence their personality and personal development, so it is important to discuss your character's history if you can. Where/when was the character born and raised? What kind of education does the character have? How does the character's past experience influence what he or she does or says?


Discuss Huck's relationship with his father and with the Widow Douglas and Miss Watson, who take him in. How do these characters influence Huck's development? The contrast between Huck's alcoholic father and the conservative ladies who care for Huck later is an interesting continuum of social behavior to analyze and consider where Huck's own beliefs/actions fall on that continuum.

, Analyze the language that the character uses throughout the work. Does the character use the same language throughout or does his or her choice of language change from the introduction to the conclusion?


Huck has an admittedly vulgar attitude for a little boy and often does not speak in a way that the Widow Douglas approves of. He does try hard to obey her and act appropriately in church, but he often missteps and announces himself, through his actions and words, as a person who is far less civilized than he pretends to be, or than the Widow would like him to be.

, Does the character act on emotions or reason? What values does the character exhibit through words or actions? Does the character have goals or ambitions? Be specific and make sure to quote or paraphrase from the work.


Huck Finn tries to abide by the rules of society, but at the end of the day he acts based on emotions. He decides to rescue Jim from being returned to his master, even though it is against the law, because he believes that Jim does not deserve to be treated like a slave. Huck decides this on his own, in direct opposition to the values his society has taught him.

, Think about how your character interacts with others in the story. Does the character lead or follow others in the story? Does the character have close friends and family? Use examples from the text along with your analysis.

, Most major characters will experience conflict throughout the course of a story.Some conflict is external (brought about by forces outside of his or her control, or by their environment and the people around them), while other conflict is internal (personal struggles the character deals with about their own feelings or actions).Is the character better or worse at the conclusion? Memorable characters usually change or grow in a literary work of merit.


Huck's external conflict relies on all of the events that take place on his journey down the river - the physical struggle of the trip, his mishaps along the way, getting caught up in various scandals and schemes, etc. His internal conflict reaches its climax when Huck decides to help Jim attain freedom from slavery. This is a crucial moment in the story where Huck follows his heart instead of his social conscience.

, Make sure you provide specific examples from the text that support what you are saying about the character.Include quotations when applicable to back up what you're saying.If the author describes the character as sloppy, you should provide specific details to show this character trait, quoting or paraphrasing directly from the work.

, This means that you should incorporate direct quotations from the text you're writing about to support the points that you are making with your writing.


Using quotes from the text will increase your credibility as an author and will support your ideas more effectively.

, This means that you will make a Point, Illustrate it (with a quotation from the text), and Explain how the quote makes your point.For example, you might say the following: Huck Finn garners a significant new identity from being a raftsman. He insists, ""It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that."" This shows the freedom and pride he associates with his raft.

, A quotation should never stand alone as its own sentence in an academic paper. Instead, you should use your own words to ""anchor"" the quote into your sentence either before or after the quotation.


Incorrect: ""It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.""
Correct: He insists that ""It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.""
Correct: ""It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that,"" Huck insists.

, Your words should still make up approximately 90% of your analysis, with the other 10% being direct quotation. Using too many quotes seems lazy and ineffective, and will probably earn you a poor grade from your professor.

This is going to be a process that will seem difficult or insurmountable at times, so it better be about something you don’t mind thinking and/or agonizing about for several months. Research your particular genre, and stay with in the rules of that genre, if you are looking to sell your script. The film industry is always looking for marketability over originality. That's not saying a little originality is a bad thing.;
, Not getting it will only annoy you and potential readers who are used to seeing dialog placed at an exact four inches from either side of the margin. If you can’t afford Movie Magic or Final Draft or Montage, try “Celtx”. Stick three “w’s” and a “.com” to the name and you’re golden. I am starting to use it now. It is pretty much fully functional and adds the option of putting your scripts in an online database for collaboration and sharing. Who knows? Maybe that is the next big thing.

, Write a short sentence (15 words or less) of the fundamental concept which drives the plot. It will help you to identify if your film is too complex and seek feedback.

, It is easy to get lost over the course of one hundred pages. Seek feedback.

, Even more than a plot outline, characters can make or break your story. List the characters and give a complete description of them, physically and characteristics like if they are smart, good and likeable or, as it tends to be these days, if they are dumb, evil and hateful but in a likeable way (see Richard III by W. Shakespeare for ideas) then you have got yourself a movie. If they are the same people you have seen again and again and have been bored with yourself at the movie theater, keep thinking. If your protagonists and antagonists are characters, make sure you list out their flaws. During the course of the story the protagonist overcomes his/her/their flaws and the antagonist flaws becomes his/her/their downfall.

, Yeah, so a lot of established writers have done away with it and done well but that is because they are established writers. Producers are willing to take chances on them because they have made money before. Most movies are written in the format of The Hero's Journey, which there are a number of articles on the web relating to The Hero's Journey. Another good reference is The Writer's Journey by Christopher Vogler and Story by Robert McKee

, If you have no idea what the last step was about…learn it. Here it is, in the briefest of brief forms: ACT I tells us about a world and characters as they are meant to be, and introduces a problem they need to solve. For example, “The Goonies live their lives happily in their little section of the world, until they discover that developers want to turn the goon docks into condominiums, so…” ACT II develops the characters more and deals with the problem. For example, “So, the Goonies enter One-Eyed Willy’s maze and try to get through all the traps in order to…” In ACT III, several things happen, probably the most important being that the hero, early on in this part, gets to a point where he or she is ready to give up. BUT and this is the important part: he or she is somehow given the idea that giving up is not the answer and instead figures out a way to win the day. For example, “Sean Astin, in Goonies, figures out a way to turn One-Eyed Willy’s traps against the villains and instead manages to get enough jewels to save the Goon docks.”

, Dialogue is best written after you have written the rest of the script, this way it makes sure that your story is told visually. Keep dialogue short, simple and make sure it is not on the nose. If you are struggling you could improvise it in a # reheasal.

, Remember each page is roughly equivalent to a minute in film time. Write action and describe how something feels instead of writing description. And finally and most importantly, keep it simple and easy to read.

, This will give you the general flow of the scripts and make it easier to tell where the story is moving.

, Make sure your dialog is very colloquial (characteristic of or appropriate to ordinary or familiar conversation rather than formal speech or writing). An exercise in helping write colloquial is to eavesdrop on someone else's conversation and record it word for word.

, Not even close. Once you have written a first draft, go back and revise the heck out of it. If, at this point, you have written one hundred and twenty pages, then you have probably written at least thirty pages too many. Go back and start cutting things out, simplifying characters, and making it a tighter, easier to read package.

, Until you feel it is finished.

, Send the script away to a respectable script reading service. For a fee, they can send you critical information on what parts of the script need improvements and much more.

Make your script memorable.",How to Write a Great Explainer Video Script," First, you need to answer some basic questions: what makes your product, company, or idea great? If you’ve been in development for a while, you likely have a short description of what’s good about your product already. But what makes it unique? What problem does it solve?;
, If you have been in development, you should already have an idea of who your audience is. However, if you still aren't sure, you can run tests on groups of people to see who connects with your product.


Invite people to try it out, then ask them to answer a few short survey questions to determine demographics and how well they liked your product.

, If you’ve figured out what makes your product unique, try to figure out how to transfer that uniqueness into the format you plan on using.


Some explainer videos use a white board, chalk board, or a piece of paper with someone drawing out the explanation as a voice narrates. Some use animation. Many use humor. Decide on a unique approach for your video.

, Keep it concise and to the point. A few sentences or a short paragraph will do here. In fact, if you can show what your product does rather than just telling the audience, that will work even better.


For example you could say, “Our new shoes are a novelty on the market. When wearing them, you will levitate 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the ground.”
However, it would be more effective to show short clips of people actually wearing the shoes and levitating.

, For instance, if you have a great new music service, discuss what was missing in music apps that made you want to design your own. Then discuss how your product fills that niche.


Think of this section as a more detailed description of your product and company. Anticipate the questions your viewers might have.
A great way to find out those questions is to do a test screening of a preliminary video. Get reactions from everyday viewers, and incorporate that information into your video.

, Do not make it too wordy. Think of it as a dialogue. When writing it, read it aloud to yourself or have someone else read it aloud. It should sound natural, not stilted.


Take out words you don’t use in your everyday language, and don’t be afraid to use contractions and informal language.
Informal language, like using “y’all” or “you guys,” invites the listener into the conversation.

, When writing, think about how it will look visually because eventually the script will narrate something visual. In other words, use language that can be animated.


If your product is levitating shoes, you might say “These shoes provide lift through their gravity-reducing soles. See how she glides above the ground.” instead of “These shoes make you look cool.”

, People like stories. Tell them a story about your product that runs through the video.

, Tell your viewers what they need to do to get your product, whether it’s visiting a website, contributing to a Kickstarter campaign, or downloading an app.


The point of the video is to get people interested. However, you must give people something to do with that interest, or they will walk away. Keep it simple. Anything too complicated will turn people away.
You can write something like, “Want to find out more? Check out our product at www.website.com!” or “Like what you see? Visit our Kickstarter page to help fund our product!”

, You want the video to remind your viewers of your brand. Therefore, use similar language to what you use on your website and pick a similar style of graphics.


If your brand is more professional, use professional language.
If your brand is more quirky, use language that reflects that quirkiness.

, Using a lot of jargon or using convoluted, run-on sentences can be confusing and off-putting for your audience. Pretend you are describing your product to your grandma. You want to reach as wide an audience as possible.

, Though you want to reach a wide audience and your language should reflect that, your product is most likely meant for a particular audience. Gear your script and format to that audience. It’s ok to use some younger slang (that everyone understands) if that’s who your audience is.


For instance, if you want to discuss a particular problem your product is addressing or even if you want to poke fun at yourself, you could use slang like “epic fail.”
Be sure to address the audience as “you,” as it will draw them in

, Generally, viewers will connect more with something lighthearted than with something very serious. Try poking a bit of fun at yourself in the process.

, Check your script for errors. Make sure you have grammatically correct sentences. It's a good idea to give the script to someone else to look over, as they will pick up on any errors you might have missed

, Overall, a great script is short, to the point, and memorable. A good length for an explainer video is 1 minute to 1 ½ minutes, which is approximately 140 to 180 words per minute or 210 to 270 words per minute and a half.

, Stand out from the crowd in the style of video you use or in the humor you use. Try something innovative with animation or draw your viewers in with a set of trivia questions. Maybe what makes your video “memorable” is what you’re offering to the viewer—a new idea or a great offer. Pick something that will stick with them for a while.

Be aware that is the core concept and story that producers will buy, not necessarily the 120 page screenplay you've written.,
Write a treatment, which details the storyline and content of your screenplay.,
Titles tell it all.,
Regardless of title and story, the most important element in pitching your screenplay is the Logline.,
A detailed synopsis of your screenplay should be 3 to 7 pages, and illustrate the most important plot points in your storyline.,
Protect your writing.,
Pitch your screenplay.,
Get recognition.,
Create a unique poster for your screenplay.

",How to Sell Your Screenplay to Hollywood," Work to identify what that story concept is, and how it can be written in a brief synopsis. This is the tool that will be used in pitching your screenplay to producers.;
, This will include the Title, Logline, and Synopsis. The Treatment is what Producers will read to determine if your screenplay is a project they wish to read in full, and/or purchase. It is essentially your marketing tool, and perhaps the most important component in selling your screenplay.

, A great title triggers the imagination, and suggests what the movie is about. A clever twist on a familiar phrase, such as ""Meet The Parents"", is loaded with expectation. We understand the inherent drama, conflict or anticipation of meeting a fiance's parents, and our imagination starts delivering the possible scenarios. Very blunt or direct titles also work. ""The Matrix"", or ""The Beach"" are straight forward titles that make us want to know ""what is that world or story about?"". Screenplays that explore character studies, such as ""Forrest Gump"", are unique to their story and character. The reader and audience are willing to explore what its about.

, This is the short pitch. A one or two sentence description of the basic concept, and unique hook that your story has. This is what Producers will read and know if they have confidence to take the time and read the script, as well as being able to market the script to studios.

, Focus on the exploits of your main character, as well as defining the three main acts. Act 1 typically sets the unique circumstances that propel our story and character's agenda. Act 2 is split into two smaller acts (a, and b). 2a brings momentum to the challenges your main character faces, as the various plots are woven. 2b typically brings a surprise conflict or challenge that must be overcome. This is the ""twist"" that may put your character's agenda at risk, and complicate it to a point of being compelling and entertaining to watch. Act 3 brings resolution to your plot and character's agenda. Themes of redemption, revenge, confirmation of love, victory, or acceptance are all common themes.

, Before pitching your screenplay by marketing the treatment to producers or agents, be sure you have third party proof of creation for your story. You can visit online registries to obtain time stamped archival for your work. When marketing your project, keep records of exposure by saving any emails, faxes, or certified mailings to any third parties who request your material. Consider using online industry marketplaces who provide electronic record of review by carefully screened companies who review new screenplays and projects in a protected database.

, Research movie producers and companies who may produce movies within the same genre of your screenplay. Websites like The Internet Movie Database are great tools to cross reference companies and executives. Target those specific companies and make query requesting permission to submit your screenplay synopsis. You can even find people to help on Craigslist. Use all marketing tools to gain exposure to established companies. Industry scouting venues, such as The TV/Film Rights Marketplace are great tools for selling screenplays and movie ideas to leading players in the industry.

, Entering screenplay contests is a great way to gain exposure. Many producers pull new projects from the ranks of winners, and many contests offer deals with producers.

Distribute your zine.",How to Make a Zine," To begin making your zine, you have to fold and cut a piece of paper, which will become the skeleton of the zine that you will later illustrate. To begin, place a piece of paper on a flat surface, then fold it in half lengthwise so that the longer edges meet up. You can use regular 8 ½ x 11 inch (21.59 x 27.94 cm) printer paper, or any kind of thin rectangular paper.Some prefer to use A3 paper, which will make a zine that is exactly postcard-sized and therefore convenient for sending in the mail. A3 paper is 11.69 x 16.54 inches (29.6 x 42 cm).;
, After you finish your first fold, fold the paper in half again, this time so that the short ends of the paper meet, making sure that the corners line up evenly., Make one final fold, this time folding in the same direction as the last fold to make a vertical fold. The shorter edges of the paper should meet when you make this fold. If you used A3 paper, the folded paper should be the size of a postcard., After you finish folding, unfold your piece of paper and lay it flat on a cutting mat. The paper should be divided into eight sections by the folds, with one fold dividing the paper horizontally and three folds dividing it vertically. Take an X-Acto knife and make a horizontal cut through the horizontal fold, starting at the point where the horizontal fold intersects the leftmost vertical fold, and ending at the point where the horizontal fold intersects with the rightmost vertical fold.In other words, you are making a horizontal cut through the horizontal fold that doesn’t start at the edge of the page, but rather goes through the middle of the page up to the points where the left and right vertical folds intersect with the horizontal fold.
Place a ruler along the horizontal fold and use it to make the cut so that the cut is straight.

, After you have made the horizontal cut, fold the paper horizontally so that the longer edges of the paper meet together. This should leave you a two-layered strip of paper with four sections., After you fold your paper horizontally, you should notice that the double-layered strip of paper you have has the slit you made running along the top of the middle two sections. This makes it possible to push the two ends of the paper together to form a sort of “mouth,” that also resembles a plus sign when viewed from above., After you have made your “plus sign,” fold the top and bottom legs of the plus sign over to the right, so that they sandwich the right leg., By this point, you should see that there is still one leg of the “plus sign” that is to the left of the other pages. Fold this leftmost page clockwise. You will see that you now have a booklet with four pages! Crease the spine of the zine with your finger to ensure that it keeps its shape!You have just finished creating the skeleton of the zine, which you will illustrate and add artwork to. You can just make this one zine if you wish, or use it as your master copy, which you will make copies of if you want to reproduce the zine.
If you want to add more pages, you can cut paper to the exact size of the spread of the zine and staple the pages into the central spread of the zine where the binding would be on a regular book. You can also use two pieces of paper at the beginning by putting one sheet on top of the other and cutting and folding them simultaneously. This will give you double the amount of pages.

, Many zines have a central theme, which can range from a brief prompt like “man versus nature” or “typography” to a more specific topic, like a personal narrative or an analysis of a current event. Before you start to create art and text for your zine, decide whether you want your zine to be a mish-mosh of ideas and themes, or if you want to have a central focus.Inspiration can come from almost anywhere. Read the news, revisit favorite books and movies, or look to other artists for inspiration.
Sometimes a whole wealth of ideas can come from just one doodle or sentence. Try doodling or writing in a journal to start generating ideas.

, Many zines feature the work of several artists rather than just one, which gives the zine a range of different perspectives and styles. If the thought of having other people contribute to the zine appeals to you, recruit friends or family to contribute to one page of the zine.If you do decide to ask others to contribute to your zine, make sure that they are reliable! It may be a good idea to install a deadline for contributions so that you aren’t waiting on their pages indefinitely.

, You may find that it is easier to start to work on your zine when it is folded out flat, rather than in booklet form. If you do decide that you want to lay the zine out flat to work on it, number every page of the zine and use a pencil to draw a small arrow pointing upward on every page.

Upward arrows help you to keep track of what direction the text and images should be in.
When you fold the zine out, you should see that the arrows on the sections of the paper are pointing down, meaning that you need to place your art upside down for it to appear right-side up when folded back into a booklet.
If you plan on adding your art with the booklet folded, you can skip this step.

, The cover is an essential part of any publication, because it plays the dual roles of catching the eye of the reader using striking graphics and visuals, and also informing the reader of what they can expect to find inside. Come up with a name for your zine that you feel is fitting to its mood and theme.Keep in mind that if you are planning on making your zine into a series, the title should be the same for each issue.
Include the theme of the zine, if you have one, in a smaller font either above or below the title of the zine.
Also try to incorporate a picture into the cover page. Pictures add visual interest, and do a good job of pulling the viewer in and making them want to read more.

, Figure out what order you want for the pages of your zine. For instance, if your zine has a linear storyline, it’s important to have the pages in order. Write down the order of your pages and the names of the artist who is doing the page (if you aren’t doing the zine alone) on a separate piece of paper before embarking on making it., Start to fill in your zine, adding artwork to each page. If you have folded out your zine, make sure to orient the artwork correctly, referring to the arrows you drew. You can use any kind of two-dimensional media to make your artwork, whether it be collage, paint, or pen and ink. You can even print text from the computer and paste it into your zine.


If you are having other people contribute to the zine, either lend the master copy of the zine to them so that they can fill in their pages, or give them the dimensions of the page. Then they can produce artwork at that size and either give the artwork to you in person or scan it and send it to you so that you can print it out and paste it inside the zine.
Each page of the zine is made of a folded-over section of paper, rather than a single sheet like a regular book. Because of this, you can decide if you want to cover the inside of the zine with artwork as well. This artwork will be hidden unless the reader unfolds the zine into a sheet and flips it over.

, Keep in mind that if you are going to reproduce the zine, printing it in color is much more expensive than black and white. If you plan on reproducing in black and white, make sure that your text and images have high contrast between darks and lights. Things that contrast well in color often don’t have as much impact when converted to grayscale., Remember that if you are reproducing your zine, thin or spindly lines and text smaller than a standard 12 point font may be less defined and harder to see after being photocopied. Try to make your lines defined and your text at least 12 pt, and avoid small, intricate details that might be lost when reproduced., You can also create your zine on the computer, using a software like Adobe Photoshop or Indesign, or even Microsoft Word, which you can later print and fold yourself. If you choose to create your zine on the computer instead of working on your artwork on paper, it’s still useful to make a dummy, or physical mockup, of your zine.

Following the steps above to fold and cut a mockup of your zine will give you the dimensions of each zine page. Use these dimensions to correctly set up your computer document.
To create a zine on the computer, create a document that is the size of the zine paper you will be printing on. Then divide the document into a grid, with each section representing one page of your zine. Work on your artwork and text on the computer, fitting them into each page and orienting them in the right direction. Then print the page and use the same steps to cut and fold it as you did for your dummy.

, After you finish the artwork of your zine, you may decide that you’d like to have more than one copy! To begin to photocopy your zine, fold out the zine into a flat page, then place this page on a scanner or photocopy machine.Making copies of your zine helps you to reach a wider audience and also produces a product that has a more finished and less handmade look than the master copy.
Make sure to use a copier that has a scanner, rather than a copier in which the paper will have to go through the machine to get copied. Because of the various multimedia that you may have used to make your zine, there is a chance that the zine could jam this type of copier, which would also damage your master copy.

, After you lay your zine out on the scanner of the copier, create as many copies of the zine as you wish. Keep in mind that color copies will be much more costly than black and white.You may want to make one test copy to make sure that the zine is copying correctly before you print several copies.

, Use the steps in Part One to fold your zine, cut along the central fold with an X-Acto knife, then refold the zine. Because your pages will be laid along a grid, it should be easy to understand how to fold., After you have finished your zines, go out and distribute them! You may decide to charge a small amount of money for your zines, or you may choose to give them out to free. Share your zines with friends and family, or go to small independent businesses like bookstores or record shops and ask if you can leave some of your zines there.

The content you'll need before you make the catalog includes images of the products, a list of products and product features, and a list of other content that needs to be written, such as information about the company, customer testimonials, and any other information that will help your customers make the right decision.

, You may be tempted to take your own images to save money, but unless you yourself are a professional photographer, it's best to hire a professional to take images for you. Your product photographs are one of the most important aspects of the catalog since this is what customers will see first. An appealing image will encourage customers to read the description and, hopefully, make a purchase.


If you have photography skills and feel comfortable taking the pictures yourself and own a digital camera, set the camera on the highest resolution and follow product picture protocol: use individual, not group pictures of products on a light background, add a drop shadow to make the products leap off of the page, and upload them at no lower than 300 dpi.

, Before you write the content about each product, you'll need to know all of the technical specifications of each one. You can also assign item numbers and prices, including original and discount prices. You may also want to jot down any benefits that come to mind while sorting through your products. Though you may want to tell readers every little thing there is to know about each product, you should only give them the information that will help them make a decision. You can direct them to your website if they want even more information about the product.

, You should pick a convenient size for your catalog to be when it's closed. Depending on where it will be used, whether it's on an airplane or on a desk in a waiting room, you'll need to consider the most convenient size for your product so your customers aren't overwhelmed by an overly-large catalog or aren't frustrated by a catalog that is too small to let them clearly see the images and information about the products they are considering.

, Your catalog needs to be long enough to give your customers all the information they need, but short enough to keep their interest and to not bog them down in extra details. Don't forget about a table of contents, any products that may be featured on an entire page, and additional informational pages, such as the company history.


Make sure that your pagination is consistent. You can make it easy for customers to find your website address and number by putting them on each of your two-page spreads. You can list your phone number on the bottom right of each page and your website URL on the bottom left, or do the reverse. You can also place one on the top or one on the bottom.
Be sure to keep the page count in 4 page increments since printing companies print 4 pages on an entire sheet of paper (2 on the front and 2 on the back).

, Keep each description short, between 50-150 words. You will want to include the features of each product, but be sure to tie small benefits into each feature. And don't forget about a core benefit. For instance, the grip features of those golfing gloves will provide a more stable hold on the club, but more importantly, customers can golf on a pro-level when wearing these gloves (core benefit). Help customers select the right item as you are writing about the products, describing what they need to know about them, from price to weight or dimensions.


If you'd like additional writing help, you may consider hiring a copywriter.

, When you're copywriting, you should use short, easy-to-read sentences and paragraphs that avoid overly technical language. Each section of your catalog should have a cover or introductory page that shows a person using one of the products in the section, along with a short article about the benefits of the entire product category. Your content can also include a brief history of the company to make your readers feel more comfortable with your products.


You should also create the order form if you will accept faxed or mailed orders.

, You'll need to plan which content will appear on each page. Be sure to place similar products together. Additionally, you should place products that go together near each other as well. For example, if you're selling upscale men's dress shoes, you may place shoehorns that will keep the shoes intact for a long time on the same page, because customers who consider nice shoes may be looking for this as well. This is also a great way to show customers something that they didn't even know they needed.


To organize your content effectively, you'll need to not only have product sections, but an introductory section at the front of the book, an educational section if you want to include articles, as well as a section for return and warranty information. You can intersperse articles throughout the catalog so that buying your products is never far from the customer's mind.
Make sure to use consistent typography and designs so your customers aren't distracted. However, you should make it convenient to find a specific section by color-coding the tops, bottoms, or sides of the pages of each section.

, When you're trying to reach a 4-page increment, you may need to use some filler pages in your catalog. Make these fillers promote the purpose of your catalog -- selling products. Including the history of your company will help customers be more comfortable buying your products. So will customer testimonials and guarantees. Anything that will put a customer's mind at ease and legitimize your company will help you make the most of extra real estate.

, The cover will be the first thing your potential customers see and it will make or break the success of your catalog. If your cover does not capture attention, the catalog may get thrown in the trash before a customer even opens it. Including feature items, any specials or discounts, and stunning images all encourage a consumer to flip through the pages. If your catalog is seasonal, go with a theme that matches the time of year or an upcoming holiday.

, Although creating the order form can be a bit tedious, keep in mind that a customer may give up on buying that one-of-a-kind lamp because the form is too confusing. Including a customer service number will give customers a way to contact you if they get stuck. A perforated form that is addressed makes mailing the order much easier for customers as well. Don't forget necessities such as a quantity option and both shipping and billing address options. If your customers can also order the product online, let them know that this is an option.

, It's important to create a mock-up of your product catalog before you order hundreds of catalogs and realize you've made some organizational errors or visual mistakes. This process will keep you from wasting time on redoing page layouts, and it will give you a sense of what your catalog will actually look like. Unless you have a graphic design background, you should hire or meet with a professional to find the best way to lay out the pages in your catalog.


You will discuss your budget, the printer you will use, any tear-out order forms, and the images you want to use. Once you or your graphic design expert will have a sense of these components, you can find a way to lay out the information, and a way to place as many products as you can on one page without crowding them.
You can use shapes or other placeholders to represent the images you will eventually use. Once you have everything ready, you can even use the real images, proof the catalog, and have potential buyers take a look at it to get some suggestions before you take it to your printer.

, If your catalog is only 4 pages, you could try printing it yourself, but a professional will take less time and ensure quality results. Plus, a commercial printing firm will take care of issues such as page implementation (page order) and creep (outer pages coming out shorter than the inner pages when folded together). A printer will also be able use a much more durable binding technique. Some printing companies even provide mailing services for your convenience. Just make sure to find a printer that you can trust for reasonable prices and professional quality."

Perform.",How to Put on a Play," The script is the document that contains all the lines and stage directions of a play. It defines act and scene changes, descriptions of the characters and ideas for staging. You can write your own play, or you can use a script from an established playwright.


If you are putting on a musical, you will also need to buy or compose a score (the music that goes with the play).
To find potential scripts, visit the Plays section in your local bookstore. You can also search online for free scripts.
You can save money by putting on a play that was written over a hundred years ago, such as a play by Shakespeare. Such scripts can be found for free, and are not owned by a publishing house, meaning you do not have to buy the rights to produce them.
If you are putting on an improvised play, or a play with no words, you will still need to write down the basic ideas of your play, and note things like scene changes and number of actors involved.
Obtain copies of the script your every member of the cast and crew, and get a few backups.;
, To buy the rights to a play, look up its publishing house. Find their catalogue online, or contact them to ask for a catalogue, to learn the royalty fee. Some plays are ""restricted,"" meaning not available for production. Once you are sure the play is unrestricted, contact the publishing house and ask for a quote.To get a quote, provide the publishing house with the play's title, the intended venue and its seating capacity, the organization that is producing the play, the projected ticket prices, and the performance dates. Make sure to indicate whether or not you are a for-profit group, and if you are in the actor's union.
You will be contacted with a quote and a contract, or simply an invoice.
You will have to purchase scripts and scores separately.

, Find a location that goes well with your script and your vision. Look at local theaters and get price quotes. Traditional theaters a stage, rows of cushioned seats, light and audio equipment, changing rooms and mirrors, access to restrooms, a curtain, storage for props and scenery, and a green room for actors to rest. Outdoor theaters, such as Greek amphitheaters and stages in parks, are excellent options for more casual productions.


Public and private schools, colleges, churches, and community centers often have theaters that can be rented.
Consider staging in an unorthodox location, such as an empty warehouse, a park, or a private home.
When picking unorthodox locations, aim for a place with good acoustics, the right amount of space for the action you imagine, plenty of comfortable seating for your audience, and access to restrooms.
Consider: how will you control the lighting in your space? Will you need to rent equipment?
What will serve as your ""backstage"" area? Where will actors go when they are not in the action?
Consider finding a venue you can also rehearse in. If you cannot afford to rehearse in the venue you have chosen for the performance, find a separate venue to rehearse in. This venue should have an area about the same size and shape of the stage you will eventually perform on.

, A play needs a producer, who oversees the financing and management of the play, and a director, who runs rehearsals. It needs people in charge of creating, finding, and keeping track of the costumes, the makeup, masks and wigs, the sets (backdrops, large objects such as fake cars or trees), and the props (objects to be handled onstage). It needs a stage manager, the person running the cast and crew from behind the curtains. Finally, it needs people to design the lights, and to handle the lights and the microphones that will be used during the show.


Depending on the size of the production, you can have different people for each of these roles, or just a few people with overlapping roles.
A large broadway musical might have a crew of hundreds, while a school play might have a single person acting as producer, director, stage manager, and costume designer.

, Audition actors to take part in your play. If you already have actors in mind, give them a private audition, or just ask if they would like the part. If you don't have actors in mind, put up notices in your local paper and on community bulletin boards advertising the auditions. Describe each character, and the type of person you are looking to cast. For example, if you were trying to cast Romeo and Juliet, you would write ""Juliet: young woman, any age considered but must be able to play 13-yo.


Be sure to list how many actors you are casting, whether or not you are offering compensation, how frequent rehearsals will be, and when the play will be performed.
List where and when auditions will be held, what the actors should bring, and your contact information.

, The producer and director should have each actor read lines from the script for the parts they want. You can audition each person separately, or you can call in all the Juliets at once and have them read one after another. You can also have actors audition with a monologue they have prepared ahead of time.


You may need to read the lines in between, or you may want to have another actor on hand to read with the person auditioning.
Get the contact information of each actors so that you can inform them whether or not they got the parts they wanted.
Once you have a few options for each roll, offer callbacks. Callbacks are a separate audition in which the actors you are considering for the part return and audition again.
Once you have cast the play, contact all the actors and let them know if they are in or not. If you have bit parts (small roles with no lines or just a few lines) available, ask the actors you did not cast if they would be willing to play these parts.
Bit part actors do not always need to come to every rehearsal, but still get to enjoy some time onstage during the production.

, Once you have your cast assembled, sit them all down in your rehearsal venue and have them read through the script. Lead a discussion about your vision for the play, and get thoughts from the actors. Discuss the significance of each scene, and clarify the meaning of each line.


Discuss the characters. Talk with each actor about the character he or she is playing. Have this actor think up a back story for the character, and establish how the character feels about the other characters in the play.
Explain the cast what the set will look like.
Agree on a rehearsal schedule, and set expectations for when lines will be memorized.

, Determine where, roughly, each actor will be on stage in even moment of scene—this is called ""blocking"" the play. Have the actors write down the blocking in their scripts, and write it in your own. Start by rehearsing with the script. The director should keep a copy of the script on hand at all times. When an actor forgets a line, he or she can say ""line"" and the director will provide a reminder.


If you are producing a musical, you will need a choreographer who designs the dances for each song. This blocking is much more involved.
When blocking, consider the set design. Put tape down on the stage where the curtain will be, where the set pieces will be, and where spotlights will be, and make sure all the actors what part of the stage is what.

, Run through scenes, run through whole acts, and run through the entire play. Give notes after each rehearsal. After a scene has been practiced, or after a whole act has run, the director should give notes and run through troubled moments. Discuss what scenes are going really well, and what needs to change. Your notes should provide specific guidance.


For example, instead of saying ""Romeo, you aren't acting like you're really in love. You look bored onstage,"" say ""Romeo, we need to work on body language. When Juliet is on stage, you should always be facing her. Don't take your eyes off her—she is totally captivating to you.""
Run through scenes that aren't going well, giving actors specific tips. For instance, after giving Romeo his notes, have Romeo and Juliet go onstage to run just the few lines that weren't going well.
Block detailed movement to guide lackluster acting: ""Okay Romeo, when Juliet moves, follow her movements. Juliet, I want you to lift your arm on that line—okay, Romeo, take a step in that direction when she lifts her arm. Imagine you're a puppy playing catch!""

, As the date of the performance approaches, begin dress rehearsals. Dress rehearsal is a rehearsal in which the play is practiced exactly as it will be performed, from beginning to end. Actors should be in full costume and makeup. All the set pieces should be in place, and all the lighting and sound should be too. This is a chance for you to make sure that all the materials of the play are in place.


Have a separate tech run-through in which the stage manager gives the cues for each scene change, and the technical crew performs the light and set changes necessary.
Do a few of these to ensure speed.
Have several dress rehearsals in which you stop the action to give notes and work out problems with sets, costumes, and lights.
Once those things seem to be working, do one or two full run-throughs in which the whole play is performed, start to finish, with no stopping.
If there is an error in staging, lighting, or acting, the cast and crew must work to cover it up, just as they will during an actual production.

, Props are the objects that are handled by actors onstage. They can range from food, to purses, to fake guns, to a Papier-mâché head. Depending on the size of your production, you will either have a single person in charge of props, or a props crew headed by a props manager.


Go through the script with your props manager and write down every object that will be needed. Make note of when it will be needed.
Make sure the props fit into the time period and social class implied by the script. For instance, when Romeo drinks poison, he shouldn't drink it out of a plastic water bottle, as those did not exist in the 1300s.
Make sure your actors know when in the script they will be handling certain objects, and have them rehearse with them or with stand-in objects when possible.
Your props can be purchased, built, or donated.
During the performances, actors can retrieve their own props, or members of the props crew to bring the actors what they need. The props manager should keep track of where the props are at all times.

, Some plays come with suggested set designs, but some require you to design your own. Make sure the layout of your set is in place before you begin rehearsals, so that your actors know where to move onstage. Some plays have elaborate sets, while some rely on the imaginations of the viewers.


If you are performing inside, your set might include painted backdrops or a screen that images are projected across.
Your set can also include furniture and built objects that actors can stand or sit on. Romeo and Juliet, for instance, requires a balcony.

, Your costume manager might rent, purchase, sew, or borrow the costumes used throughout the play. Go through the script together and determine what each character should be wearing in each scene. Mark the costume changes and make sure the actors knows when they will have to change costumes.


Members of the costume crew may be needed to help effect rapid costume changes between scenes.
If a costume must be changed quickly, consider investing in costumes that can be removed quickly, using zippers or velcro rather than laces and buttons.

, In the weeks before a play opens, advertise in local papers and message boards. Design an eye-catching image to use on posters, in ads, and on flyers. You can repeat this image on the program for your play, if needed.


Send actors in full costume to local schools, retirement communities, or public places to perform bits and pass out flyers.
Make sure your advertisements say when the play will be performed, and where.
If you are having multiple performances, indicate this prominently.
Consider offering a matinee, or daytime performance, with discounted tickets for children and the elderly.

, If you are financing or defraying the cost of your show through ticket sales, calculate how many tickets you need to sell, and at what price. Encourage your actors and tech crew to sell slightly discounted tickets to friends and family. Set up a website where patrons can buy tickets before the show begins.


Designate someone to sit at the door and sell tickets before the show starts.

, For your performance, make sure that the theater is clean and ready. Consider printing a program in which you list the cast and crew by name, in which you give thanks to everyone involved in the production of your play. Consider selling ads in the program to raise money. Thank your sponsors if you have any, and include interesting facts about your theater company and the play you have produced.


Consider selling concessions. If your show has an intermission, sell the audience members candy, chips, coffee, and, if you have a permit, alcoholic beverages.
Make sure you have permission from the venue to sell concessions.
Consider hiring ushers to help audience members to their seats. Ushers can also pass out flyers and direct people to the restrooms.

, Savor the excitement of your opening night. Gather cast and crew together before the first show and give a speech of thanks and encouragement. Answer any questions, and remind everyone of recent changes or issues. Do some team-building activities, such as having everyone hold hands in a huge circle and chanting.


After the each performance, or before the next performance opens, give notes to your cast and crew.
If you are only doing one performance, skip the notes and just dole out praise and thanks.

The Writer's Guild of America has offices in New York and Los Angeles. It offers a screenplay registration service that helps protect your copyright by establishing a date of authorship. As of May 2014, the cost of registering a screenplay is $20 for non-members.
The U.S. Copyright Office offers registration so you can establish a public record of your copyright. This will allow you to sue someone in court for infringement. You may want to register it before you start sending your script out.;
, Query letters should give the buyer an idea of what your screenplay is about and a brief introduction of yourself.


Include a one or two sentence pitch of your screenplay, called a logline. You should memorize it in case you have the opportunity to pitch your script verbally. Your logline should inspire people to want to read your script.

, The goal of the synopsis is to get the reader to request your entire screenplay. Your first synopsis should be no more than 1 to 3 pages unless a longer one is requested.

, Try structuring or making the format in a way that one page of your screenplay shows one minute of the screen time.


While in shooting, the ""shooting scripts"" are used in which the scenes are numbered according to the screenplay and directions for every scene is given individually. But while writing a ""speculative screenplay"" no such directions are given. The standard font for writing a screenplay is 12 point, 10 pitch Courier.

Research the producer.,
Tailor your pitch to the producer if you can.,
Organize your pitch.,
Practice your pitch.",How to Pitch a Screenplay," Find out what movies this producer has already made and any movies that are currently in development. Look up movie titles online to see what they're about, and watch the movies if you can. Trade publications such as The Hollywood Reporter will tell you what movies are being developed.


Look for commonalities in the producer's movies, such as genres, budgets, locations, actors or themes. A producer may want to stick to movies that are similar to what he or she has already made. If the producer has recently started producing a different kind of movie, it's a sign that he or she is looking for new ideas.
Try to understand what the movies might say about the producer's personal beliefs. You may be able to glean the producer's politics, religious beliefs, love of certain parts of the country or personal values such as whether family or personal ambition is most important.;
, Don't pitch a story or parts of it that you haven't written. Emphasize certain aspects that are likely to appeal to the producer.

, Start with a short summary of the movie, then expand a little at a time if the producer wants to hear more.


State the genre of the movie, so the producer can correctly interpret your pitch.
The first few seconds of your pitch should be centered on your log line--your 1 or 2 sentence description of your movie. Begin with a rhetorical question, then give the log line. For example, you might ask, ""How might your life change when you win the lottery? This is the story of a man who won millions but lost everything he loved.""
Follow with an explanation of the main character's story arc. Tell the producer who the main character is and why the audience will identify with the character. Give the reason that you are telling this character's story, and describe the character's journey from the beginning to the end of the movie.
Expand on the story with more characters, subplots, and other interesting aspects of your screenplay. How much you can include will depend on the length of your pitch session, so be sure to organize these details so you can wrap up at any point without leaving out anything important, such as how the movie ends.

, Don't memorize it, but learn it well enough to pitch your family, friends and coworkers. Listen carefully to their feedback, particularly if they tell you they're confused about any part of your pitch. If the producer you pitch to gets confused, you will not sell your screenplay.


You want the producer to ask questions that indicate an interest in the story, what happens and why, but you never want a producer to ask ""Can you explain that part to me again?""
If you have trouble putting together a clear, compelling pitch of your movie, it may be because you have a serious flaw in your screenplay. Think about what changes you can make to your screenplay that will make your pitch better.
Remember that you're not just selling your screenplay, but yourself as a screenwriter the producer will enjoy working with. Be passionate about your story.

Pay close attention to the information that the script gives away about your role. You will learn a lot about your character from the setting, your lines, and the things that other characters say about your character. Have a pencil handy to mark up the script. Changes will be made to your script as you read, reread, and rehearse, so make sure you use a pencil.Mark the beats. Beats are changes in tone, language, or tactics. Like most things in understanding your character, beats are up to interpretation. You may interpret changes one way, while your director sees them another way. Remember that your analysis can change throughout the rehearsal process.

Use a symbol to mark your beats. One way to mark beats is to use forward slashes between words or sentences.;
, Analyze each line for the subtext, or the meaning behind the spoken words. Subtext is conveyed by the way you say the lines. Give yourself some clues by going through your character’s lines and marking words that need emphasis to convey the meaning of the line. Mark words by underlining them or writing an accent mark above them., As you read through each scene, pay close attention to the scenes in which your character appears. Make note of what your character wants in the scene. Write your notes in the margins so that you refer back to your ideas later. After you have read the entire script, think about your character’s main objective in the play. What did they seek to accomplish? Were they successful?Analyze your character. Once you’ve determined what your character wants, look at how they go about getting it. Do they say what they want? Do they express it through actions? Is it a secret? You don’t need to answer the questions, in any particular way, but you should be able to discuss your character’s desires, needs, and tactics throughout the play.

, Comb through the script for any words that you do not know the meaning of. You want to know exactly what your character is saying in order to accurately speak their lines.For example, if your character is a chemist who uses the word, “isotope,” and you don’t know the meaning of the word, you should look it up. After finding the meaning of the word, go back to the line and clarify what your character is saying.

, Your questions are meant to help you think more deeply about your character’s personality. You don’t necessarily need to talk to other people just yet. Your goal is to clarify your interpretation of the role for yourself. Look back at the script and question what is said. Use “how” or “why” questions to begin to think more deeply about your character.For example, if another character refers to your character as, “A poor little fellow,” you should investigate further. Is this the way you would describe your character? How would your character feel about that description?

, The more you know about your character’s environment, the better. You can do research by spending time with the kinds of people your character spends time with, or you can research online if you are unable to immerse yourself in your character’s world.


If you are in a play based on real events, read biographies about those involved. If you are playing John Lennon, for example, you should learn as much as you can about his life. Where did he grow up? What his relationship with his parents like? Who were his greatest influences?
If the play is fictional but set in a different time or place, find out about that era or area. If you are acting as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, you might want to know about young women from that era. What did young women do for fun? How did they dress? What was expected of them?

, Notes about physical appearance may appear in the script. These may change or stay the same depending on the types of changes your director chooses to make for the play. If changes aren’t being made, use what is in the script to create a physical image of your character (even if this is not what you look like). You can ask yourself questions formulate your image.


What is my character’s height, weight, skin complexion, and hair color? What do they think of these things? For example, your character might be a tall, skinny, white man with dark brown hair who feels self conscious about his height.
How is my character’s posture? How is it affected by age, health, and emotions? For example, your character might slouch because he is uncomfortable about his height. He might be young but appear to be awkward because he slouches so often.
Does my character have any quirks or mannerisms? For example, he might have a habit of shaking his wristwatch when he is nervous.
Are my character’s movements quick, slow, intense, or smooth? For example, he might have a quick, jerky way of moving that shows his energy and anxiety., Use the script to help you think more deeply about your character’s psychology. The exact answers may not be in the script, but the script will help you interpret or invent an inner life for your character.


What does my character worry about? For example, a young character like Juliet might worry her what her parent’s think of her.
What are my character’s dreams and goals? For example, Juliet may dream of going on adventures or getting married.
What makes my character happy, sad, angry, or scared?
How does my character feel about themselves? Juliet, for example, might feel generally good about her self since she demonstrates confidence and bravery throughout the play., Turn to the script to get a sense of who your character is in their society. Again, answers may not be explicit. Your interpretations can be based on what you’ve read in the text and based on other research you’ve done about the time period and location of the play. Ask and answer questions about your character’s daily life.


What are my character’s daily routines and special hobbies? Routines could include feeding an animal, flossing, or getting a haircut. Hobbies could be playing a sport or an studying new languages.
How much education does my character have? A character who studied up until 8th grade will have a different set of knowledge and skills from someone who is studying law.
What are my character’s political and religious affiliations?
What are some memorable experiences from my character’s childhood., Use your knowledge of your character’s goals throughout the play to determine their beliefs about right and wrong. Remember that you need to understand and sympathize with your character’s motivations, not evaluate them from your own perspective. Use some questions to guide your thinking.


Does my character have certain moral standards? For example, they might have strong opinions about honesty, family obligations, work life, sex, murder and so on.
Who does my character admire? They might admire someone from their personal circle, or they might idolize a famous person from the time period in which they live.
How does my character feel about their choices?Perhaps they made a difficult decision in the past that affects the way they see certain events over the course of the play., Since you may be playing someone whose life is quite different from your own, it may help to use acting techniques that make your portrayal look more realistic.There are many acting systems used by actors today. The Stanislavski System, Stella Adler, and Lee Strasberg are just a few of the common techniques used today. Choose one that best fits your needs.Study Stanislavski. Many techniques are loosely based on a the Stanislavski system. This technique encourages the actor to ask practical questions about the character and ask themselves, “What would I do if I were in this situation?”Stella Adler was an actress who later founded acting schools in the United States. This system stresses the importance of using large body movements on stage.Lee Strasberg was an American actor and director. He stressed the importance of thoroughly studying the characters’ life and history. He also encouraged actors to remember their daily emotional experiences in order to apply those reactions when their character goes through the same issue., You’ve already thought about what your character looks like and how they move. Now it is time to put it to action. Use your whole body to move, stand, and sit like your character.


Use gestures. Gestures are body movements that convey a certain meaning. Use gestures to help your character express what they are feeling or saying.Know your motivation for moving. You will be given stage directions that force you to move about the stage throughout the play. Always know or create a motivation for moving from one place to another. Avoid moving simply because you were told to do so.

, Use your knowledge of your character’s age, hometown, and personality to speak like your character.Convey subtext. Pay attention to your tone, inflection, and articulation when you say your lines. Make sure that the sound and rhythm of the words conveys the meaning behind the text.For example, your line might be, “You think this is fun, don’t you?” This can be read very differently depending on what is happening in the scene. You can end the sentence in an upward tone as to actually ask if to say, “You are enjoying yourself, right?” You can also stress the word “fun” and end in a downward inflection to suggest disappointment. The subtext in that case might be, “I can’t believe you aren’t taking this seriously.”

Try things like, ""Gossip Central"", or ""All Stars"".;
, You need papers that are double-sized (A4 if it's going to be an A5 magazine, or A3 if you want it to be an A4 magazine), so you can write two pages per paper.

Insert your paper into another newspaper.",How to Make a Newspaper," Newspapers can report on happenings for a school, community or neighborhood, or organization. They can be local, regional, national or international in scope. Determine who your audience is and why you want to publish this newspaper.


Be realistic about your reach. If you want to publish nationally, think about how you will reach your audience and convince them to read your paper.;
, Newspapers can be published daily, weekly, monthly, or even less frequently. Think about how frequently your readers will want news. Think too about how you will be able to handle publishing as frequently as you would like. Do you have staff to support frequent publishing? Are you doing everything yourself?


Consider starting publishing less frequently and as your newspaper builds its readership and financial support, you can switch to a more frequent schedule.

, Circulation is the reach of your paper, or how many copies you will print and circulate. If you are publishing online, circulation numbers are measured in how many people visit and read your online newspaper. Think about how many copies you can afford to publish and how you can realistically distribute them.

, Choose a number of pages and size of page for your newspaper. Newspaper pages are typically printed in multiples of 4, with smaller papers running about 8 pages, and larger newspapers running more pages than that. Think about how many sections you’d like in your paper (news, opinion, etc.) and how many pages to devote to each of these.

, Newspapers can be printed in hard copy, but increasingly, newspapers are turning to an exclusively online format. If you do print in hard copy, consider also offering some of your stories online, or at least having some kind of online presence.


Consider too if you are publishing any of your pages in color or black and white . Online printing is in full color, but physical printing will cost more if you add colors. Talk with a printer to find out your options.

, Most newspapers are funded a combination of advertising and subscriptions or per-issue charges. This does not mean, however, that you need any of these. There are some newspapers that are commercial-free. You do, however, need to consider how you will make money in order to support the newspaper.


Some newspapers that are published by an organization are financed through the organization’s membership dues.

, Brainstorm a list of names that you can call your newspaper. These might include the name of your town, your school, the specific community you’re reaching, or something else entirely. Pair this name with a typical newspaper title word, such as “Times,” “Herald,” “Bugle,” “Post,” and so on.Try different combinations of words. The title should be easy to say and easy to remember.


Make sure there isn’t another newspaper with the same title. You don’t want to be confused with a competing publication.

, Even if you have a bare-bones newspaper, you may still incur costs for printing and distribution. An 8-page school newspaper printed monthly can run $6,000 per year, budgeting for paper, ink, incidentals (supplies for reporters, etc.), a camera for a photographer, and other costs., Putting together a newspaper takes time. Think about how many articles you’d like to publish and how long it will take for these articles to be written and edited. Consider too how long you’ll need to design the newspaper issue, and how long you’ll need for printing. Establish a schedule so you know when to start working on an issue.


Start with the date that you’d like to release your paper on, and work backwards from there.
You will also have overlap between one issue and the next issue, so keep this in mind as you plan your schedule.

, Journalistic ethics are a code that guides how you practice journalism. Consider how objective and responsible your paper will be, and think about what lines you will absolutely not cross. Be sure to get these in writing and enforce these guidelines with your staff.


The Society of Professional Journalists, a professional organization with regional chapters all over the United States, has good guidelines for journalistic ethics on their website., Newspapers are a lot of work and can be more effectively produced when you have a team of people working on them. You can publish a newspaper by yourself, but you may be strapped for time or money in the process. Find people who share the same vision and passion as you for the newspaper.


Think about different positions you’ll need to fill. These might include: writers, editors for each section, photographers, designers, web designers, and ad sales representatives.
If you can afford it, pay your staff. Even if it isn’t much, a little bit of money helps to validate their professional contributions.

, If you want local businesses to advertise in your newspaper, you will need to ask them to do so. Make up a rate sheet, which is a table that tells them how much newspaper space their money will buy. You might charge $100 for a quarter page, for example. The rates you charge will be dependent too on the number of readers you anticipate having.Give special deals to your advertisers if they are willing to purchase ad space for a certain length of time or number of issues (for example, for 10 issues, or six months).

, You may consider getting legal advice or at least establishing a relationship with legal counsel, just in the off-chance someone has a problem with the news you publish. Writing news ethically will hopefully ensure that you won’t face problems, but you should be prepared nonetheless.

, Work with the editors of each section of the newspaper to come up with story ideas. Consider the most timely or pertinent news for your readers. What do they need to know?Make a list of the most important stories and assign these to reporters. Give hard deadlines to ensure you will receive their work in time for publication.

, Ask around in your community for news stories or press releases. Organizations and other groups may have formal press releases that talk about their current news. Talk with people in your community to get a feel for the stories that are most worthy of reporting.

, Articles should give more than one viewpoint and have information that is factual, easy to read and engaging. Reporters should interview at least two sources, if not more, in order to present a balanced story.

, Be meticulous about editing. Ensure that articles are fact-checked and that details are correct. Spelling and grammar should be perfect. If an article needs revision, send it back to the writer for more work. If the story is not up to par, think about holding it over until the next issue. It is crucial to establish a positive reporting and publishing reputation for your newspaper, especially with your first issue.

, If you have ads in your paper, you need to make sure these look as professional as possible so your advertisers will be satisfied.

, Using your computer, lay out your newspaper with a desktop publishing program (DTPs) such as Adobe InDesign. There are also a number of free DTPs available for download, which you can find by searching online.Alternately, you can type up and print out articles, and paste them on a larger sheet if you want to have a more DIY zine look for your newspaper., A newspaper’s masthead includes the name of the newspaper, as well as other information such as the date and issue number. You can also include the web address and a tagline if you have one.

, Choosing too many fonts will make your newspaper look too busy and it will be hard for readers to focus on your articles. Select one highly-readable font for the headlines and another one for the text of the articles.The size of text fonts should be about 10-point.Headlines can be larger, but keep them consistent. Giant, screaming headlines tend to take up unnecessary space and should be used only in rare cases.


The masthead can have a different font, but keep the rest of the newspaper consistent.

, The most timely and important articles should go on the front page. Accompany them with solid, catchy headlines. Include the bylines (credits) of the writers. Put the rest of the articles in their proper sections.


Pair these articles with compelling photographs. Include brief captions that explain the photos. Make sure to credit the photographer.

, Columns are much easier to read than big blocks of text. Divide up columns so that there are 4-5 columns across the page (depending on the size of the page). Don’t run the columns all the way down to the bottom of the page, however. Divide the page into thirds vertically and make each of these its own mini-section for an article or two.


If you are publishing online, you can have a more flexible format and will likely not lay out your newspaper in columns. Rather, you will just put blocks of text accompanied by pictures on the page., If you are including advertising, lay out the ads. Make sure the ads are the correct size that the advertisers purchased. Think about where you might place the ads. Many ads can go anywhere in your newspaper, but there may be some ads that are more suitable for certain sections. For example, if you have an ad for a concert, think about placing the ad in the arts section.


Advertising should not go on the front page of the newspaper.

, Depending on the size and circulation, you may be able to print your newspaper yourself. You can also take your digital file to a copy shop for printing. For more professional, newspaper-type printing, you will need to use a printer that does that sort of printing. Search online for a local option. You might also be able to use a regional printer.

, Give out your newspaper for free by placing it on people’s front doorsteps. This can be an expensive option, however, since you may want to wrap up the newspaper in a plastic bag so it doesn’t get wet. You will also need to print a lot of copies of the newspaper so you can reach a lot of homes., Many local businesses and stores are willing to put a pile of newspapers or flyers near their front doors or cash registers. Then interested customers can take these newspapers home. Check with stores, doctor and dentist offices, restaurants and cafes, and other places with a reception area to see if they will make your newspapers available for customers.Keep track of how fast your newspapers are being picked up. You may find that some areas or stores go through newspapers more quickly and need to be restocked, while other locations don’t go through their papers at all.

, You may already have an existing readership for your newspaper, especially if you are starting the newspaper for a membership-based organization. Mail the newspaper to these members.


Check with the post office to determine bulk postage and rates for periodicals., Online newspapers can take different forms. You might post news in a blog format, or you might have mocked up a newspaper-looking format that can then be read as a sort of online publication. Readers can either read the blog format or download the other format as a PDF or other document.


Especially for online publication, you should publicize your newspaper on social media so that people know you have published a new issue.

, Talk with another newspaper to see if you can insert your paper within one of their issues. This will likely cost you quite a bit of money, since the insertion process costs money."

Is it going to be a scientific publication, a collection of lifestyle opinion pieces or a feature on the local music scene? Come up with the basic idea for your magazine and how you might present it. Since you're making it yourself, there are no rules! The more unique, the better.You can come up with a title for your magazine right away, or wait until it's more cohesive if you're having trouble thinking of the right title. Whatever title you choose should reflect the theme of the magazine and be short and memorable enough to catch the eye of readers.;
, Now that you have a general theme or topic in mind, consider how you'd like to present your content. If it's scientific or informative in nature, it may make sense to arrange the articles in a linear fashion and include photographs and graphics related to what you'll be writing about. If the magazine's purpose is to showcase a creative pursuit, you can take more liberties with the format, interspersing poetry, drawings, paintings, and other features among the expository writing. As the editor of your magazine, you have total control over the direction it takes.Take a look at some of your favorite magazines, or some of the more polished publications on the shelves, to receive inspiration for the style of your own magazine. What stands out to you about these publications, and how can you recreate these details while making your own work stand out?

, Take whatever writings, artwork and other content you choose to put on display and start compiling your source materials. Separate different content types into sections to help you keep track of your raw material. Once you decide what to include in your magazine, you'll start to see the overall concept take form.While most of your content will be original pieces in the form of written articles, you can also piece your magazine together with photography, drawings, research information and even interviews with interesting figures.
It usually isn't a violation of any property laws to use copyrighted content or images in self-published work that isn't being sold for profit, but make sure you're careful about the sources you pull from anyway. The last thing you want is to get in hot water over exploiting your sources for an independent creative project., You don't have to do it all by yourself--seek out other creative minds to contribute content for your magazine. This is a great chance for writers, artists and other talented individuals to have their work and opinions featured in an actual publication. Including other people's original work can help make your magazine more balanced and allow it to reach a wide audience.


Reach out to creative people in your area to see if they'd be willing to have their work featured in your magazine. Even if it only reaches a small demographic and doesn't pay, any exposure is good exposure when you're trying to make a name for yourself.
If you're in school, look for contributions from science and art groups, bands or others with special knowledge that goes along with the subject of your magazine.

, Do you intend to include your own photography to complement the magazine's articles? What about pop cultural images for satirical use, or to give the publication an injection of zany relevance? Magazines implement many different visual elements in addition to their textual content, and you'll want to include a few in your own to make it engaging to readers.


When you use a photograph, make sure that it's either one you took yourself or that you have express permission to include it in your work.Remember what you learned in grade school: don't be afraid to break out the glue sticks and colored pencils in order to produce one-of-a-kind artwork for your magazine.

, Write your own articles about a chosen subject or solicit contributions from others for absorbing featured pieces. This is where the bulk of the content on your theme will come from. Make each article distinct by using it to highlight a different topic or approach to the subject matter, and break multiple articles up with graphics, interviews, artwork and other design elements.Base your articles on a particular motif for that issue of the magazine. If your magazine is about music, for instance, do a rock feature and include interviews and write-ups about rock bands in your area.
As with any form of writing, stay on top of grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. Proofreading every step of the way will make your magazine more professional.

, You're now starting to build content to fill the pages of your magazine, but what will those pages look like? Take chances with the layout of your magazine's pages to make it identifiable and unique. Use color printing or hand-drawing, play around with various fonts and configure articles and pictures to be visually appealing. No two pages should look the same!Designing page after page of content can be challenging. It's perfectly okay to take a somewhat random approach to where things go on the page, as long as the flow of the magazine makes sense. Trust your instincts.

, Visual aids like flow charts and linear timelines can make it easier to organize the wealth of content to be included in your magazine and let you plot the best order for the finished product. Try to look at the progression of the publication holistically, from beginning to end.

, Pen an initial draft of your selected articles. Include as much relevant information as you can while keeping the pacing of each article brisk and readable. Start pairing up written content with related photos and graphics. You can keep playing around with the order of the articles and how best to arrange other design elements as you compose your first draft. Just get the information out first, then use your intuition to streamline the content for the right flow.Your first draft should be a little messy. You'll have plenty of time to tighten it up later once you have all the key details in place.

, For most people it will probably be easiest to type and arrange the content in a word processor and then print the pages out. If for some reason you don't have access to a computer, or if the theme of your magazine calls for it, you can lay everything out by hand, giving the magazine an impressive hand-crafted aesthetic.


Choosing a publishing method will mostly come down to individual taste, but certain methods will be better suited to certain types of publications. For example, a magazine dealing with traditional art might contain original hand-drawn pictures, while one about modern psychology would probably benefit from a precise, straightforward publishing approach.
Printing the pages of your magazine will be much faster and easier, but will make less of a splash with readers. Hand-drawn pages will likely be more impressive, but require a much greater time commitment. If you plan to print multiple copies of an issue, hand-drawing pages can be especially labor intensive.

, Print the finished, proofread pages of your magazine and collate them in the right order. If you've gone the hand-designed route, write out a final draft that takes into consideration the space you plan to use to add pictures, titles, borders, etc. The ""guts"" of your magazine are now finished and ready to be bound with a completed cover.


You'll have no problem getting your pages in order if you've drawn them up by hand. Printing them, however, can cause complications depending on how you plan to bind the magazine. If each piece of paper will be a separate page, you can organize the pages by hand once they're printed. If you choose to fold the pages in half and then staple them to make the binding, you'll need to be certain you have articles and images in the correct order in the word processor, and that you're selecting the ""print for publishing"" option that arranges the document by page number.If you have a little money to play around with or need a more polished look for a school or work project, you can take your printed pages to a copy store like Kinko's or FedEx Office and have them reprinted on glossy paper like the professional magazines in the supermarket. This will be more expensive than printing the pages yourself at home, but the luster of the finished product will be worth it. They can even help you bind it there in the store.

, If you've been putting off coming up with a title for your magazine, now is the time to do it. The magazine will need a short, catchy title that reflects the theme and content it contains, as well as front and back cover designs that preview what's inside. Save your most impressive photos or artwork for the cover to attract readers with the magazine's visual presentation.Consider utilizing blurbs, or short descriptions, on your cover to provide insight into the magazine's contents, or bullet points that inform readers what they'll find in the issue.
For self-published works, a table of contents isn't always necessary, but can be useful if your magazine contains lots of information divided up by article.

, After your pages are printed or written out by hand and the cover is designed and ready, it's time to bring the whole thing together. Bind your magazine's pages together using staples or specialty binding tape for a cleaner, more professional finish. Double-check to make sure that everything is in the correct order before binding.To bind your magazine with staples, collate the pages and staple three or four times down the outer edge; you can also fold the pages in half for more of a pamphlet style and staple down the center (saddle stitching).
Binding tape is easy to use and holds well for most small print projects--just make sure you're applying the tape straight and even to avoid mistakes.Other forms of binding, such as gluing, lacing and stitching are also available to you, but require much more care and attention. These will need to be researched independently, as they are an art form in themselves.

, Show off your hard work! Hand out copies of your magazine to friends and family, and have them pass copies around to anyone else who might be interested. Sometimes you can even distribute or display self-published works in cafes or on school campuses so that a wider population of people will see it. You made your magazine to be read, so get it out there and let others see what you have to share.


Make sure you receive permission to distribute your magazine on school campuses or in places of business before you start. Whether or not it's okay to hand out or put publications on display in a given place may depend on the location and/or the policies of the owner."

Ask one family member of each family to provide the information that will come to make up your newspaper. This will help decide how much material you have, what sorts of information you have to build around, and also brainstorm about broader themes.


Ask your family members to contribute drawings, poems, stories, pictures, or anything they'd like their family to see. This is a great time to get input and make everyone feel involved.;
, One of the best reasons to make a family newspaper is to keep family updated on what your kids are doing. Don't simply list all of your children's accomplishments. Instead, have them write in their own words what they're doing and what's important in their lives. This will add a personal touch and really make your family feel connected to your children, even if they're far away.If your children don't want to write anything themselves, or are too young, do an interview. Some questions to ask them include: what they're doing, what they're proud of, what sorts of accomplishments they have recently achieved, and what they hope to achieve in the near future.

, Littering your paper with vacation stories may make your life sound better, but only represents a small snapshot of what your life is really like. Make sure to tell what's happening in your ordinary lives as the extraordinary.Don't inundate your readers with too many details. They will want to hear how your children are doing in school, but not what every day of school is like. Include a concise summary, rather than lengthy descriptions. Have a friend read the newspaper before you print it to help highlight what they might find most interesting and cut out some of the fluff.

, Be selective about how much information you are sharing. Don't include struggles your family has had, such as health issues, or business and career problems you've have in the past year. Keep things positive and light!


If you want them to know what is happening with your business, add them to an e-mail or mailing list for your business newsletter, if you have one. Keep your personal and business life separate in a family newspaper, unless it's general, good news about a career change or accomplishment.

, Invite your family to an upcoming birthday party, or include an article about Thanksgiving and invite the family to dine at your house. Although the paper will succeed in bringing your family together, the paper can also encourage real bonding between your family members., The paper should be informative, but also fun. This will make it a joy to read and also keep your children and other family members more interested in helping you work on it.


Include artwork by your children. This is a great way to promote your child to be creative and show off their talents. If they enjoy comics, have them write a comic.Include short writings by your children. This can be a joke, a story, a movie review, or even something informative. This way rather than just telling your family what your children are up to and good at, you'll be able to show them. This can also create a time-capsule for your child's creative expressions to look at down the road.
This can be a great time to link your extended family. Include news that recalls common family histories, such as vacation spots or your hometown. This will make the newspaper less an abstract news update and part of their life.

, You may have so much to tell your family that you are tempted to write lengthy paragraphs. This can give a lot of great information about what your family has been doing. But pictures and other forms of media are a great change of pace. Include plenty of quality pictures that accompany activities your describing and that chronicle what your family has been doing.If your kid is a budding photographer, have them include some of their photos. This can be things taken from their cell phone such as a selfie or a fun activity they did with friends. This is also a great spot to share artwork by your kid.

, The nuts and bolts aspects of creating a newspaper can be daunting. You may have a vision for what you want it to include, but not know how to get started. Choose a good software for your computer that makes the creation process simple.Look for one that is user friendly and has the features you're looking for. You might want to include a lot of pictures, flashy fonts, or a more simple design that emphasizes content. There are many great products involved like Quark that have templates available for free.You can even use Microsoft Word if this is easily available to you.Look through a newspaper for ideas. This is a great way to find things you like and don't like. Look for community newspapers that are more likely to have similar content you desire, and not giant daily papers that emphasize up-to-date news.

, Whether it's the ""Johnson Family Paper"" or ""The McDonald Journal,"" it should be creative and reflect that family's name and daily happenings. This can also be a time to narrow down a name that reflects your purpose. If you plan on coming out with a Christmas, New Years, or summer newspaper, you can choose a name that will reflect this.


Get your family's input on a name. You can choose a name that everyone is enthusiastic about to keep everyone involved.

, This mainly depends on how long you plan to make your paper and how much information you're able to come up with. You will need a lot of information if you'd like to release your paper every week as opposed to every month. However, if you have lots of stories and things to include, you may want to make your paper more frequent.


Making a newspaper should be fun. Don't make it so often that it becomes a burden to either your or the readers.

, Whether its for a school project or a summertime craft project, a family newspaper can be a great project for your children. Ask them about what looks visually appealing to them and look through examples of community newspapers. If you have the time, you can turn the production of the paper into a craft project where your kids get to show off their artistic side.


Buy paper, markers and glue and let your kids design part of the paper. Once they make something they like, you can make copies or scan the page and make it part of the paper. This will promote your kids' involvement but also be a great creative exercise for them.

, Whether you choose to send your paper by email, or deliver a printed version at each member's house, make sure that you find a way for each member of the family to read and delight in your wonderful paper.


E-mail is a great way to save cost and makes it more likely that you reach a wider number of family members. A digital creation will also take less work and maybe mean you are able to produce it more regularly than the process of a paper copy.

, If you print your newspaper, the printing of lots of copies and purchasing of paper and ink can become expensive. Price each paper so that the expenses of producing this paper can be covered without being a detriment to your personal finances.

Decide what you like about fashion magazines.,
Think about what you can gain from reading the type of articles that you like out of fashion magazines.,
Understand that most of the time, fashion magazines are basically huge ads.,
Look for the parts of fashion magazines that don't focus on fashion.,
If all else fails, consider getting a different type of magazine.",How to Get the Most Out of Reading Fashion Magazines," Are you in it for the interviews with fashion icons? Or are you more into your fashion magazine for the tips and tricks on fashion and beauty? If you know what you like about fashion magazines, you can feel like you didn't waste an hour of reading useless uninteresting articles.;
,


If you like the interviews with celebrities, you can gain some information about the celebrity that was interviewed which can help in social situations and it can also open up some new interests for you if you think that the celebrity you read about is particularly interesting. You also may find some tips from the celebrity about various things whether it's about fashion, or expressing yourself, or confidence.
If you're into the magazine for the beauty and fashion tips, you can learn about different ways to look good. Looking good can help with your confidence. You can also learn some techniques that will help you look better faster. This can reduce the stress in the morning about getting to work/school on time.
If you're into the magazine for the outfit ideas, you can get ideas on how to recreate the look while adding your own twist to it. The ""look-books"" that you sometimes find in magazines are very helpful for this, and even the ads can help out. Recreating looks with your own twist can help with your creativity and can help you express yourself. It can also help with confidence since if you feel comfortable with what you're wearing, and you feel like it shows ""the true you"" then you are more likely to feel better and more confident.

, This is very true. First there are the ads. Then there's the products and stores that they recommend, and then there's the celebrities that they put a good word in for during the interviews. If you understand this, then it can help you from buying something that you really wouldn't want if you hadn't seen it in your fashion magazine.

, It may sound absurd, but it's true. In TeenVogue, the have one article per issue about serious teen problems such as teen alcoholism and coping with and helping friends who are doing drugs. In InStyle, they have an entire section devoted to things about life. While most of the time this section includes products for throwing good parties and tips for throwing parties and such, it's still (slightly) drifting away from the ""fashion"" side of things. This section of the magazine is called ""Life, Etc.""

, If you sort of like the fashion part of the magazine, then consider getting a magazine that has a bit of that in it, but includes other things as well. For example, if you like the side of the fashion magazine that talks about life and gives you tips for life, try a magazine like Chatelaine, All You, or Canadian Living. If you like the celebrity part of the magazine, try getting a magazine like People, Star, OK! Magazine, or US Weekly Magazine. If you don't like the fashion magazines at all, try a completely different type of magazine that suits your interesting. For example, if you like playing video games, get a video game magazine like PC Gamer or GamePro.

Skim the material.,
Format your outline.,
Write the outline.,
Annotate your outline.,
Be flexible.,
Follow instructions.",How to Do a Chapter Outline1," An outline is a useful way to help you summarize information. Your first step to understanding the chapter is to read the material. Skimming means to read quickly and somewhat superficially.Focus on key terms. Many textbooks will put these significant words in bold print to help you quickly locate them.
Do not spend too much time trying to read each word. On your first read through, scan the information to get a sense of what the chapter is about.
Skim the chapter, reading the introduction and conclusion. Also read the first sentence or two of each paragraph. You are trying to figure out what the main points of the chapter are.;
, Once you understand the basic concept of the chapter, it is time to prepare your outline. Most outlines are formatted using a combination of numbers and letters. Typically, the main points are denoted with roman numerals, and the sub points are marked with letters.For example, if you are writing an outline for a chapter about the American Civil War, you want to start by organizing your outline with the main points.
It might be something such as: I. The Origins of the Conflict II. Significant Battles III. Impact on the North IV. Impact on the South V. Reconstruction.
Once you have your main points, you can add sub points. For I. The Origins of the Conflict, you could add A. Slavery B. State's Rights
Make sure that the points of the outline are based on the main points of the chapter. You could consider using the subheadings of the outline as your main points.

, Your outline will include additional components. After you have a format, you can work on writing the introduction. The introduction for your outline should be one paragraph long.The most important thing to include in your introduction is the thesis statement. The thesis is the argument, or main point, of the chapter.
For example, the thesis in the chapter on the Civil War might be, ""The Civil War was a victory for the North because of more material resources, such as metals, and a larger population base.""
Rewrite the thesis in your own words, and include it in your introduction. Your introduction should also give a brief overview of the significant points in the chapter.
The introduction should be at the beginning of the outline. Once that is finished, you can fill in the numerals and numbers with your main points.

, An effective outline will be succinct. You do not need to rewrite the entire chapter. However, you will want to add enough information to each of your points to give you a clear idea of what you are trying to comprehend.An annotation is a comment or explanation. Include an annotation for each of your sub points.
For example, you could annotate I. The Origins of the Conflict, A. Slavery, by saying something like, ""The South was resistant to reforming society without 4 million slaves. This was also an ideological cause of the war.
The annotations should provide enough information to be useful, but not enough to overwhelm you when you are trying to review your outline. 2-3 sentences is about the right length.

, It's a good idea to have a pretty clear picture of what you want your outline to look like. However, you should also be open to making changes. Remain flexible while you're working on your outline so that you can shape it to best fit your needs.


Leave room to add points. Maybe you originally planned to have only 5 main points, but you realized there are actually 6 topics that you need to cover.
Go ahead and add an additional point. Just make sure that what you add truly does need to be a key point. If it would work just as well as a sub point, it's probably best to make it one.
You can also remove material. Maybe your initial impression is that submarine warfare was a major factor in the outcome of the Civil War. If you later change your mind, you can remove that point.

, Sometimes your instructor might assign an outline as a graded assignment. It is a useful way to help you learn new skills. Your outline can also help your teacher tell if you are focusing on the right concepts.Complete all of the requirements. If your teacher asks for an 8 point outline, then your outline should have 8 points.
Ask for clarification. If you have questions about how to format your outline, ask your instructor for some specific guidelines.

Scan the chapter.,
Focus on the introduction and conclusion.,
Read actively.,
Make notes.",How to Do a Chapter Outline2," Outlines are a great way to help you learn and retain material. You can also learn to improve your reading skills so that you can become a more efficient learner. There are several things you can do to read faster and retain more information at the same time.In order to read efficiently, you do not need to focus on every word in the chapter. Instead, skim the chapter quickly to get a clear picture of the material covered.
Scanning does not mean that you should read in a sloppy manner. It simply means that you are reading with the purpose of finding specific information.
When you scan, consider your objectives when reading. For example, if you are looking for information about the root causes of the Civil War, don't let yourself get bogged down in a paragraph about the distance that a rifle could shoot.
Reading more efficiently will help you figure out what material belongs in your outline. The more effectively you read the material, the easier it will be to outline the chapter.

, The introduction and conclusion are often the most important parts of a chapter, book, or article. In the introduction, the author will generally lay out the thesis and other main points. The conclusion should reiterate the points that are most important.Read the chapter and the conclusion first. This will help you discern the main points and you will know what to focus on when you read the rest of the text.
Look for signposts. Authors will often help you by clearly stating what is most important.
For example, a sentence that begins, ""I will argue..."" is a good indication that the thesis will follow. You should also take note of paragraphs that begin with phrases such as ""It is important to understand..."" or ""One of the key points is...""

, Do not just let your eyes slide over the words without really focusing. Reading is an activity that requires you to engage with the content. Try using the SQ3R method to help you read more efficiently.""S"" stands for ""survey"". Scan the material, paying careful attention to the introduction, conclusion, and subheadings.
""Q"" is for ""question"". Write down any questions that you have about the material that you skimmed.
The 3 ""Rs"" stand for ""read"", ""recite"", and ""review"". Carefully read each section to answer your questions.
Recite your answers out loud. Verbalizing can help you retain material. Then, review your notes.

, As you are reading, make sure to take notes. Try to get in the habit of using an outline as your note taking method. If you can format your notes, they will be much more useful to you.Don't try to write down everything that you read. Focus on noting main points and any questions that you have.
Prepare the outline before you read the chapter thoroughly. Then you can fill in the numerals and letters as you read.
Avoid over-highlighting. Many students find highlighting very helpful. Just make sure that you are also reading and retaining, not just marking passages.

"
"
Review material frequently.,
Individualize your study plan.,
Choose the right environment.",How to Do a Chapter Outline3," An outline can be one of the most helpful tools when you are studying for an exam or writing a paper. Used in combination with other methods, an outline can become even more effective. Making a study schedule is another way you can help yourself succeed.Look at your notes several times a week. It is better to study in small increments rather than trying to ""cram"" for several hours straight.
Set aside 10-15 minutes a day most days of the week. Use this time to look over your outlines and any other notes.
Review your notes after class. You will retain material best if you look at it within 24 hours of making the outline or taking notes.

, Studying can be difficult, and at times, even boring. Try to look for ways to tailor your study sessions with your personality in mind. For example, if you love being outdoors, try doing your reading outside.Maybe you are a very social person. Ask some classmates to form a study group with you.
Look for methods that are helpful to you. For example, maybe you learn best by making flashcards to go along with your chapter outlines.

, It's important to pay attention to your surroundings when you are studying. Look for a room that is not too loud. Avoid watching TV when you are looking over your outlines.Make sure the room is a comfortable temperature to you. Your mind will wander if you are too hot or too cold.
Try having a light snack before you study. A banana or some nuts will give you energy and help you focus.

Physical press kits are useful for distributing at trade shows.
An online media kit is typically a single web page that links to all the appropriate information.Another common format for a digital media kit is a multi-page .pdf document.;
, Download or view press kits for large corporations and small businesses. Take note of what appeals to you, and what ideas you may be able to use for your own kit., In a single paragraph, explain who you are as a business, and what you do.

Include information about the physical locations of your company's offices, plants, or stores (if applicable.)
If you get stuck, consider hiring a professional copywriter to write your company bio.

, If you don't already have one, this is a good time to come up with an official company mission statement, or “manifesto.” This is a short statement that explains why your company is different from the rest.Your mission statement should encapsulate your company's business objectives, ethical standards, and core philosophies.
Your mission statement should answer four main questions: “What does your company do?,” “How does your company conduct business?,” “What is your target market?,” and “What value do you bring to the marketplace?”
If you need inspiration, the mission statements of Forbes' Fortune 500 companies are available online., Talk to your sales staff or customer service department to find out what questions customers ask most frequently. Compile any questions submitted by customers via the web, and include them as well.Keep both the questions and the answers simple and concise.
Only include the main questions your customers ask. If you want to write a more comprehensive FAQ, this should go on your main web site.

, Any time your company gets a positive mention in the media, you should keep a copy of the publication. Include the most interesting or most glowing reports in your media kit.Include a sampling of articles (3-5) that make your company look good. Too many articles can be overwhelming – you want the kit to keep your reader's attention.

, If you have a section of your website that collects customer comments, choose 2 or 3 of the most glowing recommendations to include in your press kit. You can also use any favorable comments that have been provided in writing.If you don't have any, ask your most valued repeat customers if they would be willing to contribute to your reviews section.
Never write your own recommendations, and pretend they came from a customer. Although you are unlikely to be caught, this is highly unethical.

, If your company issues official press releases, find 3 – 5 of the most impressive ones and include them in your kit. Try to choose press releases that generated any of the media articles you chose to include., If you have a company website with decent traffic, collect data on the number of page views, number of unique visitors, and how much time each spent, on average, at your site.

Edit the news release.,
For the final copy, at the top left corner, type in the following:


Contact: Insert Name of Contact
Telephone Number: Example: 555.555.555
Release Date: Type in the word ""Immediate"" or you can embargo the news release by typing in a later release date.,
Proofread twice.,
Include photos.,
Label the folders.,
Study sample releases.",How to Create a Media Kit3,", On a separate piece of paper, write down key goals. Be sure to include the “Five W's” in the news release: who, what, when, where and why.


Who – name the people who are involved in your story.
What – describe what happened.
When – include relevant dates to explain when this happened.
Where – tell your reader where the action occurred.
Why – sum up the point of your story. Why is it important? What ramifications might it have? Why did you want to share it with your reader (or the public)?

, Once the goals have been clarified, write a rough draft of the news release. Keep the news release brief (300-400 words) as editors and reporters work on quick deadlines.Write a catchy headline for your news release that sums up the point of the material.

, Be sure to check all facts and dates for accuracy. Check for spelling, grammar, and punctuation.

, Double space and start writing your news release. At the end of the news release, in the center of the page, type ### or 40 to show the news release has ended.

, Set the news release aside, if you have time, for one final edit. If you look at it with fresh eyes, you're likely to notice small mistakes you overlooked the first time.

, Take photos, if appropriate, and insert them in the folder. A two-envelope folder is good for this as you can put the news release on one side and the photo on the other. You can also include a disk with the information, if you know the format used by the local media. The disk can include the news release and photo, if desired. If this is done, include a hard copy of both the news release and photo along with the disk.

, Print your company name and logo on the label. Place the label on the front of the folder.

, Seek out press releases online from major corporations and small businesses. Model your releases on the best examples you can find.

Consider trying to publish your novel.",How to Write a Novel," Writing a novel is a creative process, and you never know when a good idea might come to you. Carry a notebook and a pen so you can jot down ideas wherever you go. You might feel inspired by something you hear on your morning commute, or while daydreaming in a coffee shop. You never know when you'll be inspired, so you should keep your eyes and ears open wherever you go.


Don't wait for inspiration to come to you. Writing is kind of like digestion — there won't be output if there's no input. For example, you know when you get an idea out of absolutely nowhere, while you're doing something totally irrelevant to your idea? That's when you observe something, let it slip into your subconscious where it gets processed, and at some point, returns back to your conscious. In some instances, these are some of the best resources for ideas — the spontaneity of these ideas can really help to develop rich irony or exciting twists and turns in your story.
Being a writer, you need constant inspiration. Sometimes, writers find it difficult to have ideas popping in their head. All writers face this problem, and the best medicine is inspiration.
It doesn't necessarily have to be a book — it can be a TV show, a movie or even travelling to an exhibition or art gallery. Inspiration comes in infinite forms!
Use your notebook to write fragments, paragraphs, or even sentences, that will become part of a more complete story.
Think about all of the stories you've been told — stories passed down from your great-grandmother, a story that fascinated you on the news, or even a ghost story from your childhood that has stuck with you.
Consider a moment from your childhood or past that stuck with you. It could be the mysterious death of a woman in your town, your old neighbor's obsession with pet ferrets, or a the trip you took to London that you can't stop thinking about. For example, the ice scene in One Hundred Years Of Solitude was based on the author's own boyhood experience.
People say that you should ""write what you know."" Others believe that you should ""write about what you don't know about what you know."" Think of something from your own life that has inspired, troubled, or intrigued you — how can you explore this topic more fully in a novel?

, Not every novel fits neatly into a certain category, but it's helpful to think about your intended genre and audience as you begin planning your work. Read all of the major works that fall into your chosen genre to get a good understanding of how to construct a novel according to the standards of your chosen genre. And if you haven't completely decided on one genre or are working in more than one genre, then it's no problem — it's more important to be aware of what tradition you're working in than to stick to one specific genre or category. Consider the following options:


Literary novels are intended to be works of art, complete with deep themes, symbolism, and complex literary devices. Read classic works by the great novelists and refer to helpful lists like The Guardian's ""100 Greatest Novels of All Time"".
Commercial novels are intended to entertain audiences and sell a lot of copies. They are divided into many genres, including science fiction, mysteries, thrillers, fantasies, romances, and historical fiction, among others. Many novels in these genres follow predictable formulas and are written in long series.
There is plenty of crossover between literary and commercial novels. Many writers of science fiction, fantasies, thrillers, and so on create novels just as complex and meaningful as writers of novels that are classically ""literary"". Just because a novel sells well does not mean it isn't a work of art (and vice versa).
Whatever genre you like or choose to focus on, you should read as many novels as possible within that genre if you haven't already. This will give you a better sense of the tradition you'll be working in — and how you can add to or challenge that tradition.
Part of doing research (see below for more on research) means reading other novels in your genre or tradition. For example, if you're writing a novel set in World War II told from a French perspective, read other novels about this topic. How will your novel be different from the rest?

, Once you've decided which genre (or genres) to write within, start dreaming up a setting for your novel. This goes beyond the particular city where your characters will dwell; you've got an entire universe to dream up. The setting you create will determine the mood and tone of your novel, and will affect the problems your characters will face. Think about these questions as you sketch out the parameters of the new world you're creating:


Will it be loosely based on places that are familiar to you in real life?
Will it be set in the present, or in some other time?
Will it take place on Earth, or somewhere imaginary?
Will it be centered in one city or neighborhood, or expanded to a range of locations?
What kind of society does it take place in?
What is the governmental and social structure?
Will it take place over the course of a month, a year, or decades?
Will the world be cast in shadows, or will it inspire optimism?

, The most important character of your novel will be your protagonist, who should be fleshed out with recognizable personality traits and thought patterns. Protagonists don't necessarily have to be likable, but they are usually relatable in some way so that readers stay interested in the story. One of the joys of reading fiction is recognizing yourself and living vicariously through your favorite characters.


Your protagonist and other characters don't have to be likable, but do have to be interesting. Like Lolita's Humbert Humbert, the character can be despicable — as long as he is fascinating.
Your novel also doesn't have to have just one protagonist. You can have multiple characters that engage the readers and engage each other harmoniously or through conflict, and you can even play around with telling the story from multiple points of view.
Your world should be populated with other characters too. Think about who will interact with your protagonist, serving as either friends or foils.
You don't have to know exactly who will populate your novel before you begin. As you write, you may find that your real protagonist is actually one of the minor characters you created, or you may find new characters creeping up where you didn't expect them to be.
Many novelists describe thinking of their characters as real people, asking themselves what the characters would do in a given situation and doing their best to stay ""true"" to the characters. Your characters should be so well-developed in your mind that it feels natural to help them navigate your fictional world.

, This step could either make or break your novel. Many times do novels have good characters, but not a good plot. If you do not do this right then it will drive your readers away. A common theme in designing a plot is to create conflict. Most novels, regardless of genre, have some sort of conflict. Tension builds until the problem comes to a climax, and then it's resolved in some way. This doesn't mean novels always have happy endings; it's more about providing motivations for the characters' actions and creating a vehicle for change and meaning across the span of your novel.


There is no set formula for the plot of a perfect novel. Though one traditional approach is to have rising action (building the details and tension in the story), a conflict (the main crisis of the novel), and a resolution (the final outcome of the crisis), this is not the only way to do it.
You can start with a central conflict and work backwards to show why it matters. For example, a girl can be returning home for her father's funeral, and the reader may not know why this is going to lead to a major conflict momentarily.
Your novel also doesn't have to neatly ""resolve"" the conflict. It's okay to leave some loose ends undone — if your readers like your novel, they'll be more than happy to tie up those loose ends themselves (speculation, fan fiction, discussion, and the like).
Your novel also doesn't have to be linear. It can start in the present, jump back and forth between the past and the present, or even start in the past and jump ahead twenty years — do whatever works best for telling your story. For an example of a nonlinear novel, see Hopscotch by Julio Cortázar.
Read some of your favorite novels and follow the plot arc. See how the novel is put together. This can be even more interesting if the novel isn't linear.

, Novels are typically written in the third or the first person, though they can also be written in the second person, or in a combination of multiple perspectives. The first person is the ""I"" voice that is told directly from the point of view of a character; the second person, less commonly used, addresses the readers as ""you"" and tells the reader exactly what he or she is doing, and the third person describes a character or set of characters from an outside perspective.


You don't have to decide on the point of view of the novel before you write the first sentence. In fact, you may write the first chapter — or even the entire draft of the first novel — before you have a better idea of whether the novel will sound better in the first person or the third.
There's no hard and fast rule about what point of view will work better for what type of novel. But if you're writing a panoramic novel with a wide variety of characters, the third person can help you manage all of the characters that populate your novel.

, Though it's great to start with a genre, plot, characters, and a setting in mind, if you want to write a novel, you shouldn't get too bogged down with all these details first. You can get inspired by something simple — a historical moment, a snatch of a conversation you hear in the grocery store, or a story your grandmother once told. This can be enough to get you writing and to start creating something from what you already know.


If you're too preoccupied about details even before your first draft, you may actually be stifling your own creativity.

, Every novelist has a different method for starting a new novel. Creating an outline can be a good way to map out your ideas and give you small goals to accomplish as you work toward the larger goal of writing an entire book. But if you write from the hip and don't have all the details — or any of them — down yet, then you should just let yourself get inspired and write whatever feels right until you latch on to something that really appeals to you.


Your outline does not have to be linear. You could do a quick sketch of each character's arc, or make a Venn diagram showing how different characters' stories will overlap.
Your outline is a guide, not a contract. The point is simply to jump-start the writing process with a visual representation of where the story might go. It will certainly change as you begin the writing process.
Sometimes an outline can actually be more helpful after you've completed a draft or two of your novel. This can help you have a better sense of how your novel is structured and can help you see what does or does not fit, or what should be expanded or compressed.

, To complete your first draft, you'll need to find a time and place that is conducive to your writing goals. You can write at the same time every morning or evening, write in spurts throughout the day, or write in long bouts three days a week. Whatever your routine may be, you can't just write when you're inspired — that's a myth. You'll have to treat writing like real work and stick to a regular routine, whether you ""feel"" like writing on a certain day or not.


Create a writing space to help you get into a routine. Find a cozy place where you can relax and there are no distractions. Invest in a chair that won't give you back pains after hours and hours of sitting and writing. You don't write a book in an hour; it takes months, so protect your back.
Your routine can also include what you need to eat or drink before or during your scheduled writing time. Does coffee make you feel more alert and aware, or too jittery to be productive? Does a big breakfast energize you, or leave you feeling sluggish?

, The amount of research you need to do will depend on the novel you write. Be sure to know, research, and learn as much as you can about your novel's setting (starting with the character's culture, locale, and era). The research you'll need to do to write historical fiction set during the Revolutionary War, for example, will be more copious than the research you may need to write a Young Adult novel inspired by your own experiences in high school. Still, whatever novel you're writing, you'll need to do enough research to make sure that the events in your novel are accurate and believable.



Make use of the library. You'll be able to find most of the information you need in your local library, and libraries are also excellent places to do some writing.

Interview people. If you're unsure whether a topic you're writing about rings true, find someone with firsthand knowledge on the subject and ask a lot of questions.
Researching can also influence the scope and content of your novel. As you read more about the time period or topic you're writing about, you may find some new details that are completely fascinating — and which change the entire direction of your novel.

, When you feel ready, sit down and begin writing the first draft of your novel. Don't worry about making the language perfect — no one will read this draft but you. Write without judging yourself. The first draft of a novel does not have to be spectacular — it just has to be done. Don't hold back. The roughest parts of the novel may turn out to be the most compelling in future drafts.


Make the commitment and write every single day — or as often as you can. You do need to understand what you're undertaking. Many wonderful writers go unnoticed and unread because their drawers are filled with unfinished novels.
Set small goals — finishing a chapter, a few pages, or a certain amount of words every few days — to keep yourself motivated.
You can also set long-term goals — let's say you're determined to finish the first draft of a novel in one year, or even in six months. Pick an ""end date"" and stick to it.

, You may get lucky and only need to write three drafts to get it right. Or you may write twenty drafts before your novel rings true. The important part is slowing down and figuring out when your work feels done and ready to share with others — if you share it too early, your creativity will be stifled. Once you've written enough drafts of your novel and feel ready to move on, you can move on to the editing stage.


When asked what was the hardest part of writing the ending for A Farewell to Arms (after rewriting it thirty-nine times) Ernest Hemingway famously replied, ""Getting the words right"".
After you've written your first draft, take a break from it for a few weeks, or even a few months, and try to sit back and read it as if you were one of your readers. Which parts need more explaining? Which parts are too long and boring?
A good rule of thumb is that if you find yourself skipping over long chunks of your novel, your readers will, too. How can you make the novel more appealing to them by cutting down or revising these cumbersome parts?
Each new draft, or new revision, can focus on addressing one or multiple aspects of the novel. For example, you can write one entirely new draft focusing on making the narrator more interesting to readers, another draft that hones in on developing the setting of the events, and a third that fleshes out the central romance in the novel.
Repeat this process over and over until you have a draft you'd be proud to show other people. It may be months or years before your novel gets to this stage; be patient with yourself.

, When you have reached the point where you have written a solid draft of your novel, you can start editing your work. Now you can focus on cutting paragraphs or sentences that aren't working, getting rid of any awkward or repetitive phrasing, or just streamlining your prose. There's no need to edit every sentence you write after the first draft — most of the words will change by the time you've completed a solid draft anyway.


Print out your novel and read it aloud. Cut or revise anything that just doesn't sound right.
Don't be too attached to your writing, for example a particular paragraph that just isn't moving the story forward. Challenge yourself to make the right decision. You can always use the paragraph in a different piece.

, Begin by showing your writing to someone you completely trust, so you can get used to the feeling of having others read your work. Since it isn't always easy to get honest feedback from people who love you and want to spare your feelings, consider getting outside opinions in one or more of the following ways:


Join a writing workshop. Local colleges and writing centers are great places to find fiction workshops. You'll review other people's writing and receive notes on yours as well.
Start a writing group. If you know a few other people who are writing novels, arrange to meet with them once a month to share progress and ask for tips.
Take advice with a grain of salt. If someone tells you a chapter isn't working, get a second opinion before you decide to cut it from your manuscript.
If you're really committed to finishing a novel, you can consider applying to an M.A. or an M.F.A. program in creative writing. These programs offer a supportive and inviting environment for sharing your work with others. Additionally, they can help motivate you by setting deadlines for completing your work.

, Many first-time novelists look at their novel as a learning experience that can help them write stronger fiction in the future; however, if you feel very confident about your novel and want to try to take it to a publisher, then there are a number of routes you can take. You can choose a traditional book publishing house, an online e-publisher, or self-publishing.


If you're going the traditional route, it helps to find a literary agent to shop your book around to publishers. Go to Writer's Market for a list of agents. You'll be asked to submit a query letter and a synopsis of your manuscript.
Self-publishing companies vary widely in quality. Before choosing a company, ask for a few samples so you can see the quality of their paper and printing.
And if you don't want to go the publishing route, that's not a problem. Congratulate yourself on a job well done and move on to your next creative project.

Roleplay.",How to Begin Writing a Good Action Novel," Before you start writing, you should have a general idea of what you want to write about. While you don’t need the specifics yet, try writing down your idea in a single sentence. By limiting your grand aspirations to a single line, you can refine story and focus your main conflict. , In action novels, it is a good idea to know the different types of weaponry, vehicles, and technology that will be used throughout the book. You should familiarize yourself with the application and practicality of various guns, military services, survival techniques, computer programs, and combat styles. This will make your writing more precise, and it will help you hammer out those tricky action scenes later. Places you can use for research include museums, libraries, and archives. If your book involves technical knowledge, try contacting an expert about the subject area. University websites, newspapers, and government agencies can be a good source of information on who to contact.
While it is good to research as much as possible, you don’t need to include all of your research in your book. Too much information will overwhelm the reader. Decide what is necessary as you write your novel.

, Maybe your story is a globetrotting adventure, or maybe it is set in your hometown. If you are able to, try visiting the locations you plan to write about. During your visit, record important details about the scenery. What is the climate like? Where are the major streets and landmarks? Engage all of your senses: what does it smell like? What can you see? How noisy is it? What kind of sounds do you hear?


Perhaps you can't afford a trip to Mount Everest, but you can visit a local mountain. Or perhaps you don't have time to visit Miami, but there is a beach close to you. You can still do on-site research without traveling across the world.

, This technique is great for visual writers. Try writing your main conflict in the middle of a sheet of paper. Trace a circle around it. Draw lines for each major event or catalyst off this center circle and write them down. As ideas come to you about your novel, draw more lines that show how these ideas connect to your larger narrative. Lines can interconnect, zigzag, or even branch off into other circles. Your mindmap can resemble a web, a tree, or even a spreadsheet. , Outlines not only sketch out the main action before you write your novel but can help you identify problems with the plot ahead of time. Write a list of the events of your novel as they happen. These headings should be short descriptors of each scene. Bullet points and subsections can record the details of each scene, such as which characters are present, where the action takes place, and how the action resolves.

, Record each plot event on a notecard. On a table, arrange the notecards so that you can visualize the entire plot. Reorganize the notecards as you brainstorm. You can move around events or reorder certain scenes. When you are ready to put the notecards away, be careful to keep them in their proper sequence, so that next time you need to consult them, they are already arranged correctly.

, Write your idea down in a single sentence. Once you are done, expand that single sentence into a paragraph that describes the main conflict, important events and obstacles, and the ending. Slowly expand your synopsis, first from one paragraph to one page and then from one page to four pages. Keep adding to this synopsis until you are ready to begin writing the novel itself. , To write convincing characters, you should know every detail of their lives. Write a summary or list for each character that notes their physical characteristics, history, motivations, relationships, personality traits, habits, and flaws. Important questions include: What skills does this character possess that make them useful through the book? Are they skilled in a particular fighting technique? Can they hack computers or fly a helicopter? How did they develop this skill? Do they have experience in the military or a tragic past?
Why is this character invested in the events of this book? What motivates them to participate in the action? What is at stake for them?
How does this character deal with anger? How does this character deal with tragedy? What about fear, disgust, excitement, or danger?
How does this character treat those they love? How does this character treat those they hate?

, Always have a notebook on hand for when inspiration strikes. Write down intriguing details as they come to you. As you research, keep detailed notes on everything you find. Later, when you are at your desk, you can use this journal as a reference.

, Freewriting is a process in which you sit down and write whatever is on your mind for fifteen minutes. You can ignore grammar, punctuation, or even logic. During this time, your pen should always be moving. This process helps start you writing and overcome the mental mind blocks that prevent you from beginning. Freewriting doesn’t have to be about your novel. In fact, if you are distracted, freewriting about your distractions can help clear your mind so that you can focus on your novel.

, There are plenty of websites, books, and forums that offer writing prompts to start the creative juices flowing. These can give you a starting place for writing your story.

, The first few lines or hook of a book is especially important in action novels. A strong opening will introduce the action without overwhelming the reader with too much description, dialogue, or exposition. There a few different types of effective hooks.


Introduce a character. The character should be doing something important. You don’t have to describe their personality or physical appearance yet.
Open with dialogue. An enticing line of dialogue can be the perfect way to begin a novel. It introduces a character while making a statement about their situation.
Begin with a bang. Your story might open with a catastrophic event or disaster which your hero has to solve.
Don’t get hung up on the opening. While it can be helpful to begin with the first sentences, if you are having difficulty with the beginning, feel free to move forward. Maybe the perfect opening will come to you later.

, In an action novel, this may be the most effective way to begin writing the story. In the opening lines, something should happen. There can be an explosion, a burglary, or a murder. Your character can be answering the phone, driving, or in pursuit. The action does not have to be necessarily about the main event, so long as it reveals something about the main character or conflict. You can also begin in the middle of the action. Perhaps a series of murders just occurred, and police just found the latest victim. Perhaps you open during a high speed car chase after a crime that has been committed. Regardless, you can begin in the middle of an exciting event but before the main conflict begins.

, Pick the ten most important scenes of your novel. These will be the backbone of your story. Your first scene should be the opening scene. The second and third scenes should mark the point of no return for your protagonist. The next several scenes should build up to the climax, around scene seven or eight, and the last scenes should wind down the action to its resolution.

, After you write a few major scenes, fill in the blanks between these chapters. How does the character get from Point A to Point B? Where do the characters find the weapons or tools that allow them to overcome the antagonist? How do the characters unravel the mystery at the heart of these major scenes?

, By writing a little bit every day, you will quickly start a habit, and when you sit down to write your novel, the words will flow more easily. Set a time when you are able to write consistently every day. You may want to set a word quota for the day or week that you force yourself to reach.


Some writers find it easier to write in the early morning or late at night. Experiment with your schedule to find the ideal time for yourself.

, There are plenty of groups and clubs that meet to discuss their writing. These groups can encourage you to keep writing, provide constructive feedback, and support you when you’re struggling You might even find a group that focuses exclusively on action novels. If you can’t find a local writing circle, start one yourself!

, Every week, write a checklist of your goals. These goals should be reasonable. How many words do you want to write by Friday? What scenes do you want to finish? Are you struggling with a particular character or part of the novel? As you complete these goals, check them off your list.

, Step away from your notebook or computer to rest. Distract yourself for thirty minutes with another activity. Cook dinner. Freewrite. Make some phone calls. Watch an episode of your favorite TV show. It is particularly helpful to engage in other creative activities. You can draw a picture, play an instrument, knit, or make a scrapbook. Whatever you do, don’t think about your novel for this period of time. When you return to your manuscript, you should be refreshed.

, Writing can be an isolated practice. If you are struggling with a particular aspect of your novel, ask a friend to sit down with you for 30 minutes and discuss your project. Just the process of speaking can help your brain work through your problems, and your friend might be able to give you helpful advice. , Exercise has been shown to increase productivity. People who regularly exercise also demonstrate higher levels of creativity. Since you are writing an action novel, it might be helpful to go out and be active!

, Imagine you are your protagonist. How would you act in this situation? As you go about your day, imagine what they would do in your place. If you are a runner, imagine you are running away from your antagonist or are involved in a high-speed chase. If you enjoy hiking, you can imagine one of your characters is lost in the woods. Keep your journal nearby and record these experiences as soon as possible.

Create your own writing prompts or use existing writing prompts to get your creative juices flowing. Sit down and do timed free writes using the writing prompts so you can start to get your ideas down on the page.


For example, you may do writing prompts that focus on creating a specific element of your novel, such as character or setting. A writing prompt about your main character’s worst day ever may be a good way to generate scenes with the main character for your novel.
You can find a list of writing prompts at Writer’s Digest.com.;
, Think about who is going to populate your novel. Who is your main character? What do they want? What kind of story will they tell? Build your main character and use them as a driving force in your novel.Give your main character a name, a gender, a profession or something that occupies their time, such as school or college.
Determine their physical attributes, such as their height, weight, eye color, and skin tone. Think about what clothing they wear and any personal items that they carry with them or have around often.
Give your main character a backstory that includes past memories, experiences, and important moments. For example, you may have a main character who had a traumatic childhood. You may not include the backstory in your novel but it can help you flesh out your main character more on the page.

, Brainstorm a central conflict for your novel. What does your main character want? What do your other characters want in the world of the novel? What are the obstacles that will make it difficult for your characters to get what they want? Having a central conflict or problem in the novel will raise the stakes for the reader and motivate them to continue reading.For example, you may have a novel set in a dystopian future where abortion is illegal all over the world. You may then have a character who needs an abortion but is unable to do so safely and legally in the world of the novel. The central conflict of the novel will then be her attempt to get an abortion by other, illegal means.

, Focusing on a specific setting can help you flesh out the world of your novel. Think about where you want to set your novel and in what time period. Maybe you want to set the novel in the past, in a small town based on your hometown. Or perhaps the novel will be set in the future, in a big American city. Choose a setting and determine the details of the setting for the novel.For example, you may choose a setting that uses landmarks in New York City and make them more futuristic. You may then put a bubble over New York City, which will limit how your characters can move in and out of the city on their own.

, Consider focusing on a central theme in your novel, such as love, loss, grief, or connection. Make the theme specific to your characters and your setting. Think about how you can explore a central theme through scenes in your novel and through the actions of your characters.For example, you may have characters who are a family of immigrants living in a small American town. You may then explore themes like identity, family loyalty, and love through your characters and your setting.

, To help you get ideas for your novel, you may select a genre that you enjoy reading and write the novel within that genre. For example, if you like reading historical romance novels, you may decide to write your own historical romance novel. If you enjoy science fiction novels, you may try your hand at writing science fiction.


There are a wide range of genres in writing, from literary fiction to science fiction to romance to crime to thriller. You may read books in a few genres to find the one that speaks to you as a writer.

, A plot diagram can help you organize your novel and identify the key moments in your novel. You can then use the plot diagram to help you write the novel. A plot diagram has six main sections: the setup, the inciting incident, the rising action, the climax, the falling action, and the resolution. Identify each section in your novel to help you plot out the story.For example, you may have a setup like a college student returning home to their small American hometown in time to celebrate Ramadan with their family. The inciting incident may then be the impending death of her mother. The rising action could be the college student’s lack of connection to her family and friends.
The climax could be the death of her mother. The falling action could be dealing with the death of her mother. The resolution could be the college student’s decision to remain in the small town and care for her remaining family members.

, Another way you can organize your novel is to make a chapter by chapter plan that you can follow. Break down your novel into chapters and make headings for each chapter. Then, create an outline for each chapter that notes the basic action of the chapter as well as the characters involved and the setting. When you start writing, you can fill in the gaps in each chapter.For example, you may have Chapter 1: Introduction of Main Character, where you introduce your main character and the setting to the reader. You may then have Chapter 2: Exploration of the Setting, where you delve more into the setting and the minor characters.

, The snowflake method may be a good option if you are looking for another approach to plotting out your novel. The snowflake method consists of: a one sentence summary of the novel, a one paragraph summary of the novel, character synopses, and a spreadsheet of scenes. These four elements can help you get a better sense of where your novel is headed, making the actual writing of the novel much easier.For example, you may have a one sentence summary of your novel like, “A young Muslim woman returns to her small American hometown and tries to reconnect with her family.” You can then extend this one sentence summary to create a one paragraph summary, character synopses, and a spreadsheet of scenes.

, The first sentence of your novel will act as guidepost for your reader. It should present the tone, voice, and style of the novel. It should also keep the reader engaged and make them want to read more. You want an opening line that is not boring or familiar.For example, you may have an opening line that states an interesting fact about your main character or your setting. Carson McCullers’ The Heart is a Lonely Hunter has a compelling opening line that states a fact about the setting and her characters: “In the town there were two mutes, and they were always together.”
Another option is to have an opening line that introduces the voice and style of the narrator. Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita is a good example of this, with the opening line, “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins.”

, Begin your novel with danger, action, or surprise. Start mid-scene or at a crucial point in a scene. Have your main character doing something dangerous or provocative. Show your main character making a crucial decision. Introduce the reader to the world of the novel through action so they are carried away and keep reading.For example, you may start with your character making the decision to return to their hometown, despite their complicated feelings towards their family. Or you may begin with a character hurrying to catch a train back to their hometown, a frantic rush to the station that will keep the reader engaged.

, Another way you can opening your novel is to start with interesting dialogue. Have your main character speak to another character at a crucial point in a scene. Choose dialogue that will set the tone and mood for the novel. This way, your reader will be interested in your story right away. Make sure the dialogue introduces setting and character.For example, you may have an opening line like, “‘You missed the train again,’ Melanie said to her sister, Ness.” This opening line introduces both characters, their relationship, and a conflict or issue.

, A good opening for a novel will leave the reader wanting more. It will also present questions or complications that will be teased out over the course of the novel. Try not to pack too many details or moments into your opening scene. Instead, present just enough to motivate the reader to keep going and to help them stay grounded in the world of the novel.One option is to start with an opening that lays out most of the main plot. Then, revise it so only the most necessary information is still present in the opening, but the reader is left wondering about the main plot as a whole. Taking out a few details can make your opening stronger and more engaging.

If you know whether you’ll be just writing or instead creating an oral presentation, for example, you can choose an article with a topic you would be comfortable discussing in each format. Your assignment might also include specific topics.


If you know you’re going to give an oral presentation on a news article, you might want to choose a news article that is more likely to capture the attention of your listeners.
Not all current events are written down in articles. Make sure your assignment doesn’t include internet video news reports as an option. If so, look on TV news channel websites for a news report video.;
, Sometimes teachers require that you look in a specific place for an article, or they may assign the articles themselves so that you don’t have to do any research.If you do have to find one on your own, decide if you are going to clip an article from the local paper or if you’re going to print one off the internet.


If you want to clip a printed article, find a local paper. You can ask your family members if they receive a newspaper, go to the local library and make a copy, or purchase a newspaper from a local grocery store.
The easiest location to find news articles is online. You can do an internet search to find the website for a newspaper and then print it out.

, Although you aren’t necessarily doing a research project for a current event, the same principles for finding a reliable source apply. For example, look at the URL of a web article you want to do. If it ends in “.org” or “.gov,” it is more reliable than “.com.”


The most reliable news websites are the websites that belong to printed newspapers, like thenewyorktimes.com or the website of your local paper. These website URLs end with “.com,” but if you know a website is rub by a reputable newspaper, it is reliable.
Try clicking on an author’s name to find their biography (often called a “bio”). If there is no author, you should consider not using this source. Most reliable newspaper articles have author names listed.Look below the article to see if there are any links to where the author got their information from. If there aren’t any, you might consider moving on.

, Because you are doing a current event, you want to make sure the information is actually current.A good rule of thumb is to ensure that your article is not more than one week old.


Look at the dateline of the article to find the date. A dateline is a line just beneath the title of an article that includes the article’s date. The author’s name is usually right above it., Make sure that your article is long enough to include details of the event. For example, an article that is only a few paragraphs long or with mostly pictures and only a few sentences of text is not enough information.Look for articles in newspapers that extend past the front page. Look for the phrase “continues on page…” at the bottom of an article.
On the internet, make sure that you have to scroll down the screen in order to read the whole article. This indicates that the article has some length.
If you are asked to find a video news report, make sure the report is several minutes long rather than just a few seconds.

, Even when an article is the correct length and comes from a reliable source, you have to make sure it is on the correct topic for your assignment. To determine this, read the headline, the first paragraph, and any subheadings.If the topic matches your assignment, you can proceed.

, You can turn in a current events report in more than one way. You can write a response to it, you can give an oral report, and you can give a presentation with visual aids. However your current event assignment is framed, it is important to do a thorough job.Look at your assignment to see what your teacher wants you to do.
If you can choose what kind of report to come up with, decide which one you would like to do. Keep in mind that with all three, there is some writing required.

, After deciding which type of report you are going to do, it is time to read the article for the first time. Do not scan the article this time. Instead, read every word. Try to picture each person or situation the article talks about in your mind. Such visualization can help you understand what you are reading.If an article has quotation marks, this means the writer is quoting someone. Try to imagine the person as they are saying the quote.
Look around the article for description words like “young” or “busy” to help you picture scenes described in an article.

, After reading the article, repeat it to yourself in your own words. Some call this paraphrase a summary, and it should be about one paragraph long, or one third as long as the original article.A paraphrase helps you understand what you have read so that you can create an accurate response.
For example, if the article says, ""Construction on Interstate 65 will continue through next year,"" you could write, ""This article said that construction on the local highway won't be over for a long time.""

, But this time, look for an answer to the 5 Ws and H: who, what, when, where, why, and how. In order to accurately do this, make a list on a sheet of paper and write down each of these elements. Then ask yourself questions about each one, writing down the answer for each.Ask yourself, “Who is this article about?” and list each individual or group on your paper.
“What is this article about?”
“When does the event this article talks about take place?”
“Where does the event in this article take place?”
”Why does this event take place? What are the motivations of the people involved?”
”How did the event in the article happen?”

, Use your answers to the 5Ws and H to determine the tone of the article. Most reporters who write articles have an opinion about their subject. What does the writer of your article think about the event the article is about? Are they in favor of it? Angry about what happened?You should include the tone in your current events report.
To assist you in determining what the tone is, ask yourself how you feel when you read the article.

, Before you write your response to this article, ask yourself a few questions to help you come up with an educated opinion about the article. Consider what information has been left out by the writer.Why would the writer ignore this information? Do you think it was on purpose?


Also think about if the author trying to persuade you to agree with their perspective.
Write down your answers to these questions to help you decide what your opinion about the article is.
Take this time to answer any other questions your assignment directly asks you to address.

, After you have determined what the article is about and decided what your opinion about it is, it is time to write your response. If you are turning in a written response, you will need both a summary paragraph and a reflection section. Use the summary you wrote when you were paraphrasing the article, proofreading to make sure it is ready to turn in.


Make sure the summary paragraph is either one paragraph or one third the length of the article, whenever is longer.For example, you could begin your summary with, ""This article covers the release of a new invention that will one day change the way we purify water.""

, Your reflection on the article should come in a paragraph after the summary. This reflection is your opinion about the current event.It also expresses your thoughts about the event and things you want to know more about beyond the article.This reflection section should also include your feelings about it.
For example, did the article make you angry? Happy? Confused? Explain what parts of the article made you feel this way.
You could write, ""This article made me feel happy because it reported something redeeming about people in another country.""

, After writing your current events response, you need to revise it. Proofread it for errors in punctuation, grammar, and spelling. Then look through each paragraph to make sure it makes logical sense.


For example, the summary paragraph should list things from the article in the same order that the article listed them.

, Most assignments require that you submit a copy of the article you used along with your response. For a written current event assignment, staple it to the response or use a paperclip.

, If you are presenting your current event response in a presentation with visual aids, you should compile the presentation in the same order as a written response: a summary followed by a reflection. However, in a presentation, you should add in an introduction and conclusion.Use a program like PowerPoint or Prezi to organize your visual aids.
Introduce yourself and your article in a slide before showing a summary slide.
Use images that match the ideas on each slide.
Find out if you can use note cards so that you don’t forget your ideas during your presentation. If so, write down what you want to say in the presentation on note cards.
For example, you could open with, ""Hello! My name is Susie Brown and today I want to share my response to a current event with you.""
You could end with, ""Thank you for listening to my presentation today.""

, After building the presentation, you need to look at it closely for grammar, punctuation, and organization. You may also want to practice the presentation with a friend or family member, or by yourself in front of a mirror.


Make sure your presentation is not too short or too long. Look at your assignment for rules about how long the presentation should be.

, Sometimes current event assignments ask you to give an oral presentation without any visual aids. If this is the case, find out if you are allowed to use note cards. Fill enough out on the cards to help you get through the presentation. If you aren’t allowed to have note cards, you may want to try memorizing your presentation.


If you have an oral presentation, practicing it several times before you go to class will be the most helpful.
Be prepared to be asked questions about your article in case your teacher wants the class to have a discussion.

, When you turn in your current event assignment, be sure to include the article you used. You should see if your teacher wants you to hand in a paper version of your article.

If you need to, start on easy reading books. Don't be afraid to start with children's books, adults are supposed to enjoy them too.


“A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.”― C.S. Lewis;
, After assessing your reading level, get a list of suggested books from a person who knows a great range of books. It might be your teacher, librarian, or even that elderly neighbor across the street.


You might want to start with classics. There's a big reason why they managed to survive through time --- because of their timeless content, designed to be appreciated by people from different generations.

, It's no use hovering over books about things you're not particularly interested in, especially when you're a novice reader. It might scrape you all of your interest and enthusiasm about starting to read.


“If you cannot read all your books...fondle them---peer into them, let them fall open where they will, read from the first sentence that arrests the eye, set them back on the shelves with your own hands, arrange them on your own plan so that you at least know where they are. Let them be your friends; let them, at any rate, be your acquaintances.”― Winston Churchill

, By all means, don't be shy about getting some recommendations for reading. Read the summary so you know what you're reading about. Life is too short to waste your time in a book that you can't learn from.

, Most readers are so afraid of getting ink into their book papers, depriving themselves of further education and enjoyment. Books have margins not only so the pages look neat and organized. Publishers add margins so readers can actually write phrases and comments on them.


Comment on particular phrases that caught your attention. This will make you remember the phrase and would help you remember it when chances come that you might want to say something about that particular phrase.
Whenever you encounter a new word, grab a dictionary and look for it's definition. Use the word immediately in a sentence. By the end of the book, you'll be surprised to know how much words have been added to your vocabulary.
“I kept always two books in my pocket, one to read, one to write in.”― Robert Louis Stevenson

, You might be surprised about the amount of inspiration, lessons and humor that you can get by remembering quotes from books. They're mighty useful too. Use them in greeting cards, in speeches etc.


Highlight quotes using crayons or something that won't seep through the page.
List them out in a small notebook for handy everyday use.

, Encountered something that piqued your interest? Research more about it! Books (especially classics) have history in them and what better way to learn painlessly than by learning through the experience of others? If you're reading Les Miserables or Hunchback of Notre Dame, by all means, feel free to learn about France and their culture. This will not only educate you, it will also help you imagine the scene of the book more.


“Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.”― Neil Gaiman, Coraline

, Learning more about the author of the novel actually makes you realize more about how the book came to be. You will learn the harmony and the irony of human mind as well as the fascinating things that might come from something or someone so ordinary.


“I don't believe in the kind of magic in my books. But I do believe something very magical can happen when you read a good book.”― J.K. Rowling

, Books without lessons are of no value. After reading a book, or even while reading it, think of the lessons and morals the author wants to impart you. Does it teach about true love, real friendship, bravery or finding your true self? Don't forget to dig deeper into phrases and conversations as you go.


“The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.”― Dr. Seuss, I Can Read With My Eyes Shut!

, Oh, the joy of making friends through books. Share what you learned, share your new found passion. Join a book club and meet people with the same interest, you'll be amazed how talking about a single book can really liven up conversations. Who knows? You might even help someone realize their dream and future career.


“If we encounter a man of rare intellect, we should ask him what books he reads.”― Ralph Waldo Emerson

, By extra work, I mean, go extra miles to appreciate the book.

Read art books about the book you just read, if they are available. Some publishers publish art books for collectors and fans.
If you're into art, draw/paint characters from the book or the scenery.






If movies/musicals about the book are available, try to watch them as they might help you clarify events better.
If you're into music and you liked the soundtracks from the movie/musical, find some time to learn them or even just listen to them
If you don't have your own books, make a step and start building your own library of personal favorites.
“It is a great thing to start life with a small number of really good books which are your very own.”― Arthur Conan Doyle

, Now that you have tried reading a novel (and hopefully, have enjoyed it,) it's now time to read another book. The next book could (though not limited to) be similar to the one you have just read --- it might be of the same theme, scenario, author or similar plot.


If before, you can only read 5mins/day (which is considerably good for first-timers) you may want to increase it every time until you can genuinely say that you prefer books over other hobbies like watching reality shows and playing violent video games.
“I find television very educating. Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.”― Groucho Marx

Draw inspiration from a key theme of the story.,
Name the title after an important setting.,
Choose a title inspired by a pivotal event in the story.,
Base the title on your book’s main character.,
Name the title after a memorable line in the story.,
Research.,
Check out your own bookshelves.,
Use an allusion.,
Create a genre-appropriate title.,
Limit the length.,
Make it interesting.,
Use alliteration sparingly and with caution.",How to Create a Good Story Title," A successful title should fit the story in an apt but evocative way.Think about the major theme of your story--is it revenge? grief? alienation?--and think of titles that evoke that theme. If, for example, the theme is redemption, you might title your story something like “Falling into Grace.”;
, If one particular setting plays a central role in the story, consider using that setting for your title.


For example, if the crux of your story is something that happened in a town called Washington Depot, you might simply title the story “Washington Depot.” Or you might draw inspiration from events that happen there title the story something like “The Wraiths of Washington Depot” or “Washington Depot in Flames.”

, If there’s a particular event that either predominates the story or plays a key role in setting events in motion, consider using that as your title inspiration.


For example, you might devise something like, “What Happened in the Morning” or “A Death Among Thieves.”

, Naming the book after an important character can provide a kind of compelling simplicity to a title. It helps, though, if the character’s name is something notable or memorable.A number of venerated authors have gone this route: Charles Dickens with David Copperfield and Oliver Twist, Charlotte Bronte with Jane Eyre, and Miguel de Cervantes with Don Quixote.

, If you have a particularly clever or original turn of phrase in your story that captures an important element or theme, use it or a version of it for your title.


For example, novels like To Kill a Mockingbird, They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?, and Sleepless in Seattle are all based on lines from the stories themselves., Take inventory of the key elements of your story, particularly objects and places. Research those places and objects and look for title inspiration.For example, if your story centers on an emerald passed down through generations of the same family, you might research emeralds and find that they’ve traditionally been associated with faith and hope. So you might title your story something like “The Rock of Hope.”

, Look over the book titles on your own shelves and note down the titles that jump out at you.


Write down both the titles that jump out to you now and the books whose titles alone drew you in.Review your list and try to determine what the successful titles have in common. For example, do they appeal to the senses, appeal to the reader’s imagination, etc?

, An allusion is a reference to or a phrase taken from an external source like another literary work, a song, or even something as commonplace as a brand or slogan.


Many authors have taken inspiration from classic works, including William Faulkner, whose Sound and the Fury is inspired by a line in Macbeth,and John Steinbeck, whose Grapes of Wrath is an allusion to a line in “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.”Other authors have drawn inspiration from local vernacular sayings, like the London Cockney saying “queer as a clockwork orange” that inspired Anthony Burgess’s A Clockwork Orange.Still others have used allusions to popular culture, like Kurt Vonnegut, who used the Wheaties slogan for his book Breakfast of Champions., If you choose a title that sounds like it belongs in one genre while the actual content of the story belongs in another, you’ll not only confuse potential readers, you may alienate them.


For example, if your title sounds distinctly fantasy-esque, like “The Dragon of the Old Tower,” but the story is in fact about modern-day brokers on Wall Street, you’ll alienate those who pick up your story looking for fantasy and you’ll miss entirely those looking for a story about something modern or about the world of elite finance, etc.

, In the majority of cases, titles that are brief but impactful are more successful than those that are long and difficult to remember.


For example, “A Man Discovers the Perils of a Solo Trek Through the Yukon” is likely less compelling to potential readers than “To Build a Fire,” which is shorter and more imaginative., Titles that use poetic language, vivid imagery, or a bit of mystery tend to be alluring to potential readers.


Poetic language in a title, like “A Rose for Emily” or Gone with the Wind, draws readers with an elegant turn of phrase that promises an equally poetic story or writing style.
Titles that evoke vivid imagery appeal to readers because they conjure something tangible and meaningful. A title like Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, though long, creates an immediate and vivid image that conjures an idea of a battle between good and evil.Imbuing your title with a bit of mystery can also draw readers in. A title like Something Wicked This Way Comes (also an allusion from Macbeth) or “The Black Cat” give just enough information to raise questions that will pull the reader into the story.

, Though alliteration--the repetition of successive sounds at the beginning of words--can make a title catchier or more memorable, it can also make it sound trite or hokey if not done well.


Subtle alliteration, like I Capture the Castle or The Count of Monte Cristo, can add appeal to a title.
Obvious or forced alliteration, on the other hand--like ""The Guileless Guide of Gullible Gus"" or ""The Especially Exciting Endeavors of Elanor Ellis""--can easily dissuade a potential reader from picking up your story.

Purchase a blank book to write your recipes in.,
Ask the older folks for their recipes.,
Write the recipes in your own handwriting.,
Compose a foreword.,
Sketch or doodle in the pages.,
Don't limit your book to recipes.,
Put some pictures in it.",How to Create a Family Cookbook," You can choose from an abundance of different styles. Be sure to get the lined ones; and for a cookbook, it's really nice if you can find one that's spiral bound, so it can lay flat on a counter or remain open without a special holder. Be sure the book is of good quality - it's going to be a treasure to your family.;
, Don't be shy - they'll be thrilled. These gems could be lost forever if you wait until the old folks pass away, so go as soon as possible and gather the recipes for Aunt Margie's devilled egg recipe, Great Grandma's lemon cake, Mom's baked beans, Grandma's pea salad, your brother's barbecue sauce, your own applesauce. Read them and if you want, test them before transferring them to your family book to make sure they make sense and are correct. You should also ask your relatives for photos and memories surrounding each recipe.

, Unless your penmanship is so horrible nobody can read it but you (and even you have trouble), your family will appreciate your longhand recipes. Check the Tips below for some guidelines with recipe formatting. Use a good quality pen that leaves a dark impression. Cheap pens with blue ink, for example, often fade. Use blue only if the pen is very good quality and the words are strong in color. Black is better, otherwise. Oddly, pencil can be a great choice, too, because it will never fade - the only caveat there is to spray a little hairspray (a workable fixative is available at most craft stores, but hairspray works fine, too) over the page once you're satisfied, to keep the graphite from smudging when you touch it.

, Leave a message in the first pages for your family members. This book is meant to be handed down, and decades from now, your words will remind your family of you.

, If you feel like it, do it! Give an impression of how the dish should look if you feel inclined.

, Add helpful kitchen tips, your opinions, your ideas for variations on these well-loved recipes. Add anecdotes that will be amusing for those who remember you, and for those who don't, which give a picture of your personality for those who follow after.

, Pictures of your family eating these dishes can really add to this book - take a picture, for example, of your family members gathering around the table, which has been laid with all your holiday dishes; or at a back yard gathering where one of the dishes in the book is being served. Printing them out on paper will make it easy to use a spray adhesive or glue stick to mount the photos in the book.

Write out your life timeline.,
Identify the main characters.,
Pull out the best stories.,
Write in your own voice.,
Be revealing.,
Capture the spirit of the times.",How to Write an Autobiography1," Start writing your autobiography by conducting research on your own life. Creating a timeline of your life is a good way to make sure you include all the most important dates and events, and it gives you a structure to build upon. You can consider this the ""brainstorming"" phase, so don't hesitate to write down everything you can remember, even if you don't think the memory will make it into the final version of the book.


Your autobiography doesn't have to begin with your birth. You may want to include some family history as well. Write down information about your ancestry, your grandparents' lives, your parents' lives, and so on. Having information about your family history will help readers get a sense of how you became the person you are.
What happened when you were a teenager? What led you to make the decisions you made?
Did you go to college? Write about those transitory years, too.
Write about your career, your relationships, your children, and any big life-altering events that occurred.;
, Every good story has interesting characters, friends and foes who help move the plot along. Who are the characters in your life? It's a given that your parents will play a role, along with your spouse and other close family members. Think beyond your immediate family to others who have affected your life and should play a role in your autobiography.


Teachers, coaches, mentors, and bosses are extremely influential in people's lives. Decide whether someone who has been a role model (or the opposite) for you will figure into your story.
Ex boyfriends and girlfriends might co-star in some interesting stories.
What enemies have you had in life? Your story will be boring if you don't include some conflicts.
Offbeat characters such as animals, celebrities you've never met, and even cities are often points of interest in an autobiography.

, The story of your entire life would start to get pretty long-winded, so you'll have to make some decisions about what anecdotes you're going to include. Begin drafting your manuscript by writing out the main stories that will be woven together to create a picture of your life. There are a few main topics that most autobiographies cover since readers find them fascinating.


The childhood story. Whether your childhood was happy or traumatic, you should include a few anecdotes that give a picture of who you were and what you experienced at the time. You can tell the story of your childhood by breaking it down into smaller anecdotes that illustrate your personality - your parents' reaction when you brought home a stray dog, the time you climbed out the window at school and ran away for 3 days, your friendly relationship with a homeless person living in the woods . . . get creative.
The coming of age story. This heady and often sensual period in a human's life is always of interest to readers. Remember that it's not about writing something unique; everyone comes of age. It's about writing something that resonates with readers.
The falling in love story. You could also write the opposite of this, the never-finding-love story.
The identity crisis story. This usually occurs in the 30s or 40s, and is sometimes referred to as a mid-life crisis.
The story of facing down some force of evil. Whether its your battle with addiction, a controlling lover, or a madman who tried to kill your family, you've got to write about conflict you've experienced.

, People read autobiographies to gain insight on what its like to be someone else. Being authentically you is a sure way to keep people engaged. If your writing is formal and stiff, or if it reads like a college essay instead of an expose on your life, people will have trouble getting through the book.


Write as though you're opening your heart to a trusted friend, in prose that's clear, strong and not too cluttered with vocabulary words you rarely use.
Write so that your personality is revealed. Are you funny? Intense? Spiritual? Dramatic? Don't hold back; your personality should come through in the way you tell your story.

, You don't have to be explicit, but it's important to reveal truths about yourself and your life in an autobiography. Don't let the book become a list of your accomplishments, with all the negative material carefully kept under the rug. Present yourself as a whole person, sharing talents and flaws alike, and your readers will be able to identify with you and hopefully root for you as they make their way through your story.


Don't always cast yourself in a positive light. You can have foibles and still be the protagonist. Reveal mistakes you've made and times when you've failed yourself and other people.
Reveal your inner thoughts. Share your opinions and ideas, including those that may spark controversy. Be true to yourself through your autobiography.

, How was your story shaped by the moment in history in which it took place? What wars influenced your politics? What cultural events inspired you? Discussing what happened in the world at large during your lifetime is a good way to make your story more relevant and interesting to those reading it.

Create an overarching plot.,
Decide where the story is going to start.,
Weave in themes.Use the major themes of your life as a way to tie stories together, connecting your past and your present.,
Take a step back to reflect.,
Use chapter divisions to give the book structure.",How to Write an Autobiography2," Now that you know what content you want to include in your autobiography, think about how you want to structure your book. Like any great book, your autobiography needs a great plot. Work with the material you have to craft an interesting story that builds toward a climax and ultimately resolves. Create a narrative arc by organizing and filling out your written memories and anecdotes so that they flow together logically.


What's your central conflict? What's the biggest obstacle life presented that took years to overcome or come to terms with? Maybe it's an illness you were diagnosed with at an early age, a relationship wrought with turmoil, a series of career setbacks, a goal you worked for decades to achieve, or any other number of things. Look to your favorite books and movies for more examples of conflicts.
Build tension and suspense. Structure the narrative so that you have a series of stories leading up to the climax of the conflict. If you central conflict is trying to reach the goal of competing in the Olympics for skiing, lead up to it with stories of small successes and plenty of failures. You want your readers to ask, will she make it? Can he do it? What's going to happen next?
Have a climax. You'll get to the point in your story when it's time for the conflict to come to a head. The day of the big competition has arrived, a showdown happens with your worst enemy, your gambling habit gets the better of you and you lose all your money - you get the picture.
End with a resolution. Most autobiographies have happy endings, because the person writing the story lived to tell the tale - and hopefully get it published. Even if your ending isn't cheerful, it should be deeply satisfying. You somehow accomplished your goal or won the day. Even if you lost, you came to terms with it and gained wisdom.

, You could a straightforward chronology of your life, beginning with your birth and ending in the present, but mixing up the chronology can make the story more interesting.


You could frame the entire autobiography with reflections from the present, telling your story through a series of flashbacks.
You could begin the story with a poignant moment from your childhood, go backward to tell the story of your heritage, move forward to your college years, and launch into the story of your career, with anecdotes from your childhood sprinkled in for comic relief.

, Aside from the central conflict, what themes have followed you throughout your life? A fondness for certain holidays, your fascination with a certain place that you visited over and over, a certain type of guy you've always fallen for, a rich spiritual life you fall back on again and again. Bring up the themes every so often to help form a cohesive picture of your life.

, You're chronicling your life lessons, but what have you learned from them? Relay your intentions, desires, feelings of loss, feelings of joy, the wisdom you've gained, and other inner thoughts from time to time throughout the book. Taking a step back from the action of the story to reflect on what it all means is a good way to add depth to your autobiography.

, Chapters are useful because they allow you to move on from discussing certain life periods or events. There's a reason we have the expression that we've ""closed a chapter"" or ""opened a new chapter"" in life, and its even more applicable when discussing an autobiography. Chapter breaks allow you to skip forward 10 years, go back in time, or start describing a new theme without jarring the reader too much.


Consider ending chapters on a poignant or suspenseful note, so people can't wait to start the next one.
The beginnings of chapters are a good place to take a bird's eye view of your past, describe the setting of a place, and set the tone for what's to come.

Make sure you get the facts right.,
Edit your draft.,
Share it with other people.,
Hire a copyeditor.,
Come up with a title.",How to Write an Autobiography3," Double check dates, names, descriptions of events, and other items you're including in your book to make sure you've gotten all the facts down correctly. Even though you're writing the story of your own life, you shouldn't publish incorrect information about what occurred.


You can stretch the truth about your own goals and intentions, but don't include fabricated conversations with real people, or altered versions of events that really happened. Of course you won't remember everything perfectly, but you should reflect reality as best you can.
Get permission to use people's names or quote them if you're including content on what other people said or did. Some people don't appreciate appearing as a character in someone else's autobiography, and you should respect that by altering the way you describe them or changing their names if necessary.

, Once you've finished your first draft, go back through it with a fine-toothed comb. Reorganize passages, paragraphs and even chapters where necessary. Replace mundane words and make your phrasing more interesting and clear. Correct your spelling and grammar.

, Present your autobiography to your reading club or a friend so you can get an outside opinion. Stories you find impossibly funny might seem dull to someone else. Get feedback from several people if you can, so you'll have a better idea of how your book comes across to other people.


If several people recommend cutting a certain section, strongly consider making the cut.
Try to get opinions from people outside your circle of family and friends. People who know you might try to spare your feelings, or they might be biased - especially if they appear in the story.

, A good copyeditor will clean up your writing and make the dull parts shine.Whether you're planning on getting your book published at a publishing house or going the self-publishing route, it's never a bad idea to have a professional polish your book at the end of the writing process.

, It should match the tone and style of your book, in addition to being attention-grabbing and intriguing. Keep the title short and memorable, rather than wordy and difficult to grasp. You could title it with your name and the words ""My Autobiography"" or choose something less direct. Here are some famous autobiography titles that perfectly capture the stories inside:



Bossy Pants, by Tina Fey.

My Confession, by Leo Tolstoy.

A Long Walk to Freedom, by Nelson Mandela.

The Sound of Laughter, by Peter Kay."

Take steps to self publish your book.,
Consider finding a literary agent.If you want to publish your autobiography and share it with the world, enlisting the help of a literary agent can get you on your way.,
Submit a query letter directly to publishers.,
Look into publishing your book online.This is an increasingly popular method for publishing books, and a great way to save on printing and shipping expenses for all involved.",How to Write an Autobiography4," Even if you don't want to worry about trying to sell your book to the public, you might want to have it designed and printed to keep for yourself and give to your family members and other people featured in the book. Research companies that offer book designing, printing, and shipping services, and decide how many copies you'd like to order.Many companies offering these services produce books that look just as professional as those printed by traditional publishing houses.


If you don't want to pay for a publishing service, you can still create a nice copy of your book by taking it to a copy store and having it printed and bound.

, Research agents that work with autobiographies and send them a query letter with information about your book, yourself, and how you think the book should be marketed.


Start the query letter with an airtight blurb succinctly describing the highlights of the book. Situate your book in the correct genre, and describe what will make it stand out from the rest. Tell the agent why you think he or she is the right person to shop your book around to publishers.
Send sample chapters to agents who show interest.
Sign a contract with an agent you trust. Make sure to read the contract carefully and check into the agent's history before signing anything.

, If you don't want to take the time to find an agent, you can submit a letter directly to publishers and see if anyone bites. Research publishers that publishes books in the same genre. Don't send the entire manuscript right away; wait until you get a manuscript request from the publisher.


Many publishers don't accept unsolicited manuscripts or queries. Make sure you only send letters to publishers that accept them.
If a publisher decides to move forward with a book deal with you, you'll need to sign a contract and set up a schedule for editing, designing, proofreading, and finally publishing the book.

, Research online publishers that publish the books in the same genre, submit your query letter, and move forward with editing and publishing the text.
