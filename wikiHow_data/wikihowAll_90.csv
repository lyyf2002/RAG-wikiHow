Cheesecloth can be bought at most gourmet grocery stores, cheese making depots, and online.

, After twenty four to forty eight hours have passed, examine the beans to see if they’re ready to eat. Sprouted beans will have a small white tail and a split bean body. If you prefer bean sprouts with longer tails, let the beans continue sprouting for a few more hours.Don’t let the beans sprout for more than a few days.

Bring the meat to a boil and continue boiling until it's tender.Depending on what meats you used, it may take several hours before the internal organs are tender. Check the meats every 20 to 30 minutes if you're unsure how long you'll need to boil them.

, Cut the goat tenderloin into 1/2-inch cubes. In another large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Add the tenderloin and cook it until it browns on all sides. You'll need to stir it frequently so it doesn't stick and burn. Remove the browned tenderloin to a separate bowl.

Experiment a lot and have a sense of adventure.",How to Match Wines to Asian Food," While you'll need to taste the spice differences and match the wines accordingly, as a general rule, look for fruitier, fresh, crisp and moderately aromatic wines to match spicy Asian dishes.The Rieslings and Traminers are a good choice.


Avoid oaky and buttery whites, or neutral and dry whites for the most part.Restaurant styles for Asian food include: Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Merlot, and Italian varietals (such as Barbera and Sangiovese).;
, Dishes redolent of lemongrass, orange, or other citrus flavours will often match well with a citrus-based Semillon, especially young ones. Try Chardonnay/Semillon and Sauvignon/Semillon blends as well. Riesling is a good choice for lemon-based sauces., The clean, pure, and fresh taste is a good match for these flavors.For Thai food, try dry but fruity wines to match the salty and sweet flavors.Sauvignons, Riesling and Semillons can work well, as can lightly chilled New World reds and Beaujolais-Villages., Most Chinese food tends to be delicate and slightly sweet, so the wine needs to be considerate of this. Suitable wines include Riesling, Champagne (demi-sec or brut) and New World Pinot Noirs., Japanese dishes can be difficult to match to a wine because of the wasabi, pickles, and dipping sauce flavors. Other flavors that might work include Chablis, firm, dry whites and if you must try a red, go for a Beaujolais., Most stir-fries carry heavier sauces and flavours and can handle a fuller bodied wine. Try well rounded Chardonnays.

, Curries and thick sauce dishes might go well with such wines as Merlot and Shiraz.


Modern New World white wines are better able to cope with the bitter, sour, and astringent complexities found in curries and other Indian hot food than classic European wines.Pinot Gris is a good choice for richly flavored and textured Asian food, such as Vietnamese pork, or prawn rolls with a peanut sauce.Avoid heavy tannins and oak with hot Asian food and experiment with chilling the wine lightly before use., The ideas outlined in this article are suggestions and some may not work to your liking, while others may be spot on. It's a good idea to keep a notebook of the successes (and failures!) and rely on that to build up your knowledge of what matches work best.

Wontons can have a wide variety of fillings - the exact type of filling you use is up to you. One very common type of filling is made from ground pork and minced shrimp held together with flour or cornstarch.Spices and herbs like garlic and green onions are often added to this filling.;
, Ensure your hands are clean, then dip a finger in your warm water and use it to moisten the edges of the wrapper. This helps the wonton hold together and stay shut during the cooking process.

,


Place about a teaspoon of filling (or less) in the very center of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half to make a rectangular shape. Press gently to force out any air that's trapped under the fold - you don't want any air bubbles in your wonton. This is because any air that's trapped within the wonton will naturally expand as it's heated during cooking, potentially rupturing the wonton.
Don't over-stuff your wonton - this can keep it from cooking thoroughly. A good rule of thumb is that you've over-stuffed your wonton if you can't fold it in half a second time at this point in the process.

, Next, you'll want to fold the wonton back over itself in the direction of the filling. In other words, take the two corners of the rectangle formed by the wrapper that are on the same edge as the ball of filling and fold them over each other to make a circular or crescent-shaped dumpling. Then, dip your finger in the warm water, wet one of the edges you just folded over the other, and re-fold it, pinching to seal the edges together.

, Congratulations - you've just wrapped your first wonton. With practice, this skill will become second-nature. Use the rest of your filling and wrappers to make more wontons in the same way as you formed the first. Cook by boiling, deep-frying, or pan-frying. Alternatively, refrigerate immediately.

"
"
Place your filling in the center of the wrapper.,
Fold one corner inward.,
Fold the opposite corner inward.,
Fold the two remaining corners into an upward ""point"".",How to Wrap Wontons2," This wrapping method gives you a wonton that looks a little like a grocery bag with its handles stretched tight. Begin in the same way as you did for the method above. Lay your wrapper down flat in your work area and add about one teaspoon of filling in the very center.

, Next, grab one of the wrapper's corners and fold it over your ball of filling. The tip of the corner should be at (or even slightly past) the center of the wonton. Moisten the top of this corner of the wrapper with warm water after you've folded it.


You don't need to moisten the corner's bottom edge. It will naturally adhere to the filling somewhat, but even this isn't essential for a wonton that holds together.

, Next, grab the corner that's opposite the one you just folded - in other words, the corner diagonally across from it. Take this corner and gently fold it over the top of the filling and the other corner. The tips of the two corners should overlap slightly.


When you fold this second corner over the top, it should gently adhere to the corner underneath because of the water you used to moisten it.

, Next, you'll need to fold the two remaining corners (the other set of diagonal opposites) together. Moisten one (not both) of the remaining corners with warm water. Then, take each corner and fold it neatly over the filling. Bring the two corners together so that they come together flat against one another. The end result should be that these two corners are stuck together pointing roughly upwards over the filling, which is gathered in the bottom.


If you need to, you can lightly pinch the two upward-pointing corners together to help them adhere to each other.
Congratulations! You're done.

"
Balance a wrapper on a ring made with your finger and thumb.,
Place your filling in the center of the wrapper.,
Close the ring.,
Dab warm water around the opening and seal.,
Finished.

",How to Wrap Wontons3," This method makes a wonton that looks like a sack of money or an old-fashioned coin purse. To begin, touch the tip of your index finger to the tip of your thumb to make a small ring (this should look like the ""A-OK"" hand gesture). Lay your wrapper on top of this ring, centered over the hole. It's not a problem if it droops slightly into the hole.

, Next, take about a teaspoon of filling (as before) and place it in a ball in the center of the wrapper. Use the spoon you used to scoop your filling to push the filling down through the ring made by your fingers slightly. This should draw the corners of the wrapper inward.


Don't push too hard! You don't want to end up with your filling, wrapper, or both on the floor.

, As you push the filling down, gently bring the edges of the wrapper together by closing the ring made by your fingers. As you do this, the edges of the wrapper should close together above the filling. When you finish bringing the edges of the wrapper together, your wonton should look like a tiny ""sack"" of filling with its upper edges ruffled up.

, The last thing you want your wonton to do is to come apart while you cook it. To ensure your wonton holds together, dab a little warm water around the opening of the wonton and press the edges together to seal. Because the edges are crumpled up, you may need to re-apply water as needed if you have trouble getting the opening to stay shut.


Congratulations! You're done. Lather, rinse, repeat, and enjoy your delicious wontons.

Finished.

",How to Warm Tortillas," Lay your tortillas out individually and sprinkle, spray, or brush both sides with enough water to coat. When tortillas dry out and get stale they lack moisture, and replacing it when you reheat them will make them soft again., Or, if you prefer a slightly longer cooking time, heat your oven to 350 F (177 C).

, Stack between five and eight tortillas on top of one another and wrap the stack in foil. Make multiple stacks if you require more tortillas., Bake the wrapped stacks in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes. For an oven that was heated to 350 F, heat the tortillas for 15 to 20 minutes.

, Or, if you want crispy and slightly fried tortillas, brush or drizzle both sides of each tortilla with a little oil or butter., On medium heat, preheat a dry steel skillet, cast iron pan, griddle, or non-stick frying pan.

, Place one tortilla in the skillet and heat it for about 30 seconds. Flip the tortilla with tongs or a spatula and heat on the other side for another 30 seconds. Repeat with each tortilla until you have warmed as many as you need., This will help make them soft and moist, and prevent them from burning.

, Tortillas can also be warmed over the gas on a gas range or directly on the element of an electric stove. Allow the element on an electric stove to heat up for one to two minutes.

, Place one tortilla directly on the gas range or electric element. Heat it for five to 10 seconds,and then flip it over with tongs. Heat for another five to 10 seconds. Continue heating and flipping the tortilla in this way until it begins to puff a little or starts getting some char marks., For the microwave method, don’t stack more than five at a time., Use either a clean tea tower or a few sheets of paper towel. Place the stack on a microwave-safe plate.

, Microwave on high for 30 seconds at a time. Check them after each 30-second period. If they need longer, flip them and microwave for another 30 seconds. Repeat until they are warmed through.

, Fill the bottom pot of a stovetop steamer with about one-half inch of water. For an electric steamer, pour in enough water to reach the minimum fill line.

, This method is good for heating many tortillas at once. Stack as many as 12 at a time and wrap the stack in a clean, heavy towel.

, Heat on high for one to two minutes. When steam starts escaping from the bottom pot, remove it from the heat.For an electric steamer, turn it off when steam starts coming out from under the lid.

,, If you don't have a tortilla warmer, wrapping your tortillas in foil and towels will keep them warm for about 15 minutes.For tortillas that weren't heated in a stack, stack them up to eight high. For stacks that aren't covered in foil, wrap each stack of tortillas in foil.Wrap each pack in a towel.

, Tortilla warmers are round containers with removable lids, and they keep tortillas warm longer than the foil and towel method. They are often made of plastic, ceramic, or terra cotta, and some are designed for the oven, the microwave, or both.


Most tortilla warmers also double as warming containers that you can reheat tortillas in directly. To heat tortillas in the tortilla warmers, most require a damp paper towel in the bottom of the container, followed by about eight tortillas. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions about heating., With a cloth tortilla warmer, place the tortillas inside the cloth shell and heat them in the microwave. The insulating and moisture wicking cloth and plastic shell then keeps the tortillas warm and soft—but not soggy—for over an hour.

Flour or corn tortillas — which to choose? Flour tortillas tend to have a softer, sweeter flavor. Yet the classic Mexican taco calls for homemade corn tortillas, where the meat takes center stage.Then again, the only thing that matters is what tastes good to you. Experiment with both and choose for yourself.
Crispy or soft taco? Again, the choice is up to you. It's easy to make a taco crispy by frying it in oil, but many authentic Mexican recipes call for soft tortillas.
Adding two tortillas or just sticking with one? Many places in Mexico will serve two tortillas per taco. It's more filling, it helps keep the ingredients from breaking through a single tortilla, and it's an easy way to get rid of staler tortillas.If you're sticking to the more calorie-conscious meal, opt for only one tortilla.;
, It's incredibly simple, but a taco just doesn't taste right without it. Combine the following ingredients and allow to sit for a few hours:


1 onion, finely chopped
1 head cilantro, finely chopped
2-3 limes, juiced

, Pico de gallo is a simple mix of tomato, onion, garlic, cilantro, and lime. It's a kind of salsa that many people associate with tacos and, like onion relish, is quite simple to make.

, Whether you want to cook your salsa verde in a crockpot, oven, or over the stove, the basic idea is all the same: Cook tomatillos, onion, garlic, and jalapeño peppers over heat, and blend with a little bit of lemon and/or lime juice. A delectable addition to any taco.

, When it comes to tacos, this is definitely to most important decision. The meat will make or break your tacos (unless you're making vegetarian tacos, in which case it will do neither). Which is why this tutorial gives you plenty of options (see below) when it comes to which meat to use. There are several different kinds of kinds/preparations of meat you can use in your tacos:



Carne asada (""grilled meat,"" e.g. beef)

Carnitas (literally ""little meats,"" e.g. pork)
Al pastor (literally ""shepherd's style,"" e.g. pork)
De pescado (literally ""of fish"")
De camarones (literally ""of shrimp"")
Other cuts like lengua (tongue), sesos (brains), cachete (cheeks), trompa (lips), etc.

, You taco is pretty much complete when it has tortilla(s), meat, onion relish, and salsa verde or pico de gallo. But if you want to make it interesting, you can always add the following to your tacos to spice them up:


Beans (black or refried)

Guacamole or avocado
Cheese (queso fresco or ""Mexican blend"" cheese)
Grilled corn

, Common garnishes include radishes and lime wedges, although you might get a little more fancy with pickled onion or other pickled vegetables such as carrot. Devour your tacos and make your guests proud.

Consider getting pre-stained or painted molding so you can omit having to paint it.






Pick up paint, gloss or stain if the molding you choose is still “naked.”






Get enough molding to hold 6 or more tacos at one time. Make this serving tray worth you while so you aren’t constantly restocking.





;
, The box should be the same width and length of the crown molding, so it may be in your best interest to make your own.


Take measurements of the box width and length before purchasing enough plywood to create the box.
Have the hardware store pre-cut pieces so all you will need to do is assemble it.
Take into consideration how you’d like to assemble the box and pick up necessary supplies. You will need enough material to form the box but you won’t need a top (you can turn the box upside down). In some cases you could use wood glue and glue the box together. However, nailing it together, using small nails might be your best bet.

, You’ll want to have options in the event one method does not work very well.


Purchase stain or paint for the box. You may want to select a color to compliment the crown molding.

Combine the wet and dry ingredients in a blender.,
Combine the carne asada marinade with 2 pounds of flank- or skirt steak in a sealable plastic bag.,
Set up your grill.,
Grill your steak over charcoals to the desired doneness.,
When the steak is about 15° F from being cooked to your desired doneness, move it over to the hot side of the coals.,
When the steak is about 5° F from being cooked to your desired doneness, remove it from the grill and let it rest.,
For tacos, dice up your carne asada and add it to your tortilla.",How to Make Tacos2," In a blender over high, combine the following ingredients:


4 garlic cloves, minced
1 jalapeño, seeded and minced
1 tsp (5 ml) ground cumin seed
1/2 cup (125 ml) chopped fresh cilantro
Salt and pepper, to taste
1/4 cup (60 ml) lime juice
2 Tbsp (30 ml) white vinegar
1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) sugar
1/2 cup (125 ml) olive oil

, Allow the meat to marinade for anywhere from one hour to one day. After 4 hours, the difference in taste becomes pretty much negligible. Do not marinade for longer than one day.

, After you've gotten your coals red hot, dump them into your grill. Safely move all the charcoals over to one side, effectively creating a hot side and a cooler side. You'll use the cooler side to cook the carne asada for most of the process, and then sear the meat on the hot side at the very end to develop color and extra flavor.

, Start the meat off on the cooler side of the grill, keeping the lid closed, but flipping often. Check the steak periodically with a thermometer — or use the finger test — to test for doneness.


120° F (48.8° C) = Rare
130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare
140° F (60° C) = Medium
150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well
160° F (71.1° C) = Well done

, Use this opportunity to give the steak good color and added flavor.

, Your steak will continue to cook even after it has been removed from the grill.


Don't underestimate the importance of letting the steak rest. If you cut up the steak right away, it will give up all its juices, creating a drier steak. If you let the steak rest for at least 5 minutes, however, it will remain moist and flavorful even after cutting into it.

Stir the carnitas with a fork and brown again under the broiler for several minutes.,
Add the carnitas to your tortillas and serve.",How to Make Tacos4," You'll be slow-cooking the carnitas for a longer period of time for extra juiciness and tenderness.

, Carnitas calls for a fatty cut of pork, so butt roast is the ideal cut to work with.


If you'd like, trim off any large pieces of fat from the pork as you cut the chunks. Although it's not necessary, it does make a healthier carnitas. If you leave the fat on the pork pieces, much of it will render into the pan while it cooks, coating the carnitas and making them even juicier.

, You can boil your carnitas or simmer them on the stovetop, but you get the most consistent results baking your carnitas, them broiling them for a crispy finish. Place the butt roast pieces into the smallest casserole dish you have, with:


1 white or yellow onion, peeled and quartered
4-6 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
2 tablespoons lime juice (about 1 lime)
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon dry oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 bay leaves
The juice of 1 orange, with the orange rind itself (quartered)
salt and pepper

, Which liquid you choose is up to you. Know that if you choose to cook with oil instead of a non-fatty liquid, your carnitas will turn out much juicier.Of course, it won't be healthy, but it's okay to splurge a little for the sake of a true delicacy. Here are some options you can use to cover the carnitas:


Vegetable oil
Rendered lard
Water
Orange juice

, After an hour, the carnitas should reach a temperature of about 208° F, and stay there until the meat has finished cooking 2 hours later.

,, Broil until the tops of the pork become crispy and darken.

, When done perfectly, you'll have crispy carnitas that's still succulent and tender.

Heat the oil in a skillet.,
Cook the onion.,
Add the garlic and spices.,
Brown the ground beef.,
Add the remaining ingredients.",How to Make Taco Meat1," Pour the oil into a medium skillet pan and heat over medium heat for several minutes.


The oil is ready when it appears to shimmer and can glide over the bottom of the pan without resistance.;
, Add the minced onion to the hot oil and sauté it until it becomes soft. This should take roughly 5 minutes.


If you do not have fresh minced onion, you could use dried minced onion flakes or onion powder, instead. Add these dry seasonings to the skillet when you add the other spices. Use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) dried flakes or 1 tsp (5 ml) onion powder., Stir the minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano, and cayenne pepper into the onions. Also add about 1 tsp (5 ml) salt. Cook for 30 seconds, or until the mixture becomes fragrant.


If you do not have full garlic cloves, you can use about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of bottled, moist minced garlic instead. You could also use 1.5 tsp (7.5 ml) of dried minced garlic or 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) garlic powder.The chili powder can be adjusted to taste. This amount will create a mildly spicy meat filling, but you can add more for a hotter flavor or less for something even tamer.

, Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until it is no longer pink. This should take about 5 minutes.


Break the ground beef up with a heavy spatula or wooden spoon as you cook it. This will ensure that it browns evenly and more quickly.
For a healthier version, you could use ground turkey instead of ground beef.

, Pour the tomato sauce, chicken broth, cider vinegar, and brown sugar into the pan. Stir it in and continue cooking until thickened. This should take about 10 minutes.


When possible, opt for a low-sodium chicken broth.
Make sure that the ingredients are well-blended. Stir them together continually as they cook.

Assemble your all-American taco.",How to Make Tacos5," This should take about 3 minutes.

, This should take 3 to 4 minutes. Break up the ground beef into small pieces with a wooden spoon.

, Follow the instructions on the packet about how much seasoning to add. Usually, it's recommended to add 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef. If you don't have pre-mixed taco seasoning, here's a recipe to make the seasoning on your own:


2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons hot smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

, Stir, incorporating evenly, and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, until mix thickens a bit, about 2 to 3 minutes.

Make sure that you are using the smooth kind of salsa and not the chunky kind; do not use pico de gallo.;
, Place a large skillet onto the stove, and turn the heat up to medium-high. Add the beef, and use a wooden spoon or spatula to break it up. Cook the meat, stirring occasionally, until it turns brown and starts to crumble., Tear open the package of taco seasoning, and pour it into a cup. Add the water, and mix the two together using a fork or mini whisk.

, Stir the meat occasionally to help the flavors mix and the meat to cook evenly., This will prevent your salad from wilting or becoming too soggy., Save the rest of the cheese for garnishing, and do not add the chips yet. To prevent the salad from getting too soggy, make sure that the meat is cool and drained. The beans and tomatoes should also be drained.


You don't have to include all of the ingredients. If you don't like olives, leave them out! If you don't like beans, consider using corn instead.
You can add some extra ingredients as well, such as chopped avocado or diced onion. Anything that could be found in a taco will work.

, You can do this using a pair of salad tongs, or two large spoons. Scoop the salad from the bottom of the bowl, and drop it back gently on top. Keep doing this until the dressing is evenly distributed throughout the salad.

, You can tuck the chips around the sides of the bowl, or you can keep them separate, so that people can grab them as they please; not everyone enjoys soggy chips!


You can garnish the salad with and additional cup (cc grams) of salsa."

Combine the seasonings.,
Cook the chicken, water, and most of the spice blend.,
Let the chicken cool.,
Reduce the liquid.,
Shred the chicken.,
Return the chicken to the liquid.,
Thicken the liquid.",How to Make Taco Meat2," In a small bowl, mix together the paprika, chili powder, sugar, garlic powder, salt, onion powder, black pepper, cumin, and oregano. Whisk them together thoroughly to create a spice blend.


Use plain white granulated sugar for this recipe. Light brown sugar can also be used.
Alter the amounts of paprika and chili powder to vary the heat level of your blend. This will create a mildly spicy meat mixture.

, Place the chicken in a deep skillet and cover with 4 cups (1 l) of water and 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of your spice blend. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer.


Cover the skillet and let the chicken cook for 30 minutes, stirring periodically. #*The chicken should be fully cooked and tender when finished.
You can also use a Dutch oven or stockpot instead of a deep skillet. Simply make sure that whatever cookware you use is heavy-duty and equipped with a lid.

, Transfer the chicken from the liquid and let it cool on a separate plate.


Do not dump the liquid.

, As the chicken cools, turn the heat back up, bringing the liquid to a boil again. Keep it boiling.


Do not cover the pan with a lid during this stage.
As the liquid boils, much of it will evaporate off, reducing it down to a thicker, more concentrated consistency.

, When the chicken is cool enough to touch, shred it by pulling the meat apart with two forks.


You could also use your fingers to shred the chicken, but doing so will be much messier.
Alternatively, you could use a knife to cut the chicken into rough cubes or strips instead of shredding it.

, Transfer the shredded chicken back into the liquid.


Stir well so that the chicken is evenly soaked in the seasoned liquid.

, Combine the remaining 4 Tbsp (125 ml) of water, the remaining spice blend, and the cornstarch in a small bowl to form a paste. Add this paste to the skillet and continue cooking until the liquid thickens.


You will need to allow the liquid to boil after adding the cornstarch slurry.
Stir constantly until the mixture thickens.
Remove from the heat and serve or store the meat when finished.

Season the steaks.,
Heat the oil in a heavy skillet.,
Cook the steaks.,
Let the meat rest.Allow the meat to rest for 5 minutes before proceeding further.,
Slice the steaks.",How to Make Taco Meat3," Sprinkle both sides of the steaks with salt, pepper, cumin, and garlic powder.Note that many steak tacos simplify the process by eliminating seasonings other than salt or pepper, or by omitting the seasonings altogether. This creates a slightly more flavorful taco meat, but you can prepare steak for tacos even if you omit this step.
Skirt steaks work well, but rib eye or sirloin will also work as long as the steak is 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) thick or thinner.
If you are uncertain about how much salt and pepper to use, start with 1 tsp (5 ml) salt and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) pepper.

, Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.


Give the oil a few minutes to heat up. It should be ready to use once it appears to glisten.
For a more authentic taste, use lard instead of vegetable oil.

, Add the steaks to the pan in a single layer and brown them for about 4 to 6 minutes, turning once in the middle.


If you cannot fit all your steaks into the pan at once, cook as may as possible without crowding the pan and wrap them in aluminum foil once finished. Then proceed to cook your remaining steaks.

,


As they rest, the steaks will continue to cook and the juices will redistribute themselves throughout the meat. As a result, the steaks will be juicier than they would be without this resting period.

, Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the steak into thin ribbons across the grain. Serve or store when finished.


The ""grain"" refers to the visible muscle fibers in the meat. Cutting across the grain will make the steak more tender, but cutting with the grain will make it tougher and harder to chew.

Cut up the pork.,
Marinate the pork.,
Heat oil in a skillet.,
Fry the meat.",How to Make Taco Meat4," Chop the pork into bite-size pieces using a sharp kitchen knife.


Note that the pork might be slightly easier to cut if it is still cold and a little frozen in the center. The pork should be mostly thawed, however.

, Place the pork into a large resealable plastic bag and add the spices, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) oil, and the lime juice. Turn to coat and let marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.


The pork can be marinated with only the spices, rather than the oil and lime juice, but adding the oil and juice will allow the flavors to blend into the meat more thoroughly. Acidic lime juice breaks the meat down while the oil moistens it and distributes the flavors.
You could also let the pork marinate in a glass baking dish covered with plastic wrap.

, Heat your remaining 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of vegetable oil in a large, heavy-duty skillet over medium-high heat.


Allow the oil to heat for several minutes until it begins to glisten.
You could also use corn oil, canola oil, or olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

, Add the cubed pork and marinade to the hot oil and fry until it begins to brown. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and let simmer until all the juices evaporate.


This could take 4 to 8 minutes, depending on how large your pieces of pork are.
Remove from heat once the pork has finished cooking. Serve or store the taco meat when done.

This ensures that they cook evenly., Once the onion and garlic have turned soft, add the beef, and use a wooden spoon or spatula to break it up. Cook the beef until it turns brown and starts to crumble, about 5 minutes.If you don't have beef, try it with ground turkey instead!, To prevent your salad from becoming too soggy, make sure that the beans and chopped tomatoes are fully drained before you add them in. You are ready for the next step when the tomatoes start to break down.

, Gently fold the mixture together until everything is evenly combined. Save the rest of the dressing for later.

, You can do this using two large spoons or a pair of salad tongs. Grab the lettuce from the bottom of the bowl, and drop it gently back on top. Keep tossing the lettuce until it is evenly coated with the dressing.

, It will also make for a nicer presentation.

, You can place the chips around the salad and scatter the cheese on top. You can also serve the cheese and chips separately to prevent them from getting too soggy.

Serve on top of ube halaya.",How to Make Ube Halaya," Fresh ube has the strongest flavor, but frozen grated ube is easier to find in Asian markets outside the Philippines. Whichever you choose, get it ready for cooking:



Fresh ube: Simmer whole or in large chunks until soft but not mushy, about 30–45 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Peel the ube (throwing away the peel), then grate the rest of it.

Frozen grated ube: Leave it at room temperature until it thaws, then press it hard to squeeze out water. Pour out the water.;
, Find a wide, deep pan large enough to hold all your ingredients. Heat the pan over medium-heat, then melt ½ cup (125g) butter or margarine.

, Pour in 1 can each of evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and coconut milk. You can also try these variations instead:


Make it extra sweet with a second can of condensed milk instead of the coconut milk.
Try a less traditional, vegan recipe by leaving out the milk and using just one can of coconut milk.(Using less liquid isn't a problem, since the mixture is supposed to boil down anyway.)
If you're not nostalgic for the taste of evaporated milk, you might prefer fresh milk instead., Add all of the grated ube plus 1 tsp (5mL) vanilla extract. Most cooks also add 1 cup (200g) sugar. You can skip this if you prefer a stronger ube taste, since there's already sugar in the sweetened condensed milk.


You can use white granulated sugar, brown sugar, or caster sugar.

, Simmer the mixture over medium-low heat. Stir constantly to prevent it burning on the bottom of the pan. The ube halaya will gradually get thicker and thicker. It's ready once it's thick enough to cling to the spoon, about the consistency of thick cake batter.Prepare for an arm workout, since this usually takes 30–50 minutes.


If the coconut milk starts to curdle, reduce the heat and stir more slowly.

, In the last five minutes of cooking, add an extra tablespoon (15mL) butter to make the ube halaya shiny.Mix it in for a couple minutes, then turn off the heat and let cool slightly.


Use coconut oil instead if you've made latik, as described below.

, Brush the last bit of butter onto llanera flan molds or any other heat-safe container, to prevent sticking.If you don't plan to finish the jam within a couple days, use sterilized glass containers.

, Spoon the thick purple mixture into the greased containers. Smooth out the surface with your spoon. Let them sit on the counter until the halaya is warm, but not hot.

, Some people prefer it at room temperature, while others like to cool it for a couple hours in the fridge. Either way, here are some serving ideas:


Sprinkled with latik (see below) or toasted coconut flakes

Spread over bread
Sprinkled with cheese

, Store the rest of the jam in a covered container in the refrigerator. In sterilized containers, it will stay good about 7–10 days., Latik is made from coconut curds, which separate from the fat. You can use coconut milk, but the recipe is faster and makes more latik if you use the thicker, fattier coconut cream skimmed from the top of the can.


You can also make coconut milk from fresh or shredded coconut. To make coconut cream, follow the same recipe, but use 4 parts coconut meat to one part water., Pour the coconut cream (or coconut milk) into a non-stick pan. Heat over medium heat until the mixture starts to simmer, then reduce to medium-low heat. Let it simmer, stirring occasionally, until it thickens. This takes about an hour., Once most of the liquid has evaporated, the coconut cream will separate into two parts: oil and curds. Keep heating it as this happens, stirring frequently to prevent burning.

, Leave the curds and oil in the pan and reduce the heat to low. Stop stirring until the oil begins to fry the curds, turning them golden-brown. Once they start to change color, stir occasionally so they cook evenly., The latik will continue to cook for a few minutes, turning a deep brown color.

, Pour the mixture through a mesh to separate the solid latik from the coconut oil.

, You can use the oil instead of butter in the ube halaya, or brush it on top once the halaya is finished. Sprinkle the latik on top of the ube halaya before serving


Store latik in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one month.Store coconut oil in an airtight container away from light and heat. It should last for at least a few months either in or out of the refrigerator, but homemade coconut oil may have traces of curds that cause it to spoil faster.

Don't skimp with the salt; you can add up to 2 teaspoons.

,, Place a heavy dutch oven on the stove. Put a few teaspoons of oil in the dutch oven and turn the burner to medium high. When the oil is hot, put the pork shoulder pieces in the dutch oven. Cook them on one side until they get brown, then use tongs to turn them over and brown the other side.


Don't cook the pieces too long. You don't want to cook them through, just enough to bring out the flavor in the meat.
Remove the dutch oven from heat when you're finished.

, Arrange them around the meat pieces so that they make contact with the bottom of the pot. Pour in an inch or two of water and cover the pot.

, Place the pot in the oven and let the carnitas cook for 4 hours. Check the pot a few times during the course of cooking to make sure the meat isn't drying out or burning. Remove the dutch oven from the oven when the carnitas are meltingly soft when poked with a fork.If you'd prefer to cook the carnitas in a slow cooker, transfer the meat and vegetables to a slow cooker and cook on high for 4 hours, or on low for 8 hours.
If the carnitas look like they could use some moisture during the course of cooking, add 1/2 cup of water.
Don't remove the carnitas until they are completely tender; cooking the carnitas for a shorter period of time will leave you with tough meat.

, Place the carnitas on a plate with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, a section of lime, some cilantro, and chopped onions. Serve with warm tortillas and some sour cream.

, Fill taco shells or soft taco tortillas with few spoonfuls of carnitas. Top with the taco toppings of your choice, such as salsa, guacamole, lettuce, cotija cheese, and black beans.

, Fill tortillas with carnitas, then roll them up and line them on the bottom of a deep baking dish. Pour red or green enchilada sauce over the rolls, then top with grated cheese. Bake the enchiladas for 20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly. Serve with sour cream and lettuce.

Pour in 1 1/4 cups (295 ml) of water and use your hands to mix the water into the corn flour. This should make a dough that's thick like a paste.You can purchase pre-made masa dough. Just follow the manufacturer's instructions for rolling and frying it.;
, Get out one ball of red recado and place it in a prep bowl. Add a few tablespoons of water or enough liquid to thin out the recado, so it's just a little thick.If you can't find red recado paste, you can use red recado powder or ancho chili powder.

, Spoon the red recado into the mixing bowl with the masa dough. Use your hands to mix and knead the recado into the dough. Continue to knead (stretch) the dough for several minutes, so the dough becomes smooth.

The masa dough should turn slightly red once you add the red recado., Divide the masa dough into small balls. Roll each ball between the palms of your hand to smooth them out. Each ball should be about 2-inches (5 cm) in size. Set the balls aside to rest while you heat the oil and prepare the salbutes toppings., Pour enough vegetable or coconut oil into a skillet or frying pan, so the oil comes 2-inches (5 cm) up the sides of the pan. Heat the oil over medium-high heat while you press the masa tortillas.The oil is hot enough once a drop of water in the pan sizzles or pops.

, Place a ball of masa dough in the center of a tortilla press. Put the lid of the press down and press firmly on the handle of the press, so you put great pressure on the dough. When you open the press, you should see a flattened disk of masa dough.Repeat this with the other balls of dough.

, Place one or two masa tortillas into the hot oil at a time. They should immediately begin to bubble and fry around the edges. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to carefully flip the tortillas over after about 30 seconds, so they fry on the other side. Finish frying the tortillas for another 30 seconds to one minute.Remember to let the oil heat back up in between batches of tortillas.
If you crowd the pan with too many tortillas, they'll take longer to fry and will absorb more oil.

, You can purchase cooked chicken and shred it apart using two forks. Season the shredded chicken with one ball of red recado that you've diluted with a little water.You can also roast, braise, or poach the chicken yourself. Save any of the pan juices for pickling the onions.

, Wash two or three tomatoes, half a head of lettuce, and two red onions. Use a sharp knife to carefully slice the tomatoes. Set the tomatoes in a prep bowl. Chop the lettuce and put it in another bowl. Slice the red onions and put them in another bowl.Keeping the veggies separate will make it easier to assemble the salbutes, especially if people want to create their own.

, If you'd like to make quick pickled onions, bring 2 cups (470 ml) of chicken broth to a boil over high heat in a small saucepan. Add the sliced red onion and let them boil for about one minute. Have a bowl of ice water next to your work surface. Drain the onions and immediately submerge them in the ice water until they're cold. Use a slotted spoon to lift the blanched onions out of the water and put them in a bowl with 1 cup (236 ml) of distilled white vinegar until you're ready to serve them.If you're short on time, you could just serve the raw, sliced onions.

, Set a fried masa tortilla on a serving plate and spread a few tablespoons of the shredded chicken over the tortilla. Top the chicken with some of the pickled onion, a little chopped lettuce, and a few slices of the fresh tomato. You could also serve the salbutes with:Shredded cabbage
Chopped cilantro

2 cups masa harina (preferably Maseca brand)
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

, Make sure salt is evenly distributed in the masa.

,, The dough should have the consistency of Play-Doh: springy and firm but also slightly dry.


Add more water by tablespoons if the dough is too dry; add more masa if the dough is too wet.







, Remember that corn tortillas are traditionally smaller than flour tortillas.


Use a tortilla press lined with plastic wrap for even, more uniform-looking tortillas.






If you don't have a tortilla press, use a rolling pin for more artisanal tortillas.







, If the dough crumbles, it is too dry — add more water. If the dough sticks to the plastic on the press, or to the rolling pin, it is too wet — add more masa.


This will be your final chance to get the consistency right before cooking.







, The tortillas won't take long to cook, so you may want to have them all pressed before you begin cooking. If you're working with a tortilla press, you should have enough time to press tortillas while you cook.

, Cast iron pans distribute heat evenly and quickly, so they are best for cooking tortillas, but any non-stick pan will do the job in a pinch.

, Cook 1-2 minutes on one side, or until slightly charred and edges begin to curl. Flip onto opposite side and cook for 15 more seconds. Remove from heat.


If using a cast-iron pan, it's okay to cook more than one tortilla at a time.







, Keep the tortillas warm by wrapping them in a clean kitchen towel if serving immediately.

Stack 2 to 3 tortillas on top of each other.,
Slice the tortillas into ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) thick strips.,
Spread the strips in a single layer on two baking sheets.,
Bake the strips in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden and crispy.,
Season the strips with salt.,
Let the strips cool on the baking sheet, then serve them.",How to Make Tortilla Strips1," If you'd like, you can also line two baking sheets with parchment paper. The parchment paper is not absolutely necessary, but it will make cleaning up easier.;
, Measure out the oil into a small bowl, Then, use a basting brush (or something similar) to brush the oil onto the tortillas. The oil will help the tortillas turn crispy when you bake them.

, If you'd like to make smaller strips, cut the tortillas into quarters. At this time, you can also put the remaining tortillas into stacks as well, so that they will be ready for you.

, You can do this using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter. These narrow strips are perfect for tossing onto a soup or salad. If you'd like to make something more chip-like that you can eat with salsa (or other dips), cut the tortillas into 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) wide strips instead.

, If you cannot fit all of the strips onto the baking sheets, save them for a separate batch. You don't want the strips to be clumped up or covered, or they won't bake evenly.

, You can bake them one baking sheet at a time, or you can put both baking sheets into the oven. If you are baking both sheets at the same time, rotate them halfway through baking. This ensures that both sheets get baked the same amount.

, Once the strips are baked, pull the baking sheets out of the even, and set them down on the counter or stove. Shake some salt onto the strips; how much salt you add is entirely up to you!

, They make great toppings for salads, soups, and beans. You can also serve the wider ones on their own with some dip.

There should be enough water to completely submerge the chicken. If 3 cups (750 ml) are not enough, add more.;
, Place one minced clove of garlic and half of the chopped onion in the saucepan with the chicken and water.

, Set the ingredients on the stove over high heat. Let the water reach a rolling boil.

, Once the water begins to boil, reduce the heat to low and allow the chicken to simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.


The chicken must be completely cooked though by the end of this step. Check for doneness by cutting the thickest piece open. If you see any pink, cook the chicken longer. If no traces of pink remain, you can stop cooking the chicken.

, Remove the chicken from the saucepan and set it aside on a clean platter or bowl. Allow it to cool to room temperature.


Do not dump the cooking liquid yet. You will use some of it later on in the recipe.
You may, however, wish to strain the onion and garlic from the liquid by pouring the contents of the saucepan through a colander. You only need the liquid broth, not the solid ingredients.

, Use your fingers or two forks to shred the chicken into rough pieces.


Keep the shredded chicken on the platter and set it aside for the time being. You will not use it immediately, but you will need it again shortly.

, Place the chopped tomatoes and 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the reserved chicken broth in medium saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat.

, Once the mixture starts to simmer, start the clock. Let the tomatoes simmer in the broth until they are soft and cooked through.


The tomatoes should be mushy at this point, but they should not be soft enough to completely fall apart.

, Use a slotted spoon to remove the tomatoes and transfer them to a blender. Blend them on a medium speed until they turn into a smooth sauce.


You could use a food processor instead of a blender, if desired.
If the sauce is too thick for your liking, you can add another 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of the reserved chicken broth or water to help thin it out. Blend thoroughly after making the addition.

, Pour the vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet and set the skillet on the stove over medium heat.


Give the oil a minute or so to warm up. It should be hot and notably thin, but it should not be allowed to start smoking.

, Dump the remaining chopped onion into the hot oil. Stir fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it becomes soft and translucent.


Stir the onion frequently as it cooks to prevent it from burning.

, Add the second minced garlic clove to the skillet with the onion. Stir fry the mixture for an additional 1 minute.


Both the onion and garlic should lightly brown during this time. The entire mixture should become notably fragrant, as well.
As before, you need to stir the onion and garlic frequently to prevent them from burning. Garlic can burn quickly, so you need to pay close attention.

, Pour the pureed tomato sauce into the skillet with the onion and garlic. Stir well, distributing the onion and garlic throughout.


Allow the sauce to heat up to a slight simmer, then proceed with the next step.

, Stir the chipotle peppers in adobe sauce, oregano, salt, and pepper into the sauce currently simmering in the skillet.


The chipotle chiles and adobo sauce are what give this dish heat. If you want to produce a milder flavor, only add a portion of the can instead of adding the entire thing.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the sauce continue to simmer for another 10 minutes to thoroughly combine the flavors.


The color of the sauce should also change into a deep red color during this time.
Consider keeping the lid partially on the skillet during this time. The steam should be allowed to vent, but keeping the lid tilted on top of the pan can help prevent the sauce from splattering out as it simmers.

, Add the shredded chicken to the sauce, mixing it in so that all of the chicken is evenly coated. Heat through.The chicken should absorb most of the liquid in the sauce during this time. The final mixture should be moist, but not watery.
This step completes the actual tinga de pollo, but you still need to prepare the tostadas if you want to serve this dish in the traditional way.

, Pour enough vegetable oil into a large skillet to fill 1/4 inch (6 mm) of the bottom. Heat the oil on the stove over medium-high heat.


Let the oil heat up for 1 or 2 minutes. It should be very hot, but not quite smoking.
Note that you can save time by simply using packaged tostada shells instead of using corn tortillas. If using tostada shells, skip the frying and draining steps and move directly onto the assembling steps.

, Add one corn tortilla to the hot oil and fry it for 20 to 40 seconds on each side.Use tongs to turn the tortilla halfway through the frying process.
The entire tortilla should be crisp and golden in color when ready.

, Use tongs to remove the tortilla from the hot oil. Transfer it to a plate lined with clean paper towels and let the excess oil drain off.


You will need to repeat the frying and draining process for each tortilla, working with one at a time.

, Place one tostada onto your serving plate and add a dollop of crema Mexicana or sour cream. Spread the cream evenly over the surface of the shell.


If you do not like the taste of sour cream, you can skip this step.
Another option is to spread a dollop of refried beans over the surface of the shell instead of or alongside the cream.

, Spoon on a generous helping of the prepared tinga de pollo.


You can leave the chicken piled in a mound in the center of the tortilla, or you could spread it evenly over the surface of the tortilla.

, Arrange a few avocado slices on top of the chicken. Sprinkle the entire thing with shredded lettuce, crumbled Cotija cheese, and a spoonful of salsa.


You can skip these ingredients or substitute them for other garnishes as desired. These toppings are common and recommended, but not strictly necessary.

, The tinga de pollo is now prepared and the tostadas are now assembled. Eat the dish while it is still hot.

, If you'd like to make smaller strips, cut the tortillas into quarters now using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter. At this time, you can also stack the remaining tortillas so that they will be all ready for you.

, These narrow strips will make perfect garnishes for soups, salads, beans, and other dishes. If you'd like to make more chip-like strips that you can scoop up salsa with, cut them into 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) wide strips instead.

, Pour the oil into a bowl, and dump the strips in. Gently toss the strips until they are all evenly coated with oil. You can do this using your hands or a pair of salad tongs., Keep tossing until the strips are evenly coated with seasoning., Make sure that the strips are spread evenly and that they are not clumped together. If any of the strips are covered, they won't bake evenly.

, You can bake the sheets in the oven one at a time, or you can bake them at the same time. If you are baking both sheets at the same time, rotate them halfway through the baking process. This will ensure that the strips get baked the same amount.

, You can toss them over a salad or soup, or serve them alongside some black beans. If you made the wider, chip-like strips, you can serve them with some salsa, guacamole, or your favorite dip.

Enjoy.",How to Make Sopes," Place the masa harina and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together until evenly combined.


Masa harina is finely ground corn flour typically used for corn tortillas. If you can't find masa harina, consider grinding 8 to 12 stale corn tortillas in a food processor until they form a fine powder.If you have a corn allergy, you could use all-purpose wheat flour instead of the masa harina. The taste won't be quite as authentic, but the dough should still hold together correctly.;
, Add water by the 1/2 cup (125 ml), mixing well after each addition. Continue adding water until a smooth, cohesive dough forms.


Mixing the dough with your hands will be easiest, but if desired, you could opt to use a wooden spoon or a low-speed stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment.
Mixing the dough should take roughly 3 to 5 minutes. After the dough holds its form, however, you don't need to knead it any further.

, Pinch the dough into 12 evenly sized pieces. Roll each piece between your hands to form balls.


Each ball of dough should be between 1-1/2 and 2 inches (3.75 and 5 cm) in diameter.
Line up the balls of dough on a lightly floured counter or sheet of parchment paper.

, Using your fingers, carefully flatten each ball of dough until it forms a patty approximately 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) thick and 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter.


You could use a tortilla press to flatten the balls of dough if one is available. Place the dough in between two sheets of plastic bag material, then set the covered dough over the center of the tortilla press. Close the press gently, flattening the dough to the indicated dimensions.Cover the finished dough patties with a clean, slightly damp kitchen towel to prevent the dough from drying out as you work.

, Place a large cast iron skillet on the stove over medium high heat. Give the pan 1 or 2 minutes to heat up.


If you don't have a cast iron skillet, any nonstick frying pan should work adequately well.
Ideally, you should not add any oil to this pan before or after it heats up. If you need to add some type of nonstick coating, apply a light layer of nonstick cooking spray to the surface before heating the pan.

, Place three dough patties on the hot skillet. Cook the dough for 1 minute, flip, then continue cooking for another minute.Arrange the dough patties on the skillet with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between them.
You should cook the dough patties until they brown and blister on both sides. This should be a quick process as long as the pan is adequately hot.

, Remove the sopes from the pan and allow them to cool for 30 to 60 seconds, or until they are cool enough to handle safely.


Do not wait for the sopes to cool completely. If they cool too much, you won't be able to shape them.

, Use your fingers to pinch around the outer edge of each sope, forming a 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) rim around the entire circumference.


You should form this raised edge on the side of the sope cooked first to help protect your fingers from the hot dough.
While not strictly necessary, you could also pinch a smaller ring around the center of each patty. Doing so may help prevent the sope from falling apart after you fill it.

, After shaping your first three sopes, continue shaping the remaining nine dough patties in the same manner.


Work with only three patties at once. If you try to do too many, the patties may burn or cool too quickly.
Set aside the shaped sopes while working on the flat patties. Try to keep them warm.

, Pour the oil into a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan or deep fryer. Bring it to a temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius).Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper, and line a large plate with clean paper towels.

, Place two or three shaped sopes in the hot oil. Fry them for 1 or 2 minutes, or until they turn golden brown on both sides and are fully cooked through.


Use tongs to carefully turn the sopes halfway through the cooking time, ensuring that both sides brown evenly.
Only work with a few sopes at a time. If you try to fry too many, the temperature of the oil may drop, forcing the sopes to cook longer and become soggy.

, Remove the hot sopes from the oil using tongs. Place them on the paper towel lined plate.


Arrange the sopes with the indentation facing down so that the oil does not gather inside the shell.
Wait a minute or so, giving the sopes adequate time to drain, before moving onto the next step.

, Place the sopes on the lined baking sheet and place the baking sheet in the oven. Keep the sopes in the oven while you work on the remaining batches.


Storing the finished sopes in the oven should keep them warm while you finish cooking the rest.
After you've finished cooking the remaining sopes, you can remove the entire batch from the oven. Cover the sopes with a clean, dry towel to keep them warm as you prepare the filling.

, Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil., Place the shaped sopes on the lined baking sheet. Cook them in your preheated oven for approximately 10 minutes, or until they feel firm to the touch.


Keep at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space in between each sope when you arrange them on the baking sheet.
Unlike fried sopes, baked sopes won't gain much color after being cooked through. As long as the sopes are firm, however, they should be ready to use and enjoy.

, Once the sopes have finished cooking, remove them from the oven and set them aside in a warm area while you prepare the filling.


It's a good idea to cover the sopes with a clean, dry kitchen towel to help them hold in more heat.

, Spoon 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of refried beans into each sope, then use the back of the spoon to smooth the beans into an even layer.


While sope toppings typically vary by personal preference, including an initial layer of refried beans is common among many traditional recipes.

, Take a handful of romaine, iceberg, or green leaf lettuce and shred the leaves into thin strips. Spread a layer of the shredded lettuce over the refried beans.


Lettuce is another traditional component of sope toppings, but it can also be skipped if you have an aversion to it or don't have any presently available.

, Nearly any shredded or cubed meat would work. Spoon a layer of the meat into the center of each sope, directly on top of the bed of lettuce.


Any prepared taco meat would be one option worth considering, especially if you have some leftover from another meal.
You could also add chopped cooked chorizo, albondigas meatballs, or seasoned shrimp.
Omit the meat if you'd prefer serving vegetarian sopes.

, After layering on the meat, you can add your favorite chopped vegetables, cheeses, and creams.


Some popular vegetable options include diced onion, diced avocado, diced bell pepper, diced chile pepper, and diced tomato. Similarly, you could add your favorite commercial salsa or homemade pico de gallo.
Crumbled queso fresco is the most conventional choice of cheese, but if you can't find it, mild feta cheese is a good substitute. If you don't like the taste of these cheeses, shredded cheddar or a shredded Mexican-style cheese blend are other options worth considering.
Similarly, Mexican crema is a type of heavy cream used as a garnish for many Mexican dishes, but if you don't have any, you could use sour cream instead.

, Once you've finished filling and garnishing the sopes, they're ready to eat. They don't store well, so you should enjoy them while they're warm and fresh.

, Walk away and let it cook undisturbed.

, When it's all done, it'll be easy to shred the pork with just a couple of forks. The meat should be sitting in a delicious, spicy sauce, and will fall apart easily.

, The carnitas are good as is, just in their own juices. However, if you want a little more flavor on the side, try a Sriracha-flavored mayo or a Sriracha sour cream.


For the mayo, mix Sriracha, mayonnaise, and soy sauce, to taste.For the sour cream, mix about ¼ cup of sour cream with ½ to 1 Tbsp of Sriracha., The carnitas go great in tacos. Warm up some corn tortillas in a frying pan, drop some carnitas in the middle of each tortilla, and add your preferred toppings.


Try a little shredded cheese, some fresh chopped cilantro, a few slices of avocado, some sour cream, and some salsa or pico de gallo. If you really want to maximize the heat, add some more Sriracha!

Dish out the hot pozole.",How to Make Pozole," The two beefsteak tomatoes need to be roasted for 20 to 25 minutes in an oven heated to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius). Once cooled, the skin should be peeled off.


The tomatoes should weigh about 1 lb (450 g) combined.
Preheat an oven or toaster oven to 500 degrees degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius). Prepare a rimmed baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil.
As the oven heats, prepare the tomatoes by cutting an ""x"" through the skin at the bottom of each one. This incision will make it easier to peel away the skin later on.
Place the tomatoes on the baking sheet, and place the baking sheet in the preheated oven.
Roast the tomatoes until they are well-charred and tender. This should take about 20 to 25 minutes.
Let cool. The skin should already be peeling away at the ""x"" incision you made earlier. Once the tomatoes are cool to the touch, pull off the skin by peeling it away at the ""x"" mark. Throw the skin out.;
, The chiles should be seeded and toasted in a large skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant.


The chiles should be about 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) each. Wipe them clean with a moist paper towel before proceeding.
Use a sharp kitchen knife or a pair of kitchen scissors to cut the chiles open lengthwise, from end to end. Dig out the seeds and any large ribs.
Heat a heavy skillet or griddle over medium-low heat without oil. Place the chiles on the skillet cut-side-down. Press them down and flip them over with a heat-resistant spatula until they become just barely darkened and fragrant. This should take about 1 minute per chile, and you should work in batches of 1 or 2 chiles at a time.

, Cover the toasted chiles with cold water and let them soak for about 30 minutes.


Use a medium-size bowl.
The chiles should soak until they are softened.

, Add the garlic and onion to the heated skillet or griddle in batches. Toast each one until they are golden-brown with a few blackened spots.


You need about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of peeled garlic. You can add up to twice as much if you prefer a stronger garlic taste.
Turn the garlic as necessary to prevent it from blackening too much. The garlic will need to be cooked for about 8 minutes.
Only flip the onion slices once. The onion needs to be cooked for roughly 15 minutes.

, Blend together the drained chiles, tomatoes, garlic, onion, cloves, and allspice with a little water.


After the chiles have finished soaking, drain them and place them into your blender.
Add the tomatoes to the blender along with any tomato juice they are sitting in. Add the garlic, onion, cloves, and allspice, as well.
Puree the sauce. Add up to 1/2 cup (125 ml) water, pouring in a little at a time, until the sauce becomes very smooth. This should take around 2 minutes.

, Heat the oil in a large stockpot before adding the puree. Fry the puree until it becomes thicker.


Heat the vegetable oil in a 6-qt (6-l) heavy-duty stockpot over medium heat. A Dutch oven also works well.
Add the puree. It will likely splatter, so prepare yourself.
Reduce the heat to low. Fry the puree, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula or spoon, until it thickens. This should take about 5 minutes.

, Add 1 cup (250 ml) water, as well as the vinegar, sugar, and salt.


After adding the water, raise the heat to medium-high and bring the sauce to a boil.
Add the vinegar, sugar, and salt. You will need about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt, but you can add more or less depending on your own sense of taste.
Reduce the heat again to medium or medium-low, so that the sauce sits at a steady simmer.
Partially cover the pot, leaving a small gap to vent some of the steam. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Add water, if necessary, to keep the sauce at the same consistency.

, Seed the poblano chiles and toast them in a skillet over medium-high heat until softened. Soak them in hot water for 20 minutes.Use a sharp knife or kitchen shears to cut the chiles open lengthwise. Scrape out any seeds and large veins from the chiles, and remove any stems.
Heat a skillet or griddle on medium-high heat without oil.
Add the chiles, cut-side-down, and roast them for 1 or 2 minutes until they soften. Flip them once during the cooking process and do not let them burn
Add 3 cups (750 ml) of water to a medium saucepan and boil it over medium-high heat.
Submerge the toasted chiles in the pot of hot water. Cover the pot and remove it from the heat.
Let the chiles soften in the hot water for 15 to 20 minutes.

, Add the cubed pork to a skillet of hot oil and cook until browned on all sides.


Cover the bottom of a large skillet or Sauté pan with 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) olive oil. Heat the oil on medium-high heat.
Dry the pork chunks with clean paper towels and season with salt.
Brown the pork for several minutes, stirring infrequently. Make sure that the pork is brown on all sides and that the pan does not become too crowded. If necessary, work in batches.
For a richer taste, you can use multiple types of pork instead of just pork shoulder. Substitute 1/3 of the pork for pork spare ribs or baby back ribs, for instance, or half of the pork shoulder for pork loin.Chicken is another popular choice for pozole. You could use a combination of 6 skinless chicken drumsticks and 6 skinless chicken thighs instead of the pork in this recipe.
While not as common as pork or chicken, beef can also be used in pozole. Instead of pork shoulder, add 2 to 2 1/2 lb (900 to 1125 g) beef shank, cubed, to the recipe., Add the browned pork to stockpot of hot chile sauce. Stir it into the sauce and increase the heat to medium-high so that it remains at a steady simmer.


When adding the pork to the sauce, also scrape any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet and add those to the sauce, as well.

, Stir these four ingredients into the chile sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.


When adding the oregano, crumple it with your hands so that it breaks into more pieces as it goes in. Mexican oregano works best, but if you cannot find it, you can also use standard oregano.
Add about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt. You can add more or less to taste, however.
Rinse the hominy before adding it, especially if it came from a can. You can add more hominy if desired.

, Reduce heat and partially cover the stockpot. Cook until the pork is completely tender.


The pozole can be cooked for as little as 1 1/2 hours, but cooking it longer will result in a more tender dish.
Leave the stockpot partially uncovered so that steam can escape.
Reduce the heat enough so that the pozole just barely simmers.

, Use a ladle to skim excess fat from the top of the pozole once you finish cooking it.


The amount of excess fat will depend on how fatty the meat you used was. More fat adds more flavor, but it also means that you will have more to skim off at the end.

, Taste the broth. If it is too bland, you can add more salt, to taste, at the end.


Make sure that you stir the salt in thoroughly after adding it.
You will likely need to add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) or more, depending on your sense of taste.

, Since pozole cooks for so long, the sauce may reduce too much and become thick. If this happens, you will need to add more water at the end.


Pozole should be very liquid. Add enough water to form a good broth consistency and heat another 10 to 15 minutes, or until thoroughly incorporated.

,


Make sure that the lettuce, onion, and radishes are all shredded, chopped, or sliced thinly, making it easy to add them in small amounts. Cabbage can also be used instead of lettuce.
Tostadas are crispy, fried corn tortilla shells. You can usually find them pre=packaged, or you can make your own by frying stale corn tortillas in a little hot vegetable oil. Alternatively, you can also use tortilla chips.

, Ladle the hot pozole into individual serving bowls.


Arrange the garnishes in the center of the table so that your family or guests can add garnishes as they please.

Choose your dried beans and rinse off 2 1









Pinto beans are the classic choice.,
Cover the beans with at least 2"" of water and bring to a boil.,
Lower the heat to a simmer and let the beans cook for 1-2 hours, until tender.,
Drain or strain out the beans, retaining the water they were cooked in for later.,
Pick out your fat and heat 5-6 tablespoons of it on medium high heat.,
While letting beans sit, fry the chopped onions in your oil.,
Add garlic, along with salt and seasonings, when onions have 1-2 minutes to go.,
Add the beans fry everything for 2 minutes or so.,
Add one cup of reserved liquid and use a potato masher to smash the mixture up.,
Let the mashed mixture simmer until it reaches your desired consistency.",How to Make Refried Beans1," Sweet but savory, with a good size for mashing and a creamy texture, they are the top refried beans.

Black beans are slightly courser, without the sweet notes of pinto beans, which can lead to a somewhat more muted flavor that compliments many flavors well without overpowering.

Navy, cannellini, and white beans can all be used for delicious refried beans, though they won't be ""classic"" by any stretch. They tend to have a lighter flavor and creamy texture, but are all open for culinary experiments.;
, The water should be at least a few inches above the beans, as they will absorb the liquid as they cook.








, You should be able to easily pierce each bean with a fork when they are done.








, These water, which is lightly flavored, will help cook the beans the second time, in your frying pan. Ladle out at least one cup of the bean cooking liquid for later.








, Use a skillet big enough to fit the beans, melting your frying fat first while the cooked beans sit to the side. The type of fat you use will greatly impact the flavor of your final dish, so choose wisely:










Lard: the ""king"" of refried bean fats, this is the most common fat used to cook the beans. Pork fat, in particular, is a spectacular choice.

Bacon drippings: the second-most common fat in recipes, as it is readily available and lends a rich, smokey flavor to the beans. Can be mixed or cut with vegetable oil.

Vegetable or Canola oil: these mild oils will allow the flavors of your spices, beans, and onions to shine through. Don't use high-flavor oils like olive or truffle unless you want those flavors in the beans -- which most cooks don't.

Butter: not incredibly common, but still delicious, butter imparts a rich creaminess to the beans that is unconventional, but certainly delicious., Cook them over medium heat for 4-5 minutes, until translucent, at least, adding a dash of salt right when they hit the pan.This means they are starting to become see-through. The longer you cook the onions, the sweeter they'll get, which can be a good thing if you want a rich, sweeter dish. If so, cook until the edges brown and begin to caramelize.

You can add as much or as little onion as you want. Most cooks aim between half of an onion or one full, medium-sized onion.

, Add as many cloves of chopped garlic as you desire, a dash of salt, and any combination of the spices listed below. These ingredients only need a minute or less to cook up, so work quickly. It can help to pre-mix the spices in a small bowl ahead of time, then add them all at once:

1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
Juice from 1/2 a lime, Let the flavors meld, stirring regularly to make sure everything is well coated in spices. They should start to bubble and simmer before moving on., Stir in the mixture, then start beating. You can smash the beans into any texture you want, from creamy, perfect purees to chunkier, more hearty spreads. Don't have a potato masher? There are other methods, as well:









Pour the whole mixture into a food processor or blender, pulsing until your desired texture then returning to the bowl.
Use a hand mixer or stick blender to puree the beans right in the pot.
Use the back of a wooden spoon to hand-mash the beans., Add another pinch of salt and adjust the seasonings to your liking. Now, simply let the mixture cook on medium-low until it thickens to your liking. If things get too dry, add some more of the bean liquid, plain water, or a splash of brown to rehydrate and thin them out. Serve hot.









These beans are incredible with a squirt of fresh lime juice, a sprinkling of queso fresco, or a spring of fresh cilantro."

Raw, it is sharp and pungent. Sauteed, it mellows out a bit, retaining spice but losing its raw edges. Roasted, garlic has a rich, nuanced warmth to it. For this recipe, you can get all three flavors with ease by roasting the outside of whole cloves, while the inside retains some of the sharpness, Smashing the garlic up will make it much easier to eat later on. You can also remove them, let them cool, and cut them up into small bits if you're worried about biting into a chunk of garlic. Cook the garlic with the onions together for 3-5 minutes., Many spices, especially chili, reveal their best flavors only under a little heat. ""Toasting"" the spices will bring out a delicious richness of flavor, but only if you move quickly. You should add the beans (the next step) within thirty seconds of the spices., The liquid in these beans is necessary to keep them hydrated as they cook. That said, you can always substitute other liquids for the beans if desired, such as stock, water, or even milk, If you don't have a potato masher, a food processor, hand mixer, blender, or the back of a wooden spoon can usually cover for you. You can either grind them into a smooth, consistent puree or leave some chunks and skins around -- it is entirely up to you., If the beans become too thick or dry, add some water or chicken stock, stir it in, and bring everything back to a simmer. The beans are ready to heat whenever you are -- serve hot!Top with shredded cheese, fresh cilantro, or a squeeze of fresh lime.

Try an Italian-inspired refried bean dish with white beans.,
Try the whole dish in a slow cooker for an easy, all-day recipe that just have to heat.",How to Make Refried Beans3," There is no reason why the beans need to sit without flavor for 2 hours while they cook! After you've covered the dried beans with water and have the heat set to boil, toss in the following to cook alongside the beans for 1-2 hours. When done cooking, remove and discard before proceeding:

1 half white onion, whole
2-3 cloves garlic
1 large sprig epazote or Mexican oregano, Kick up the flavor with some of the most popular additions to a good pot of refried beans. Each of these flavors can be added after the onions, with the garlic, depending on how long you want them to cook. They will all mash up wonderfully with the beans.

Can of fire-roasted peppers
Can of green chilis
Chipotle peppers canned in adobo sauce1/2 fresh green bell pepper, chopped sauteed alongside the onion.
Cooked, chopped bacon bits.

, While some people love the simple, but rich, flavor of plain beans, every now and then you'll want a little extra kick to your dish. You can add a flavored stock or broth in place of the bean liquid to give a little more flavor to the beans, omitting the bean cooking liquid., Refried beans are a decidedly Latin American dish, but at their heart the are just a smooth, cooked bean paste, which has inspirations from across the globe. If you want to use navy or cannellini beans, nothing is stopping you, and some adjusted spices can make them an appealing dish in their own right:

When cooking the beans the first time in the water, add half an onion, a sprig of rosemary or thyme, and 2-3 cloves fresh garlic. You can also add bay leaves, celery, and whole carrots as the beans boil.
Fry up onion and garlic, like normal. Discard anything boiled with beans and add to pot.
Replace cumin/chili with any combination of the following spices:

Rosemary
Thyme
Oregano
Basil
A touch of cumin (1/2 teaspoon)


Drizzle finished beans with fresh lemon juice.

, Beans love to cook slowly, absorbing liquid as they do to stay tender and creamy as they cook. Once cooked, all you are really waiting for are the flavors to marry and develop without the beans drying out. This makes refried beans perfect for the moist, warm environment of a slow cooker, and they couldn't be easier:

Add dried beans, finely chopped onion and garlic, and 2 teaspoons of salt to the pot.
Add any desired spices, such as 1 tablespoon cumin and chili powder. If desired, add pork/ham bones or bacon strips for a richer flavor.
Cover everything with water.
Cook for 8-10 hours, adding more liquid if the beans seem to be drying out."

Peel and slice the plantains.,
Sauté the plantains until browned.,
Add the cinnamon, vanilla extract, and brown sugar, if desired.,
Remove the plantains from the heat.,
Serve hot.",How to Cook Plantains1," Add the oil or butter to the skillet and heat over medium-low to medium heat. Give it a minute or two to heat up, but do not wait for it to start smoking.


Plantains have a high sugar content. As a result, they burn easily if they come into contact with extremely high heat.






Use butter if you want to create a richer, more dessert-like plantain dish.






Use oil if you plan to serve the plantains as a side dish. Olive oil, safflower oil, corn oil, and coconut oil are all good options.





;
, Remove the skin and divide the plantains into slices or halves.

Ripe plantains are almost entirely black.






Use a paring knife to cut off the ends of the plantains. Make three shallow, lengthwise slits in the side of the skin. Peel the skin away starting from these slits.






Cut the plantains into 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) slices if you plan on frying them and serving them without additional seasonings or sweeteners.






For a more elegant presentation, split the plantains in half lengthwise, using a knife to divide them from top to bottom.







, Add the plantains to the skillet and fry for 2 minutes or until golden-brown on the bottom. Flip with a spatula and Sauté the other side for an additional 1 or 2 minutes.Arrange the plantains in a single layer inside the pan to ensure even browning.






Do not allow the plantains to blacken.







, Stir the three ingredients together in a small bowl and spoon the mixture over the plantains. Continue cooking for an additional 30 seconds or so, just until the sugar begins to caramelize.For a simpler plantain dish, omit this step.

, Transfer sweetened plantains to a serving dish or drain the oil from non-sweetened plantains.


If you did not add sugar to the plantains and merely fried them in oil, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a plate covered with several layers of paper towel. Let them sit for a few minutes to allow the excess oil to soak into the paper towels.
If you did caramelize sugar over the plantains, draining them is not necessary. Use a normal serving spoon to transfer them directly to a serving platter.







, Fried plantains should be eaten immediately for the best flavor.

For sweetened plantains, you may drizzle an additional 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of melted butter over the plantains before serving them.






To use plantains as a side dish, consider serving unsweetened plantains over hot rice.

Prepare the plantains.,
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes.,
Serve with sweetened condensed milk, if desired.",How to Cook Plantains2," Take out a shallow baking sheet for the plantains., Plantains can be baked in or out of their peels.

Ripe plantains should be mostly black or yellow with spots of black on them.






To peel the plantains, cut off both ends of each plantain and make three shallow lengthwise slits in the skin. Peel the skin back starting from these slits.






Cut peeled plantains into 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) slices. Coat the baking sheet in nonstick cooking spray and arrange the slices in a single layer on the sheet. Coat the tops of the plantain slices with more cooking spray.






To bake plantains in their skins, wrap a sheet of aluminum foil around each plantain and arrange them in a single layer on an un-greased baking sheet.







, Peeled and sliced plantains should turn golden-brown. Plantains inside their peels will become very soft.


If baking peeled and sliced plantains, flip the slices every 5 minutes or so with a flat spatula to ensure even browning.







, After the plantains finish baking, remove them from the oven and serve immediately.

If the plantains are still in their peels, use oven mitts to carefully remove the aluminum foil before making a shallow slit down the middle of each plantain with a sharp paring knife. Carefully open the peel and serve.






For a sweet, dessert-like touch, drizzle sweetened condensed milk or honey over the plantains to taste. You could also sprinkle brown sugar over the plantains while still hot.







"

Preheat the grill.,
Prepare a butter glaze, if desired.,
Slit the plantains open and wrap in aluminum foil.,
Cook for 15 minutes.,

For gas grills, heat the grill to 550 degrees Fahrenheit (288 degrees Celsius). Close the lid and wait for 15 minutes before turning the heat down to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius).For charcoal grills, spread an even layer of coals along the bottom of the grill and light. Wait for the flames to die down and a fine layer of ash to form over the tops of the coals before proceeding.

, Whisk together the butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the apple cider vinegar and stir.


Sherry vinegar can also be used in place of the apple cider vinegar.






Omit this step for a simpler plantain dish.

, Use a paring knife to make a shallow lengthwise slit in the middle of each unpeeled plantain.

The slit should run from top to bottom.






Individually wrap each plantain in a single layer of aluminum foil. Leave a small gap of space above the area where you made the slits.







, Place the plantains on the grill slit-side down. Close the lid and cook for 15 minutes.


Baste and continue cooking. Flip the plantains over so that the slit-side faces up. Baste the exposed plantains with the butter glaze, if desired. Close the lid and continue cooking for another 15 minutes.






Finished plantains should be very soft.







, Baste once more with the butter glaze before removing the plantains from the grill.


Carefully remove the aluminum foil from the plantains but serve them in their skins.

Buy the right flour and gather your tools.,
Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a kettle or other pan.,

Cut the ugali into pieces with a knife once it is on the serving plate.,
Serve the ugali.,
Pair the ugali with another dish.",How to Cook Ugali," Look for corn flour or maize flour at the store. In addition to the flour and water you will need a saucepan and a wooden spoon, as well as a stove to cook the ugali on.


The saucepan will need to be big enough to hold the 6 cups of ingredients with room to vigorously stir them around.
You can use cornmeal if you can't find the flour at the store but the consistency will be very different. Corn flour is more finely ground than cornmeal, so the finished consistency will be smoother and more gelatinous with the corn flour.
This dish can get messy while cooked, so might consider using a non-stick pan. Either way, expect a bit of scrubbing after the dish is finished.;
, You want the water to be very hot so that it keeps enough heat while you add the flour.

,, You want to keep stirring constantly, making sure that the mixture is getting even heating and that you smooth out any lumps that develop., Cook untill thickened.


You may need to add more than 1 cup of flour to get your ugali to the right texture. Don't worry about staying strictly at 1 cup, instead pay more attention to the texture.

, The texture is usually thicker than mashed potatoes and is best cooked until the dough pulls from the side of the pot.


It may get difficult to stir and incorporate the flour by the end of cooking.However, you want to keep going, so that the finished product is pretty firm.

, Use a wooden spoon to transfer it, taking care while you do it, as the ugali can be very hot.

, Simply cut across making a grid-like pattern, so that the pieces are easier to handle. You could also cut the ugali into slices like a pie, cutting across the center in all directions.


If you don't want to cut the ugali, you can just keep it whole. During the meal allow people to simply pull chunks off with their fingers.

, To eat it, you first want to roll a small piece into a ball, about the size of a golf ball or smaller. Then make an indentation in the middle of it with your thumb.You can then use this indentation to scoop up other foods served in the meal., It goes well with many foods, particularly those that are juicy and need to be scooped up.

Select the fruit and vegetables.,
Rinse and chop most of the produce.,
Chop the mango.,
Chop the chili pepper.,
Combine all ingredients.,
Serve with tortilla chips.",How to Make Mango Salsa1," The tomatoes and mango should both be fully ripe and soft to the touch, but not squishy and bruised. Check near the mango's stem for a small amount of syrup and a mango scent; these are both signs of ripeness. While any varieties of these fruits and vegetables will work, these are the ideal options if available at your local grocery or farmer's market:


Mango: Try to find a non-stringy variety such as Haden and Kent.
Tomatoes: Use a small variety such as Roma. Large varieties will make your salsa soggy.
Onion: A sweet onion variety such as Vidalia makes a sweet salsa, while red onion adds more kick.
Lime or lemon: Lime is preferred, but any variety will do. Bottled lime juice has less punch, but may be a much cheaper alternative in many areas.
Chili pepper: If you enjoy spicy salsa, use habanero, cayenne, or Thai chili to provide great contrast with the sweet mango. Otherwise, select a jalapeño or other relatively mild pepper.;
, Rinse all the fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Peel the onion and garlic, then finely chop them, the tomatoes, and the cilantro leaves. Discard the cilantro stems


If your chopped tomatoes are extra wet, drain them in a colander while you chop the other ingredients.

, The easiest way to cut a mango into thick cubes is to cut it into thirds lengthwise. Set aside the middle third, which contains the pit. Score a grid pattern at ¼ to ½ inch (6–12 mm) intervals into the flesh of each end piece, cutting all the way to the skin. Turn the end piece inside out so the cubes of flesh stick outward, then sever them at the base over a bowl.


Depending on how much flesh there is on your middle section, you can cut cubes off it one by one, or set it aside as a snack for your hard salsa-making.

, Wear gloves to prevent irritation of your skin, and make sure not to touch your face while chopping. Slice the pepper lengthwise in half. Scrape out and discard the seeds and stem. Mince ½ the pepper, or the entire pepper if you enjoy spicy salsa.


If using chili powder instead, add it a teaspoon (5 mL) at a time, according to taste.

, Gently stir all the fruits and vegetables together in the serving bowl. Cut a lime into quarters and squeeze each quarter over the salsa. Add a generous pinch or two of salt and stir.


Taste the salsa before you put away the ingredients. Feel free to add more salt, lime, coriander, chile, or any other ingredient you feel the salsa needs.
If the salsa is too sour, mix in a teaspoon (5 mL) of brown sugar at a time.
If the salsa is floating in its own juices, pour out half the juice or more – but save it for adding to soups or other recipes.

, Unsalted, unflavored chips are best, since the salsa has plenty of flavor on its own. Refrigerate it before serving to enhance the flavor and chill the dish. Leftovers will last for up to three days in the refrigerator.

Add more fruit for a sweeter recipe.,
Mix in other vegetables or nuts.,
Try other spices.",How to Make Mango Salsa2," Make a refreshing summer appetizer halfway between salsa and fruit salad, by chopping and adding half a sweet apple and half a pear instead of the onion and garlic. This pairs well with a handful of chopped mint instead of cilantro.


1⁄4 cup (60 mL) crushed pineapple can be added to this recipe or to the basic recipe for a more tropical, acidic flavor.

, Your favorite fresh vegetables make your salsa distinctive in color and flavor. Options include bell pepper (any color), avocado, cucumber, or walnuts. Mince finely and combine with the basic ingredients.


Leave the avocado out until just before serving, to avoid browning.

, Instead of the typical Mexican blend of chile pepper, cilantro, and garlic, try one of these substitutions for a more unique take on the salsa:


Fry a small handful of fennel seeds in a tablespoon (15 mL) of olive oil, until browned. Add the chopped mango and chile pepper along with ½ teaspoon each (2.5 mL) of cumin, coriander, and ginger powder. Cook until the oil separates, then combine with the other fruits and vegetables or serve plain.

Or try 1 teaspoon (5 mL) white vinegar, 3 teaspoons (15 mL) olive oil, and a brief grind of white pepper.

Go to a butcher that sells specialty meat.,
Select a cut of fresh meat.,
Learn how to bring out the best flavor in goat meat.",How to Cook Goat Meat1," Goat meat is not commonly available in Western supermarkets. You'll need to look for it through specialist butchers, online sellers from farms or gourmet food sellers, and in some Middle Eastern, Indian or Caribbean specialty grocery stores.


Sometimes the words ""chevon"" (older goat meat), ""cabrito"" (younger goat meat) or ""capretto"" are used to denote that the meat is goat's.You can also ask your local butcher to source some goat meat if you'd like to try it.;
, Like beef or pork, there are a variety of cuts of goat meat to choose from. Each one has a different texture and flavor, and each requires a different cooking method. Here are the most popular cuts, and the best cooking methods for them:


Cheeks: Stew.
Chops: Marinate and roast.
Cubed or minced meat: Stew on or off the bone.
Goat leg: Marinate and roast.
Leg steaks: Marinate and roast.
Shoulder: Marinate and roast.

, Goat is quite lean, and if cooked at the high temperatures, it will toughen and be intolerable for eating. Goat meat is best when it has been slow-cooked to break down the tendons in the meat. Marinating goat meat is another good way to tenderize the meat. In addition,


Goat meat loses moisture very quickly due to its low fat content. The best way to cook goat meat is to cook it slowly, preferably in a slow cooker, at a low temperature, and with plenty of moisture.Moreover, goat meat should never be served rare; it must be thoroughly and well cooked in order for it to be appealing.
Flavorful additions tend to make goat meat delicious. Goat meat is ideal for eating with Middle Eastern, Mexican and Indian dishes that use a slow cooking method. The meat gets infused with spices as it becomes tender."
"
Cube the coat meat.,
Marinate the meat and vegetables.,
Brown the meat and vegetables.,
Add the stock and tomato paste.,
Simmer the stew for two hours.,
Serve the stew when the meat is tender.",How to Cook Goat Meat2," In many cases you can buy goat meat that has already been cubed, or cut into bite-sized pieces. If your goat meat has not been cubed, use a sharp knife to slice it into 1-inch pieces that will break down easily in the stew.


Any type of goat can be stewed. If you can't find pre-cubed goat meat, consider stewing a goat leg or goat steaks instead. You can stew a goat leg without cubing it.
You need two pounds of goat meat, not including the weight of the bone.

, Combine the carrots, celery, onions and pepper in a bowl with the goat meat. Season the mixture with a teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Cover the bowl and allow the mixture to sit in the refrigerator overnight. If you don't have enough time to refrigerate it overnight, do so for at least two hours., Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium high heat. Add the marinated meat and vegetables and spread them out in an even layer. Cook on one side until browned, then turn the meat to brown on the other side.


There's no need to cook the meat through. Simply brown it on both sides and cook no longer than one to two minutes. Otherwise, the meat will come out tough.
You can transfer the stew to a slow cooker at this point if you'd prefer not to cook it on the stove.

, Stir it well, then cover the pot and reduce the heat to a simmer. If you want to flavor the stew differently try any of the following variations:


For curried goat meat: substitute a cup of coconut milk for a cup of stock. Add 3 tablespoons curry powder.
For spicy goat meat: add 1/2 Scotch Bonnet pepper, seeded and chopped, or 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper.

, Keep it at a low simmer for the duration of the cooking time. Check every fifteen minutes or so to make sure there is enough liquid in the saucepan to keep the meat and vegetables covered. If needed, add water or more stock in small increments to prevent the stew from drying out.

, After about two hours, the meat should be succulent and fall-apart tender when you poke it with a fork. This stew is delicious when served over rice. It tastes even better the next day."
"
Choose goat meat to roast.,
Marinate the goat meat.,
Preheat the oven to 300° F (150° C).,
Wrap the meat in foil.,
Roast the meat for one hour.,
Serve the meat with rice and peas.",How to Cook Goat Meat3," You can roast any cut of goat meat by cubing it and threading it onto skewers. If you'd rather roast a whole leg, that's fine, too. You need two pounds of goat meat, not including the weight of the bone., In a large bowl, mix the yogurt, orange juice and all of the spices. Add the goat meat to the bowl and coat it completely with the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate it overnight, or for at least four hours.

, This lower temperature will cook the meat slowly, allowing time for it to tenderize.

, Place the meat in the middle of a sheet of aluminum foil. Gather the edges to create a roasting pouch that won't leak. This will trap moisture against the meat so that it won't dry out. Place the pouch in a roasting pan or on a baking sheet.

, When the hour is up, check the meat to see whether it is fall-apart tender. It should come apart easily when poked with a fork. If it holds together, return the meat to the oven to roast for another half hour.

, This traditional Caribbean dish tastes delicious with classic rice and peas or another starchy side dish.

Make the tempura batter just before use. It is best made fresh and not stored for later use.

Continue the rolling method for the rest of your spring rolls.,
Fry them until they're golden brown.",How to Fold a Spring Roll1," If you're using a round piece of dough, then you can lay it out any way you like. If you have a square piece, then lay it out like a diamond.;
, Crack a raw egg into a small bowl and whisk it with a fork until it blends completely. This will help create a mixture that holds the roll together. Once you cook the roll, it will be safe to eat. If you're using rice paper or another wrap that you don't plan on cooking, then you can not use the egg mixture to secure the wrap because it will be raw.








, This will help these parts of the wrap stick together when the time comes.








, Place this on the sheet near the bottom and spread it out in a line. This line should be about 1/2 to 2/3 inches tall. Make sure that the line doesn't overflow off the sheet. You want to leave enough room on each side of the wrap that you can comfortably fold the wrap without the contents spilling out.








, Just fold each side over until they just touch each other, or come close to touching each other, over the filling.









Some people like to fold the top and bottom of the wrap first, and then tuck the sides over the top and bottom before they roll them.

, Be careful to tuck it under the front side of the mixture, the side away from you.








, When the line of mixture isn't visible because it is under the sheet, fold the sides near the end of the line. Hold those down while you continue to fold. Make sure that you are folding with your hands in the middle of the line of mixture.








, Your spring roll is now ready to cook!








, This should do the trick.








, You can make as many as you like, or just make one for yourself.








, Just 2-3 minutes on each side should do the trick. Put a bit of oil on a frying pan and fry the rolls over medium heat. Give them a minute to cool off and they're ready to go.

Roll the bottom up until you've finished folding the spring roll.",How to Fold a Spring Roll2," If you use rice paper, which is traditionally used in many spring rolls, then you should read the instructions on how to prepare it. You may have to place it in hot water for fifteen seconds to get it ready. Each of the four corners should be pointing out, so that it is in the shape of a diamond, not a square.









Keep in mind that, unlike the first method, you can't use egg paste to help the roll stick together because this roll is already cooked. You don't want to put raw egg on it if you don't plan on cooking it.

, Now, scoop in the filling so it lies horizontally from left to right, with at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space between the filling and the left and right corners. This will keep the filling from coming out the sides. It shouldn't be put in too high -- just an inch (2.5 cm) or so at most -- so that you have plenty of space to fold the roll over the filling.








, Now, pick up the bottom corner and fold it over the filling, so the bottom corner is now facing the same direction as the top corner. About an inch (2.5 cm) or so of the corner should be folded above the filling, so that there's still a good 2-3 inches (5 - 7.5 cm) between the bottom corner and the top corner.








, Some people like to tuck the top corner into the filling, so it disappears into the ingredients. Some like to even roll it over the ingredients one full rotation, to secure them there. Others prefer to go the traditional route and to keep the corner folded up -- it's your call.








, Fold the corner over, so it points in the opposite direction, in the middle of the roll. It should begin to resemble an envelope.








, Now, just do what you did on the right side of the roll. The left and right corners should just touch. Now, you've almost finished making your envelope. Right now, it should look like an envelope with the filling inside and the flap facing up.








, Now, just roll from the bottom upwards until you've fully folded the spring roll using the envelope method. Now, all you have to do is sit back and enjoy your delicious treat.

You may prefer to not add the plastic bag on the mouth of the jar. The probiotics in kimchi are just like the ones in Kombucha. They are both highly reactive to plastic, metal and anything with a PTFE coating or other similar type of coating including Microban; these will break down under the probiotics and may poison you. Also, do not use any plastic utensils or metal utensils and containers (use wooden utensils) and use only glass to store Kimchi. You can't buy Kimchi in a plastic jar for this reason. Instead, simply put the cover on the jar, leaving it loose and let it bubble over while fermenting. When your kimchi is as sour as you like, simply tighten the cover and wash off the outside of the jar.

, Allow to ferment until the kimchi is as sour as you like.

You can make homemade chili instead, or use the recipe below.
For more flavor, add diced tomatoes and/or canned beans if the canned chili does not include them. Most Texan chili skips both of these ingredients., A ""walking taco"" is a Frito pie served in the Frito bag instead of a bowl. Each person gets one Frito bag. Cut each bag open along the side instead of the top to make a larger opening.

, Spoon the chili directly into the Frito bag, then top with melted cheese. You can leave this as is to keep the chips crunchy, or stir it together for a delicious mess.


Diced onions and sour cream are optional toppings.
If you want room for more chili, crush some of the chips first by squeezing the bag.

",How to Make Frito Pie3," Slice open the peppers and remove the seeds, stem, and white inner flesh. Heat a dry skillet and toast the peppers for about 30 seconds on each side, until dark spots begin to appear.You can skip this step and use chili powder instead, but whole dried chili peppers give a much better flavor.


Do not touch your eyes until you've washed your hands thoroughly. Wear gloves if you have sensitive skin.
If you like extra-spicy, chili, set aside some of the seeds and add them once the chili is cooking.

, Submerge in 1 cup (240 mL) of hot water, not boiling water, for 5–10 minutes. Puree the peppers and water in a blender and set them aside for now.If you think you'll use them again, you can make a large batch in advance. For maximum flavor, soak for 30 minutes and simmer in oil, covered, for another 20 minutes., Add the beef to a hot frying pan and cook until brown. Stir occasionally and break it into even-sized pieces with a wooden spoon. For best results, brown in small batches, so most of the beef can touch the pan surface. This will take a few minutes per batch.


Use a nonstick pan, or nonstick cooking spray.

, Add the diced onions to the hot pan and cook until translucent, about five minutes.

, Combine chili pepper puree, beef, and onions in a large pot. The larger and heavier the pot, the better the meat texture will be.Add the chicken or beef stock, beer, cumin, a grind of pepper, and several pinches of salt.


If food has stuck to the frying pan, deglaze it with some of the stock and add it to the chili.
Red ale or stout is a good choice.Replace with more stock for a nonalcoholic version; otherwise, about 25% of the alcohol will remain., Bring to a boil, then simmer uncovered until the meat is tender and the chili is thick, 45–60 minutes. Stir occasionally.


For extra flavor, instead cover with a slightly ajar lid and cook for up to 3 hours., This makes a thicker, less greasy chili. Add the corn flour to a bowl and spoon in some of the chili broth. Stir until it forms a paste, then pour it into the chili. Stir until thoroughly combined.

, Taste the chili. Add more salt, pepper, or cumin if desired. Let it sit off the heat to absorb more flavor and cool enough to eat. Serve with Fritos and grated cheese.

Top with chips, remaining vegetables and cheese.",How to Make a Taco Salad1," Use a sharp knife to chop the lettuce, tomato, and bell pepper into small, cubed pieces. Set the lettuce and tomato aside — you'll use them later on.


To save time, you can chop the bell pepper first, then finish the other vegetables while you're waiting for the ground beef to finish browning in the next step.;
, Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the beef with a little cooking oil and use your spoon or spatula to break it into small chunks. After a few minutes, add the chopped bell pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until brown all over and no pinkness remains. This should take about five to seven minutes.


When you're done cooking, there will be a little excess grease in the pan. Carefully drain this into a container that won't melt from the heat and toss in the garbage. Don't pour it down the sink — this can clog the drain.
In a pinch, you can also microwave ground beef for five to seven minutes, breaking it up and stirring at the three minute mark., Pour your bottled salsa directly into the pan with the drained beef and bell pepper. Stir well to combine. Do not attempt to drain the salsa or get rid of excess moisture. Let this mixture cook until it reaches a healthy boil.

, When you notice boiling, reduce the heat to medium or low. The boiling should decrease to a light simmer. Cover loosely (with a gap in the lid to allow steam to escape). Simmer at this heat for 10-12 minutes or until the mixture is pleasantly thick. Stir every few minutes. Keep an eye on the texture and thickness of your mixture to prevent burning.


The cooking time here will vary greatly depending on the starting thickness of your salsa. Very liquid salsas may take the full 12 minutes to thicken, but chunkier salsas will be ready much sooner. When it's done, your mixture should be thick enough to hold together in a spoon without running over the edges.

, Take a generous pinch of your chopped lettuce and set it in the center of each plate. Spoon a helping of the meat/salsa mixture over this bed of lettuce.

, When each plate has a serving of meat over a bed of lettuce, sprinkle each with the chopped tomatoes, crumbled chips, shredded cheese, and the rest of the lettuce. Your easy taco salad is now ready to eat.


This dish can be eaten with a spoon or fork, but you may want to serve it with additional chips or hot tortillas for a rustic ""eat with your hands"" experience.

Chop your vegetables.,
Combine the vegetables.,
Brown and drain the ground beef.,
Add taco seasoning and water.,
Layer ingredients over a bed of lettuce.,
Arrange the chips in an appealing pattern around each serving.,
Garnish with sour cream and guacamole.",How to Make a Taco Salad2," This recipe is a little more complex than the one above, but the result is a fuller, more impressive dish. The recipe starts basically the same way: chop your lettuce, bell pepper, and tomatoes into small pieces so they'll cook quickly. For this recipe, you'll also want to chop about two medium onions and slice a handful of olives.If you are including the optional green onions and cilantro, chop these up at this point as well.

, In this recipe, you will make your own chunky salsa rather than using storebought salsa. Add chopped onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, and olives to a large mixing bowl. If you are using the optional cilantro and green onions, add these as well. Mix well to combine. Don't worry if the tomatoes make the mixture a little watery. Set aside when combined.


If you have a lime handy, squeezing half of it over the mixture can lend it a bit of a tangy flavor. You can also try using a squirt of bottled lime juice. This isn't required, however.

, Set a frying pan over medium-high heat for about three minutes. Add a little cooking spray or oil and crumble the beef into the pan. Cook until well-browned and no pinkness remains (about five to ten minutes), stirring and breaking up the meat with your spoon or spatula.


As noted above, when the meat is finished cooking, some grease will remain in the pan. Drain this carefully and dispose in the garbage.

, Pour the water into the pan with the beef, followed by the seasoning. Stir well so that the beef is evenly coated (the water will make this easier). Simmer until the water evaporates.


If you don't have taco seasoning, it's not hard to make your own. Most commercial seasonings are just chili powder, cumin, paprika, and coriander, with a little salt, onion powder, and/or cayenne added for flavor. See our article on taco seasoning mix for step-by-step recipes.

, Put a generous pinch of lettuce in the center of each serving plate. On top of this, arrange your beef, beans, vegetables, and cheese in layers to give each serving a multi-tiered presentation.


Now is your chance to get creative. There's no ""right"" order to layer your ingredients, so feel free to arrange them however you want. You can also use the sample order below, which works well:




(Bottom) Bed of lettuce
Seasoned beef
Beans
Chopped vegetable mixture
Sprinkled lettuce

(Top) Shredded cheese





, In this recipe, the tortilla chips are used like miniature spoons that you can eat. Arrange a generous portion of chips around each salad in a way that you find pleasing.


Again, the exact arrangement here is up to you. One idea is to try laying chips in a circle around the edge of the plate, for instance. You can also wedge the chips in the salad itself at an angle to make something that looks like a flower.
Keep a bowl of chips handy for when your guests run out of chips on their plates.

, To finish off your taco salad, put a portion of guacamole and sour cream on each plate. You can put these on the side or on top of the salad itself. If you're not sure whether your guests like these ingredients, putting them on the side is probably safest.


To get a clean presentation, try using a melon baller or a tablespoon to get round, even scoops of each ingredient.

Serve in a crisp taco shell ""bowl"".,
Serve with Spanish rice.,
Serve with latin-style beans.,
Toss vegetables with salad dressing for flavor.,
Consider non-beef alternatives.",How to Make a Taco Salad3," If you order a taco salad from a restaurant, there's a good chance that you will receive it in a hard tortilla bowl (or ""tostada"") that looks a little like a giant, folded tortilla chip. You can replicate this at home easily. Just buy tortilla bowls from your local supermarket (your best bet is to look in the Latin foods section) and layer your taco salad inside the bowls instead of on a bed of lettuce.


You can also make your own tostadas if you wish — see our article on the subject for instructions.

, With its distinct flavor and reddish-orange color, there's no mistaking well-prepared Spanish rice. Prepare the rice on its own in a slow cooker or a separate pot (cooking times will generally be longer than for the beef, etc., so you'll probably want to start it first). Serve the rice on the side of the salad plate or use it as a layer in the salad itself.


See our article on Spanish Rice for a selection of easy recipes.

, Beans are a filling side dish that round out a taco salad well. With their high protein and fiber content, they're also quite nutritious. Try serving your taco salad with a generous scoop of beans on the side and provide a few extra chips or tortillas to eat it with.


Refried beans are a favorite often served at Mexican restaurants. See WikiHow's refried bean article for an easy recipe.
Seasoned black beans provide a healthier alternative (see our black beans recipe).

, Adding a few spoonfuls of your favorite dressing to your vegetable mixture can give your salad a richer, more complex flavor for almost no extra effort. Simply stir, shake or toss the vegetables to mix the dressing in well, then use them in the recipe as normal.


While there's no ""right"" dressing to use for this, the simple, tangy-sweet flavor of Catalina dressing tends to be a good choice. A good recipe is available here.

, Ground beef is generally the most common meat used in taco salads, but it's far from your only choice. Many types of shredded or ground meats can be substituted — you may even like them more once you try them. Some choices (like ground poultry) will generally even make a leaner, healthier choice. Prepare these beef alternatives as you normally would: cook them in the pan, drain them, and season them before assembling your salad. A few ideas are below:


Ground chicken
Ground turkey
Pork carnitas
Shredded/pulled barbecue pork
Flank/strip steak, chopped or sliced thin

Sift the dry ingredients together.,
Add the butter, coconut milk, egg, and water and mix all the ingredients thoroughly.,
Pour the mixture in molds or small cupcake pans.,
Put cheese on top of the mixture.,
Prepare the steamer.,
Put the molds in the steamer and steam for 20 minutes.,
Remove the puto from the molds.,
Serve.",How to Make Puto (Steamed Rice Cake)," Sifting your rice flour, sugar, and baking powder will help you combine the dry ingredients, get rid of any lumps, and get some air into those ingredients. Just pour them into a bowl through a sifter, scraping a fork along the bottom of the sifter as they fall, allowing them to sift more easily. Mix the ingredients well until they're thoroughly incorporated.


If you don't have rice flour, you can use regular flour instead, though this is considered less traditional than using rice flour.
If you're really serious about making puto, then you can combine the rice flour and water in a bowl, cover it, and let it sit at room temperature overnight. If you want to do this, you should combine about 1 lb (16 oz) of rice flour with 1 1/2 cups of water.;
, Use a wooden spoon, whisk, or electric mixer to mix the ingredients until they are thoroughly incorporated. If you don't have coconut milk, you can use half as much evaporated milk, or just regular milk, but that won't give the puto the distinct traditional flavor it is known for.


If you'd like the puto to be a bit more gelatinous, you can add 1 tbsp. of tapioca to the entire batch.
Though food coloring isn't necessary, it can make this treat more colorful. Some common colors for puto are lime green, yellow, or purple. If you'd like to create a multitude of colors, you can even divide the batch into four parts, and place 1-2 drops of unique colors in three of them; you can leave the fourth batch without coloring, to create a nice ""white"" color for contrast.

, If you're not using cupcake paper, you can grease the molds with butter to prevent the treats from sticking to them. You should fill the mixture to the top or a little bit below the molds. They'll expand as they cook, so you don't want them to leave some room for them to grow. Some would even say to only fill the molds three-quarters of the way.

, Cut the cheese into little squares about the size of a half-dollar, a little larger than a quarter. If you're using regular cheese, then you should put it on the mold before you start steaming. However, if you're using Quickmelt cheese, then you should put the little squares on at the end of the steaming process, when there are just two minutes left. That's all you'll need to melt the Quickmelt cheese.

, Make sure you've put the necessary amount of water in the steamer and have set it to cook. You can line it with cheesecloth to protect the molds and use more cloth to cover it. Or you can just stick to using an ordinary lid to cover the steamer. You can start preparing the steamer as you mix the ingredients together to save time.

, You can start checking up on them after 10 minutes. Once you can put in a toothpick and have it come out clean when you take it out, then the puto is ready. Just remember to leave two minutes for cooking at the end if you're using Quickmelt cheese.

, Give them a minute or two to cool down before you do this. When they're ready to handle, arrange them on a serving plate.

, This treat is best served warm, so you should enjoy it immediately. Puto can be enjoyed on its own at any time of day, but many people love to have it with coffee. You can also enjoy it along with dinugan, pork blood stew, if you like.

Remember, if you don't have calamansi you can substitute the juice from a lemon or lime.

, Since the meat is already cooked, this is just to mix the flavors together and reheat the pork.

, Sisig is often served with an egg on top, or alongside a side of rice. Enjoy your dish!

Try different cuts of meat.,
Add mayo with the wet ingredients for a richer, thicker sisig.,
Spice up your sisig with a custom spice mixture.,
Marinade the pork a day in advance and bake it if you don't have a grill.",How to Make Sisig3," Pork belly, which is rich in fat, cooks particularly well on the grill and can make decadent sisig. Traditional sisig also mixes in snout, tongue, and liver meat as well, using every part of the pig. But even those that don't enjoy pork can still enjoy sisig.



Squid Sisig: Substitute the squid for the boiled pork. Simply grill the squid for 4-5 minutes, chop it, then add it to the skillet full of sisig mixture.

Monkfish Sisig: Fry and debone a white, mild fish, then add it to the sisig mixture as it cooks.

, Many recipes in the Philippines use mayo as a binding agent, holding the ingredients together in a light sauce.


The traditional binding agent of sisig is actually pork brains, but this variation is for more adventurous eaters.

, There are a lot of different spices to throw in the sisig along with your vegetables and pork. Try tossing these ingredients for the last 4-5 minutes of cooking:


1 cube vegetable, chicken, or beef bouillon.
1 tablespoon Chinese 5 spice seasoning.
1-2 crushed bay leaves.
1/2 cup chopped cilantro.
1 teaspoon orange or lemon zest.

, This recipe, while different, will still make a tender, delicious sisig. To adapt the classic sisig recipe for the oven:


Mix the pork with the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, onions, chili powder, and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.
Refrigerate this mixture overnight.
Preheat an oven at 350 degrees and cook the pork for 3 hours in a roasting pan.
Cool the pork and chop it into small bits, then continue the recipe as if you had finished grilling it.

Serve the taho warm.",How to Make Taho," Pour in 6 cups (1.5 l) of water into a large saucepan, and stir in ¼ cup (59.1 ml) of dark brown sugar. Turn the burner to medium heat and cook until the water has boiled., After the water has boiled, add in the ¼ cup (59.1 ml) of sago pearls. Pour them in, stirring regularly, and cook them until the water returns to a boil.Make sure that you stir at least occasionally because sago pearls are very sticky and are prone to sticking together.

, After the sago pearls have reached a boil, lower the heat and let them simmer. Keep checking on the sago pearls until they are translucent with a solid-looking center. When finished, the pearls should be soft but still fairly chewy.Small sago pearls take about 20-30 minutes to make, while larger varieties can take up to an hour and a half.
If you are cooking larger sago pearls, simmer them for 30 minutes with the lid on and then turn off the heat. Keep the lid on and let the pearls sit and cook for another hour. If the large pearls still aren’t fully cooked, turn up the heat and keep cooking and testing the pearls until they are done.
You can also pre-prepare the sago pearls if you wish. After cooking and draining the pearls, put them in a bowl, pour in enough water to cover them, and refrigerate them for up to three days.
Don’t over-cook the sago, as this changes the texture and makes them mushy.

, After the sago has reached the desired consistency, strain the pearls in a colander. Run cold water over the pearls to cool them and ensure that they don’t cook any further., Transfer the sago pearls into a container and pour in enough room-temperature water to completely cover them. The water will help cool them and also prevent them from sticking to each other. Store them uncovered in the fridge while you are preparing the other ingredients., In a medium saucepan, pour ½ cup (118.2 ml) of water, ¼ cup (59.1 ml) of brown sugar and ½ teaspoon (30 drops) of vanilla extract., Cook the mixture over medium heat until it reaches a boil. Then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for a minute or two. By this time, you should see that the sugar has dissolved and the syrup looks uniform in texture. Stir occasionally so that the sugar doesn't stick to the sides., After the sugar has dissolved and the mixture has turned into a thick syrup, take the arnibal syrup off the heat. Stir it with a spoon to ensure it doesn’t stick to the sides of the saucepan, then put the saucepan aside.

, Set up a steamer on the stovetop over medium heat. Fill the lower pan of the steamer with about two cups (473.1 ml) of water, then bring the water to a boil.

, Place the tofu on a heat-safe plate, then place the plate in the steamer. Let it steam for 15 minutes, then remove the plate from the steamer., The tofu in taho is typically cut into bite-size pieces so that it can be enjoyed in the same spoonful as sago pearls. Some enjoy the tofu cut in small cubes, while other like to cut the tofu in long layers. If in doubt, cut the tofu into inch-long (2.5 cm) chunks., Dish out the chunks of tofu into a cup, or several cups if you are serving multiple people. Try to distribute the tofu evenly.


Taho is often served in clear plastic cups, though it also can be served in bowls if you wish.
The visual aspect of the taho is part of what makes this treat so enjoyable! Even if you are serving in a bowl, try to use a glass bowl so that you can see the swirl of colors inside.
If you waited to assemble the taho and the tofu or syrup got cold, heat them for 40 seconds or so in the microwave. Taho is meant to be eaten warm.

, Take the bowl of sago pearls out of the refrigerator. Pour out the water, and press the pearls lightly with a paper towel so that they aren’t moist. Then dish out the pearls into the cups. Include a generous amount in each cup., After you have added the tofu and the sago pearls, pour in the arnibal syrup. Again, use a generous amount so that every bite of the taho will include the sweet syrup., Use a long spoon to gently press the tofu aside and allow the arnibal syrup to trickle down to the bottom of the cup. Also try to push some of the sago pearls toward the middle of the cup so that they aren’t all at the top.


Be gentle as you push aside the tofu. You don’t want to scramble the tofu or cut it so that it loses its shape. Instead, try to prod it aside so that the syrup and sago pearls can get mixed into the middle and bottom of the cup.
Mixing the taho ensures that each bite is equally enjoyable.

, After you have assembled the taho, serve it immediately while it’s still warm! Eat the taho with a spoon, and enjoy this light, flavorful treat!"

Combine the ingredients in a saucepan.,
Heat through.,
Serve with the eggs.",How to Make Kwek Kwek," Place the eggs in a medium saucepan. Add water until the surface of the water is 1 inch (2.5 cm) higher than the tops of the eggs. Heat the saucepan over high heat until the water starts to boil. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and let the eggs cook in the hot water for an additional 5 minutes.It is generally recommended to bring the water and eggs up to temperature at the same time. If you drop cold eggs into boiling water, you may end up cracking some of the shells.






To make the eggs easier to peel and to prevent the yolks from taking on an unappealing green tint, rinse the eggs in cold water as soon as you remove them from the hot water. This stops the cooking process and creates a barrier of steam between the egg white and the shell, which is why the shell is easier to remove as a result. You can rinse the eggs in cold, running water, or you could dunk them into a bowl of ice water.





;
, Let the eggs sit at room temperature or in cold water until they are cool to the touch. Once they are sufficiently cool, peel off the shells using your fingers. When done, you should be left with a dozen hard-boiled quail eggs.


To peel the shell, tap it on a hard surface, using just enough force to form a crack. Peel the shell off in pieces from this crack.






Note that you can do this step up to two days in advance. If you do not plan on using the boiled quail eggs immediately, you should refrigerate them in a covered container until you are ready. They should not be kept for more than two days, however.

, Sprinkle 1 cup (250 ml) flour into a small dish with shallow sides. Roll the freshly peeled quail eggs in the flour until each one is well-coated all the way around.


Note that you could also use corn flour when dredging the eggs instead of wheat flour. Corn flour has a lower gluten content, but otherwise, it will act the same way as the wheat flour acts and will adhere just as effectively.

, Dilute the annatto powder by mixing it into 3/4 cup (185 ml) warm water. Stir with a whisk until dissolved.


Annatto powder is mostly used as a coloring agent, and when combined correctly, it should produce a deep orange color. It does give the batter a hint of flavor, though.
If you do not have annatto powder, you can use orange food color instead. Place a few drops of orange food coloring, or a few drops of red and yellow food colorings, into the warm water and mix until you get a deep orange color. The food coloring will not give the batter the same exact taste as the annatto powder gives it, but the color should be about the same., Mix another 1 cup (250 ml) flour, baking powder, and diluted annatto together in a large bowl, using a whisk. Combine thoroughly until there are no lumps.


To improve the quality of the batter, set it off to the side for about 30 minutes before coating the eggs. Letting the batter sit allows the flour to become more thoroughly hydrated, creating a thicker, richer batter as a result. The resting time also gives the baking powder more time to activate. Be careful, though, since allowing the batter to rest for more than 30 minutes can cause some of the bubbles produced by the baking powder to escape, creating a denser, less airy batter as a result.
Also note that the baking soda is not an absolutely essential ingredient. Some recipes leave it out completely. You could leave it out, as well, and the result will simply be a slightly denser batter.

, Toss the eggs into the batter mixture. Roll them around gently until all sides are covered in batter.


If you do not want to get your fingers sticky, use a metal skewer or a fork to move the eggs around as you coat them. It is crucial that all sides of each egg get coated.

, Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vegetable oil into a wide pan with tall sides and a heavy bottom. Heat the oil on high over the stove until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).


Check the temperature of the oil using an oil or candy thermometer.






If you do not have a thermometer, check the temperature of the oil by dropping a small dollop of batter into it. The batter should immediately begin to sizzle and fry when the oil is ready.







, Transfer the coated eggs into the oil, four to six at a time. Cook, stirring gently with a slotted spoon, until the batter turns golden-brown and crisp. This should only take a few minutes.


To avoid getting batter on your fingers, you might want to use a skewer to pierce the coated eggs when transferring them to the hot oil. Use a second skewer or fork to scrape the egg off the skewer and into the hot oil.
Work carefully to avoid splashing hot oil when you drop the eggs in.
Understand that the temperature of the oil will fluctuate once you drop the eggs in and once you remove them. Continue watching your oil thermometer as you fry the eggs. Readjust the heat controls on your stove as necessary to maintain a temperature of about 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).

, Line a plate with several layers of clean paper towel. Remove the kwek kwek from the hot oil and place the eggs on the paper towels. Let the excess oil soak into the paper towels.


A plate lined with clean paper bags will work instead of the paper towels, if desired.
Alternatively, you could place the fried eggs in a metal strainer and drain the excess oil that way instead of using paper towels.
It is best to enjoy the kwek kwek while it is still somewhat hot. The batter will be crispier when eaten fresh, but it can start to become soggy once it cools.
Kwek kwek does not reheat well since the batter tends to get soggy during the refrigeration and reheating process.

, In a small saucepan, mix together the rice vinegar, brown sugar, ketchup, soy sauce, and black pepper. Stir until evenly combined.


If you want a spicier sauce, chop up one hot chili and mix it into the other ingredients.If you still prefer a smoother sauce, though, you could accomplish the same level of heat by adding 1 tsp to 1 Tbsp (5 to 15 ml) chili sauce.
Make this sauce as the eggs drain and cool. By the time the sauce is done, enough of the oil should have been drained and the eggs should be cool enough to bite into. You do not want to let the eggs cool down completely, though, since the batter will get soggy once that happens.
Note that you could even make the sauce in advance. Store it in an airtight container and refrigerated it until ready to use. Microwave it for 30 to 60 seconds or heat it gently on the stove to warm it up slightly.

, Simmer the mixture at medium heat on the stove until the sugar completely dissolves. Stir frequently as the sauce cooks.


When done, immediately remove the dipping sauce from the heat source. Allow it to cool down until it is cool enough to touch without getting burned.







, Transfer the dipping sauce into a small bowl. Serve it alongside the freshly fried quail eggs, or kwek kwek.

Sprinkle the seasonings.,
Serve with lime.",How to Make Mexican Corn1," Preheat an outdoor charcoal or gas grill to a medium-high heat setting. Oil the grill grate when ready.


If you're using a charcoal grill, fill and light one chimney full of charcoal briquettes. Once the charcoal is evenly covered in gray ash, spread the coals evenly over half of the coal grate.If you're using a gas grill, preheat the burners on one half of the grill to high heat. Position the grate in place, cover the grill, and wait approximately 5 minutes for the grill to finish preheating.;
, While the grill preheats, remove the husks from the corn. Rinse the exposed cobs under cool, running water and dry well with clean paper towels.


While rinsing the corn, use your hands to peel away most of the silky threads still clinging to the kernels.
You can technically grill the corn without removing its husks, but traditional elotes are lightly charred, and you won't be able to achieve that effect without removing the husks.

, Arrange the cobs of corn over the portion of the grill receiving direct heat. Cook them for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the ears are evenly charred and hot throughout.Use tongs to turn and rotate the corn every few minutes. The corn should be lightly charred over all sides, and rotating it is the only way to accomplish that.
Remove the corn from the grill as soon as it appears done.

, Pour the melted butter into a shallow dish. Roll each ear of corn in the butter, coating all sides evenly.


Alternatively, use a basting brush to brush each ear of corn with the melted butter, coating them as evenly as possible.

, Use a spoon or butter knife to spread the mayonnaise over all sides of each ear of corn.


Note that the corn should have a fairly light coating of mayonnaise. You only need to apply enough mayonnaise to flavor the corn and help the seasonings stick.

, Sprinkle each ear of corn with grated cotija cheese, chopped cilantro, and chili powder.


Apply as much or as little of these seasonings as desired.
Cotija cheese is ideal, but if you don't have any, you could use grated Feta, Parmesan, or Romano cheese., Serve the corn immediately, while it's still hot and fresh. Cut the lime into wedges and serve it alongside the corn.

If you don't have a roasting rack, you can cook the ears of corn directly on the oven rack. Do not coat the oven rack with nonstick cooking spray, but thoroughly clean it before and after roasting the corn.

, Place the roasting rack on the middle shelf of the oven, and bake the corn for approximately 30 minutes, or until it is tender and cooked through.


Note that you should keep the husks on the corn when using the roasting technique. Do not husk the corn before cooking it.
The exact amount of cooking time will vary depending on the size of the ears and the level of doneness you prefer. You should begin checking the corn after 25 minutes. Continue checking it every 5 to 10 minutes after that, cooking the corn up to 45 minutes if needed.

, Remove the finished corn from the oven. Let it cool slightly, then peel away the husks.


Place the corn on a separate cooling rack and wait at least 5 minutes for it to cool. Once you can safely handle it without burning your fingers, peel off the husks.
You can either completely remove the husks or wrap them around the stem end of each ear to serve as a handle.

, Spread the butter evenly over each ear of corn, then coat all sides of the corn with a thin layer of mayonnaise.


You can either roll the corn in the melted butter or brush the butter on using a pastry brush.
Use a butter knife or spoon to spread the mayonnaise.

, Sprinkle the corn with chili powder, chopped cilantro, and cotija cheese. Apply as much or as little as desired according to your sense of taste.


Note that cotija cheese is the most conventional option, but if you don't have any, you can substitute grated Parmesan or Romano cheese. Finely crumbled Feta cheese could also work.

, Cut the lime into wedges. Immediately serve the corn with one or two of these lime wedges and enjoy it while it's still hot.

Lightly char the corn.,
Add the garlic and jalapeño.,
Toss the corn with the remaining ingredients.,
Serve warm or at room temperature.",How to Make Mexican Corn3," Place the butter in a large, heavy skillet and set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat.Once the butter completely melts, turn the pan to coat the bottom.
If desired, you could use canola oil instead of butter. Allow the oil to heat for 30 to 60 seconds, or until it starts shimmering, before turning the pan and coating the bottom.

, Add the corn kernels to the hot butter in the skillet. Cook, stirring and tossing occasionally, until it becomes lightly and evenly charred.


If using frozen corn, thaw it before adding the corn to the pan. For a fresher alternative, you could use a large, smooth knife to slice the kernels off four or five fresh cobs.
The exact amount of cooking time will vary depending on how often you stir the corn and how charred you prefer it. If you toss the corn infrequently, the process should take 6 to 10 minutes. If you stir it frequently, the process may take 15 to 20 minutes.

, Add the minced garlic and minced jalapeño to the skillet. Stir to incorporate the new ingredients into the corn, then cook for another 30 to 60 seconds.


If you don't wish to use jalapeño, try using a red chile pepper or other small hot pepper. Regardless of the variety you choose, however, you should still remove the seeds and mince the pepper before adding it.When ready, the pepper and garlic should both seem lightly toasted and more fragrant.

, Remove the corn from the heat and transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add the cheese, mayonnaise, cilantro, chili pepper, and lime juice to the bowl, as well. Toss well to combine.


Cotija cheese is the most convention choice, but crumbled Feta cheese would be a good substitute. You could also use grated Romano or grated Parmesan cheese.
Adjust the seasonings as needed to match your personal sense of taste. For an interesting variation, you could also mix in other complementary seasonings and ingredients, like salt, green onion, and avocado.

, Allow the corn mixture to cool slightly, then enjoy it while it's slightly warm to room temperature. Serve with additional cotija cheese or wedges of lime, if desired.

, While tortillas are a healthier option than deep fried shells for Mexican food, it’s important to choose the right type. Instead of flour tortillas, which are high in carbs and low in fiber, choose corn tortillas. They are lower in carbs, contain whole grains, and are high in fiber so you’ll feel full longer.Whole wheat tortillas are another healthy alternative to flour options. Like corn tortillas, they are made from whole grains and are high in fiber.

, Rice is often used as a filling in Mexican dishes, such as burritos, and as a side for other Mexican recipes. Instead of the usual white rice, which is low in nutritional value, use brown rice in your burritos and as the base for Mexican rice. It contains whole grains and is high in fiber to make it a healthier option.If you aren’t a fan of brown rice, consider substituting grated cauliflower “rice” for the white rice in your Mexican recipes. It is low in calories and carbs and is gluten-free.

, Choosing healthier ingredients for your Mexican dishes doesn’t have to mean flavorless meals. By incorporating hot peppers and spices, your recipes will have plenty of flavor without adding any significant calories, fat, or carbs to the food.Fresh, chopped jalapenos, serrano, and habanero peppers can add significant heat to your dishes.
Chili powder, chipotle powder, cumin, coriander, black pepper, garlic, and oregano are common spices used to add flavor to Mexican dishes.

, Instead of using meat or cheese to bulk up your Mexican dishes, look for ways to incorporate fresh vegetables in your recipes. Use sliced veggies as fillings for burritos, quesadillas, fajitas, enchiladas, and other dishes, or use chopped vegetables to top tacos and burrito bowls.Because vegetables are low in calories and fat but high in nutrients, you can add as much of them as you like to your favorite Mexican recipes. They can help make your meals more filling so you don’t need to add as much protein or fat.
Bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, squash, corn, spinach, and other greens all make delicious additions to your favorite Mexican dishes.

, Many Mexican dips, such as queso dip, are high in fat and calories, so they aren’t healthy options. Salsa, on the other hand, is full of vegetables, herbs, and spices so it is relatively low in calories and fat but high in nutrients. Add some fresh salsa to the fillings for tacos, burritos, or quesadillas, or use it as a dip for your favorite Mexican dishes.It’s best to make homemade salsa so you can control what goes into it and be sure that it isn’t too high in sodium.
Avoid eating salsa with tortilla chips as it’s often served in Mexican restaurants. They are deep fried so they aren’t a healthy option.

, Ground beef is a common ingredient for popular Mexican dishes such as tacos or nachos, but it can be high in fat. Replacing ground beef with a leaner cut of meat, such as ground turkey or chicken, can help make your favorite Mexican dishes a little healthier.If you aren’t comfortable substituting ground turkey or chicken for all of the beef in your recipes, consider mixing half and half. Use half ground beef and half ground turkey or chicken; you’ll still get the flavor of the ground beef but keep the fat and calories down.
If you really prefer using ground beef in your Mexican dishes, opt for the leanest cut that you can get, such as 90/10.

, Red meat is often used in Mexican recipes, but it is high in saturated fat and cholesterol so it isn’t the best option. Grilled chicken breast is an ideal alternative because it is lower in saturated fat.Be sure to opt for lean white meat chicken rather than dark meat, which is higher in saturated fat and cholesterol.
Grilled chicken makes an ideal filling for tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and quesadillas. It also makes a healthier topping for nachos.

, Like chicken, fish makes an ideal alternative to red meat in many Mexican dishes. Not only is fish lower in saturated fat, the omega-3 fatty acids fats that it does contain are actually good for you. It makes a good replacement for ground beef in tacos.Halibut, cod, flounder, salmon, tilapia, and snapper can make ideal taco fillings.

, Beans are often used to serve as protein in vegetarian Mexican dishes, but not all beans are created equal. Refried beans are usually flavored with lard, making them high in fat and sodium. Choose black beans instead, which are high in fiber and low in fat.If you aren’t a fan of black beans, you can substitute pinto beans instead. They are closer in taste to refried beans but don’t contain as much saturated fat.

, Fat imparts a great deal of flavor to Mexican dishes, so you don’t have to avoid it entirely. However, it’s important to understand serving sizes so you don’t wind up adding too much. Check the packaging or nutritional information for the cheese, sour cream, and avocados that you plan to use so you’re aware of how much saturated fat and calories that contain.A serving size of most shredded cheese is ¼ cup (25 g).
A serving size of avocado is 2 tablespoons (28 g).
A serving size of sour cream is 2 tablespoons (30 g).
It’s best to include just one fat in your Mexican recipes. For example, if you’re using cheese, skip the avocado and sour cream. If you add avocado, leave out the cheese and sour cream.

, Cheese is often included in Mexican dishes, such as tacos, enchiladas, and quesadillas. To make sure that your meal is as healthy as possible, skip the full dairy cheese and incorporate a low-fat version. You can find low-fat cheddar and monterey jack, which are both popular in Mexican recipes.You may prefer to use pepper jack cheese in your Mexican dishes. It has the biggest flavor so you can add less of it and still wind up with a flavorful meal.

, Sour cream is often used to top Mexican recipes as a soothing contrast to the spice of the food. However, it is high in saturated fat so it isn’t the healthiest option. Consider substituting guacamole for sour cream. It is high in fat, but they are hearty-healthy monounsaturated fats so it’s a healthier option.For the healthiest option, make your own guacamolewith fresh avocados. That way, you can control exactly what goes into it.
If you really prefer to use sour cream, opt for a low-fat version.

Making the patties.,
Once all of the patties are finished, they can be plated and topped with the peanut sauce.,
These potato patties are commonly served with various egg dishes, and even sausages.",How to Make Llapingachos at Home," The water can then be drained from the pan to allow the potatoes to dry for several minutes. After they have dried sufficiently, they should be mashed. This is the time to add any salt that is desired. After mashing, the potatoes will need to be divided into sections of about a third of a cup, and formed into balls. Allow them to chill for a half an hour.;
, While waiting for the potatoes to set up, the sauce can be made. The milk should be cooked on a low simmer, along with the sliced onions. After ten minutes have passed, pull the onions out and throw them away. The peanut butter should then be blended into the milk, with the desired amount of salt. Once the sauce reaches a boil, the heat can be turned to low to allow the sauce to become thicker. This should take about five or six minutes.

, When the potatoes have cooled sufficiently, pull them out and add about a tablespoon and a half of the cheese and scallions to each ball. Put the oil in a pan and put the stove on a moderate level of heat. Once the balls have been made into patties, place them within the pan of oil two at a time and allow them to cook until they are brown.

, To ensure that they are hot when served, it is often a good idea to place the finished patties into the oven to keep them warm while others are browning.

, The truly traditional meal includes rice and one or more vegetable choices. The flexibility of these potato patties and their exotic taste make them useful as either a main course or a side dish. Those cooks who take the time to learn how to make llapingachos at home will find that these potato patties quickly become a popular choice for those who experience them.

Simmer the tamales for 40 minutes or until they no longer stick to the husk.",How to Make Masa," Add 4 ½ cups (513 g) of masa harina and 3 ¾ cups (887 ml) of cold water to a large bowl. Use clean hands to blend the two together until they are mostly incorporated and a moist dough forms. Set the bowl aside.Masa harina is a corn-based flour used in traditional Mexican cooking. You can usually find it in Latin grocery stories or in the international aisle of other grocery stores. Many online retailers also sell it.;
, Add 1 ½ cups (308 g) of cold lard and 1 tablespoon (18 g) of kosher salt to the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment inserted. Beat the two together on high until the mixture is white and shiny, which should take approximately 2 minutes.Lard or rendered pork fat helps give the masa a mild pork flavor. You can make your own or find it at Latin grocery stores or in some general grocery stores in the oil or baking aisle.
If you prefer to make a vegetarian masa, you can substitute vegetable shortening for the lard. However, it won’t have the same flavor as traditional masa.
You can substitute an electric handheld mixer for the stand mixer, though you may need to beat the lard and salt together a little longer.

, After you’ve blended the lard and salt together, lower the mixer’s speed to medium high, and begin to add handfuls of the dough you made earlier. Continue mixing in more until all of the dough is blended in.When you add the dough, make sure that each handful is mixed in before adding more.

, Once you’ve added all of the dough to the lard mixture, keep blending the mixture for approximately another minute. Stop when all of the ingredients are fully mixed, and a soft, smooth dough forms., When the dough has formed, cover the bowl tightly with a piece of plastic wrap. Chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least an hour to firm it up.You can refrigerate the dough for up to 2 days before using it.

, To make it easier to get the tortillas off the press, it helps to cover it with plastic. Cut open a plastic zipper plastic bag along a side seam. Open the tortilla press and set the open bag over it.You can purchase a tortilla press at most home goods stores and a variety of online retailers. It is a good investment if you make homemade tortillas on a regular basis.
If you don’t have a tortilla press, you can roll out the masa with a rolling pin. They won’t be perfectly round as they are with a press and there may be some cracks along the edges, but they still work well for holding your favorite fillings.
You can use regular plastic wrap to cover the press, but the bags work better because the plastic is thicker, which makes it easier to lift the pressed tortillas off.

, After you’ve covered the press with the plastic bag, use a clean hand to remove approximately 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60 g) of the chilled masa dough from the bowl. Carefully roll it into a ball between your hands.A ball of masa that’s approximately the same size as a ping pong ball will typically create a 6-inch (15-cm) tortilla. Adjust the amount of dough that you use to get the tortilla size that you prefer.

, Once you’ve rolled the masa into a ball, place it down on the opened plastic bag in the middle of the press. Fold the other side of the plastic bag down over the ball so the masa is protected with plastic on both sides., With the masa ball in place, close the press. Bring down the handle over the top of the press, and flatten the dough until it is approximately ⅛-inch (3-mm) thick.If you press the tortilla and it isn’t as thin as you’d like, it usually helps to rotate the plastic with the dough on it and repress it.

, After you’ve pressed the tortilla to the right thickness, open the press, remove the top layer of plastic, and flip the tortilla onto your hand so you can peel away the plastic bag from the other side. Set the finished tortilla on a plate, and repeat the process for as many tortillas as you need.If you’re waiting to cook all of the tortillas once you’re finished pressing them, make sure to cover the flattened tortilla with a towel to keep them fresh.
You can stack the tortillas on top of one another, but you must be carefully when you peel each off the stack because they may stick together. If you like, you can cut some more plastic bags to layer between the tortillas.

, To cook the tortillas, set a large, flat cast iron skillet on the stove. Turn the heat to medium-high and allow the pan to heat for at least 5 minutes.You’ll know the skillet is hot enough when you drop some water on it and it sizzles right away.

, When the skillet is heated, place a tortilla in it. Allow it to cook for 1 to 2 minutes on the first side, or until the edges begin to curl up. Turn the tortilla over, and cook it for another 1 to 2 minutes on the other side.You’ll know that the sides of the tortilla are ready when they are dry and have some brown, toasted spots.
You can cook as many tortillas as will fit in the pan in a single layer with no overlapping at one time.

, After the tortilla is finished cooking, place it on a clean kitchen towel. Wrap the towel around it to help trap the steam and soften it. Continue cooking the tortillas, and stack the finished ones on top of one another, wrapping the entire pile in the towel., Fresh, homemade tortillas are best when served warm so you can use in them in your favorite recipes right away. If you don’t plan to eat them right away, allow them to cool, place them in zipper plastic bags, and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.You can use the corn tortillas for tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas, or any recipe that calls for a tortilla or wrap.
To reheat refrigerated tortillas, wrap them in dampened paper towels and microwave in 30 second intervals until they are warm and soft.

, To form the tamales, you need corn husks. Remove any dirt on the husks by filling your sink with warm water and placing them in it to soak for at least 15 minutes. Swish the husks around in the water once or twice to ensure that all of the dirt comes loose.After the husks are finished soaking, drain the sink and rinse them with fresh water before moving onto the next step.
You can find corn husks, often marketed as tamale wrappers, at Latin grocery stores and many mainstream markets.

, Corn husks are often large, so unless you want to make oversized tamales, it’s best to trim them. Use a pair of scissors to cut the husks so they are approximately 5-inches (13-cm) wide.Save the scraps from the husks that you trim off. You can use them for cooking the tamales later.

, Once the husks are clean and trimmed, lay them out flat and place approximately 2 tablespoons (30 g) of the masa in the center. Use a butter knife or offset spatula to spread the masa so it forms a 5-inch by 5-inch (13-cm by 13-cm) square along one of the longer sides of the husks., After you’ve spread out the masa, add a small amount of the filling of your choice to the center of it. Spread it out over the masa in a thin, even layer.Traditional tamales fillings include pork, chicken, and beans and cheese, but you can be as creative as you like.
It’s best to make your filling ahead of time and refrigerate it. Cold fillings hold their shape better and don’t run out of the tamales.

, After you’ve spread the filling over the masa, fold over one long side of the husks. Next, fold over the other side to cover the first. With the seam facing upward, fold one end of the husks under to secure it.One end of the tamales will still be open when you’ve finished folding them properly.

, After you’ve folded the tamales, line the bottom of the a large pot with the corn husk scraps that you trimmed earlier. Crumple a ball of foil and place it in the center of the pot before arranging the tamales around it.When you place the tamales in the pot, make sure to arrange them with the seams facing outward and the unfolded ends facing upward.
It’s all right if the tamales lean against one another, so you can create multiple rows in the pot.

, Once all of the tamales are in the pot, pour 3 cups (710 ml) of chicken stock into the pot. Heat the pot on the stove high heat until it comes to a boil.You can substitute water or another type of broth for the chicken broth if you prefer.

, After the pot comes to a boil, cover it and lower the heat to medium-low. Allow the tamales to simmer for approximately 40 minutes, adding more stock if it the liquid cooks off. You’ll know the tamales are done when they no longer stick to the husk when you unwrap them.Allow the tamales to sit for about 10 minutes before serving.

Choose your main protein or filling.,
Heat up several tablespoons of oil on medium heat in a large skillet.,
Cook the meat with the onions and garlic.,
Lower the heat to low and add beans and sauces.,
Cover the pan and let it sit for 20-30 minutes on low heat.,
Set the mixture aside to cool.,
Shred the filling if necessary.,
Experiment with new filling ideas.",How to Make Chimichangas1," Chimichangas are usually classified by the type of meat or protein source filling them, and you have a lot of options. The two most common are ground beef and shredded chicken, but feel free to experiment. The only real criteria is that the meat needs to be tender enough that it can be cut into small pieces -- large steaks may be difficult to maneuver.


Vegetarians can make incredible chimichangas with spiced rice and beans. Cook the rice according to the packaging, but use vegetable broth instead of water. Add the beans afterwards and heat them up together before continuing.
More adventurous eaters should try out Lengua (cow tongue), Tripe (intestines), or Cabeza (cow head).;
, The oil should be hot but not smoking. Save the rest of your oil for later -- you'll need it to fry the chimichangas at the end.

, Add your meat to the hot oil and cook until browned, then add the chopped onions and garlic. Cook an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the onions are slightly translucent (clear, but not completely). Add your spices to this mixture so that the meat and vegetables have time to absorb them.


Once the meat is brown and the outside is starting to caramelize, it is time to add the vegetables.
If you are adding chopped bell peppers, chili peppers, or jalapeños, add them with the onions.
For slightly sweeter filling, you can caramelize the onions before you add them.

, This is where you get to customize your chimichangas to your liking. Mix in red chili sauces for a spicy flavoring, enchilada sauce for a smokier filling, or sour cream for a richer taste. Mix in any beans and rice if desired. Stir the filling so that everything is coated in your sauce and spices once everything is added.


Avoid making the mixture soupy or watery. Add enough sauce so that there is a little extra liquid at the bottom of the pan but no more than 1/4 of an inch.
Some people prefer to keep the rice and beans separate as a ""dry"" component.

, This step is not strictly necessary, but it allows the flavors to meld together to create a richer filling. The longer you cook it, the better the flavor, but stir it periodically and sure there is still liquid at the bottom of the pan.


You can periodically taste the mixture and add more salt, pepper, or spices to suit your preferences.

, Once you've finished with the filling you'll need to let it rest before stuffing the chimichangas.

, Using a fork or a food processor, cut the filling up so that there are no large chunks that will make rolling your chimichangas difficult.

, The only limit is your creativity. Simply follow the steps above to create any filling you want, substituting different meats, vegetables, or sauces. Try pulled pork, onions, and barbecue sauce for a ""Southern"" chimichanga, mix it up with sauteed squash, carrots, and peppers for a vegetarian option, or be bold with a dessert chimichanga.

Warm the tortillas.,
Spoon 1/6 of your filling into the center of the tortilla.,
Roll up the chimichanga.,
Heat up at least 4 inches of vegetable oil in a large sauce-pot.,
Remove the chimichangas and drain them before serving.,
Alternatively, bake the chimichangas for a healthier approach.,
Top the chimichanga and serve.",How to Make Chimichangas2," Warm tortillas are much easier to roll, becoming softer and more pliable. You can warm your tortillas several ways:



Oven: Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil and place in a 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes.

Microwave: Wrap each tortilla in moist paper towels and heat on high for 6-7 each.

Stove-Top: On a lightly greased griddle (use a drop or two of vegetable oil), heat each side of the tortilla for 30 seconds., The amount may vary depending on how much filling you have, but generally 1/3 of a cup will do. Err on the side of less filling if you are not confident in your tortilla rolling abilities.


Leave at least a 2 inch border between your filling and the edge of the tortilla., Roll the tortilla like you would roll up a burrito. Fold in one inch of each side, then roll upwards from the bottom. Use your fingers to contain the filling as you go.


Stick each roll with toothpicks to hold them together if they keep unraveling.

, If you have a deep-frier, you can set it to 375 degrees. If not, heat up oil in a pot with large sides until it is just beginning to smoke. Set your stove-top to medium-high heat.Different oils have different smoking points -- so research yours if not using vegetable oil. You want the oil between 375 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit. That said, a little variation will not ruin the chimichangas if you remove them before they burn.
Fry the chimichangas for 2-3 minutes each in the hot oil. After 1 minute, flip the chimichanga so that each side is in the oil. Do not put so many in the pot that you have no room to turn them -- you can usually cook only 1-2 at a time.
Be careful of oil splatter. Never drop the chimichanga in from a high up and keep your face away from the top of the pot.

, Using a slotted spoon, remove the chimichanga and rest it over the pot so any excess oil drips off. Pat them lightly with paper towels to remove any more unneeded oil, then set them aside as you cook the rest.


Make sure the chimichanga is cool enough to touch before patting it dry.

, Coat an oven-safe pan with oil or melted butter, then place the chimichangas in it seam-side down. Lightly brush oil on the tops of each roll and cook them in the oven for 8-10 minutes at 450 degrees. Flip them after 10 minutes and cook for another 8-10 minutes.


After flipping them, you can add your shredded cheese so that it melts on top.
Every oven is different, so be sure to remove them if they start to brown or burn.

, While still hot, top the chimichanga with cheese, then add the rest of your desired toppings. Try diced tomatoes and lettuce for a classic chimichanga or experiment with guacamole, your favorite salsa, olives, sour cream, enchilada sauce, scallions, or Tabasco."

Combine the almond milk and eggs.,
Stir in the remaining ingredients.,
Allow the batter to sit for a moment.,
Heat a skillet.,
Pour the batter into the center of the pan.,
Tilt the pan to spread the batter into a circle.,
Cook the tortilla until the edges begin to curl.,
Flip the tortilla and cook until the other side browns.,
Turn the tortilla over again and brown on the first side.,
Place the tortilla on a cooling rack to set.,
Repeat the process with the remaining batter.",How to Make Coconut Tortillas," Add 2 ½ cups (591 ml) of almond milk and 4 large eggs to a large bowl. Use a whisk to beat the ingredients together until they’re fully mixed.If you prefer, you can mix the tortilla batter in a stand mixer with the wire whisk attachment inserted.;
, Once the almond milk and eggs are mixed together, add 2 cups (244 g) of tapioca flour starch, ½ cup (56 g) of coconut flour, 1 tablespoon (14 g) of flaxseed meal, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully blended and the batter is smooth.You can purchase tapioca flour starch at most grocery stores.
If you prefer, you can substitute whole wheat flour for the tapioca flour starch.
You can find coconut flour at many grocery stores in the gluten-free foods section.
Flaxseed meal is just ground flaxseeds. You can purchase the meal at many grocery and health food stores, or make your own by grinding whole flaxseeds in a food processor or coffee grinder.

, After you’ve finished mixing the batter, let it sit on the counter for 1 to 2 minutes. That gives the coconut flour time to naturally thicken up the batter so it’s pourable but not as thin as water.Be careful not to let the batter sit for too long. You don’t want it to thicken up too much or you won’t be able to pour it into the pan to fry the tortillas.

, To fry the tortillas, you’ll need an 8-inch (20-cm) frying pan. Place it on the stove, and turn the heat to medium. Allow it to fully heat, which should take 3 to 5 minutes, before frying your tortillas.You may want to add a ½ teaspoon (2 ¼ g) of coconut oil to the pan to prevent the tortillas from sticking. If you’re using a non-stick skillet, it usually isn’t necessary.
If you want to make larger tortillas, use a pan that’s larger than 8-inches (20-cm). Your finished tortilla will be roughly the same size as the pan that you use.

, When your skillet is fully heated, use a measuring cup to scoop ½ cup (80 g) of the batter from the bowl. Add the batter to the center of the pan from the measuring cup.If you’re using a pan that’s larger than 8-inches (20-cm), you may want to add a little more than ½ cup (80 g) of batter so the tortillas aren’t too thin.

, As soon as you pour the batter into the center of the skillet, rotate your wrist to smoothly to tilt the pan and move the batter. The goal is to spread it so it covers the entire bottom of the pan.The batter should spread in a fairly thin, even layer throughout the pan.

, Once the batter is spread throughout the pan, allow it to cook on medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes until the tortilla is just set. You’ll know that it’s set when the edges of the tortilla begin to lift and curl., When the bottom of the tortilla is set, use a rubber spatula to carefully flip it over. Allow it to cook on the other side until it is golden brown, which should take 2 to 3 minutes.It helps to use as wide a spatula as possible because you’ll be able to support more of the tortilla so it’s less likely break as you flip it.

, After the bottom of the tortilla is golden brown, use the spatula to flip it over again to the first side. Let the tortilla cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until the first side is golden brown too.Be careful not to cook the first side too long because it’s already partially cooked. If you leave it in the pan too long, it may burn.

, When the tortilla is golden brown on both sides, use the spatula to lift it out of the pan. Set it down on a wire cooling rack and allow it to cool completely, which should take 15 to 20 minutes., Once you’re finished with the first tortilla, continue the same process with the remaining batter. If you used oil to grease the pan, you’ll likely need to add more before you make each tortilla.This recipe should make approximately 12 8-inch (20-cm) tortillas.
Store the coconut tortillas in plastic zipper bags in the refrigerator. They should keep for up to 2 weeks.
You can also freeze the tortillas, so they’ll keep for up to 3 months.

Enjoy.",How to Make Conchas," Pour the warm water into a large bowl. Stir in the yeast and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of the granulated sugar until combined. Let the mixture stand for 10 minutes.The water must be much warmer than room temperature but not hot enough to steam.
As the yeast stands, foam should begin to form. If no foam forms after the 10 minutes pass, the yeast might be dead, and your bread will not rise at all. If this is the case, you should start over with a new packet of yeast.;
, The milk should be at least as warm as the water. Pour it into a small saucepan and slowly heat it on the stove over medium-low heat, stirring continually to prevent it from burning. Remove the milk from the heat as soon as steam starts to form.


Set the milk off to the side and allow it to cool for a few minutes. When it stops steaming, the milk should be sufficiently cool.

, Pour the warm milk into the proofed yeast. Also add the remaining sugar, unsalted butter, eggs, salt, cinnamon, and half of the flour. Stir until thoroughly combined.


You could try mixing the dough with a mixing spoon, but you will have better luck if you use your hands, especially once you add more of the flour and the dough starts to become thicker.
If you have a stand mixer with a dough attachment, you could use that instead of using your hands.

, Divide the remaining flour into thirds. Add it to the dough mixture one third at a time, mixing well after each addition. Continue to mix after the final addition until the dough has come together completely.


Do not add all the flour at once. Mixing the flour into the dough a little at a time makes the process easier and ensures that the moist ingredients are blended into the dough at more equal intervals.
Continue mixing with your hands. You could also use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment.

, Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust your hands with flour, and knead the dough by hand for 5 to 10 minutes, until it becomes less sticky and forms a smooth, elastic mass.


If the dough starts to stick at any point as you knead it, sprinkle more flour onto the counter, your hands, or over the surface of the dough. You do not want to add too much extra flour into the dough, but you do need enough to prevent it from sticking to everything it comes into contact with.

, Set it aside in a warm space for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.


The bowl you place the dough in should be about twice the current size of the dough to allow the dough enough room to expand.
Use nonstick cooking spray or vegetable oil to coat the bowl before you place the bowl inside. This prevents the dough from sticking.
Ideally, the dough should sit at a temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) as it rises. One option is to preheat the oven to its lowest setting, turn it off, and place the dough in the still warm oven with the oven door slightly cracked.

, Beat the two together with an electric mixer at medium speed until the mixture becomes fluffy and less dense.


Use powdered sugar if you want your topping to be smooth. If you prefer a somewhat grainy texture, use granulated sugar.

, Add the vanilla extract and flour to the contents of the bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until well-mixed.


The resulting dough should somewhat resemble cookie dough.
If you want to add a little cinnamon to the topping dough, do so when you add the vanilla and flour.

, Separate the topping dough into two equal portions. One portion can remain in its current bowl, but the second should be transferred to another bowl.


By following these instructions, you can create a chocolate topping and a colored vanilla topping. If you only want to make one topping for the conchas, though, you can add the other topping ingredients to the full batch of topping dough instead of dividing the dough into two separate portions.

, Sprinkle the cocoa powder over one half of the dough. Blend it into the dough using your hands or a mixing spoon until the entire half is a rich, even brown.


Note that the cocoa powder is technically optional. If you do not want any chocolate topping, you can skip it. Leave the dough colorless or add food coloring to it as instructed to do with the second half.
Similarly, you could use cocoa powder to flavor and color both halves of the topping. To do so, simply double the total amount of cocoa powder called for in the original recipe and add it to the full batch of dough without dividing the dough into halves.

, Mix half a dozen to a dozen drops of your favorite food coloring hue to the other half of the dough. Work the food coloring into the topping dough using your hands or mixing spoon, and continue mixing until the color is evenly dispersed through the dough.


Note that you can add more food coloring if you want a deeper color.
If you do not want to use food coloring, you can color this half with cocoa powder or leave it colorless, instead.

, Gently punch down the risen dough. Separate the full bulk of dough into 12 to 16 evenly sized portions, and roll each portion into a ball.


Spread these balls of dough onto two lightly greased baking sheets. Leave at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of space in between each ball of dough.
Gently press on the top of each piece of dough to somewhat flatten the top. The rolls should be round, but the top needs to be somewhat flat for when you add the topping.

, Separate the topping dough into 12 or 16 pieces, depending on how many rolls you made with the bread dough. Make sure that half of the pieces are chocolate and half are vanilla.


Roll each piece of topping into a ball.
Place each ball, one at a time, in between two pieces of plastic wrap or parchment paper. Press down on it with your hands or with a rolling pin to flatten the ball into a circle. Each circle should be large enough to completely cover the top of one roll.

, Arrange the flattened circles of topping onto the rolls, one piece of topping per roll. Carefully press down around the edge of the topping dough to secure it into the bread dough.


The two doughs do not need to be blended together, but they should stick together securely. To test the strength of the bond, carefully tip the roll upside-down after placing the topping on. The topping should remain on even when upside-down. If it falls off or if a side starts to fall off, press it into the dough a little more firmly and try again.

, The patterns you choose should resemble seashells. Gently draw the patterns into the topping using a toothpick. The lines should be deep, but not deep enough to completely cut through to the other side of the topping or into the roll itself.


The name of this sweet bread roll, ""conchas,"" is also the Spanish word for ""seashells."" In other words, the bread is named for this seashell design, which is why it is an important aspect of authentic conchas.
Get creative. Try to mimic the appearance of a clam shell, or create a snail-like spiral pattern. If all else fails, you could just draw a criss-cross pattern over the top.

, Loosely cover the rolls with a damp dish towel or plastic wrap. Place the bread back in a warm location and allow the rolls to rise again for another 45 minutes.


As before, the dough should nearly double in size after it finishes rising.

, To save time, begin preheating the oven while the conchas rise.


Ideally, the oven should be ready a little before or as soon as the rolls have finished rising.

, Place both baking sheets into the preheated oven, placing them on the middle rack if possible. Allow the rolls to bake until the bread turns a light golden brown color.


Work gently as you place the dough in the oven. If you move the rolls around too recklessly, you could partially deflate them.
Pay attention to the color of the bread dough and not the color of the topping. Since the topping has been colored with cocoa powder and food coloring, it will be harder to see any browning on it. The golden brown color should be much easier to spot on the bread itself, though.

, Remove the conchas from the oven and let them cool for 5 minutes on their baking sheets. Lift them from the baking sheets and transfer them to a wire cooling rack to finish the cooling process.

, At this point, the conchas are ready to eat and enjoy. You can eat them while they are still a little warm, or you could wait until they have cooled to room temperature.


If you decide to save any conchas for later, let them cool completely to room temperature first. Place the cooled rolls into an airtight container and store them at room temperature for a few days.

, After you finish making the paste, cut the pork and Thai eggplants into bite-size chunks. Try to cut the eggplant and pork into similar shapes so that the texture of the curry is even., Open up the can of coconut milk and use a spoon to skim off the cream at the top. Pour the cream into a separate bowl. Coconut milk naturally separates with the cream at the top and the coconut water at the bottom, so separating them should be fairly easy.Make sure not to shake your can of coconut milk before you open it.
If you can’t find Thai eggplants, substitute a regular eggplant.

, Place a wide wok on medium-high heat. Pour in ½ cup of the coconut cream you just separated. Wait for the cream to boil, about two minutes, then add the curry paste to the wok.

Then slice them open and take out the seeds so that the curry isn't too hot., While the chilies are soaking, place the cumin seeds, cilantro seeds and peanuts in a pan on the stovetop over medium heat. Roast the seeds for about five minutes, swirling them around in the pan every so often so that they roast evenly.Keep the seeds and the peanuts all separate, or roast them in separate batches.
If you don’t want to roast the seeds, you can skip the step, though it will alter the flavor slightly.
If you want to simplify the process of making the curry, you can buy Panang curry paste from an Asian specialty store instead of preparing it from scratch.

, After roasting your seeds, use a mortar and pestle to grind them and make a powder. Then remove them and grind the chilies and salt to make a paste. Add the lemongrass and grind, then combine all of the paste and use the mortar and pestle to create a thick paste., Take the pork or beef and cut with the grain of the meat to make bite sized pieces.

, When the meat is cooked, add the lime leaves, fish sauce and palm sugar, and stir to mix the curry together. Then cook for another 3-5 minutes., Add the lime leaves, then remove the pan from the heat. Add the basil leaves, then serve while hot!

You can prepare Pad Thai at home using a wok and a few basic Thai ingredients. You will need:1 cup tamarind juice
½ cup fish sauce
1 cup palm sugar
1 cup water
8 ounces medium rice noodles
4 tablespoons peanut oil or vegetable oil
½ lb. frozen or fresh shrimp or 1/3 lb. boneless pork loin, shoulder or other similar cut
3/4 cup firm tofu, cut into 1 1/2"" x 1"" x 1/4"" pieces
4-5 cloves garlic, finely chopped
3 shallots, thinly sliced
1/4 cup dried shrimp, soaked in warm water
1/4 cup chopped sweet pickled radish or turnip
2-3 teaspoons dried ground Thai chili pepper
2 large eggs, beaten
3 cups bean sprouts
1 cup garlic chives, cut into 1 inch lengths (or scallions)
⅔ cup roasted and crushed peanuts and 1 lime, for garnish;
, For authentic Pad Thai, you will need to first create a Pad Thai sauce using tamarind juice, palm sugar, fish sauce, and water. Combine 1 cup tamarind juice, ½ cup fish sauce, 1 cup palm sugar, and 1 cup water.You will then cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes until the ingredients form a syrup. Set the sauce aside until you need it for the Pad Thai.

, Start by soaking the rice noodles in cool or lukewarm water for 40 minutes. The noodles should appear limp but be firm to the touch.Once the noodles have softened, drain them and set them aside. You can also prepare the rest of the ingredients while the noodles are soaking.

, If you are using shrimp as your protein in the Pad Thai, you will need to peel and devein the shrimp, leaving the tails on. If you are using pork as your protein, slice it into 1 x ½ x ¼ inch pieces.You can also brine the shrimp so they are moist once they are cooked. Do this by boiling one cup of water and adding ¼ cup salt. Then let the water cool and add 3-7 cups of water. Place the shrimp in the brine and let it refrigerate for 30 minutes. Drain and pat the shrimp dry.

, You should also prepare the other ingredients so they are on hand when you are ready to cook. Slice the tofu into bite sized pieces. Then, mince the garlic and cut up the shallots. You should also chop up the dried shrimp, the scallions, and the lime.Place all of these ingredients in small, separate bowls so they are ready to go.
You should also roast the peanuts at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 to 5 minutes. Then, remove them from the oven to cool. You can crush the peanuts in the mortar and pestle.

, You can also use a 12” skillet if you do not have a wok. Once the wok is hot, add 2 teaspoons of cooking oil. Then, add the garlic and stir it quickly in the oil for about 30 seconds.Add the shrimp and cook until they turn pink. If you’re using pork, cook the pork until it is brown. Then, remove the protein from the wok and put it on a plate.

, Put in another 2 tablespoons of oil into the wok and let the wok heat up. Then, add the tofu and stir-fry it until it turns golden brown. This should take about four to five minutes.Once the tofu has been cooked, add the shallots, dried shrimp, sweetened radish, and ground dried chilies.

, You should then add the noodles to the wok. Combine the noodles with the other ingredients, stir-frying them for one to two minutes until the noodles are soft.If you have a large wok, you may be able to fit all the noodles in one batch. If you have a smaller wok, you will need to stir-fry them in two batches. Do this by setting aside half of the tofu-dried shrimp mixture and doing one batch of noodles, followed by the other half of the tofu-dried shrimp mixture and the other batch of noodles.

, Push the noodles and tofu-shrimp mixture to one side of the wok and add a teaspoon of oil. Then, put in the eggs and let them cook until they are just cooked.Use a metal spatula or a knife to divide the eggs into small chunks and toss them with the noodles.

, Finish the dish by pouring 8 tablespoons of the Pad Thai sauce on the noodles and stirring it well to coat. If you find the noodles are too firm, you can sprinkle them with 1-2 tablespoons of water.Once the noodles have been cooked to your preference, put in the bean sprouts and the garlic chives. Then, sprinkle on half of the chopped peanuts as well as the cooked shrimp or pork.

, You can also add on more chopped peanuts and bean sprouts to your liking. Serve the Pad Thai hot on a serving dish., Thai curries are also well known for their complex flavors and textures. Thai curries can be served with jasmine rice or Thai noodles. There are three types of curries in Thai cooking: green curry, red curry, and yellow curry. You can prepare curries with chicken, pork, or fish. You will need the following ingredients:400 grams beef or chicken, substitute for tofu, fish, or shrimp if desired
1 tablespoon cooking oil (corn, safflower or peanut oil, not olive oil)
3 tablespoons curry paste (green, red, or yellow depending on preference)
2 ½ cups coconut milk (about 1 ½ cans)
2 kaffir lime leaves
5-10 small Thai eggplants, quartered
2-3 fresh red spur chilies, sliced diagonally
¼ cup sweet basil leaf
1 ½ tablespoons fish sauce
1 ½ teaspoons palm sugar
Sweet basil leaves and red chili slices for garnish

, Start by slicing the beef or chicken into thin pieces. Try to make the pieces about ⅓” (3 cm) thick.If you are using tofu, slice the tofu into small thin pieces. If you are using shrimp, peel and devein the shrimp.

, Heat the wok over medium heat and put the curry paste in the wok. Let the paste heat up until it is fragrant., Reduce the heat and gradually add 2 ½ cups of coconut milk into the wok. Stir until there is a film of green/yellow/red oil on the surface of the milk., Let the beef or chicken cook for three minutes until it smells fragrant and is cooked through. You can do the same for tofu or shrimp, if you are using them.Raise the heat so the mixture starts to boil. Once it has reached a boil, add the remaining coconut milk and season with palm sugar and fish sauce.

, Let the mixture return to a boil and then add the eggplant. The curry should cook until the eggplants are done. They should appear soft and darker in color.Finish by sprinkling basil leaves and chilies over the curry. Then, turn off the heat.

, Arrange the curry on a serving dish and then garnish it with sweet basil leaves and red chilies. Serve hot., Thai food also has a variety of desserts that are served to finish a meal. You may prepare one of the more popular Thai desserts: Thai Sweet Sticky Rice. This dish uses coconut milk and palm sugar to sweeten the rice. You can serve it with fresh tropical fruit like mango or papaya. You will need the following ingredients:2 cups uncooked long grain rice, soaked in cold water for one hour and drained
1 ¼ cups coconut milk
A pinch of salt
2 tablespoons of sugar
2 large ripe mangoes, peeled and sliced
1 tablespoon split yellow mung beans, toasted (optional)

, Then, combine the rice, coconut milk, salt, sugar, and 1 ¼ cup water in the saucepan. Let the rice mixture come to a boil on the stove.Once it comes to a boil, lower the heat and stir. Simmer, uncovered, for eight to ten minutes until all the liquid has been absorbed.
Remove from the heat and cover. Let it cool, covered, for five minutes.

, If you are using a steamer basket, pour the rice mixture into the steamer. Then, place the steamer over a wok or large pot filled with two to three inches of water. Let the water boil and then cover and steam the rice for 20 minutes. Make sure the rice does not touch the water. You can stir the rice so the steam is evenly distributed in the steamer.You can also cook the rice in a rice cooker. Place two cups of rice and two and a half cups of water in the rice cooker. Let the rice soak for 30 minutes and then toss in 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Turn on the rice cooker and let it cook for 15 to 20 minutes, then let it stand for five minutes.
You can then mold the cooked rice into individual ramekins or small ceramic cups lined with plastic wrap. Let the rice cool to room temperature.

, You can serve the sticky rice right in the ramekins or lift the rice out of the cups onto a plate. Then, top them with mango. Sprinkle with toasted mung beans as a garnish., A wok is a deep wide cooking pot that can be used in Thai cooking to stir-fry, steam, or roast food. Woks come in a variety of sizes, though a medium sized one will often be enough for home cooking. You can find woks online or at Asian grocery stores.Look for a wok made of spun carbon steel as it will conduct heat well and can be seasoned to prevent sticking when you are cooking in it. You should look for a wok with a lid that has a handle, as the lid can get hot and you do not want to burn yourself when you use it.
You should get a spatula or spoon with a long handle made of metal to go with the wok. This will make it easier to toss food around in the wok when you use it.
If you do not have access to a wok or the funds to buy one, you can cook Thai food in a deep, non-stick pan.

, A mortar and pestle is used to grind up Thai spices for sauces, curries, and soups. You will use the mortar and pestle to crush the fibers of Thai roots and herbs as well to release the flavors and juices in the food. You can find mortar and pestles online or at most cooking stores.If you do not want to buy a mortar and pestle, you can use a small food processor or a coffee grinder. Make sure the coffee grinder is only used for Thai spices and herbs as you do not want any other flavors to contaminate the food.

, Many Thai dishes are served over jasmine rice. You should invest in an automatic electric rice cooker so you can cook rice quickly and easily. You can find rice cookers online or at Asian grocery stores.You can always prepare rice on your stovetop at home if you do not want to buy a rice cooker. But you may need to add more time to a recipe so you can cook the rice on the stovetop.

, Many Thai dishes require the use of a traditional steamer. These steamers are often made of bamboo or woven fibers. You can also get steamers made of metal. Look for steamers online or at most cooking stores.The steamers will be round and stackable, making it easier to steam food over a container of boiling water. The steam will then rise through the steamers, cooking the food efficiently and quickly.

, A good chef’s knife is essential to Thai cooking, and any other cooking you do in the kitchen. A chef’s knife should be large enough to chop vegetables, herbs, meat, and fruit. It should have a strong, high quality blade and be comfortable to hold in your hand. Investing in a good chef’s knife will make chopping up Thai ingredients much easier.You may not have the funds to invest in a high quality chef’s knife. You can use a basic knife for chopping and slicing, as long as you make sure it is sharpened before use. Sharpening the knife will make it easier, and safer, to use in the kitchen.

, One of the key elements of Thai cooking is using the right herbs and spices. You can find many traditional Thai herbs and spices at Asian grocery stores, in the Asian grocery aisle of your supermarket, and online. Getting these herbs will ensure the Thai food you prepare is authentic and flavorful. You should stock up on the following herbs:Thai basil: This type of basil is sometimes called “Thai Sweet Basil” and is known as “bai horapha” in Thai. It has smaller, darker leaves than Western sweet basil, with purple stems and flower buds. You will use the leaves in Thai curries and other Thai dishes.
Coriander root and seeds: This root is known as “rahgk pak chee” in Thai and is located at the end of the coriander plant. You will pound the root in the mortar and pestle to add to curry pastes and Thai soups. The coriander seeds, called “mellet pak chee” in Thai, are small and brown. You will use them in Thai curry pastes, sauces, and marinades.
Galangal root: This root, called “hea-uh kah” in Thai, is similar to ginger root, but has a more delicate flavor and texture. You can find it fresh at Thai grocery stores. You can also find it dried in slices, or ground up. You will add this root to Thai soups and curries.
Kaffir lime: The leaves of the Kaffir lime, called “ma-goot” in Thai, are a must have ingredient for Thai soups, curries, and stir-fries. You can also find the leaves dried or frozen, which you can add to Thai dishes.
Cilantro: The cilantro leaves are used as garnishes on Thai dishes and in salads. The leaves and stems can be eaten raw.
Thai chili peppers: These small red chilis are called “asprik kee noo” in Thai and pack a spicy punch. They are added to Thai soups and curries.

, You should also invest in Thai sauces and pastes that you will reach for often when you are cooking Thai dishes. These sauces and pastes can be found at most Asian grocery stores as well as online. You should get the following sauces and pastes:Fish sauce: This is one of the most essential cooking ingredients in Thai cuisine, called “nam pla” in Thai. The use of fish sauce in Thai cooking is comparable to Chinese soy sauce or American table salt. It has a strong smell when uncooked but when added to dishes, it has a subtle flavor.
Tamarind paste: You can buy tamarind paste pre made at Asian grocery stores or online. It is made by soaking tamarind seeds in water and squeezing out the seeds to extract the flavor, or paste.
Curry paste: Though you can make your own Thai curry paste using a mortar and pestle, you can also buy Thai curry paste in stores and online. Using authentic Thai curry paste will make it much quicker and easier to prepare Thai curries.

, Many Thai dishes call for the use of palm oil, coconut milk, and palm sugar. You can find these ingredients at Asian grocery stores or online. Palm oil is used for frying foods in the wok and for flavoring soups. If you do not have access to palm oil, you can use a lighter oil like canola, sunflower or peanut oil.Coconut milk is made by straining and squeezing coconuts for the juice inside. It is often used for Thai curries and soups. You can find coconut milk in cans at the grocery store. Make sure you always stir the can before you use it so the heavy cream on top is mixed into the juice.
Another popular Thai ingredient is palm sugar, which is used to sweeten curries and soups. It is made from the sap of the coconut palm flower.

Use a wooden spoon to break up the meat into pieces that are equal in size so they’ll cook evenly. Cook for approximately 10 to 15 minutes to ensure that all of the meat is brown, with no traces of pink.Make sure that your skillet is large enough to hold 2 pounds of meat. If the ground beef is crowded in the pan, it may not cook evenly.
You can substitute ground turkey for the beef if you prefer.;
, Once the beef is browned, mix in 2 cups (approximately 473 g) of diced onion, 1 cup (approximately 237 g) of diced green bell pepper, and 1 cup (approximately 237 g) of diced red bell pepper. Keep the skillet on medium-high heat, and saute the mixture for 3 to 5 minutes or until the onion and peppers become tender.Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon periodically to ensure that the vegetables cook evenly and don’t stick to the pan.

, When the beef, onion, and pepper mixture has sauted for several minutes, mix a packet (approximately 1 ¼ oz. or approximately 35 g) of taco seasoning into the skillet. Make sure to stir the contents well so the seasoning is fully incorporated into the beef mixture.If you prefer to use homemade taco seasoning, spoon in approximately 2-3 tablespoons (30-35 g), depending on how spicy you want your soup, in place of the packet.

, Once the taco seasoning is completely mixed into the ground beef, onion, and peppers, transfer the mixture to a large stock pot or dutch oven and set at medium heat.Make sure the pot is large enough to not only hold the ground beef and vegetables, but the other ingredients that you’re going to add. It should hold at least 3.5 quarts (approximately 3.3 L).
If you prefer, you can cook your taco soup in a large slow cooker instead of on the stove.

, After you place the ground beef mixture in a pot, stir in 1 16-ounce (approximately 454 g) can of mild chili beans, 1 15-ounce (approximately 425 g) can of pinto beans that have been drained and rinsed, and 1 15-ounce (approximately 425 g) can of whole kernel corn that’s been drained, and 1 4-ounce (approximately 113) can of diced green chilies.

, The soup really starts to come together when you add the tomatoes. Stir in 1 14.5-ounce (approximately 411 g) can of stewed tomatoes and 1 14.5-ounce (approximately 411 g) can of diced tomato with green chilies. Once the tomatoes are incorporated, add 1 packet of ranch salad dressing mix and stir well.If you want your soup to have a thinner consistency, you can substitute 1 15-ounce (approximately 425 g) can of tomato sauce for the stewed tomatoes.

, Once all of your ingredients are combined in the pot, turn up the heat to high. Allow the soup to come to a boil, which should take approximately 10 minutes. Look for bubbling in the pot to know that it’s boiling.If you’ve used a slow cooker to make your soup, allow it to cook on low for 6 to 8 hours.

, After the soup has come to a boil, reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer for approximately 1 hour, so the ingredients have time to break down and the flavors can fully meld.If you’re in a rush, you can eat the soup after it’s simmered for as little as 15 minutes, but the flavor will be better if you wait the full hour.

, When you’re ready to serve the soup, spoon it into bowls and garnish with the usual taco or chili toppings. Shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, chopped green onions, diced jalapenos, and tortilla or corn chips all make delicious toppings for taco soup.The recipe usually yields approximately 8 to 10 servings, depending on how large the bowls that you serve are.

Turn the mixer on to medium-low speed and beat the mixture for a minute or two, so the ingredients are combined.You'll want to use a stand mixer for this dough because it is really sticky to work with.;
, Open 1 envelope (2 1/4 teaspoons of 7 g) of instant yeast and pour it into a small prep bowl. Pour in ¼ cup (60 ml) of warm water and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Stir the mixture, so the yeast and sugar dissolve.You should notice the yeast bubble a little as it activates.

, Pour the yeast mixture into the mixing bowl. Measure out 3½ cups (437 g) of flour and add half of it to the mixing bowl. Turn the mixer on to medium speed and beat the dough for 3 to 5 minutes.The dough will be very thick and paste-like once it's combined.

, Crack 3 egg yolks into the mixing bowl and add the rest of the flour. Turn the mixer on to medium speed and beat the dough for 3 minutes. The dough will be sticky at this point.You can discard or save the egg whites for another recipe.

, Use a rubber spatula to scrap the dough on the sides of the bowl down. Lay a clean kitchen towel over the mixing bowl and set the bowl in a warm place. Let the dough rest for 2 to 3 hours.The dough should double in volume once it's finished proving.

, Sprinkle your work surface with flour. Scoop the dough onto the surface. Use a sharp knife or bench scrape to divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Divide each of those pieces in half, so you have 4 pieces of dough. Divide each of those pieces into 4 small pieces. You should now have 16 pieces of dough.Try to keep the dough pieces the same size, so they bake evenly.

, Take one piece of dough and roll it out to a rough oval shape. It should measure about 8 x 4-inches (20 x 10-cm) in size. Get out ¼ cup (57 g) of softened butter. Use a pastry brush to spread some of the softened butter over the entire surface of the oval. Repeat this with each piece of dough., Since the dough will be sticky, you may want to use a bench scraper or spatula to gently scrape up the long end of the oval that's closest to you. Tightly roll the dough into a long, thin cylinder, so the buttered side is completely rolled up. Repeat this with each piece of dough., There are a few ways you can wrap the cylinder into a coil. Take one end of the cylinder and begin wrapping it into a spiral, so you can loosely tuck the other end underneath it. Or you can cross the ends of the cylinder, so they almost form a pretzel shape. Bring one of the ends under and through the center of the coil., Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet and set each shaped ensaymada on it. If you'd like to bake the ensaymada in individual molds, you could grease 16 molds and place on ensaymada in each., Place the sheet with the ensaymada in a warm place. Let the ensaymada rest until they double in volume. This should take 30 minutes to 1 hour.Avoid overproving the ensaymada or they may shrink a lot when they bake.

, Turn the oven on to 300 degrees F (150 C) when you begin to prove the ensaymada for the second time or when they have about 30 minutes left to prove.If you wait until the ensaymada have doubled in volume before you turn on the oven, they may overprove while the oven is heating.

, Place the sheet of ensaymada into the preheated oven. Bake them for 20 to 25 minutes. They should turn slightly golden brown once they've finished baking. Let the ensaymada cool on a wire rack while you make the topping.If you baked the ensaymada in molds, let them cool for a few minutes before you turn them out of the molds (which will be hot).

, Place ½ cup (113 g) of softened butter in a mixing bowl. Add ½ cup (62 g) of powdered sugar. Use a stand or hand mixer to beat the butter and powdered sugar together for several minutes. The mixture should become light in color and fluffy.Start by beating on low speed. Once the powdered sugar is somewhat incorporated, you can turn the speed up to medium.

, Once the ensaymada have cooled, use an offset spatula or spoon to spread a little of the butter and sugar mixture on the tops. Measure out 1 cup (100 g) of grated Cheddar cheese and sprinkle a few teaspoons of the cheese onto each frosted ensaymada. Serve them immediately.You can store the frosted and topped ensaymada in the refrigerator for a few days. Or store the unfrosted ensaymada in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.

Deep fry the chicharrónes.,
Optionally, rub the pork with pepper before frying.,
Serve.",How to Make Chicharrón1," Put your pork skins in a large pot and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil, cover the pot, and allow to cook. Boil until the skin is softened (but not falling apart) and the water is white - about 1-2 hours.


To keep the skins submerged in the water, you may want to weigh them down by placing a heat-resistant plate on top of them as they boil.;
, Use tongs or a slotted spoon to take your pork skins from the boiling water and lay them on a cooling rack set over a baking pan to catch the drippings. Discard the cooking water.


At this point, if you'd like to give your chicharrónes an extra dash of flavor, sprinkle your vinegar evenly over the pork skins.

, Place the pork skins (still on the cooling rack) in the refrigerator uncovered. Let the skins cool completely - usually this takes several hours.

, Use a spoon or another kitchen scraping tool to remove any fat clinging to the bottom of the pork skin. The fat should separate from the skin easily. Be careful not to tear the skin, as it will be still be soft from cooking.

, Next, the cooled, cleaned pork skins must be allowed to dry. This can be done several ways, which are described below. Regardless of the method you choose, allow plenty of time for drying - you'll know the skins are ready when they're shrunken, brown, and brittle. It's not uncommon for the process to take more than eight hours, so you may want to allow the skins to dry overnight. Several methods for drying the skins are listed below:


The easiest way to dry the skins is in an oven. Set the oven to its absolute lowest setting. Aim for no higher than 200o F (about 93o C). Place the skins on their cooling rack and baking sheet in the oven overnight.
Traditionally, chicharrónes are dried in the hot sun. If you live in a hot, dry area, try setting the chicharrónes outdoors in a secure spot that receives constant sunlight all day, checking on them occasionally.
Other methods for drying can also work well. If you have access to a heat lamp or an electric drying fan, you may want to experiment with these things.

, Split the dried skin into long strips or small squares about 1 inch (2.2 cm) per side. Heat a deep-sided pan over high heat. When it is hot, add lard or cooking oil. Fry the chicharrónes one or two at a time, prodding them until they puff up and start to float. When done, remove the chicharrónes to a paper-towel lined plate.


Be ready to remove the chicharrónes quickly - the frying process can take as little as 10-20 seconds!

, For a spicy chicharrón, season each chicharrón with black or cayenne pepper before frying. You can lightly dust the entire pile of dried skins at once or give each individual piece of skin your desired level of spice before popping them into the pan.


Other great seasonings include various other chile powders, sugar, and Chinese spice blends. Try experimenting with your own seasoning mixes!

, Congratulations - you've made your very own delicious plate of chicharrónes. Sprinkle with salt and serve immediately. Pairs well with beer or red wine.

Cut the pork belly into strips.,
Score the meat of each strip deeply.,
Heat a deep-sided frying pan.,
Cook the pork belly strips with water in the pan.,
Continue to flip and move the strips as the water evaporates.,
Remove the meat from the pan and increase the heat.,
Quickly fry each chicharrón for a crisp exterior.,
Season and serve.",How to Make Chicharrón2," This alternate recipe forgoes the lengthy boiling, cooling, and drying processes of traditional chicharrón preparation in favor of a quicker method that can produce delicious results in as little as an hour or two. To begin, use a sharp knife and/or kitchen shears to cut your pork belly into thin strips about the length of a piece of bacon. If you start with the recommended 1 & 1/2 pounds, you should end up with about 4 strips.


Note that this chicharrón recipe will differ in appearance and taste from the traditional one above, as it includes the fat and meat of the pork belly, rather than just the skin.

, Make lots of crosswise cuts about 1 - 1 & 1/2 inch deep into each strip of pork belly from the ""meat side"" of the strip towards the ""skin side"" of the strip. Making these cuts ensures the meat is able to cook all the way through during the frying process without burning.


Make sure that your cuts are fairly deep but do not reach the skin of the pork belly strips or they may break up during the cooking process.

, Set a pan over a burner on medium heat. While you're waiting for the pan to heat up, rub each pork belly strip with a thin layer of baking soda. This will help the meat develop a crisp, delicious crust as it cooks.

, When the pan is hot, carefully lay the baking soda-dusted pork belly strips in a circle around the center of the pan, leaving a small space in the middle. Pour the 1/2 cup of water into this space and cover the pork belly strips with a pot lid to retain the moisture. Allow to cook, flipping and moving the strips after about 15 minutes.


Be careful when you remove the pot lid to flip the meat, as the water/fat mixture can sputter, sending hot grease your way.
Since this recipe uses pork belly meat and fat in addition to the skin, we won't need to use any cooking oil, as the pork fat will naturally render as it cooks.

, As the water evaporates and is replaced by liquid fat from the pork belly, remove the lid and reduce the heat slightly. Allow the meat to continue to cook, flipping and moving the meat as necessary to ensure it cooks evenly. Cook over low heat in this way for about an hour to allow the fat to fully render.

, When meat is golden-brown and its fat is almost completely rendered, remove the pork belly from the pan. The meat isn't quite done yet - for maximum crispiness, it still needs one final ""searing"". When all the meat is out of the pan, turn the burner up to high and allow the liquified fat in the pan to heat.

, When the fat in the pan is nice and hot, cook the chicharrónes one or two at a time until they gain a delicious, crisp outer crust - this should only take a minute or two. Look for bubbling, ""blistered"" skin as a sign of done-ness. Remove each chicharrón from the pan to a paper towel-lined plate as it finishes cooking.

, Congratulations! You've finished a batch of mouth-watering pork belly chicharrónes. Sprinkle with salt and any other seasoning you like and serve immediately.

Serve with cinnamon-sugar.",How to Make Bunuelos1," Place the flour, baking powder, salt, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of sugar in a large bowl. Stir until combined.While not strictly necessary, consider sifting the flour once or twice before adding the other ingredients. Doing so removes lumps and introduces air into the mixture, which should create lighter buñuelos.;
, Form a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add the egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract to the center of that well. Mix to combine.


When mixing in these liquid ingredients, knock a little flour from the sides of the well into the liquids, then mix without disturbing the rest of the well. Repeat, working with small amounts of the flour mixture at a time. Once the liquids are thick enough to hold their form, you can incorporate them into the rest of the flour.
Continue mixing until all the ingredients are combined and the resulting dough seems like coarse crumbs.

, Add warm water to the dough 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time, mixing after each addition. Continue until you've added 3/4 cup (80 ml) of water total.


Once the dough comes together, start kneading it after each addition, too.
Continue working with the dough for about 5 minutes, or until it seems soft, stretchy, and smooth.

, Cover the bowl of dough with a clean towel and set it aside. Let it rest in room temperature to warm conditions for approximately 30 minutes.


Continue with your preparations as the dough rests.

, Combine the cinnamon with the remaining 1 cup (250 ml) of sugar. Stir until evenly mixed.Set aside the cinnamon-sugar mixture until later. You'll use this as a topping for the buñuelos once they're done.

, Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of oil into a large frying pan with heavy sides. Set it on the stove over medium-high heat.


The oil will need to reach a temperature between 350 and 360 degrees Fahrenheit (177 and 182 degrees Celsius) before you can fry the buñuelos. Monitor the temperature of the oil using candy or frying thermometer.You should also prepare your working area at this time. Sprinkle flour over the counter and over the rolling pin. Line a plate with clean paper towels or brown paper bags.

, After 30 minutes pass, divide the batch of dough into 12 small, evenly sized balls.


If the dough starts sticking to your hands, dust your hands with flour before you continue working with it.

, Flatten each ball of dough using a rolling pin, inverted bowl, or your hands. Each portion should be flattened until it is very thin and roughly 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.


To use a rolling pin: place the dough on your floured work surface and roll over it until you get an evenly round tortilla.
To use an inverted bowl: place a pastry towel over the bowl and spread the ball of dough over it. Use your hands to gently stretch the dough over the sides of the bowl, pulling down on the dough very gently as you work.
To use your hands: dust your hands with flour and pat each ball of dough in between them. Gently pat and stretch the dough into a round tortilla.

, Place the raw dough into the hot oil. Fry each buñuelo for about 3 minutes, turning once halfway through.


When ready, the buñuelos should become puffy, crispy, and golden brown.
Note that you should only fry one portion of dough at a time. Add more oil as needed and check the temperature in between batches.

, Remove the finished buñuelo from the hot oil and transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels. All the excess oil to drain off for several seconds.

, Sprinkle the finished buñuelos with the cinnamon-sugar mixture and enjoy them while they're still warm.


If you pile the finished buñuelos together, they should remain warm until you finish frying the last one. If they seem too cool, however, preheat your oven to its lowest setting and place the batch of buñuelos inside for 5 minutes.

Combine the dough ingredients.,
Add milk, if necessary.,
Roll the dough into small balls.,

Cook the buñuelos until golden brown.,
Drain off the excess oil.,
Serve warm.",How to Make Bunuelos2," Place the grated cheese, cornstarch, tapioca starch, sugar, eggs, salt, butter, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix the ingredients together until a soft, smooth dough forms.Traditionally, Colombian buñuelos are made with a cheese called queso costeño, which is nearly impossible to find outside of Columbia. To obtain a similar flavor, use 1-1/2 cups (150 g) of Mexican queso fresco plus 1/2 cup (50 g) of dry feta cheese. If queso fresco is unavailable, you could use fresh farmer's cheese., If the dough seems dry, add milk 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time, kneading well after each addition.


Stop adding milk once the dough is smooth and holds together. Adding too much milk will make the dough too sticky.

, Pinch off small portions of dough. Roll each portion of dough in between your hands, working it into a smooth ball.


If the dough sticks to your hands as you work with it, lightly dust your hands with flour or additional starch.
Note that each ball should be about 1 to 1-1/2 inches (2.5 to 3.5 cm) in diameter.

, Pour 3 inches (7.6 cm) of vegetable oil into a deep pan with a heavy bottom. Heat the oil on your stove until it reaches 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius).


If one is available, you may use a deep fryer instead of a deep pan.
Use a candy or frying thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil. The maximum temperature should be 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius), but you can probably cook the buñuelos without difficulty once the oil reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius)., Drop several buñuelos into the warm oil. Fry them for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they turn golden brown on all sides.


Fry the buñuelos in small batches to avoid over-crowding the pan. They should be able to float around without knocking into one another.
Expect the balls of dough to sink when you first drop them into the oil. After 30 to 60 seconds, though, bubbles should gather around the sides and the ball should float to the top.
You'll need to stir and turn the buñuelos with a slotted spoon as they start browning. Otherwise, they may not brown evenly.

, Remove the finished buñuelos from the hot oil and transfer them to a plate lined with clean paper towels or brown paper bags.


Let the oil drain off for at least 30 to 60 seconds.
Pile the drained buñuelos onto a separate dish while you finish the entire batch. The residual heat from the latest ones should help keep the earlier ones warm while you finish frying.

, Buñuelos are best served hot or warm. You can still enjoy them once they cool to room temperature, too.

Grease your hands and form the balls.,
Roll the balls in topping.",How to Make Brigadeiro," By gently warming your ingredients, you’ll guarantee they gradually thicken, rather than burn. Place a medium saucepan on the stove when your ingredients are measured and ready to go., Pour your condensed milk into the saucepan, and then add your cocoa powder (or Nesquick powder) and butter.Stir well with a spoon until your butter is melted and everything looks thoroughly mixed.


The original Brazilian recipe calls for simple cocoa powder, but American cocoa powder is a bit less sweet. To crank up the sweetness in this recipe, you can either swap the cocoa powder for Nesquick powder all together, or use a portion of Nesquick powder, i.e., two tablespoons (29.57 mL) of cocoa powder and one tablespoon (14.79 mL) of Nesquick powder.

, Use a large wooden spoon to do this. Don’t stop stirring for the entire time your mixture is on the stovetop. As your mixture heats, it will gradually thicken. In about 10 to 12 minutes, it should be done. When it seems thick enough, turn off your stovetop.To see if your mixture is thick enough, test it by tilting the pan. It should appear to peel away from the bottom.
Another way to test if the mixture is done is by scraping the bottom of the pan with your wooden spoon. If you can reveal the bottom of the pan, it should be thick enough.

, Using your spoon or spatula, spread the mixture thinly and evenly across the pan. Allow to cool for around 10-20 minutes, or until it’s room temperature.Once you think it’s cool enough, test a section by trying to roll it into a ball. It should hold its shape.

, Spray some cooking spray on your hands or coat your fingertips with butter to keep the mixture from sticking to them. Once your fingers are coated, pick up enough of the chocolate to form small balls. Traditional brigadeiro is served in balls about 1.5 inches thick., Chocolate sprinkles are a common topping to use, but you can get creative!Try rolling them in crushed nuts, crystal sugar, coconut flakes, crushed candy, or anything else you might like. Anything that goes well with chocolate would make an excellent topping for your brigadeiro.


Store your brigadeiro in the fridge so they maintain their shape. Keep them chilled before serving."

Serve and enjoy!",How to Make Arroz Con Pollo1," Warm a sturdy pot over medium-high heat on the stove. Add a one or two spoonfuls of oil to the pot and proceed to the next step. Any oil with a reasonably-high smoke point should work well — vegetable/canola, grapeseed, and even milder olive oils should be fine.


If you're aiming for authenticity, try using a traditional Latin cooking pot called a caldero, which is similar to a dutch oven.;
, Carefully spread the chicken pieces in the hot oil and cook until browned and somewhat crispy on both sides. This should take about five minutes per side. Be careful when working with hot oil (tongs are a good idea here.)


You don't have to cook the chicken all the way through right now. We're just trying to get a crispy, flavorful exterior — we'll cook the rest of the meat soon.

, Once you've achieved a good sear on both sides of your chicken pieces, use tongs to remove them from the pot and place them in an easy-to-reach spot on the counter. Don't drain the pot — we want to keep the drippings for flavor.Don't set the chicken pieces on paper towels, as these will absorb the grease from the chicken. Instead, use a bare plate or platter.

, Using a sharp knife and a cutting board, cut up the bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, garlic, and cilantro. Aim for a coarse puree — you want the chunks to be bite-sized, but large enough that you can easily identify them.


If using a food processor, try giving your ingredients a few quick pulses to avoid over-chopping. You can always chop your ingredients more, but you can't put them back together if you chop them too much.

, Combine your vegetables in the same pot you used for the chicken. Cook over medium heat, using the chicken drippings as your grease, until the vegetables are heated all the way through and have begun to soften (approximately 5-10 minutes.)

, At this point, you can add any extra spices or seasonings that you'd like to. Though the Arroz con Pollo should taste great if you follow this recipe exactly, some chefs like to spice their sofrito up with some of their favorite flavors as a personal touch. A few recommendations are listed below — you may use any you wish (or none at all.)


1 teaspoon black pepper (for a savory, smokey flavor)
1 teaspoon garlic powder (for a garlic-y taste)
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (for spicy heat)
2 tablespoons sliced Spanish olives (for salty, olive-y flavor)
1 teaspoon alcaparras (capers) (for salty, pickle-esque flavor)

, To the same pot as you've been using for the rest of your ingredients, mix two cups of water, the uncooked rice, the salt, and the butter (optional). Stir once, then cover with a lid.


At this point, the water level should be about an inch over the rice. If it isn't, you may add additional water. If you accidentally add too much water, you can always carefully drain some and allow the rest to boil off.

, With the lid on, heat over medium until you see significant bubbles. At this point, reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer for 20 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed.

, Check the rice for taste and texture when the water is fully absorbed (you'll know the water is absorbed if you can scoop the ingredients to one side of the pan and not immediately see liquid leak into the cleared space.) If the rice has a somewhat soft, pleasing, ""al dente"" texture, it's done!


Note that, because it incorporates the inner grain husk of the rice plant, brown rice can take an additional 20 minutes or more to cook., Here's the tricky part! At this point, your meal is essentially done — you can eat it and it will (hopefully) taste great. However, if you want your Arroz con Pollo to be the best that it can be, let it sit with the lid on (and the heat from the stove off) for at least five minutes and as long as 30. There are two reasons for this:


First, rice can have an uneven texture if served immediately after it finishes cooking. Waiting allows the moisture redistribute from the wet, fragile rice at the bottom to the dry, fluffy rice at the top.Second, resting allows the muscle fibers in the chicken to re-absorb moisture that would otherwise be lost as soon as the meat is cut., Serve the dish as a mixture of chicken, rice, and sofrito. Use any leftover sofrito from the pan to flavor to taste.

Making it short: make a hole in the ground.,More detailed:,



 Consider a lot of stones if you add a lot of food.,
The Food

5 Kg Meat for each guest
1 Kg Pork Meat
1 Kg Lamb
20 Sausages that you are fond of
2 Chicken (can be all cut into pieces)
2 Cabbages filled with cheese, cream and some peas
3 Kg Potatoes and/or Sweet Potatoes and/or Carrots (peeled)
1 Kg Onions (peeled).,
PROCEDURE

Some cultures used to make a fire inside a big hole.",How to Make Araucan Curanto (Barbeque)," Put some burning rocks inside. Cover them with big leaves. Then put the food. Then more leaves on top, some cloth and bury it all until it is all done.
,,

Elements you’ll need...

A piece of land big enough in order to be able to make a fire and a big hole of 1.5 meter (4.9 ft) depth.
Some rounded stones usually found near a river.
Some pieces of cloth to protect the food from the earth.
A spade to dig a hole of 1 meter (3.3 ft) x 1 meter (3.3 ft) x 1.5 meter (4.9 ft) of depth.
Some big leaves to cover the stones and the food. Please, wash them.
Some material to make a fire during 0.5 - 1 hour.

,
20 Clams or any other fish in its shell
3 Fishes preferably not cut into pieces, only cleaned.
10 Apples

, But the Araucanian make a fire outside the hole.
There, they heat some rounded stones until they are red hot.
Then, inside a big hole of more than 1.5 meter (4.9 ft) of depth lay the red hot stones. They can be carried with the spade.
Over them, make a layer with half of all the collected leaves, to protect the food from the stones.
Then, put the heavy food (cabbages, peeled potatoes and/or sweet potatoes and/or carrots) .
Then the rest of it over the first layer.
The idea is to make several layers that would all heat with the stones.
At last, cover it all with the remaining leaves.
Cover the leaves with some cloth that would protect it all from the earth.
Now, cover all the hole with earth.
The earth has to act as a heavy lid. So compact the earth.
Now, take your time. You may have to wait for more than an hour.
You'll know when it is well done, when you see some small strings of smoke coming from underneath of the earth-lid.
As the stones as cooling down, there is no risk of burning your food.
Finally, undo all the covering very carefully.
Prepare your dishes! Although every food needs a special time to get cooked, the pressure of the earth makes them all cook at the same time.

Try serving with corn tortillas.,
Try adding chili peppers for spice.,
Add saffron for a paella-esque twist.,
Substitute brown rice for a healthy alternative.",How to Make Arroz Con Pollo2," Arroz Con Pollo is traditionally served with tortillas in a variety of Latin American countries. For instance, in parts of Mexico, corn tortillas are traditionally grilled until just charred around the edges, then served hot with the meal.For a truly authentic experience, try serving with plenty of corn tortillas (preferably hot) and eating with your hands!


If you're up for a challenge, try making the tortillas yourself. The recipe uses just a few ingredients and is quite simple to make.

, Like your Latin food hot and spicy? Adding heat to your sofrito is as simple as chopping up a chili pepper (or two, or three) and adding them to the mix when you put the rest of the vegetables in your pan. For most, adding a single pepper to the recipe above should provide sufficient spiciness. It's important to note not to use the seeds of the pepper — these are typically hotter than the flesh.


Below is a list of some of the most common peppers available for cooking, ranked from mildest to hottest.Jalapeño
Serrano
Cayenne
Pequin
Habañero
Red Savina

, Paella, a rice dish that often includes seafood, chicken, and vegetables (and the national dish of Spain), is superficially quite similar to Arroz con Pollo. You can make your Arroz con Pollo resemble paella even more by adding the latter dish's signature ingredient: saffron. This spice is very expensive (in fact, it's the most expensive spice in the world)and is sold in very small quantities. Thus, you may want to save it for when you're making Arroz con Pollo for a special occasion.


To add saffron to your dish, simply drop 1/4 teaspoon crumbled saffron threads into the pot with the sofrito right before you add the rice and water, making sure to stir so that the threads are evenly distributed.

, Nutritionally, brown rice is superior to white rice in just about every way: it has fewer calories per gram, it's more filling, it has more fiber, it has more essential nutrients — the list goes on.If you're looking to make your Arroz con Pollo as nutritious as possible, using brown rice as opposed to starchy, carbohydrate-rich white rice is a great place to start. However, as noted above, you'll want to allow extra time for cooking if you're using brown rice.


In addition, be prepared to add extra water in case you boil off all of your water without the rice reaching its desirable al dente texture.

Finished.

",How to Make Capirotada," Prepare a baking sheet by greasing it with nonstick cooking spray or butter.


For this step, you could line the sheet with parchment paper, instead, if you would prefer an easier clean-up.;
, The slices should be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick. Add butter to both sides and arrange them on your prepared baking sheet.


You will end up using roughly half of the butter, or 1/4 cup (60 ml), for this step.
Bolillo rolls are a type of Mexican bread available through many market bakeries. If you cannot find bolillo, though, French bread makes an excellent substitution. Both types of bread have crusty outsides and soft insides.For best results, use bread that has been left out or bread that is at least 2 days old. This bread is already somewhat stale, but for a recipe like this, a little extra crispiness is actually preferable.

, When ready, both sides should be dry and lightly browned.


Remove the rolls from the baking sheet and let cool. Set aside.
Turn the rolls after 3 minutes using tongs. Work carefully to avoid getting burned.

, Toasting the bread in the oven is the contemporary way to prepare the bread, but a more traditional way to prepare it would be by frying it on the stovetop in a cast iron skillet.Melt 1 to 3 Tbsp (15 to 45 ml) of butter in the skillet over medium heat. Make sure that the butter coats the entire bottom of the skillet.
Butter both sides of the each slice of bread, as with the oven-toasted method.
Add the pieces of bread to the skillet a few at a time. Do not overcrowd the pan.
After 3 minutes or so, use a spatula to flip the bread over to the other side. The side that initially faced the pan should be crispy and lightly browned.
Give the other side an additional 2 to 3 minutes to cook. When done, that side, too, should be crispy and lightly browned.
Note that you may need to add more butter as you go along to keep the bottom of the skillet well-coated.

, Bring the ingredients to a boil on the stove over high heat.


Piloncillos are cone-shaped pieces of raw, Mexican cane sugar. They are usually available in 4 oz (120 ml) and 9 oz (270 ml) sizes. If you cannot find piloncillo sugar, though, you can use brown sugar, instead.
You could also use 1 full cinnamon stick and about 3 whole cloves instead of the ground spices, if desired. Note that these whole pieces of spice will need to be strained out before the syrup can be used, though.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the syrup simmer for about 20 minutes, uncovered.


Simmering the syrup allows the tastes of cinnamon and cloves to permeate it more thoroughly, ultimately making the final syrup more flavorful.

, Remove the syrup from the heat and cover the pan with a lid until ready to use.


If you used whole cinnamon sticks and whole cloves, you should let the entire syrup steep for 1 to 2 hours, giving the flavors more opportunity to disperse throughout the syrup. Pour the syrup through a mesh strainer to remove the whole spices before use.

, Make sure that the bottom and sides are well-coated.


Use an 11 by 7 by 2-inch (28 by 18 by 5-cm) baking dish.
You could use butter or shortening to grease the dish instead of cooking spray, if desired.
Note that the oven should still be preheated to a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).

, Layer roughly 1/3 of the toasted bread at the bottom of the pan, arranging it in as even a layer as possible.Try to cover the entire of the bottom in at least one layer, but do not exceed two layers of bread at the bottom.

, Lay roughly 1/3 of the apple slices over the top of the bread layer.


Some recipes leave this fruit layer out completely. Other recipes use 2 to 3 peeled and sliced bananas instead of or alongside the sliced apples.

, Sprinkle 1/3 of the nuts, raisins, dried apricots, and shredded cheese over the apple layer.


A traditional Mexican cheese, like Cotija or Queso Añejo, would work best, but you can replace these hard-to-find cheeses with more common options like Monterey Jack, Longhorn Cheddar, and Colby cheese.
Additionally, you can use chopped cubes of cheese instead of shredded cheese, if desired. Just know that the cheese will not spread out as evenly when using cubes.
Pine nuts, almonds, pecans, walnuts, and roasted peanuts are all good nut options. You can even use a nut blend, if desired. Just make sure that the nuts are chopped into small pieces regardless of the type.

, Pour 1/3 of the syrup over the bread, apple, and fruit layers. Make sure that the bread at the bottom is well coated in syrup.


Let soak for 15 minutes. By letting the first layers rest, you give the syrup more time to soak into the bread and other ingredients.

, Arrange the remaining layers using the same pattern as before, and use 1/3 of the total amount of each ingredient each time. This means that you will have two more full layers after your initial layer.


Let the bread pudding rest for 15 minutes after completing each full layer.

, Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the oven long enough to heat it through.


Baking the bread pudding also helps the bread to absorb the syrup more effectively. Combining all the ingredients together before baking also allows the flavors to partially blend together.

, Remove the foil. Drizzle your remaining butter, about 1/4 cup (60 ml), over the top of the capirotada before returning it to the oven. Let it bake until the cheese is golden brown.


The drizzle of butter is only optional, but it does add a final coating of moisture and flavor to the dish.

, Scoop out the capirotada into individual serving dishes while still warm.


Many people prefer to enjoy their capirotada cold, though. To chill the dish, cover it loosely with aluminum foil and refrigerate it for a few hours. If you have never had capirotada before, try it both ways to determine which version you prefer.

Include sriracha and hoisin sauce.,
Freeze excess portions.Pho can be fairly time-consuming to make, so it's a good idea to maximize your efficiency and make a lot at a time.,
Customize your recipe in the future.",How to Make Pho," Although your pho will get a lot of its flavour from the ingredients you throw into it while cooking, it's a good idea to rely on beef bones for the majority. A lot of beef flavour sinks into bone marrow, making bones a perfect tool for creating hearty broths. It's recommended you fill up a pot with water and put in the bones as early as you can. A broth needs at least 6 hours simmering to complete, and you'll want to replace the bones with meat ingredients at an earlier stage.


On the other hand, you can buy a storebought beef stock for the purpose of your broth. It won't have the same hearty, homemade quality to it, but you'll be able to make the soup in a fraction of the time.;
, One of the things that turns off some Western diners to pho is the variety of different beef types in the soup. Ingredients like tendon and bone marrow may seem like weird addition, but they soak in the broth flavour very well and can be recommended as a result. Beef is the standard meat used in pho. Standard rare beef chunks are fine, but the less common pieces can typically be purchased at a butcher's shop.Beef chuck is a common purchase for pho, with lots of fat to go in the soup. Brisket is a flavourful and lighter alternative to chuck.
Oxtail and cow shin are great for pho. The bone marrow has lots of gelatin and combines with the broth well. Gelatin is incredibly nutritious and will add to the feeling of warmth you get after eating pho.
Beef flank is a lean type of beef. Because it doesn't taste as good once it's been simmered for a long time, it's recommended you place rare thin strips of it in once the dish is finally being served.
Chicken isn't recommended as part of a pho soup. It doesn't cook as well in the broth. However, versions of pho do exist with chicken and even pork, so if it sounds like something you might prefer, you should give it a try., If you're buying pieces of meat directly from a butcher's store, you may need to cut the beef into chunks for the pho. The chunks should be roughly bite-sized. If you have any doubts, try placing them on a spoon to see whether you need to cut them any further. You can add as much or as little


The pieces should be smaller rather than larger in order to ensure they're properly cooked within the broth.

, Cooking beef before adding it to the broth is actually optional. Although it's necessary if you're using a premade beef stock, the beef will cook when it's simmering in the broth. If you're trying to make pho in a faster time, it's a good idea to fry up your meat. Cook it until the meat is pink. Don't cook the meat beyond rareness. If you do, you'll lose the potential for tenderness that many people find so appealing about pho.


Cook the beef in a pan on high heat. Add some canola oil to the pan and let it heat for 30 seconds before you add the beef onto the pan. Let the beef cook on both sides by turning it over. Try to get both sides of each piece cooked evenly. Though you can cook it however you'd like, it's recommended to leave the beef rare. The rest of it can be cooked in the pho broth itself.
In order for the beef to cook naturally in the soup, you should set at least 6 hours aside. If there's any doubt, it's probably a better idea to cook your meat to rareness.

, Beef bones are where you'll get the distinctive broth taste. It's recommended that you let the broth simmer for 3 hours with the beef bones in the soup. From there, the bones should have left their flavour in the broth, and you can replace the bones with the edible beef ingredients.


Add salt to your pot to get a more striking taste.

, Your beef parts should be added three hours after you first put the bones in the broth. From there, the soup should be left to simmer for an additional 3 hours. It's recommended you take out the bones before adding the rest as it can be difficult to extract the bones once the pot is filled.

, Charred onions have the best effect. Take a pair of tongs and use them to hold onions over a gas-powered stove. From there, chop them up into thin slices and add them to the pho. You will definitely notice the improvement to your broth.


Depending on how much you want the charred onions to inform the broth's taste, you can either add them early on with the beef ingredients, or you can serve it after adding the noodles as a garnish. For the sake of smokiness, it's recommended you add them with the beef., In a separate saucepan, bring water to a boil. From there, take a handful of rice noodles and throw them in. Depending on the thickness of the noodles you're using, it can take up to five minutes for the noodles to properly cook.Once the noodles are sufficiently soft, strain them out of the second saucepan and add them to your main pho pot.


To preserve their form, it's recommended you try blanching the noodles, taking them quickly from boiling to cold water as a way to quickly halt the cooking process. Let the dry noodles into a boil for 10-20 seconds until they have lost their stiffness, then immediately put them under cold water. This will ensure they are cooked properly, but will stop the cooking before they get soggy., If you're making your own pho, you can practically add whatever vegetables you like into the broth. Because vegetables tamper with the broth's flavour, they should be steamed and added to the broth after it's finished cooking.Carrots and broccoli are most recommended, as they're spoon-sized and compliment the taste of the broth.Carrots are best cut into coin-thin slices so that they best soak up the flavour of the soup.


Get the vegetables to a soft tenderness before adding. They will get softer still once added to the hot broth. The texture shouldn't be resistant to the teeth at all, but the vegetables should retain enough strength to keep their form.

, Aromatic spices help improve the taste of the pho, but they're also great for adding that visual touch once the basics have been taken care of. Sprinkle cilantro and green onion atop your soup once the broth and main ingredients are ready for eating.


Prepackaged pho spice blends are available, but they aren't recommended if you want the best-tasting pho., Bean sprouts are a light and tasty thing to eat alongside your main course. Although you should serve them on a separate plate, the sprouts can be added to the broth once your meat and noodles begin to run out. Lime wedges are a nice touch as well, whether for adding tang to the broth or for fitting in a beverage.


Storebought bean sprouts go bad within a couple of days, so it's a good idea to eat them shortly after they're purchased.

, Most pho restaurants include a few spicy sauces to sweeten the deal. Whether you want to add these to the broth as you're making it or keep them at hand when you eat it is your decision. Generally speaking, these sauces are great to have when it comes time to eat. Rather than adding them from the start, you should keep them handy to calibrate the taste to your liking.


Don't rely on spicy sauces to mask a weak broth. A top-notch pho won't need any sriracha to be delicious., Once your original meal is finished with, store the rest of the pho in tupperware containers and keep it sealed in the freezer until it's time to eat again. Pho can be reheated in the microwave or stovetop.


Pho can be frozen healthily for 3 months or kept in the fridge for 5 days., The great thing about pho is that you can customize it to your liking once you have the basic broth and noodles ready.Pho isn't a hard meal to make once you have the ingredients and process down, so it makes sense to play around with the recipe. Do you like extra beef or spice? Make it happen. A big part of the enjoyment in home cooking is the freedom to choose and experiment.


If you've been to many pho restaurants before, you'll know a big thing about pho recipes are the portions and kinds of meat they use in the broth. Simply changing up the portions of one meat in exchange for another can change the experience of the meal.

Leeks
Carrots
Corn
Turnips
Onions
Apples or pears (not vegetables, but will add some nice sweetness and dimension);
, Add the chopped vegetables (and fruits if you used them) to the pot and cover them completely with water. Then, add about 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of sugar.








You can add up to 1/2 tablespoon more sugar if you want the soup to be a little on the sweeter side.Turn the burner on high heat and allow the water to come to a boil. Then, reduce the heat to medium heat and let the vegetables simmer in the water.

, While the vegetables boil, char a halved and peeled onion, some ginger slices, and some other spices of your choice. To char the onion and spices, place them on an open flame, such as on a grill, or place them in a nonstick skillet over high heat for a few minutes. Turn them over after a few minutes to char both sides.


Scrape away the burnt bits of the onion and then place it into the pot of boiling veggies.Some other good spices to use in the broth include six whole pieces of star anise, five whole cloves, one tablespoon of black peppercorns, or a cinnamon stick.Use them all for maximum flavor.
The onion can go straight into the broth, but it is a good idea to contain the other spices in a spice sack. To do this, take the ginger slices and other spices and place them into a tea bag. Then put the spice sack into the pot.
You can also place the ginger and spices straight into the pot if you plan to strain the broth before serving it. Otherwise, you might accidentally serve whole spices to someone.

, Let all of the ingredients simmer in the pot for a few hours. The longer the ingredients simmer, the more flavorful the broth will become. When the soup has finished cooking, use a slotted spoon to remove the large chunks of vegetables and the spice packet.








You can also pour the broth through a sieve and into a separate large pot to separate the vegetables and spices from the broth.

, It is important to taste the pho broth before you serve it to determine if you need to add any more salt or sugar. If it does not taste salty enough, then add some more salt. If does not taste sweet enough, then add more sugar.Add only a small amount at a time (1/2 tablespoon of sugar or ¼ teaspoon of salt) and taste the broth as you adjust it to avoid over seasoning the broth.

, Tofu is a popular protein choice for vegetarian pho. However, you can use a different vegetarian protein, such as vegetarian “beef” slices, or just use some mushrooms instead. Slice up your tofu, faux beef, or mushrooms and place the slices in a non-stick oiled skillet.If you prefer, you can also use additional vegetables for your toppings, such as bok choy, napa cabbage, or broccoli.If desired, you can add some chopped garlic and ½ teaspoon of Chinese five spice powder while the ingredients are cooking.
Sauté the tofu, faux beef, or mushrooms until they are golden brown.
Then, remove the skillet from the heat and set it aside.

, Cook the rice noodles according to the package’s instructions. You will need to boil them in a pot of water, but the amount of time that the noodles will need to cook will depend on the thickness of the noodles.








For example, if you are using thick rice noodles, then they will take a little longer to cook than thin noodles.
After you finish cooking the noodles, strain them through a sieve and pour cold water over them or hold them under cold running water for a few minutes. This will stop the cooking process and help to prevent the noodles from sticking together too much.

, The last thing you will need to do is prepare a garnish plate so that you can customize your pho experience. You can add any variety of add-ins and condiments that you like. Place your garnishes on a plate just before you are ready to serve the pho. Some popular choices include:Bean sprouts
Thai basil leaves
Cilantro
Chopped scallions
Sliced jalapeno peppers
Lime wedges
Crushed peanuts
Sriracha sauce
Hoisin sauce

, To assemble a bowl of pho, place about a cup of rice noodles into a large soup bowl.Pho is normally served in a big bowl, so use something larger than you normally would. A bowl that will hold about four cups is ideal.You can use a smaller bowl if you don’t have any large bowls, but you may want to put only ½ cup of noodles in instead. Otherwise, your other ingredients might not fit.

, Get some of your sautéed tofu, faux beef, or mushrooms and add them to the bowl. Place them on top of your noodles.








Don’t worry if they are not hot anymore. The broth will heat them up again!

, Next, ladle the pho broth over the noodles and toppings.Add lots of broth! The broth should cover the noodles and toppings completely.







, Finish up your bowl of vegetarian pho by adding the garnishes of your choice.You can add as much or as little of the garnishes as you like depending on your preferences. Add some sriracha or hoisin sauce to adjust the spiciness or sweetness of the broth.








You can also prepare a couple of bowls of sriracha and hoisin sauce for dipping. You can dip your tofu or faux beef slices into the sauces as you eat the soup.
Use chopsticks or a fork to eat the noodles and other larger items in the soup and use a large spoon to drink the broth.

",How to Make Bun Bo Hue," Most of the flavor comes from the beef and pork bones; they are the perfect tool for making hearty broths. The ideal broth takes around 3 hours to complete.


Wash the pork and beef bones with water. Place them into a stock pot until bones are fully covered. Boil the meat for about 10 minutes. Remove the fat from the pot as it rises to the top.
Empty the pot, rinse the meat, and then place into a different pot. Smash and bruise the 8 stalks of lemongrass for the the stock. 6-8 stalks should be good; too much will make the stock bitter. You can use a meat tenderizer or simply anything hard enough to smash the stalk.;
, This includes the cleaned meat, beef ox tail, a couple cloves of garlic, the bruised lemongrass stalks, a knob of ginger, 1 quarter of a pineapple, 1 tbsp of salt, fish sauce, and the fermented shrimp paste. Turn the stove on high.


Wait until the broth boils and skim and then dump the fat the rises to the top. Turn the stove down from medium-low and let it simmer for about 3 hours. Make sure the pot is covered so the broth can absorb all the flavor. Remove the meat from the pot. Shred it from the bone and add it back in.

, Slice beef shank into quarter-inch pieces. Wash the pig feet and pig toes (the pig feet come pre-sliced). Slice your pork loaf into 1 inch pieces and set aside.Add the beef shank and pig feet into the stock pot. Wait about 30 minutes until that meat is tender and remove the excess fat, as before. Turn the stock pot back on low-medium heat., In different pan on medium heat, add 2 tbsp of cooking oil and 1 tbsp of annatto seeds. When the color of the seeds have seeped into the oil to make it dark red, remove the seeds. Chop and mince 2 stalks of lemongrass. Add that to the pan. Saute it for about a minute; this releases the fragrance.

Add 2 Tbsp of fermented shrimp paste and 1 Tbsp of chili paste to the pan.
Saute this mixture until the texture becomes smooth (about 7-10 min). Transfer this mixture into the stock pot. This will give the broth a vibrant red color at the top.
You can add more chili paste to make the broth more spicier, if desired.

, Then drain the water, rinse and set the noodles aside when cooked; that way the noodles won't stick., This includes bean sprouts, mint, cilantro, red cabbage, lime wedges, coriander, and sliced raw onions.

, If so, add the sliced pork blood into the broth. You can tell if the pig feet are done by poking them with a chopstick.

You can buy the pork blood pre-cooked (if you don't find this satisfying you can still add it in to enhance the flavor).

, While you wait, you can add noodles to your boil along with the pork loaf. Add the broth and whatever meats you like into your bowl.Add whatever garnish you like afterwards. It's traditionally added after your pour the broth in your bowl.,"

Familiarize yourself with pho eating utensils.,
Sample and season your broth.,
Put in herbs and sprouts, if you desire.,
Mix your dipping sauce.,
Eat your pho.",How to Eat Pho1," In traditional situations, you'll be provided a spoon and a pair of chopsticks to eat pho. Generally, the spoon is held with the left hand and the chopsticks with the right, though this may be reversed if you are left handed. Additionally, you should have a small sauce dish and a holder for your chopsticks.


Opposite of proper Western manners, it is alright to leave you hands on the table when eating a Vietnamese meal, like pho. This way, you can raise the bowl to your mouth to get every last bit.Wooden chopsticks can sometimes splinter when pulling them apart. In casual situations, take each chopstick and rub them together to remove splinters or burrs. However, in formal situations, this practice can be interpreted as rude.
Refrain from sticking either or both chopsticks vertically into your food, or leaving your chopsticks in your food when not eating. Doing so is considered rude.;
, When your pho hits the table, the first thing you'll want to do is sample the broth. If you find the broth needs a little more flavor, you can add some fish sauce, a common pho condiment, to it.









Two other common flavorings added to pho broth include black pepper and lime juice. Very frequently, an entire lime wedge will be squeezed into the broth., The amount of beansprouts you add to your pho will depend on your preference, but in most cases roughly a handful will be enough. If your pho is served with Thai basil, de-stem the leaves and add 10 - 12 to the broth.









After adding beansprouts, use your spoon to submerge them along with any pieces of rare beef.
Some restaurants or households may serve pho with saw herb. If you'd like to add this to your pho, tear and add 2 - 3 of these into pieces about an inch in length.
If you enjoy your food spicy, 3 or 4 slices of a serrano chili will give your pho a potent smolder. Those who are sensitive to spicy food should use fewer slices or none at all., Take your small sauce dish and add hoisin sauce and sriracha chili to it to make a dipping sauce. Normally, equal parts hoisin sauce and sriracha chili are used, though if you are sensitive to spicy things, less sriracha may be best.









You can sample your dipping sauce by inserting the tip of your chopsticks into it and tasting the sauce on your chopsticks. If you find it too spicy or not spicy enough, you may want to add more hoisin sauce or sriracha., Take your chopsticks and spoon to mix all the ingredients of your pho evenly. When eating noodles, vegetables, and/or meat, collect combinations of ingredients together with your chopsticks and dip them into the sauce. In between bites, scoop up broth with your spoon and sip it until your pho is done.


It may be difficult to eat the last bits of your pho with your spoon and chopsticks. In this situation, lay your spoon on its holder, bring the bowl to your mouth with your free hand, and guide the remnants into your mouth with your chopsticks."

Eat your pho.",How to Eat Pho2," In a Western place setting, the soup spoon will be the largest. At some restaurants, a special soup spoon may be brought to you when your soup is served. Your fork will be used to wind up the pho noodles and spear other ingredients, like meat or vegetables.In British and American dining culture, the farthest right spoon is typically your soup spoon. In some cases, you may find a seafood/oyster fork to the right of your soup spoon., In Western culture, it's considered impolite to blow on soup-like dishes to cool them off. Participate in dinner conversation while waiting for it to cool. Blowing on your pho can make you seem impatient or result in soup splattering on yourself, the table, or others.You can politely check the temperature of your pho by using your spoon to stir the broth and holding it to your lips. If the spoon is uncomfortably hot, your pho probably needs more time to cool.

, When eating pho with proper Western manners, you'll want to position your spoon toward the back of the bowl so the front of the spoon faces away from you. This will make you less likely to drip any pho on yourself while eating.


Though it may feel unnatural at first, you should drink the broth by sipping it from the side of the spoon instead of putting the whole spoon in your mouth., Now that you pho has cooled, take your spoon and taste the broth. Add a scoop of beansprouts and use your spoon to push these and under cooked meat to the bottom of the bowl. Add herbs and spices to your pho with serving utensils.


Generally, when eating with Western manners, it is considered impolite to handle herbs, spices, and other seasonings with your bare hands., The same as you would normally when eating pho, take a small dish or saucer and combine equal parts hoisin sauce and sriracha chili. If you dislike spicy food, you might want to go light on the sriracha chili or leave it out completely.


You can sample your sauce to check its spiciness by dipping the tip of a utensil, like your spoon, into the sauce and tasting it., Take a fork in your right hand and swirl it through the pho noodles to catch some in the tines of your fork. Hold your spoon in your left hand, and submerge it in the broth. Then:


Place the tip of your fork into the bowl of your spoon and twist the fork to collect the noodles together.
Scoop or skewer meat and/or vegetables on the end of your fork, then dip the noodles and veggies into the sauce.
Hold your fork over the sauce dish until it stops dripping sauce, or position your spoon closely beneath your fork to catch dripped sauce, then eat the pho.
When you start getting low on pho, tilt your bowl backwards slightly to collect the remnants there. Then use your spoon to finish the meal."

Wait for the host to eat before partaking.,
Personalize your food without hesitation.,
Avoid rude gestures.,
Acclimate to less eye contact.,
Honor Vietnamese age and gender customs.",How to Eat Pho3," Especially when dining with traditional Vietnamese friends or family, you should wait for either the head of the household or the eldest member to eat first. When in doubt, wait to eat until you see one of your adult Vietnamese dining companions also doing so.


Depending on your situation, your Vietnamese dinner may or may not begin with a small offering on a family Buddhist altar., Unlike some other kinds of cuisine, Vietnamese food, including pho, is expected to be personalized to your tastes. Even special sauces that have been prepared beforehand can be poured into small sauce dishes and altered with seasonings until it suits your preferences., While eating your pho, you'll naturally gesture as you dine and converse with dinner companions. Avoid pointing at anyone with your index or middle finger, touching someone on the shoulder, or patting others on the back, as all of these are considered rude.


The placement and usage of your feet is also important in Vietnamese culture. Refrain from pointing with your feet or putting your feet on tables.
Excessive use of gestures may come across to traditional Vietnamese as rude, especially for women., In Vietnamese culture, when someone feels socially unsure or like they are of lower status, it's common for them to bow frequently and avoid eye contact. This might seem disrespectful to you, but it is actually a sign of respect.


Vocalizing disagreement or criticism, especially loudly or publicly, can be viewed as disrespectful. Your comments or suggestions might go over best if saved for a more private time., Though this might be different from you home culture, Vietnamese tend to show deference by seating and serving elders most prominently, then male adults, then other members of the family, like young men, women, and children."

, Carefully remove the ginger’s peel with a paring knife. Hold your grater over a small container to catch the shavings. Rub the peeled ginger over the grater. Scrape the peelings into the bowl with the garlic.

You can use a vegetable peeler instead of a paring knife to remove the ginger peel.

If you do not have a large glass or plastic dish, you could also combine the marinade and chicken in a large resealable plastic bag. Try to use a freezer bag or a marinade bag, since either option will be durable enough to hold the heavy chicken without developing leaks.
While chicken thighs and drumsticks are preferable for this recipe, you could also use a whole chicken cut into pieces. Keep the skin on and the bones in. Just be aware that white meat can cook faster than dark meat.;
, Cook the bacon on medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes, until it becomes brown and crispy.


Remove the bacon pieces and transfer them to a plate. Set aside and keep warm.
You need to let the bacon render its fat. This will give the dish more flavor. If you do not have bacon or would prefer not to use it, you could double the amount of oil you use, instead, and leave the bacon out entirely.
If you do not have a Dutch oven, you could also use a large, heavy stockpot with deep sides.

, Remove the chicken pieces from the soy sauce marinade. Add them to the hot oil and fry for 4 to 8 minutes, or until well-browned on all sides.


Let the excess marinade drain from the chicken before you add it to the hot oil.
Dispose of the marinade after removing the chicken. Do not attempt to reuse it, since marinades holding raw meat can become tainted with hazardous bacteria.
Turn the chicken pieces periodically using tongs to ensure that all sides are evenly browned.
Once browned, transfer the chicken to another plate. Set it aside and keep warm.

, Add the chopped garlic and onions to the oil in the Dutch oven. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the onion becomes soft and both ingredients become more fragrant.


Stir the onion and garlic frequently to prevent them from burning. Burnt ingredients, especially garlic, can destroy the flavor of the dish.
Both the onions and garlic should look cooked. The garlic will look golden and the onions will become translucent.

, Cook the contents of the Dutch oven for another 4 to 5 minutes.


The tomatoes will need to soften quite a bit. In this particular recipe, most of the tomato flavor comes from the actual tomatoes. The tomatoes should soften and start breaking down slightly.
Stir the contents of the Dutch oven periodically to prevent anything from burning. Scrape the bottom of the pan as you stir to remove the brown bits on the bottom. These will add more flavor to the finished stew.

, Return the chicken to the Dutch oven and add the fish sauce, water, and bay leaves. Mix well to combine the flavors.


If you do not have fish sauce or would prefer not to use it, you could replace it with 1/2 to 1 tsp (2.5 to 5 ml) of salt.
Bring the contents of the dish to a boil over medium-high to high heat, stirring frequently.

, After the dish boils, turn the heat to medium-low and let the liquid simmer until the chicken becomes tender. This could take anywhere from 25 to 45 minutes.


Leave the lid off the Dutch oven as the Afritada cooks, and stir the dish periodically.

, After the chicken is cooked through and tender, add the chopped potatoes and chopped carrots. Cook them in the stew for another 10 minutes.


The pieces should be about 1 inch (2.5 thick). If you opt to make them smaller or larger, at least try to keep the vegetable pieces in fairly consistent sizes.
Note that larger pieces will likely take longer to cook.

, Toss the bell pepper into the Dutch oven along with the other ingredients and simmer for another 5 minutes.


The peppers should be about the same size as the potatoes and carrots when you add them.

, Once all of the vegetables are tender, add the peas and bacon pieces. Continue simmering until the peas are tender and the entire dish has been heated through.


If using frozen peas, make sure that they have been thawed before adding them to the Afritada.
Taste test the liquid if desired. You can add more seasonings of the taste seems off. For instance, if the taste seems bitter, mix in 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of brown sugar. If you want it to be a bit spicier, try mixing in 1 tsp (5 ml) of hot sauce.

, Chicken Afritada should be spooned into serving dishes and enjoyed while still steaming hot.

Finished.

",How to Make Turon (Bananacue Wrap)," Turon filling is composed of chopped langka and saba. Simply chop up the fresh langka to get it ready to go. The fruit can be eaten raw when it's fully ripe. To prepare the saba, cut each one into three long pieces and roll each piece lightly in brown sugar. Lay out the bowl of langka and the plated of sliced, sugared saba so you can start filling your rolls.


If you can't find langka, it's ok to leave it out of this recipe. Many recipes for turon don't call for langka, though it's a common traditional ingredient.
If you can't find saba, use the smallest bananas you can find. Bananas are larger than saba so you won't need as many. Saba tastes like a cross between a plantain and a banana.;
, The sheets of paper-thin lumpia are difficult to pull apart; be very gentle so they don't tear. Pull them apart and lay them out to get them ready for assembly.


It might help to wet your fingers with warm water so they don't stick to the wrappers. You can also steam the wrappers first to help them come apart more easily.If you can't find lumpia wrappers, spring roll wrappers also work well. Lumpia is a bit thinner than spring roll wrappers but the taste is quite similar.

, Lay 2 - 3 slices of saba on a wrapper. Spoon a few teaspoons of langka over the slices.

, Start by folding the top and bottom of the wrapper toward the middle. Gently turn the wrapper 180 degrees so that an unfolded side is facing you. Roll the wrapper away from you, as you would an egg roll or a jelly roll. Brush a big of egg white on the edge of the wrapper to seal it in place. Finish filling and rolling the rest of the wrappers.


After the turon is wrapped, one traditional preparation method is to roll the turon in brown sugar. The sugar will caramelize as the turon fry. Alternatively, you may make a brown sugar syrup to serve with the turon after they're fried., Place the oil in a deep cast iron skillet or dutch oven suitable for frying. Let the oil heat until water sizzles when sprinkled over it.

, Carefully place them in the oil one at a time. They should begin to sizzle and fry right away - if they don't, the oil isn't hot enough. Don't overcrowd the pan, or they won't cook evenly. Fry them in batches if you have too many to fit all at once.

, Halfway through the frying process, turn the rolls with a pair of tongs.

, They should be crispy and golden on the outside and creamy on the inside. Place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain.


If you didn't opt to give the rolls a caramelized sugar coating, top them with brown sugar syrup, which can be made as instructed below.

, To make the syrup, all you need is brown sugar and water. Place 1 cup of sugar and 3/4 cup water in a saucepan and stir the mixture.


For a richer, creamier topping, replace all or half of the water with coconut milk.







, Put the saucepan on medium low heat and allow it to come to a simmer. Let it cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. When it's ready, it should be thick, bubbly and caramel-colored.

, You can also serve it alongside turon as a tip.

You can go even thinner and cut it into 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm)-thick pieces if you want it to be extra thin. Make sure to remove all of the bone. If you want to make it easier for yourself to slice the pieces, you can throw them in the freezer first until they start to firm up a bit, and then cut them.






;
, You should mix the table salt, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, onion powder, and food coloring together until you've thoroughly combined the ingredients. Instead of the food coloring, you can use a teaspoon of red beet powder if you'd like. Place the ingredients in a bowl so you can easily rub the pork in the mixture.









For a more tart flavor, you can add 1/2 cup of pineapple juice to the mixture.

, Press the pork into the curing mixture until you've covered it thoroughly and evenly. Toss the pork to fully immerse it in the curing mixture.








, Place the pork in a zip-seal bag or a closed plastic container and place it in the fridge for three days. This will ensure that the pork is fully cured before you cook it. When you take the pork out of the fridge, don't be disappointed if it doesn't have the bright, vibrant color you expected; it may look a bit gray and drab, but the colors will come out as you cook it.








, Here's what you should do to pan fry the cured pork:









Place the cured pork meat into a frying pan with a little bit of oil.
Heat up the oil over medium-to-high heat and then heat each of the pieces for two to three minutes per side. Think of it as cooking bacon: just fry each piece until it is a nice crispy golden brown.
When you're done frying each piece, just put it on a plate and move on to the next piece or pieces.
You can even place the pieces on a paper towel if you want to soak up some of the grease first.
If you want a more Caribbean flavor, you should cut up the pork into little squares and then fry it until its crunchy, serving it with white rice in a traditional dish called arroz blanco con tocino or ""white rice with tocino.""

, You can also opt to use a grill instead. Here's what you can do to grill your tocino to perfection:









Simply heat up the grill and place each piece of pork on it for two to three minutes on each side, just as you would in a frying pan.
When each piece is crunchy and charred, remove it from the grill and you're all done.
Wait for the pork to rest for about five minutes before you serve it.

, There are a variety of ways to serve this delicious dish. Though you can enjoy it on its own, you can also serve it as part of a traditional dish called Tosilog in the Philippines, which consists of tocino, garlic rice, and fried egg.

Serve.",How to Cook Sinigang Na Baboy," Tamarind is the most traditional souring agent used for sinigang na baboy. You can prepare the soup with fresh tamarind or use a powdered tamarind-flavored sinigang mix.When using fresh tamarind, you'll need 10 to 15 standard pieces of fruit. When using powdered flavoring, you'll need 1-1/2 packages, each weighing 1.41 oz (40 g). You can also use 3-1/2 oz (100 g) of commercially prepared tamarind pulp, if you can find it.
Even though tamarind is the most common and conventional souring agent, you could also use guava, bilimbi fruit, pineapple, green mango, calamansi, or wild mangosteen. Other flavors of powdered sinigang mix could work in equal portions, as well.;
, Rinse the pork and pat it dry with clean paper towels, then cut it into 2-inch (5-cm) cubes.


You can use different cuts of pork for this soup, but the most common are pork belly and pork spare ribs. Cuts of pork that include the bone (like spare ribs) will add more flavor to the broth. You can also mix and match different cuts to vary the flavor.
When using pork spare ribs, cut the ribs into individual portions, leaving them roughly 2 inches (5 cm) long when possible. Leave the bones in.
If using pork belly, simply cut the pork into 1-inch to 2-inch (2.5-cm to-5 cm) chunks.

, Rinse the vegetables and pat them dry with clean paper towels. Chop each one into serving portions.


Cut the onion and tomato into wedges or quarters. Peel the taro, and cut it into wedges or quarters, as well.
Cut the string beans into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces, or trim the ends and tie the beans into knots.
Chop the peppers and separate the water spinach into individual leaves.
Slice the eggplant into 1-inch (2.5-cm) slices on the diagonal. Peel and slice the radish into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) rounds.

, Pour 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of vegetable oil into a large saucepan with deep sides. Set it over medium-high heat.

, Add the pork pieces to the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes or until the majority of the pork browns on all sides.


If the saucepan has a narrow bottom, you may need to brown the pork in two separate batches. Ideally, most of the pieces should be able to touch the bottom of the pan as you brown them.
After the pork browns, transfer it from the pan to a separate dish. Set it aside and keep warm.

, Pour the remaining 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of vegetable oil into the same saucepan and reduce the heat to medium.

, Place the onion in the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes or until the layers begin to separate.


As you cook the onion, scrape the bottom of the pan to remove any pork bits. Allow these bits to mix into the onion as it cooks.

, Return the pork to the saucepan. Add the fish sauce ad 2 qt (2 L) of water, as well, stirring to combine.


Allow the water to reach a rolling boil before you continue. Once the water boils, use a spoon to carefully skin off any scum or suds that develop on the surface of the liquid.

, Add the tomato and hot peppers (chili or banana peppers) to the saucepan. Stir to combine.


Allow the mixture to cook for another 4 minutes, or until the tomato and peppers begin to soften.

, Reduce the heat to low or medium-low and allow the soup to simmer for at least 40 minutes, or until the pork is fully cooked and somewhat tender.Periodically check the level of liquid while the soup simmers. Add more water, as needed, to keep at least 1.5 qts (1.5 L).
While the soup simmers, begin to prepare the tamarind.

, Place the fresh tamarind in a medium saucepan and combine it with 2 cups (500 ml) of water. Bring the liquid to a boil and cook the tamarind until it softens.


You should continue cooking the tamarind until the outer skins begin to burst. This should take 10 to 15 minutes. Note that the inner fruit should also become very soft.
If using prepared tamarind pulp, place the pulp in a heatproof bowl set above 3 inches (7.6 cm) of simmering water. Allow it to sit for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pulp is soft enough to mash.When using tamarind powder, you do not need to complete any special preparation. The powder can be added directly to the soup at the appropriate time.

, Drain the cooking water, then mash the softened tamarind fruits with the back of a fork, creating a thick pulp.

, Transfer the tamarind pulp into a fine mesh strainer. Press the pulp with the back of your fork until juice comes out, and collect the juice in a bowl placed beneath the strainer.Press the seeds, too, since they should also produce some juice.
When finished, discard the solids (seeds, skins, and pulp). Save the tamarind juice for the sinigang.

, Once the pork starts to become tender, add the taro wedges to the soup. Continue cooking the soup at a low simmer for 15 minutes, or until the taro softens.If using pork spare ribs, wait until the pork starts to separate from the bone before adding the taro. If using boneless pork belly, test the pork by piercing it with a fork; if you can cut into it with a fork but it still retains solid form, add the taro.
If more scum or suds develop at the top of the soup after adding the taro, skim the surface with a spoon before continuing.

, Pour the tamarind juice into the soup broth and stir to combine.


Cook the soup for another 5 minutes at a mild simmer. Doing so allows the flavor of the juice to meld with the broth and other ingredients.
If you use a powdered tamarind mix instead of using fresh tamarind juice, add the powder directly to the broth and stir to mix it in. Allow the broth to simmer for 5 minutes, as you would do with tamarind juice.

, Place the slices radish and sliced eggplant in the soup. Stir to combine, then cook for 5 minutes.


When finished, the eggplant should be nearly tender and the radish should slightly soften.

, Add the string beans to the soup and stir to combine. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes.


At this point, the pork and all of the vegetables should be soft enough to easily pierce with your fork. Continue to simmer the soup until the meat and vegetables are ready.

, Place the leaves of water spinach in the soup and stir to combine. Turn off the heat and cover the pot, then allow the soup to sit for 3 to 5 minutes.


Since water spinach can be somewhat delicate, allowing it to cook using residual heat instead of direct heat can prevent it from falling apart. When it's ready, the water spinach leaves should be wilted yet whole.

, Taste the soup broth. Add salt and pepper as needed to balance out the flavors. You can also add extra fish sauce, if desired.


You should flavor the soup according to your own tastes, but to make authentic sinigang na baboy, the broth should be both sour and salty.

, Ladle the hot soup into individual serving bowls and enjoy.


You can either remove the pork bones before serving the dish to your guests or allow each guest to do so after serving the soup.

Sinigang na baboy is frequently served with a side of steamed rice. Consider garnishing it with chopped scallions, lemon wedges, and additional fish sauce, as well.

You should use spare ribs instead of prime ribs. Both will offer you the same flavor and nutrition, but spare ribs are less expensive and benefit more from the slow, low cook time.
You could also use pork bones. Pork bones are meat-covered bones that come from the limbs of the big rather than the rib cage. They contain more of the nutritious marrow but less meat, so adding pork bones will produce a richer broth but a less meaty soup.;

Make sure that the ginger has been peeled and sliced into thin pieces. You can also chop or mince the ginger.
Note that the ginger in this version of the recipe creates a more fragrant soup and pungent flavor than versions that use garlic and black pepper.
You could also use pork broth instead of water, but the pork bones or ribs should produce plenty of flavor on their own, so it is not necessary.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the stockpot. Allow the contents to simmer at this temperature until the pork is tender.


Stir the soup periodically as it cooks.
As the dish cooks, you will likely notice brown foam or scum at the top of the soup. This is normal, but it should still be removed. Scrape it off using a large mixing or serving spoon and discard in the sink. Rinse the sink well afterward to prevent it from turning into an obnoxious smell.

, Once the pork is tender and just about falling off the bone, add the string beans and the fish sauce. Stir these new ingredients in and continue cooking for another 5 to 8 minutes, or until the string beans become warm and tender-crisp.


You can adjust the amount of string beans you add according to your own tastes. Make sure that the string beans are clean, but otherwise, they require no preparation and should be added to the soup whole.
Taste the soup and adjust the flavor accordingly. You can add more salt or more fish sauce.
Note that if you buy the fish sauce from an Asian market, it might be labeled as ""patis.""

, When done, remove the soup from the heat and spoon it into separate serving dishes immediately. It should be enjoyed while still fresh and hot.


This soup is traditionally served with a side of hot, cooked white rice.

Rinse the pork.,
Place the pork and seasonings into a large stockpot.,
Let the pork simmer for roughly 1 hour.,
Add the starches.,
Add the cabbage leaves, green onions, and fish sauce.,
Serve hot.",How to Cook Nilagang Baboy2," Clean the pork by rinsing it under cool, running water. Doing this removes stickiness and some of the surface bacteria from the meat. Pat the pork dry with clean paper towels and cut into bite-size pieces.


Choose bony parts of the pork. Bones from the ribs, belly, hocks, or neck tend to work best. If you need to separate the pieces, do so by cutting into the meat in between the bones.
Ribs tend to have more meat than other pork bones, but other pork bones tend to have more marrow and make a richer broth.
If you use ribs, choose more affordable spare ribs instead of prime ribs. Spare ribs benefit more from this slow, low cooking method than prime ribs would.

, Combine the pork, water, garlic, onions, black peppercorns, and salt in the stockpot. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.


Note that the black peppercorn and garlic combination is a bit more traditional than the ginger version.
Only add the white onion in this step. Do not add the green onion yet.
The garlic must be peeled and crushed before you add it, and the onion should be peeled cut into quarters or similar wedges.
You could substitute the water for low-sodium pork broth, but since the pork bones give off a lot of flavor on their own, doing so is not necessary.

, Cover the dish and reduce the heat to medium-low. Allow the contents of the stockpot to simmer until the pork is tender and nearly falling off the bone.


Stir the contents often as the soup simmers.
You will likely notice brown scum or foam rising to the surface of the soup as it simmers. Even though this scum is normal, you should still remove it with a large serving or mixing spoon. Pour the foam down your sink and follow it with a flush of running water.

, After the pork becomes tender, you should add the potatoes and eddoes. Mix these into the soup well and simmer for another 10 minutes, or until tender.


The eddoes, also referred to as ""taro"" or ""gabi,"" are only optional. They can add a little flavor to the soup, but their main purpose is to thicken up the broth.
If desired, you could cut the potatoes into smaller, bite-size pieces or use ""baby"" potatoes instead.

, Mix these ingredients into the soup and cook for no more than 5 minutes. The leaves and green vegetables should be warm but not soggy.


Note that the bok choy cabbage might be referred to as ""pechay"" at the market, and the green onions could be labeled as ""scallions.""
Similarly, the fish paste will often be labeled ""patis"" when bought at an Asian food market.

, After all the ingredients are warmed through, remove the stockpot from the heat and spoon the soup out into individual serving bowls. Serve while still fresh and hot.


Traditionally, nilagang baboy is served with a side of hot, cooked white rice.

Heat oil in a large skillet.,
Brown the pork.,
Toss the pork, potatoes, and seasonings into a slow cooker.,
Cook on High for 4 hours.,
Add the scallions, cabbage, and green beans during the last 15 to 30 minutes.,
Serve hot.",How to Cook Nilagang Baboy3," Pour the oil into a large skillet with high sides and bring it to temperature over medium-high heat. Wait a minute or two until the oil becomes glossier and smoother, but do not allow it to start smoking.


Even though this method is made in a slow cooker, you will still brown the pork beforehand. Doing so will give the meat a richer, deeper flavor. It is, however, technically optional, so if you are really short on time, you can skip this part and go straight to the slow cooker portion of the instructions.

, Add the pork to the hot oil in bite-size cubes. Stir-fry using a heat-resistant spatula until brown on all sides.


Drain the excess fat off into the sink and rinse it down the drain.
For this method, it is better to use boneless pieces of pork instead of pork bones and ribs. Even though pork bones are more traditional for nilagang baboy, lean cubes of boneless pork meat are preferred for the slow cooker method. Pork legs and fillets tend to be leaner and make good choices.
To make the pieces juicier and more tender, you can pound the meat with a meat mallet or rolling pin until the muscle fiber begins to loosen.

, Place the browned pork cubes into your slow cooker along with the onion, garlic, ginger, fish sauce, potatoes, and broth. Add in the salt and pepper, as well. Stir gently to mix.


If desired, you could spray the inside of the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray or line it with a specially created slow cooker liner. Taking either one of these steps before adding the ingredients can make the clean-up process easier later on.
Note that you really should use broth for this version instead of water. Since you are not using pork bones, the liquid will not receive much flavor from the pork itself. As such, using a pre-made pork broth will give the soup a richer taste.
If you do not have pork broth on hand, you could use vegetable broth, chicken broth, or beef broth, as well.

, Cover the slow cooker and cook the soup until the pork becomes tender.


You could also cook the soup on Low for 7 to 8 hours.
Do not stir the soup as it cooks. Opening the slow cooker releases too much steam and could prolong the overall cooking time.

, When the soup is nearly ready, add these last three ingredients and stir to combine. Cover the slow cooker again and allow the dish to continue cooking on Low power for the remainder of the time.


The green beans should be sliced into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces and the scallions, or green onions, should be chopped into 1-inch pieces. The bok choy should also be shredded or roughly chopped.

, As soon as the dish finishes cooking, you should turn the heat off and spoon the soup into individual serving bowls. Enjoy while still fresh and steaming hot.


To serve this meal in a more traditional way, enjoy the nilagang baboy with a separate side of hot, cooked white rice or jasmine rice.

Obtain a gourd and bombilla.,
Pack the dry, loose yerba mate into the gourd just over half full.








,
Place your hand on the top of the half-filled gourd and turn it upside-down.,
Turn the gourd almost completely on its side and give it several light shakes back and forth.,
Insert the bombilla into the gourd.,
Pour hot water into the empty space as you did with the cool water.,
Drink from the bombilla.,
Clean the gourd (or whatever container you used) after you're done and leave it out to dry.",How to Make Yerba Mate1," Mate is traditionally steeped and served in a hollow calabash gourd (itself called a mate) and drunk through a metal straw called a bombilla (pronounced bome-bee-ja). There are also mate cups made from metal, ceramic or wood. You can use a regular teacup, as well, but you'll definitely need the bombilla.


A gourd being used for the first time should be cured, or else the first few drinks from it might be a little on the bitter side. Curing removes the soft inner tissues of the gourd and ""seasons"" the inside with the flavor of mate. Fill the gourd with boiling water almost to the metal rim (or to the top if there is no metal rim) and let it sit for 10 minutes. Then softly scrape the membrane out of the gourd with a metal spoon under running water (but do not remove the stem in the center). Finally, put the cleaned-out gourd in the sunlight for a day or two until it is completely dry.;
,, Shake the more powdery leaves to the top of the gourd with several flicks of the wrist. This helps to ensure that you don't suck in the powdery leaves through the bombilla later.








, This action will bring the larger stems to the surface, which will help filter the powdery leaves later. Slowly and carefully tilt the gourd right side up so that the yerba mate remains in a lopsided pile on one side.








, Whether you add cool water before or after inserting the bombilla is a matter of personal or cultural preference. Either way, the cool water will help preserve the integrity of the mate.









Put the bombilla in the empty space next to the pile, being careful not to disturb the arrangement. Bring the end of the bombilla to the bottom and against the wall, as far from the powdery tip of the pile as possible. Then add cold water into the empty space until just before it reaches the top of the pile and wait for it to be absorbed. Try to keep the powdery tip of the pile dry.
Alternatively, pour cool water into the empty space until just before it reaches the top of the pile, and wait for it to be absorbed. Pack or gently tamp the slope of the pile; this packing helps the mate remain in this shape later on. Bring the end of the bombilla to the bottom and against the wall, as far from the powdery tip of the pile as possible.

, It is important that you use hot water (70–80 °C, 160–180 °F) not boiling water, as boiling water will make the mate bitter.








, Newcomers to mate tend to jiggle the bombilla and stir the herb. Resist this temptation, or you'll end up clogging the bombilla and allowing herb into the straw. Drink the entire mate when it's handed to you, don't just take a small sip and pass it back. You should hear a sound similar to when drinking soda with straw.









In a group, the first brew is traditionally taken by the person who prepares the mate. If you are the server, drink the mate until there is no water left, then refill the gourd with hot water and pass it to the next person, sharing the same bombilla.
Keep refilling the gourd as it's passed around (one brew per person) until it loses its flavor (called lavado in Spanish, because the flavor is ""washed out""); it should take ten refills, more or less (depending on the quality of the mate). The mound can be pushed to the opposite side of the gourd and refilled a few more times in order to fully extract the flavor.
To signal that you don't want any more mate, give thanks to ""el cebador"" (the server). Remember only to give thanks after your last mate. Once you give thanks it will be understood that you do not want anymore.

, Containers made from organic materials may rot and your mate will taste accordingly.

Check the expiration date.,
Consider how long you want to keep the tortillas.,
Decide between popular grocery-store tortilla brands.",How to Choose Tortillas1," When choosing a specific package of tortillas, always check the expiration date (or the “sell by date”) before purchasing. If the expiration date is soon—or if the tortillas have already expired—put them back and search for another package, whose expiration date is farther off.


It goes without saying that if a package of tortillas is moldy, or if the tortillas are clearly stale, you should not purchase it.
If you find that you’ve already purchased a moldy, stale, or expired bag of tortillas, you should be able to take it back to the store where you purchased it, and receive a full refund or store credit.;
, If you’re not planning to eat the entire package of tortillas in the day or two after you purchase it, you’ll need to think about how long the tortillas are likely to be sitting in your pantry. Corn tortillas generally have a great shelf life than their flour counterparts, so if the longevity of the unused tortillas matters, corn may be the more economic option.As a rule of thumb:


Corn tortillas generally last up to 10 days after the “best by” date if stored in a pantry, up to 8 weeks after the “best by” date if stored in the refrigerator, and up to 8 months after the “best by” date if stored in the freezer.
Flour tortillas can last up to seven days after the “best by” date if stored in a pantry, up to four weeks after the “best by” date if stored in the refrigerator, and up to eight months after the “best by” date if stored in the freezer.

, Local grocery stores sell many popular brands of tortillas, which will have small differences in taste, consistency, texture, and other qualities. To decide which you prefer, you could compare two or three in a single sitting, or try a variety of brands over time. Popular tortilla brands include: Mission, Don Marcos, Piñata, and Cruz.If you’re dissatisfied with the tortilla offerings at large chain grocery stores, you’ll be able to find a greater variety of tortilla brands if you look at a health food store or an organic retail store.
If you’d like to find more authentic tortillas than those sold in large chain grocery stores, look online to see if there is a farmer’s market or Mexican grocery store in your area.

",How to Make Tostada Shells1," Traditionally, the tortilla is deep-fried in vegetable oil. This is considered the most authentic, and often tastiest way to prepare tostada shells, though if you are watching your calories you may wish to bake or microwave the tortilla.;
,, Test the heat by dropping a small piece of tortilla into the center of the skillet. If the tortilla immediately sizzles and fries, the oil is ready.

, The outer edges of the tortilla should bubble, as should the center. Always be careful of splattering oil.

, Depending on your stove this may take 8 to 10 or up to 30 seconds for each side. A fully fried tostada should be a light to medium brown color.

Consider the dish you’re making.,
Choose corn tortillas for a healthier meal.,
Determine which flavor you prefer.,
Look for spinach or whole wheat tortillas.",How to Choose Tortillas2," Flour tortillas are typically larger than their corn-based counterparts, and are consequently used for burritos, as they’re able to hold more meat, cheese, and beans, without bursting open. Conversely, corn tortillas are often used for soft tacos, which are folded, but not wrapped shut, and almost always used to make enchiladas, in which the tortillas are layered atop one another.


The consistency of the tortillas also plays a role. Flour tortillas are smoother and more flexible, while corn tortillas have a slightly grainy texture and can be brittle.
When corn tortillas become stale, they can be fried and used as tortilla chips, or used to make taquitos., Corn tortillas are made from corn, which is a whole grain. Whole grains provide many nutritional benefits, including high amounts of fiber and various vitamins and minerals. Flour tortillas—made from flour, which is a refined and processed grain—do not provide these benefits.Additionally, since corn tortillas are typically smaller than flour tortillas, you’ll consume fewer calories by eating a single corn tortilla than you would eating a single flour tortilla.

, Ultimately, the decision between flour or corn tortillas may come down to a simple taste preference. Flour tortillas have a soft texture and a sweet taste, which tends to be mild. Corn tortillas have a more chewy texture, and also have a more pronounced flavor of roasted corn.If you’re unfamiliar with the differences in their flavor, buy a package of corn tortillas and a package of flour tortillas at your local grocery store.

, Although flour and corn tortillas are by far the most common and the most popular types, there are various other types of tortillas which offer new tastes and, in some cases, health benefits. Check your local grocery store—or a health food store—for spinach tortillas. Many commercial brands also offer whole grain tortillas or wheat flour tortillas.Whole grain tortillas are healthier options than generic white flour tortillas, as they’ll contain more healthy nutrients.
While spinach tortillas have an appealing taste, they do not offer substantially more health benefits than regular flour tortillas. Spinach tortillas are typically made from white flour, and spinach powder and green food dye are added to them."
"
Buy an appropriate number of tortillas for your dining plans.,
Plan ahead for future tortilla-based meals.,
Purchase an appropriate size of tortilla, based on how you’ll be filling it.,
Use larger tortillas to make wraps.",How to Choose Tortillas3," Tortillas are commonly sold in packages of 8, 10, and 12, but it’s not unusual to find packages of flour tortillas that contain 20 tortillas, and packages of corn tortillas that contain up to 30. In order to avoid wasting food and spending money needlessly, calculate how many tortillas you need in advance.


For example, if you’re making enchiladas for a party, you may need two dozen (or more) corn tortillas. If you’re just planning to take burritos for lunch over the course of a week, you only need to buy a small package of eight.

, If you’re planning to eat Mexican or Latin American food for a long period of time (for example, a month or more), you may decide to buy a large package of tortillas in advance preparation. In terms of cost effectiveness, buying a larger package of tortillas will result in a lower cost per-tortilla.


If you’re undecided about how many tortillas you’ll need, buy two moderate sized packages (for example, containing 10 or 12 tortillas). Use one package immediately, and keep the other in the freezer in case you need more tortillas than the first package contained.
When you need to thaw the second package of tortillas, pull it out of the freezer a day or so in advance. If you put the package of tortillas in the refrigerator overnight, the individual tortillas should be thawed by morning.
If you need to thaw tortillas more quickly, take the frozen tortillas out of the plastic bag, wrap them in a paper towel, and microwave for about 45 seconds. If the tortillas aren’t thawed after 45 seconds, microwave more as needed.

, Common tortilla sizes include 4-inch (for corn tortillas) and 7- or 12-inch (for flour tortillas), although tortillas can be sold in sizes reaching up to 24 inches.Plan to purchase a size of tortilla that will match your culinary needs: the tortilla should be larger enough for you to fill it with as much food as you please (for example, if you’re making a burrito), but not so large that you end up throwing part of it away.


If you’re making soft tacos or enchiladas, first try using a small size of corn tortilla.
If you’re making burritos, first try making them with a standard size of flour tortilla; you can then decide to purchase smaller or larger tortillas in the future, as needed.

, Tortillas are commonly used to make wraps, which combine sandwich or salad ingredients into a neatly packaged burrito-like form. Since wraps can include large amounts of several different ingredients, plan to use a large tortilla when making a wrap. If you’d like to try making a wrap but are unfamiliar with common varieties, typical wraps include:Chicken Caesar wraps, including lettuce, grilled chicken, Caesar dressing, and shredded parmesan cheese.
Buffalo chicken wraps, including lettuce, buffalo chicken, buffalo sauce, shredded cheddar cheese, and blue cheese dressing.
A sandwich wrap, including your choice of sliced deli meats, cheeses, and mustard or sandwich oil.

Note the principal fresh ingredients involved in real Mexican cooking.,
Find a good source of Mexican cooking ideas.,
Use spices judiciously.,
Avoid using canned beans.,
Make some corn dishes.,
Try some traditional Mexican soup dishes.,
Make fish and seafood dishes.,
Cook using meat and poultry.,
Make salsa!,
Try some traditional Mexican baking.,
Make or purchase Mexican drinks.",How to Cook Real Mexican Food," First, fresh is important because the freshness gives Mexican food its vitality and interest. Second, the following ingredients are fairly staple Mexican inclusions, although it is very important to recognize that the uses for ingredients and food dishes will vary from region to region:


Corn - used for a variety of food including tortillas, quesadillas, tamales, chimichangas, soups, etc.
Chiles and peppers - with over 100 varieties of chiles, there are plenty of uses in Mexican cuisine, from mild to hot, including as a spice for salsa.
Tomatoes - used in a wide variety of dishes. In addition, tomatillos are used a lot. These are not small tomatoes but a fruit in their own right, used in sauces and dishes.

Cilantro (coriander) - a fairly typical herb flavor added to numerous Mexican dishes. In the Yucatan peninsula, annatto (achiote) is a popular spice, and it is from here that a sauce made from the hottest chillies (habaneros) is made (Ixni-pec).
Beans, usually kidney, haricot, black, or pinto beans. Frijoles (beans) are a Mexican staple, often served with a little cooking liquid, or mashed or fried with oil or lard and served as ""refritos"". Haricot and pinto beans are native to Mexico. Lima beans (Peru) and garbanzos (chickpeas) are also popular.
Fruit, including peaches, pawpaws, avocados, pineapples, and coconuts. Naturally, avocado is essential for the well-known guacamole.
Meats such as goat, chicken, pork, lamb, and beef. Chorizo, a seasoned sausage, is used a lot in Mexican cuisine.;
, Some cookbooks that claim to teach you traditional Mexican food are suggesting deviated variants or even Tex-Mex. A definitive reference cookbook for the US audience is Authentic Mexican by Rick Bayless. When deciding on buying or borrowing a Mexican cookbook, check that the cookbook has made a decent attempt to explain regional cuisines differences, and does not have an excessive focus on ""easy-out"" options or focuses on using too much dairy throughout the book. The same qualifications apply to finding suitable recipes online.


If you can read Spanish, order cookbooks direct from Mexico, or read Mexican recipe sites and recipe blogs. Some bloggers may even translate their dishes into English; indeed, there are many Anglophones who have lived or traveled in Mexico, and who love to share their favorite Mexican recipes online.

, Mexican food is, of course, not always heavily spiced or piquant, but chiles are a common ingredient. They may be raw, smoked, or dried, but are seldom used in their powdered form. Cayenne chili, commonly found in a dried form, is not frequently used in Mexican cooking (cayenne chiles are actually quite hot). Nearly all chiles can be eaten green and are hotter green than their red or yellow counterparts. Jalapeño chiles - particularly those sold these days - are some of the mildest ""hot"" chiles around. Some ways for using chiles in Mexican cuisine include:



Make chiles rellenos (stuffed peppers).

Make ferchirajas.

, This could be taken more generally: avoid using canned foods whenever possible. Cooking dried beans allows you to introduce some flavor into the cooking liquid, and canned beans are often heavily salted. Spices vary from region to region and dish to dish, but with beans, you could safely include sauteed onions and garlic, bay, Mexican oregano, and various forms of fresh and cured pork.


Bean dishes include refried beans, frijoles negros, green lima bean salad, etc.

Make black bean salsa.
Make traditional Mexican rice to accompany the beans.

, Corn is used extensively in Mexican cuisine and there are many ways that you can use it at home. Look for masa harina (flour made from grinding dried corn kernels) which serves as the basis of tortillas, tamales, baked goods, and atole. Here are some suggested recipes to get you started:



Make tortillas or Make corn tortillas. If you cannot find corn flour, use wheat flour (traditional in the area bordering with Texas, where corn does not grow well): Make flour tortillas.

Make tortilla soup. This is a traditional, delicious Mexican soup.

Make hot tamales.

Make enchiladas.

Make a chicken chimichanga (substitute corn flour for the wheat flour suggested).

, Traditional Mexican soup dishes include corn soup, tortilla soup, tomato soup (use fresh tomatoes and coriander), vermicelli soup, avocado soup, etc.

, Real Mexican cooking makes the most of fish and shellfish, including red snapper, sea bass, mackerel, striped bass, and prawns. The Mexican dish Huachinango a la Veracruzana (red snapper Veracruz style) is a national signature dish. Ceviche, dried salt cod, and Spanish and Portuguese fish dishes are also very popular in Mexico.



How to Prepare Snapper.

, There is a wide variety of traditional meat dish choices in Mexican cuisine, including turkey, quail, pheasant, chicken, etc. Many meat dishes blend old culture with new cuisine. One of the most traditional dishes is Mole Poblano de Guajolote, which is based on turkey. Some ideas to help you get started:



Make Mexican beef and beans.

Make chicken mole. See also how to make mole sauce.

, Salsa is a popular Mexican accompaniment, including salsa chipotle, salsa verde, and green jalapeño salsa. You can find a range of salsa recipes in wikiHow's Salsa page.

, Baking is an important part of Mexican cuisine, including desserts and cakes. Some ideas to start you include:



Make Mexican polvorones.

Make churros.

Make sopaipillas.

Make coffee flan.

Make arroz con leche.

, To complete your Mexican meal, add some drinks. You can purchase Mexican beer, Mexican wine, tequila, or try making:


Horchata
Milk coffee.

Margaritas.

Sangria or sangrita.
Tequila cocktails (not all authentic of course but in the spirit of tequila!).

Mexican hot chocolate.
Tamarind or rosella drinks.

"
Make the filling.,
Roast the chile peppers.",How to Make Chiles Rellenos1," You will make two fillings: one comprised of meat, and the other of cheese.









Meat filling - Fry the ground beef in a standard non-stick pan. Chop up the tomato and one of the onions. Add the chopped ingredients to the pan when the meat is fully brown. Remove the pan from the heat and give the ingredients a stir.
Cheese filling - Grate the cheddar cheese into a bowl with a cheese grater. When the whole pound is grated, chop up and add the remaining onion.;
, Sometimes, you can buy the peppers already roasted, especially in areas where chiles are a popular part of local cuisine. You can also buy them online, roasted and frozen.









To roast the chile peppers yourself, put them on the grill or on a gas stove and leave them over the open flame, rotating until they are completely charred. Then rinse them off in cold water, rubbing off the burnt skin. You should now have 20 tender chiles ready to be stuffed.

At this point, you can carefully scrape out the seeds with a butter knife to reduce the heat of the pepper, but this is optional.








, Be careful because the soft, roasted chiles are easily torn. Begin with the meat stuffing. Portion out some of the stuffing and fill the chile. When 10 of the chiles are filled, do the same to the remaining chiles with the cheese stuffing. Don't stuff them so much that the slit can't be closed.








, It doesn't need to be perfect; it's just to keep any stuffing from falling out while you fry them.

Pour into a glass jar.,
Refrigerate overnight before use.,
Store extra in the refrigerator or freezer.",How to Make Kecap Manis," White granulated sugar lacks the depth of flavor needed for this recipe, so your best choices are brown sugar, palm sugar, or molasses.


Palm sugar (also called Indonesian palm sugar, gula jawa, or gula merah) is the most authentic but it is harder to find in standard grocery stores. This is the preferred option if you're able to find it, and you can use it in either granulated or liquid form.
Brown sugar and molasses are both good substitutes for palm sugar, so you should use whichever you prefer or have available. You can even mix-and-match by adding 1/2 cup (125 ml) brown sugar and 1/2 cup (125 ml) molasses.;
, You can create a flavor similar to the taste of real kecap manis by using nothing but soy sauce, sugar, and water, but using additional seasonings can enhance the flavor and make it even more authentic.


Note that this recipe recommends a combination of ginger (or galangal root), garlic, and star anise.
Other spice options can include fresh curry leaves, cinnamon, and red chili pepper.

, The ginger must be peeled and grated. The garlic should be minced or crushed.


Use a vegetable peeler to shave the skin off the ginger or galangal root. After peeling the vegetable, drag it across the surface of a box grater to tear it into large shreds.
Alternatively, you can cut the ginger or galangal root into discs that are 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick.Quickly smash the garlic clove with a cutting board or the side of a broad kitchen knife. Remove the loosened skin and use the crushed garlic as it is or mince it with a sharp, smooth knife.

, Set this bowl of ice water aside until later.


Note that this step is only necessary if you plan on using the stovetop cooking method. You do not need to prepare any ice water if you plan on making the kecap manis in your microwave.
Select a bowl that is large enough to hold the saucepan you'll be using if you plan on using the stovetop cooking method instead of the microwave cooking method.
Only fill the bowl halfway with water and ice. Do not fill it to the top.
Keep the bowl near your stove as you proceed.

, Stir the two ingredients together in a heavy, small saucepan.

, Place the saucepan on your stove and set the burner to medium-high heat. Bring the contents to a boil, stirring occasionally as it heats up.


Stirring the mixture as it heats up promotes even heat distribution and will encourage the sugar to dissolve more swiftly.
Scrape any sugar or syrup from the sides of the pan, pushing it down into the rest of the hot mixture.

, Stop stirring the mixture once it reaches a boil. Let it cook undisturbed for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until the color changes to a deep amber.


Keep the saucepan uncovered as the syrup simmers.

, Quickly remove the saucepan from the stove and sit the bottom in ice water for 30 seconds.


After 30 seconds pass, remove the saucepan from the ice water and place it on a heat-resistant surface.
Dunking the bottom of the saucepan in ice water stops the cooking process and prevents the syrup from becoming any hotter than it should become.
Do not allow any water from the bowl to get into the pan of syrup.

, Place the soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and star anise in the saucepan of semi-cooled syrup, stirring gently to combine.


Work carefully as you add the other ingredients. Even though the syrup is partially cooled, it can still cause a mild burn if it splashes onto your bare skin.

, Cook the contents on medium-high heat, bringing them to a simmer but not a full boil.


Stir the mixture occasionally as it heats up.

, Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for another 10 minutes.


Keep the saucepan uncovered as the mixture simmers.
Stir the mixture occasionally during this time.

, Take the saucepan off the stove again and place it on your heat-resistant surface. Allow it to cool at room temperature until the sauce reaches room temperature.


Consider loosely placing a lid, upside-down plate, or towel over the saucepan as the sauce cools. Doing so will prevent dust and debris from falling into the sauce.
When prepared using the stove, finished kecap manis should be the consistency of a thick syrup. It will also continue to thicken as it cools., Mix well until evenly distributed.


The bowl should be able to hold a minimum of 4 cups (1L), even though this capacity is nearly twice as much as needed to hold the ingredients at room temperature. The extra space will help prevent any overflow from escaping into the microwave as the mixture heats up.

, Set the microwave to 50-percent power and place the sugar mixture inside.Cook uncovered for 30 to 40 seconds, or until the sugar starts to melt.


The sugar should not be completely melted at this point.
If you use molasses instead of sugar, note that the molasses should look notably thinner than it did before being heated.

, Place the ginger, garlic, and star anise in the hot mixture. Stir well until the new ingredients are evenly incorporated.


Work carefully. The contents of the dish will be hot at this point and may cause a mild burn if they splash onto your bare skin.

, Return the bowl to the microwave and the mixture for another 10 to 20 seconds on medium (50-percent) power.


After this second round, the sauce should look notably thin and there should no longer be any visible chunks of sugar remaining. There may, however, be individual granules of sugar floating around in the syrup.

, Remove the dish and stir it well using a spoon or whisk. Continue stirring until all of the sugar is completely dissolved.


All of the sugar should be dissolved. This includes both large clumps and any individual granules.
If the sugar is not fully dissolved after you mix it for 60 to 90 seconds, return the dish to the microwave and cook it for another 10 to 20 seconds at medium power before stirring it again.
Since the syrup never quite boils when you use a microwave, the finished kecap manis will not be as thick when prepared using this method. The taste will remain accurate, however, and the sauce will thicken slightly as it stands.

, The sticky, thick syrup will take its time passing through, but all of the actual sauce should eventually make it to the other side.


The solid ingredients like the star anise, garlic, and ginger will be strained out.
Alternatively, you can fish the solid ingredients out with a fork or spoon instead of passing the sauce through a strainer.

, Transfer the strained sauce to a non-reactive, non-permeable jar with a lid. A glass jar usually works well for this purpose.


If you plan to keep the sauce for more than a week, you should make sure that the jar has been thoroughly sterilized in scalding hot water before using it.

, Place the lid on the jar and keep the sauce in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.


Letting the sauce rest gives it a chance to mellow. The flavors will be more thoroughly blended together, and no one flavor should be able to overpower the others.
After refrigerating the sauce overnight, it is ready to use.

, If you do not use all of the kecap manis, you can keep it covered and refrigerated for as many as two to four weeks.

If you intend to keep the sauce for a longer period of time, store it in your freezer. When sealed and frozen, this kecap manis should last for up to six months.

Remove the plastic wrap and lay a large sheet of parchment paper over the shell. Fill it with pie weights and bake the shell for 20 to 25 minutes.The pie crust won't bake completely. It will finish baking once you've poured the filling in and bake the entire pie. Par-baking ensures a crispy crust.

, Take the pie shell out of the oven and carefully lift out the parchment paper and pie weights. Scatter 3 ounces (90 g) of finely chopped bittersweet chocolate over the crust while it's still hot. Wait 5 minutes and then use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread the melted chocolate evenly across the crust. Set the pie shell aside while you make the filling.If you don't want to chop your own chocolate, you could use bittersweet chocolate chips.

, Cut one stick (8 tablespoons or 113 g) of butter into 8 pieces. Put the butter into a small saucepan. Turn the heat to medium low and stir the butter constantly until it melts and turns brown. You'll need to heat it for about 5 to 7 minutes. If you want to use bourbon, turn off the heat and slowly stir in 3 tablespoons of it.

If you don't have a square baking pan, you can use a round springform pan. If you use the springform pan, you won't need to use the parchment paper.

, Place 1 cup (125 grams) of all-purpose flour into a food processor. Add 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 cup (50 g) of granulated sugar. Put the lid on the processor and pulse the mixture so the ingredients are combined.If you don't have a food processor, you can make the crust in a mixing bowl. You'll just need to manually cut the butter into the dry ingredients.

, Cut 1/2 cup (4 ounces or 115 grams) of unsalted butter into cubes and add them to the food processor. Turn the food processor on so the butter is incorporated with the dry crust ingredients. Run the food processor for about 30 seconds so dough begins to form.If you're making the crust by hand, you'll need to mix the butter in and then knead the mixture into a rough dough.

, Scoop the dough directly into the parchment-lined pan. Use your fingers to press the dough evenly across the bottom and slightly up the sides of the pan. Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Let the crust cool while you make the filling.The crust will be very pale once it's finished par-baking.

, Put 6 tablespoons (85 grams) of unsalted butter into a small saucepan. Turn the heat to medium. Stir the butter until it melts and then pour it into a large mixing bowl.

If you like, sprinkle some flaky sea salt over the top for added richness. Bake the thoroughbred pie bars in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the pan to a wire rack so they can cool before you cut them.The bars will be golden brown and firm once they've finished baking.

, Slice the cooled pie bars into 16 pieces and serve them with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. If you want to serve them warm, keep in mind that you may not be able to cut them into neat slices.Store leftover pie bars in an airtight container. You can chill them for up to 5 days or keep them at room temperature for up to 3 days.

Learn about the different types of tools used in measuring for baking.,
Measure dry ingredients following these guidelines:


Use graded measuring cups for the most accurate baking measurements.,
Measure liquid ingredients in a measuring glass.,
Measure fats and other solids in graded measuring cups.",How to Measure Correctly when Baking,"


Measuring spoons. These come in a range of sizes, from 1/4 tsp. (1.25 ml) up to 1 tbsp. (15 ml).
Measuring glasses. These clear glass containers are marked on the side in increments ranging from 1/4 cup (60 ml) up to 2 cups (480 ml), 3 cups (720 ml) or 4 cups (960 ml). Measuring glasses come with a handle and a pour spout.
Graded measuring cups. These measuring cups come in sets of 4 to 6 cups, each cup representing 1 measuring amount, from 1/4 cup (60 ml) to 1 cup (240 ml).;
,
Spoon ingredients into measuring cups lightly. If the recipe calls for a leveled-off measurement, use a knife to level the ingredient off at the rim of the measuring cup. If the recipe calls for a heaping measurement, do not level the ingredient off; instead, leave a small heap atop the measuring cup.
If the recipe calls for a packed measurement, use a spoon to push the ingredient into the measuring cup either loosely or firmly (according to the directions). A packed ingredient will retain at least some of the shape of its measuring cup after it is dumped into the mixing bowl.
If you are using a measuring spoon for dry ingredients, scoop the dry ingredient with the appropriately sized spoon. Leave it as-is if a heaping spoonful is called for, but use a knife to level it off if a level spoonful is called for.

, Rest the container on a flat surface and view the liquid at eye level to determine that you have accurately filled the container to the correct amount. If your baking measurements require a measuring spoon, simply pour the liquid into the appropriate spoon until it is full.

, Spoon these ingredients into measuring cups, then pack them firmly with a spoon or a rubber spatula to get out any air bubbles.

Use 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (plus an acid) for every 1 teaspoon of baking powder in your recipe.,
Use an acid that compliments your recipe.,
Add your baking soda to the dry ingredients and your acid to the wet ingredients before combining the two.,
Use 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar for each 1/4 teaspoon baking soda.,
Use 1 cup of sour dairy for 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda.,
Add 1/2 teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice for every 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda.,
Add 3/8 cup of molasses, golden syrup or treacle for every 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda.",How to Make Substitute Baking Powder," Baking soda (bicarbonate of soda) is an ingredient in nearly all substitute baking powder recipes. Baking soda acts as the base in the acid-base reaction that recreates the leavening effect of baking powder. You may choose from a variety of acidic ingredients, but, for the reaction to work correctly, you'll need this common kitchen base. When substituting baking soda for baking powder, know that baking soda is about four times as powerful as baking powder, so 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda equals 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda equals 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and so on.


While the amount of baking soda you will use as a substitute for baking powder is always 1/4 of the amount of baking powder called for, note that the volume of your acidic ingredient will vary from recipe to recipe.;
, As noted above, each substitution option uses baking soda as a base. However, each substitution option uses a different ingredient as its acid. The reaction between the baking soda and the acid will effectively neutralize most of the sour taste of the acid, so you don't have to worry, for instance, that using the baking soda and vinegar method will leave your cake with a disgusting sour taste. However, other aspects of the acid's flavor will remain, so try to pick a substitution option whose acid compliments the other ingredients in your recipe.


For instance, if you're making sweet, delicious cookies, you might opt for the baking soda and molasses method, which will give your cookies dark, decadent molasses undertones.

, The acid-base reaction between your two ingredients substituting for baking powder will begin as soon as they are combined, and, over time, the reaction will slow and eventually peter out. Because of this, it's important not to combine these two ingredients until just before you're ready to put your dough or batter in the oven. Luckily, most baking recipes call for you to combine all your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, etc.) and your wet ingredients (eggs, vanilla, etc.) separately from each other before combining the two. Use this to your advantage - add the baking soda to your dry ingredients and add your acid to your wet ingredients so that they combine as soon as possible before putting your ingredients in the oven.

, Cream of tartar is a common powdery ingredient that, combined in a slightly greater than 2:1 ratio with baking soda, makes a good substitute for baking powder. Though cream of tartar itself is a dry ingredient, add it to your wet ingredients as you would any of the other acids used in this article.


Optionally, you may create and store a powdered baking powder substitute for use at a later date. Combine your cream of tartar and baking soda in a 2:1 ratio as you normally would, then add a quantity of cornstarch equal to the amount of baking soda you added. The cornstarch will absorb moisture from the air, preventing the baking soda and cream of tartar from reacting prematurely., Another useful acid-base leavening combination is that of baking soda and any form of sour dairy - buttermilk, yogurt, or completely sour milk will all work. The dairy's sour taste is a result of its acidity, the same property that causes it to react with baking soda and produce the leavening effect. Use 1/2 cup of dairy for every 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda, or, in other words, 1 cup for 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, etc.Because you must use a relatively large volume of dairy to balance out your baking soda, reduce the volume of your other liquid ingredients to accommodate the extra liquid. For example, if you're using this substitution method and you put 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda into your dry ingredients, you might want to remove 1/2 cup of milk from the recipe to make up for the fact that you will add 1/2 cup buttermilk.

, The acid-base reaction between baking soda and vinegar has gained fame through countless paper mâché volcano science fair projects. The reaction works identically here. Simply add vinegar to your wet ingredients in a 2:1 ratio to the baking soda you add to your dry ingredients and combine as normal. Lemon juice, because it is also quite acidic, may be used in place of vinegar.

, Some thick, viscous kitchen sweeteners are acids and therefore will react with baking soda. Molasses, golden syrup, and treacle are all good choices when substituting for baking powder - add 3/8 cup of any of these to your wet ingredients for each 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda you add to your dry ingredients.


As with the sour dairy method above, the volume of acid here is large enough to affect the overall composition of your recipe. So, if you use this method, remove 3/8 cup of liquid from your recipe for every 3/8 cup of molasses, etc. you add.
Additionally, because molasses is very sweet, you may want to lower the amounts of other sweeteners in your recipe as well.

Start with 1 cup (150 grams) of all-purpose flour.,
Add 1½ teaspoons of fresh baking powder.,
Consider adding ¼ teaspoon of baking soda if your recipe calls for buttermilk, cocoa, or yogurt.,
Add ¼ to ½ teaspoon of salt.,
Sift the ingredients together to make sure they are evenly combined.,
Use the flour in your recipe.,
Store any left over flour in an air tight container, and write the expiration date.,

Use the flour in your recipe, and store any left over flour in an air-tight container.",How to Make Self Rising Flour," Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl. If your recipe calls for more flour, simply increase the proportions.;
, Make sure that the baking powder is fresh. If the baking powder is not fresh, your self-rising flour will not work as well., These ingredients require a little extra raising power. The baking soda (in addition to the baking powder) will give them just that.If you are not baking with buttermilk, coca, or yogurt, you do not need to add the baking soda.

, Take a look at your recipe. If your recipe already contains salt, about ¼ teaspoon of salt added to your all-purpose flour will do. If your recipe does not contain salt, bump it up to ½ teaspoon of salt.

, Use a whisk or fork to mix them together.

, Keep in mind, however, that store-bought self-rising flour is made from a slightly different wheat. Whatever you are baking will not be quite as tender.

, Note the expiration date on your baking powder. This is when your self-rising flour will expire too. Copy the expiration date from your baking soda into your self-rising flour container., Mix them together using a whisk or fork until they are evenly combined.

, You will need just a little less than 2 teaspoons.Again, make sure that you mix it in well.

, In a separate bowl, combine the baking powder and the salt. You will need about 6 ¾ teaspoons of baking powder and 1 1/8 teaspoon of salt. If you won't be using all of your gluten-free flour mix, use 1½ teaspoon of baking powder and ¼ teaspoon of salt for each cup of flour., Mix the two together using a whisk or fork until everything is evenly combined.

, Take note of the expiration date on your box of baking powder. This is when your self-rising flour will expire. You might want to copy this date down onto the container you will be keeping your flour in. When you are done, put the container in a cool, dark place.

Purchase brown or white rice, depending on the type of flour you want to make.,
Purchase a blender or mixer that cracks grains.,
Fill the container with 1 to 4 cups (240 mL to 960 mL) of rice.,
Mix the rice until the flour consistency is one you like.,
Use the resulting rice flour in gluten-free recipes.,
Store any remaining rice flour in an air-tight container until you are ready to use it again.",How to Make Rice Flour," The more rice you buy at a time, the less expensive the rice flour becomes. If you have a warehouse store in your local area, consider buying the rice in bulk so you can make rice flour in large amounts or in small batches whenever you need it, regardless of quantity. A 25-pound (11.33 kilogram) bag should produce enough rice flour to last for several months.






;
, You need a blender or mixer that works specifically to crack grains; if you have one for wet ingredients, it will not work.








, If you use more than this amount, you could compromise the quality of the resulting rice flour. If you want to make more than this at one time, do it in multiple batches.








, Mix it gradually until you get it as fine as desired. The finer the grain, the better it will work in baked goods because it will not drastically alter the texture of the final product.








, You can also use it to thicken soups, sauces, and gravies. It works as a thickener because it will not allow the liquid to separate from the other ingredients.








, If the flour is not stored in an air-tight container, it may become moldy. You can store it in the freezer to help prevent the mold from forming, but if it is not in an air-tight container, it will absorb moisture and odor from other items. Brown rice flour typically lasts up to 5 months but may spoil sooner if the bran contains a lot of oil. White rice flour, when stored properly, is thought to have an indefinite shelf life.

Blend with brown sugar instead.,
Tint your sugar.,
Mix in spices.",How to Make Powdered Sugar," Keep in mind that sugar can scratch plastic or weak glass.A high-powered blender is the fastest and most effective option, but any blender or spice grinder can do the job.


Spice grinder or coffee grinders — which are essentially the same tool — pick up flavors from the ingredients they grind. Clean it thoroughly before using it for sugar.
Many food processors will not work, possibly due to their large size.You can try it with your machine, but you may end up with superfine sugar, or an uneven mix of superfine and powder.;
, Wipe the inside of your blender or spice grinder with a dry cloth. Any residual moisture from the last rinse will make the sugar stick to the sides., Only blend a maximum of 1 to 1½ cups (200–300g) in an average blender, or 2 cups (400g) in a high-powered one.Any more may block the blades from pulverizing all your sugar. For a spice grinder, just add as much as can comfortably fit, leaving a little space.


For your first try, assume that 1 cup of granulated sugar will make 1 cup powdered sugar. A strong blender may be able to break it down almost to half volume, but it will be easy to grind more if you encounter this ""problem"" of perfectly powdered sugar.

, This step is mandatory for making glazes and icing, as it thickens the sugar into a proper paste. Even for other recipes, the starch will help prevent the powdered sugar from clumping due to moisture absorption. For each cup (200g) sugar, add 1½ teaspoon (7.5mL) cornstarch.


This ratio is very close to the 3% mix used in commercial powdered sugar.While most online powdered sugar instructions call for more cornstarch, the result may behave unpredictably in recipes, or have a poorer taste.
Arrowroot powder is a good substitute for those avoiding corn products.

, Blend or grind for 30–40 seconds, then take a look at the result. Repeat until powder flies up into the blender, and there are no visible crystals (usually 1–3 minutes total blending time). Leave the blender or spice grinder closed until the dust settles.


Blending too long without pause may burn the sugar.

, Sift through a fine mesh to catch clumps. This is especially important if you are making an icing or glaze.


If not using the sugar immediately, just sift right before using it in a recipe.

, In theory, the sugar will last indefinitely. In practice, powdered sugar rapidly picks up moisture in the air. Keep the sealed container in a dry pantry or cupboard to slow the inevitable clumping. Store it away from sources of heat as well, which tend to increase humidity.If the sugar clumps, sift it again before using it in a recipe.

, Although this is possible, the results will not be as fluffy or even as white sugar.Brown sugar has extra moisture content, which can make it difficult to pulverize. Look for ""free-flowing"" brown sugar, or add an extra ½ tsp (2.5mL) cornstarch.Do not use this semi-powdered sugar for icing, as it may turn out grainy and dark-tinted.

, Add color to powdered sugar by mixing in special ""decorating dusts"" available at baking supply stores. Avoid ordinary food coloring, which may dissolve the sugar.If you use the powdered sugar for icing or glazes, just mix in ordinary food coloring to the final result.

, If you decorate baked goods with your sugar or mix it into sweet drinks, add a little flair and flavor. Just toss in cinnamon or your favorite dessert spice into the jar, seal, and shake until blended. To get fancy, look for special powdered flavor extracts at kitchen supply stores.

Bake your kolaches and serve.,
Finished.

",How to Make Kolaches," This is the first step if you are working with active dry yeast. It’s easiest to do this in a measuring cup, because you will be pouring this mixture later. Make sure the yeast is completely dissolved.If you are using instant yeast, you can skip this step and add the instant yeast later.;
, The butter should be softened to room temperature to make this easiest. Pour in the remaining milk, the softened butter, the eggs, the sugar, and salt, as well as the yeast mixture that you created. Then, pour in 1.5 cups of flour and mix everything together thoroughly. If you are choosing to add lemon zest, ground mace, or nutmeg, add that now as well.If you are using instant yeast, you will add that now.
After everything is blended, slowly add the remaining flour. You may use exactly four cups, or you may use a little bit more or less. Just make sure that the dough isn’t too sticky or too dry.

, Lightly coat some space on your countertop or table with flour so that the dough doesn’t stick to it. Work the dough with your fingertips so that it becomes smooth and easy to form. After you’ve done this for about five minutes, roll it into one large ball., Spray a bowl with cooking oil, or pour about a tablespoon of oil into the bottom. Place the large ball of dough into the bowl, and roll it in place so that it’s coated with the oil. Then, it’s time to let the dough rise.Cover your bowl, either with a kitchen towel or with cling wrap. Let it rise in your kitchen (or any warm place) for about two to three hours. You can also let it rise overnight in your refrigerator, if that is easier.

, After the dough has almost doubled in volume, you want to push it down into the bowl and gently knead again. Then put the cover back on, set it aside once again, and let it double in size over about an hour and fifteen minutes. When the time has passed and the dough has risen again, knead it, split it into two halves, and let it rise a final time for about ten minutes. Finally, your dough is ready.Making kolache dough takes patience, but it’s key that it has time to rise fully and bulk up. This creates the chewy, dense dough that kolaches are known for.

, Once again, sprinkle some flour on a flat surface to prevent your dough from sticking to it. Using a rolling pin, flatten out your dough so that it is about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) thick., Each round should be about 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) across. The easiest way to create these rounds is to use a cookie cutter, but you can also use the rim of a proper-sized glass. Press the cookie cutter or the rim of the glass firmly into the dough, and then peel up the dough around the circle.Roll your excess dough into a ball, and then use your rolling pin to flatten it out onto the floured surface again. Cut out the rounds, and then roll the excess dough up again. Continue doing this until you’ve used all your dough.

, You can line your baking sheet with parchment paper or grease it to make sure the dough doesn’t stick to it. Once again, cover the dough with a kitchen towel or cling wrap. Set the baking sheet aside and let the dough rise again for about an hour., Once the dough has risen and each round has doubled in size, it is time to make the indentations in the middle. This step basically makes dough round into a little bowl that will hold the topping as they bake.Use your thumb or a small spoon to press down gently into the center of each round. Make sure that you don’t make the indentations too large – each round should still have about a 0.5 inch (1.27 cm) rim around the perimeter.

, Mix the sugar, cornstarch, and cherry juice in a saucepan. Use a wooden spoon to stir until everything is thoroughly mixed. Put the saucepan on the stove and set it to medium heat. Once the mixture starts boiling and thickening up, turn off the heat and add the pitted cherries., Mix the sugar, cornstarch, salt, blueberries and lemon juice together in a saucepan. Turn the stovetop to medium heat to warm the mixture while continuously stirring. Once the sugar has dissolved, turn the heat on your stovetop down and let the mixture simmer for about ten minutes. The final product should be fairly thick., This one will take a bit longer than the cherry and blueberry toppings. You’ll need to simmer the dried apricots and the orange juice in a saucepan for about half an hour, or until soft. Then, drain the orange juice and put the tender apricots into a food processor to puree with sugar and lemon juice. Once the mixture is nice and smooth, it’s all set., While a fruit topping is the traditional topping, it is certainly not the only one you can make. Other common variations are poppyseed and cream cheese kolaches. You can even make savory kolaches with different types of breakfast meats. Don’t be afraid to get creative!, Set it to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, or 190 degrees Celsius.It’s good to do this before you start adding your toppings to the dough, so that it will be ready to go once you are finished. Depending on your oven, it will take about ten to twenty minutes to preheat.

, Using a pastry brush, brush it generously onto each of the dough rounds., You only need to put about a spoonful onto each of the rounds. The indentation should be completely filled with topping.If you don’t use all of the topping you created, it can be refrigerated for up to three days or frozen to use again next time you prepare kolaches.

, Put your kolaches in the oven and set the timer for 12 minutes. Keep an eye on the kolaches, though, and take them out when the dough has turned golden brown. Use a spatula to remove your kolaches from the hot baking pan and let them cool on a wire rack or another surface. Serve immediately and enjoy!You can store uneaten kolaches at room temperature for about two days after making them. If you won’t eat them for awhile, you can pop them in the freezer and save them for up to three months.

Open two 0.25 ounce (7 g) envelopes of instant yeast and pour it into one side of the bowl. Put 3 tablespoons of sugar and 3/4 teaspoon of salt in the other side of the bowl. Whisk the dry ingredients for about 30 seconds to combine them.You don't want the yeast to come into direct contact with the salt. The salt can stop the yeast from activating.
You can use instant or rapid rise yeast. If you'd like to use active dry yeast, you'll need to activate it in a liquid before adding it to the recipe.;
, Pour the wet ingredients into a small saucepan and heat them on low heat. Check the temperature occasionally and turn it off when the mixture reaches 120 to 130 degrees F (50 to 55 C). You'll need:1 cup (236 ml) water

Spray a 10 to 12-inch (25 to 30-cm) skillet with cooking spray or brush it with olive oil. This will keep the rolls from sticking in the pan.Follow the specific oven temperature on the package of dinner rolls you're using.

, Place about 7 frozen, uncooked dinner rolls in the skillet. The rolls shouldn't be touching. Lay a clean cloth over the rolls and let them prove for one to 2 hours, so they double in size.Proving just lets the dough rest and expand in volume. Try to prove the dough in a warm, draft-free place.

, To make savory rolls, melt 4 tablespoons (57 g) of salted butter. Use a pastry brush to gently spread the butter over the rolls after they've risen. Coarsely chop 1 sprig of fresh rosemary and sprinkle it over the tops of the rolls along with several pinches of coarse sea salt.Save any leftover melted butter for brushing on the rolls after they've baked.

, To make sweet skillet dinner rolls, melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a small prep bowl.

Bake the meringue at a low temperature.",How to Make Meringue," Meringue is made by beating air into egg whites, causing them to gain volume and become light and fluffy. The texture of meringue is best when the air is dry, because the presence of water can weigh it down. On rainy or humid days, the air contains higher water content. That's why meringue is easier to make and gains the right volume and texture when you make it on a dry day, rather than a rainy one.


On rainy days, try beating the meringue longer so it's less likely to collapse.;
, Bowls made from plastic are harder to clean, and they often have traces of oil and other materials that can affect the quality of the meringue. Use clean, dry stainless steel or glass bowls and utensils to make meringue.


Even a drop or two of water can ruin a meringue, so make extra sure the bowl is dry.

, The texture of egg whites changes as the eggs age, becoming thinner. Eggs that are 3 or 4 days old whip up better than those that are extremely fresh. If you get your eggs from the supermarket, chances are they're already a few days old by the time you buy them, so they're probably fine. If you shop at the farmer's market, ask after the eggs' age so you know when to use them., You can use an egg separator or do it by hand. Meringue doesn't require egg yolks, so set those aside and use them to custard or ice cream. The quickest way to separate eggs is to do the following:


Hold an egg over a clean stainless steel or glass bowl.

Crack the egg on the rim of the bowl, letting the white fall into the bowl.
Carefully separate the egg halves and pass the yolk from half to half, letting the white drop down. Continue until the white is in the bowl and all you have left is the yolk.
If you still need practice with this technique, separate each egg into a small container and pour the white into the larger mixing bowl you're using. That way you won't ruin a whole batch of egg whites by accidentally dropping in the yolk of the last egg you crack.

, Room temperature egg whites will get bigger and more voluminous when you whip them. Let them come to room temperature for a few minutes instead of beating them while they're still cold from the refrigerator.

, Use an electric mixer to start beating the egg whites in the mixing bowl. Keep beating them for several minutes, until they foam up and gain volume. Keep going until the whites have formed into soft, floppy peaks that will hold their shape but are in no way stiff.


The egg whites should be in a large, tall bowl and the mixer set to medium-high speed.Beating egg whites by hand is possible, but it takes much, much longer than using a mixer, and it's impossible to achieve the same texture.
If you're making meringue cookies, you'll need to add cream of tartar and other flavorings at this point in the process.

, Keeping the mixer running, add the sugar a few teaspoons at a time. It will slowly dissolve in the egg whites, causing them to become stiff and glossy. Keep adding the sugar until you've used as much as you want, and keep beating until it's dissolved.


Most meringue recipes call for 1/4 cup of sugar for every egg white.
If you want a softer meringue, add less sugar. You can add as little as 2 tablespoons per egg white. For a stiffer meringue, add more sugar. It will give the meringue structure and gloss.

, Eventually the egg whites will stiffen and take on a glossy sheen. Rub a bit of meringue between your fingers; if it's grainy, that means you need to keep beating for a few more minutes to let the sugar finish dissolving. If it's smooth, the meringue is ready to be baked.


Another way to tell if meringue is ready is to dip a spoon in the mixture and hold it upside down; if it slips off the spoon, keep beating. If it sticks, it's probably ready.

, This gives it a little time to set before you top the pie, which will help it stick during the baking process. Here are a few delicious recipes for pies that call for a meringue topping:


Lemon meringue pie
Coconut cream pie
Raspberry meringue pie
Lemon cream pie

, Have the pie crust filled with hot filling ready for the meringue. Spoon it onto the filling and spread it evenly. Keep going until you have a great heap of meringue on top of the pie.


Make sure the meringue completely covers the filling, all the way to the edge of the crust. This helps ensure it won't slide off as it bakes.
Many bakers mound the meringue so that it forms a hill in the middle of the pie. This has a pretty effect when you cut the pie.

, Use the back of a spoon to dip into the meringue and lift it up, allowing it to form curls and peaks. This is a popular way to make the meringue look more decorative.

, Every pie recipe is a little different, but most will tell you to bake the meringue at about 325 °F (163 °C) for 20 or 30 minutes, so it has time to bake and set without burning. It's ready when a cooking thermometer reads 160 degrees.

Become self-aware.,
Practice patience.,
Use humor.,
Look at issues from a different perspective.,
Accept differences.",How to Work With Different Cultures1," If you have never worked with someone from a different culture before, it can be an adjustment. While you might encounter some challenges, you will likely find it a rewarding experience. Your first step is to put yourself in the right frame of mind.Work on becoming more aware of your words and actions. What seems appropriate to you may not be a cultural norm to another person.
Before you give someone at work a high five or a pat on the back, take a moment to consider your actions. Based on what you know about that culture, is touching in the workplace appropriate?
A good rule of thumb is to take a moment to consider your words before you speak. Is what you're about to say possibly offensive? If so, figure out a way to rephrase.;
, It may take awhile for you to get used to working with people from different cultures. Don't worry, that's normal. It probably took you awhile to acclimate to your current co-workers, too.Try not to get irritated if communication takes a little extra effort at first. For example, maybe you are now working with someone whose first language is not English.
Instead of getting impatient if they don't understand your point, try to treat it as a learning experience. Try saying, ""Ok, I can see I'm not making myself clear. How can I help us get on the same page?""
Be patient with yourself, too. It may take you some time to adjust to working with your new co-workers or clients, and that is ok.

, Remember that working in a new environment might be intimidating for someone from a different culture. Whether you are on a conference call, or traveling to meet someone face to face, the initial meeting can feel stilted or awkward. Don't be afraid to lighten the mood.Humor is an excellent way to ease tension in the workplace. It can serve as a way to make people feel comfortable and even more connected to each other.
Remember that different people have different senses of humor. Before making a joke, try to make sure that it won't be construed as offensive.
You can try making a lighthearted joke about something situational. For example, if it's a nasty, rainy day, you can jokingly say, ""Lovely day, isn't it?"" It may not be the most original comment, but things like that can lighten the mood.

, Remember that not everyone will come at a discussion from the same angle. Difference in perspective are coming when working with people from different cultures. Don't assume that you are all looking at the issue from the same perspective.Clarify what important terms mean to each individual. For example, in a meeting you could ask, ""What does efficiency mean to you?""
It's possible that you might think you're working with the same goals in mind, but that you have a different understanding of the process or outcomes. A simple question can help resolve any issues.
Once someone explains their perspective, take some time to reflect. Looking at an issue from an alternate perspective can help you find solutions that you might not have considered.

, Part of choosing the right frame of mind means that you are open to differences. If you go into a new situation aware that people might have different customs than you, you will find it easier to be accepting. Go to work knowing that people from different cultures might work differently than you, and that's to be expected.Be aware that there will likely be differences in communication styles. For example, in some cultures the word ""yes"" means, ""Certainly, I'm in agreement."" To others, the word ""yes"" can mean, ""I heard you.""
Accept that there might be differences in addressing conflict. In some cultures, a face to face conversation might be the norm. For other people, written communication might be more appropriate.
When you encounter differences, be willing to be adaptable. You might need to alter some of your habits in order to make the work relationship more constructive.

"
"
Research different cultures.,
Be willing to make mistakes.,
Learn to be an ally.,
Get to know individuals.,
Make an effort.",How to Work With Different Cultures2," Maybe your company recently expanded its global operations. You might suddenly find yourself working closely with team members from other cultures. Take some time to work on making these relationships stronger.Spend time learning about other cultures. For example, if you are going to be working closely with your Japan office, study up on Japanese work etiquette.
Ask your Human Resources department if they have any resources available. They might be able to direct you towards a helpful website.
Head to the local library. The resource librarian can direct you towards references that can give you a solid overview of the culture you're learning about.

, Don't go into this situation afraid to make errors. If you're overly anxious, you might not speak up and share your ideas. You also won't be able to connect with your new co-workers or clients.Just know that mistakes might happen. You might accidentally try to eat your food incorrectly at a client lunch, for example.
Laugh it off and apologize. These things happen when you are learning new cultural norms.
Say a sincere, ""I apologize."" Then remember your mistake and don't make the same one twice.

, Some of your current colleagues might be uncomfortable working with people from different cultures. That can cause unease and stress in the workplace. Build good relationships with people and learn to be an ally for those from other cultures.One of the most effective ways to be an ally is to show that discrimination will not be tolerated. Stand up for people if someone is saying or doing something offensive.
For example, maybe one of your co-workers makes an offensive comment about the way your new clients from the Middle East dress. Make it clear that that sort of talk is not acceptable.
You can say something like, ""You know, just because these people dress differently, that doesn't make them wrong or somehow less than us. Let's be respectful, ok?""

, When you take time to get to know someone, you can find new ways to strengthen your work relationship. Put some effort into building individual relationships. Your work life will be more productive and pleasant.Don't lump people together in a group. For example, avoid making general comments such as, ""Those Australians don't have the same work hours that we do.""
Instead, say, ""I need to talk to Anna and Steve about how we can resolve this issue."" Thinking of people as individuals is a great way to show respect and build relationships.

, It might feel difficult to learn to work with new people. This can be especially tricky if you have any sort of communication barriers. However, that doesn't mean that it's not worth your effort.Try to make any newcomers feel welcome. Try saying, ""I noticed you bring your lunch. So do I. Do you want to go to the park and eat together tomorrow?""
If you are the newcomer, you can find other ways to make an effort. For example, if you're in a new office, you can ask about customs and traditions.
For example, you can say, ""I noticed that you all seem to support different football teams. Can you tell me a little more about the sport?""

"
"
Listen to stories.,
Ask questions.,
Be sincere.",How to Work With Different Cultures3," One of the best ways to learn about a new culture is by hearing some personal anecdotes. Ask your new co-workers or clients to tell you some stories. Listen with an interested and curious open mind.Perhaps you have some new clients from South Africa. You can ask them to tell you stories about what life is like there.
You can say something like, ""What do you typically do for fun after work?"" Then you can offer examples of your own experiences.
Listening to stories is a great way to form bonds. You'll learn something new, and likely find more commonalities than you expected.

, Learning to communicate better will help you to work with people from different cultures. One of the most important components of effective communication is asking questions. Questions are a great way to clear up differences and also a good way to get to know people.If something is unclear, just ask a question. For example, you could say, ""I noticed that people in this office bow to one another in greeting. Is that something I should do, also?""
Try asking open-ended questions. For example, instead of saying, ""Am I doing this right?"", try asking, ""How can I improve my performance?"" You'll get a more informative answer.
Listen carefully to the answer. When you ask a question, pay attention to the response and try to retain the information.

, It may take some time to learn to work with new people. Make it clear that you are putting in effort. Make it clear that you are sincere in wanting to better your communications.Do something that indicates you are trying. For example, try greeting someone from a different culture in their language.
Most people will appreciate a gesture like that. It won't take much work on your part, but it indicates your sincerity.
Smile. This generally means that same thing in most cultures.
Take time to reflect. If you have had trouble communicating, spend some time asking yourself where the breakdown occurred. Then try to improve tomorrow."

Further, horse meat is often unsafe to eat, and horse slaughter is often tied to air and water pollution, diminished property value, and even increased crime.Since legislators are often interested in representing the views of their constituents, look up any statistics about opposition to horse slaughter in your area. Be sure to share these with your legislator.
If there is a horse slaughter plant or plans to put one in your area, point out your concerns. Be sure to mention pollution, negative impact on property value in the area, and the fact that horse slaughter plants are often associated with increased crime in the areas they operate.;
, Organizations such as the ASPCA and the Humane Society, not to mention PETA, lead coordinated efforts to help end horse slaughter. Their methods include taking action to inform the public about the social, economic, and political components effects of horse slaughter. These organizations also commonly lobby government bodies and legislators, and even protest outside of government building.In fact, organizations such as these are already engaged in many of the steps listed in this article. Joining a larger organization may help ensure that your efforts contribute to your shared goal of ending horse slaughter.

, There are several different methods to make your legislator more aware of horse slaughter. Send e-mails and letters to your legislator’s offices, and call the office directly. You can find their office’s address and phone number on their official government website. Though they may not receive your correspondence first-hand, their staff will inform them of the issues and perspectives that matter to their constituents.Be sure to take advantage of every method of direct contact available. The more correspondence a legislator receives about a particular issue, the more likely they are to address the issue.
Remember to keep your correspondence to the point. Focus on asking your legislator to help ensure horses are protected from slaughter, and that people are not exposed to dangerous horse meat.

, Town hall meetings or other political meetings often allow for members of the community to present an issue. Find out about the date and times of meetings in your city or county. Let the political organization hosting the event know that you plan to attend.Prepare a brief, clear, polite, and research-based statement about the reasons to end the practice of horse slaughter.
Know that you do not need to be a professional about a certain issue to bring it to the attention of your city government.

, Use whichever social media platforms you use to bring horse slaughter to legislators’ attention. For instance, on Facebook, post directly on legislators’ pages. You can also post on your own timeline, and tag multiple legislators in your post. Similarly, tweet your legislators about horse slaughter, urging them to oppose the practice.These tactics will be especially effective immediately preceding a vote on any law regarding horse slaughter.
Post something along the lines of “please support/oppose bill ____, to protect horses and keep our meat supply safe!”
On any platform, use hashtags such as #EndHorseSlaughter.
Your legislators’ social media handles can be found on their government websites.

Prepare for the civil unrest.,
Recognize the legitimacy of martial law.,
Show respect and courtesy to authorities.They are not perfect human beings and mistakes will happen.,
Follow all directives given to you.,
Obey orders as you are instructed.Orders are usually quick and fast and without explanation.,
Help others as much as you are able.",How to Survive Under Martial Law1," Pay attention to current events. Know when potential threats are coming to the area. You may have no warning when another country invades yours.However, you may know if a hurricane or tornado is coming your way. Websites like www.ready.gov are devoted to disaster preparedness.


Stock your home with supplies.Before martial law is enacted, you may be on your own during a breakdown of civil authority. Be ready to survive at least 72 hourswithout help.
Protect your home and business. After civil authority has broken down, people may become opportunistic. Homes and businesses may be looted.Secure your home and business in advance. Board up windows and barricade doors. Stay in your home with your own supplies until military help arrives.;
, For whatever reason, martial law has been declared and you are one of the citizens functioning under it. If your country has been invaded (i.e., your area is still under the protection of your country's military) or a major natural disaster has occurred you should recognize that martial law might be best for moment. The soldiers are there to maintain order and keep you safe until civilian authority can be re-established., The best thing you can do is assist and obey. Keep your head down and don't draw attention to yourself. This isn't the time for political activism if you want to survive.


Keep everything you can't live without on your person. If you are being moved there may be no time to go back for your things. Have everything you need on you at all times in case you have to move immediately. Anything you might be tempted to go back for, keep on you. If there is some object too big to carry around you may have to leave it.
In rare situations you may be able to hide something special until you are able to come back for it. You may want to consider burying a ""time capsule"" in a waterproof container to retrieve when you return.

, No matter how odd or strange it is best to do as you are told. If a curfew is set, be in your quarters by then. If you are given a meal time, don't think you will be served if you show up late even if you are hungry. If certain areas are off-limits, do not go exploring beyond the boundary. Your rights are greatly limited until civil order is re-established so don't push your boundaries if you want to survive.


If you are under martial law in a country that you know intends to do you harm (e.g., Jewish Germansor Japanese-Americansduring World War II) you may want to consider hiding from the government instead of being a good citizen.
You may want to learn military time.Some watches and phones can be adjusted to show military time automatically. In general, times are written out differently such that 9:00AM (""nine o'clock AM) becomes 0900 (""zero nine hundred) and 3:30PM (""three-thirty PM) becomes 1530 (""fifteen thirty). In other words, PM times are 12 greater than normal and times are described as if they are four-digit whole numbers without the colon with the hour always represented as two numbers (don't drop leading zeros). Hours may be referred to in ""hundreds"" but never ""thousands"".

, Resisting or forcing an explanation may be dangerous. Military personnel may be given orders they don't even understand. They expect you to follow orders just as they are doing. Time sensitive orders they may not have time to explain or their explanation may cause a panic. Trust that their goal is to protect you and any failure they would take personally.

, The military personnel may be short staffed. Offer to help as much as you can. You will garner their respect this way. You may then learn more about what's going on and why things are happening as they are. If you find out important information that you have permission to share, spread the word. Make sure other people know what's going on and hopefully everyone will be able to survive the event.

Stay up to date on current events.,
Identify what you care about.,
Research the current event.,
Read other people's satire.,
Know your audience.",How to Write Satire About Current Events1," In order to write satire about current events, you will need to understand the major issues of the day. Read newspapers, blogs and websites that chronicle the news of the day and offer commentary. Watch television as well, especially news stations such as CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and CNBC.


Developments in current events change and evolve quickly, and with the instant online access, your audience will know the news as it happens.
The more knowledge you have about current events, the easier it will be to identify topics to write about.;
, Your topic should stem from something that you have a personal interest in. As you read or watch current events, notice anything that you do not like, that makes you angry, that you believe is wrong, or that you would like to change. These are the topics that you should write about.Also look for inconsistencies, hypocrisy, cover-ups, or inappropriate words or actions as a potential topic. For example, a candidate during a political debate may make disparaging comments about immigration, yet the candidate's parents are immigrants. That inconsistency could be a topic for a satirical writing.
Your interest is necessary because you will be researching, thinking and writing about the current event. If you do not have strong feelings about your topic, it will be very difficult for you to write about it.Choose a current event that is visible and well known. This will make it easier for you to connect with your audience. If you use a current event that people are unaware of, they will have a hard time understanding the satire because they will have no idea what you are talking about., In order for you to write about a current event, you must have a thorough understanding of the event. Have a critical approach as you do your research. You want to understand all aspects of an issue and the different viewpoints of the event.


For example, if you plan to write about a case that is up before the Supreme Court, you would research the history of the case, the defendant and the plaintiff's point of view, similar cases and precedents, the general public's perception of the case, etc.
Never take the current event at face value. Always dig deeper.

, Satire is a unique style of writing and requires a different way of thinking. Reading satire can help you grasp a better understanding for your own writing.Critique the writings that you read by asking yourself some of the following questions:What is the satire about?
Who is the intended audience?
What are the author's motives?
What additional ways could you satirize this topic?
Is the satire warranted?
Go back and watch episodes of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report as another way to learn about satire. Also visit The Onion website. This is an online satirical newspaper.

, Satire is only funny if your audience thinks that it is funny. Find out the intended audience of your work before you begin to write. What resonates with college students will not resonate with elderly retirees.If you are planning to submit your work to a particular publication, ask the editor about the target audience of the publication.
If you are not sure who the audience is, try to write in a more general tone.

Inform your online followers.,
Contact media organizations.,
Volunteer with a horse rescue organization.,
Take it to the streets!",How to Work to Stop Horse Slaughter2," Use your social media platforms to tell your friends and family about the reality of horse slaughter. On Facebook, post on your timeline and the pages of friends who you think will be interested in joining your efforts. Whatever platform you use, post photos, videos, or facts, and urge those viewers to help stop horse slaughter as well.For example, post something like “Join our efforts to protect horses and keep our meat supply safe! Help us end a terrible and dangerous practice.”
Use hashtags such as #EndHorseSlaughter.
Include informative of engaging content, such as facts, videos, or infographics. Encourage viewers to repost this content. The Humane Society, as well as the ASPCA make resources freely available for this purpose.

, The best way to inform the public is by getting prominent news organizations to cover the issue of horse slaughter. Write an op-ed to your newspaper, local television station, and radio station. Remember to include each of the key points you’ve identified about horse slaughter, or cite facts provided by the Humane Society or another recognizable organization.Include links to videos and other marketing material that news organizations might want to feature.
Local or national animal rights organizations will be happy to help with media relations. They will help you prepare a statement, and their support may help you get more coverage.

, Find a horse rescue facility in your area and submit a volunteer application. Expect to be tasked with cleaning, feeding, and grooming horses if you have experience doing so. You can also help by assisting with fundraising and organizing other volunteers.If you do not have time to volunteer at a horse rescue facility, considering donating money or other resources.
Contact the Homes for Horses Coalition or the ASPCA for help locating an organization you can work with or donate to.

, Old school activism tactics still work in mobilizing energy, participation, and resources. Hand out flyers or hang posters on college campuses or other places where people may be interested. Set up an information booth at a local food or art market.


Consider protesting peacefully at facilities where horse slaughter takes place. You may also want to protest as places that use horse meat or other body parts to produce food or other goods.

Note the global nature of horse slaughter.,
Recognize that horse meat is not safe to eat.,
Familiarize yourself with specific examples.",How to Work to Stop Horse Slaughter3," Many large, economically powerful governments have outlawed horse slaughter. This includes both the European Union and the United States. However, horse slaughter still occurs in some countries, and the meat that is produced is often sent to other countries for human consumption.For instance, the Safeguard American Food Exports (SAFE) Act has been passed in the U.S. This law prohibits horse slaughter, as well as the export of horses to be slaughtered.

, Put simply, horses aren’t raised to be eaten. In fact, horse slaughter adds dangerous meat to human food supplies. Since horses are commonly raised for work, sport, and human companionship, the food they eat and medications they take are not regulated by food production laws. This makes the meat derived by horse slaughter extremely dangerous for humans to eat.There is no regulatory system that monitors what horses have consumed or have been treated with when they are sold to be slaughtered.
Though it is increasingly uncommon, horse meat is occasionally eaten as a traditional food, or in cases where other meats are scarce. Fortunately, this often occurs in countries where these horses are less likely to have been treated with the dangerous chemicals or medications.

, Several substances that are toxic to humans are commonly provided to horses. These include medications and/or supplements that are either known to be dangerous to people, or have not been tested for their effects upon people. In fact, more than fifty substances provided to horses have been banned for use on animals meant for human consumption.In particular, a pain reliever called Phenylbutazone, or “Bute,” is commonly provided to horses, and has been tied to potentially fatal human illnesses.
Meat from horses is often tainted with chemicals used in fly sprays and deworming medication.
Horses that are used for racing are also commonly given illegal drugs, including steroids, and sometimes even cobra venom."

Establish a survival bunker in a hidden location.This bunker should be able to keep you and your family safe for several years.,
Stock your survival bunker with supplies.Everything you would need for several years worth of living.,
Get to your survival bunker as quickly as possible.,
Keep a radio on hand to keep track of when martial law has ended.,
Stay in your bunker until you are sure it is safe to leave.",How to Survive Under Martial Law2," The best bunkers are usually underground. Many are underground but in the sides of mountains or hills. The goals is to be able to get in and out but for no one else to be able to find you.


Keep your bunker secretby never carrying your phone or GPS enabled device with you when you visit. Even when you turn your GPS off, you may still be tracked with cell phone tower signals. Don't discuss your plans with anyone outside your family and resist the temptation to ""show off"" on social media.

, This will include food, water, and medicine. You can consult a survival guide or book to determine the best setup. Think about everything you and your family uses frequently over the course of a year and make sure you have everything you absolutely need.


Some items such as medicines may be difficult to acquire by legitimate means. Proper storage may also be difficult. Favor solid form pills over liquids as their shelf life tends to be longer even after the expiration date.Store medicine in a cool dry place to extend potency, and remember that taking drugs after their expiration date is rarely harmful.

, If you are going to stay ahead of the military you will need to move fast. As soon as martial law is declared you may not have time to discuss what to do next. You may think the military isn't there yet but local law enforcement may start implementing martial law beforehand. Have everything you want or need in your survival bunker and move there as soon as humanly possible.

, Most likely you will not be able to stay in your bunker forever. You will need to keep contact with the outside world.You need to know when it will be safe to emerge. Since batteries degrade, you may want to use a survival radio that incorporates a hand-crank for power.Be cautious of pro-military propaganda. Know what frequencies local militias are broadcasting on and any code words. Don't listen to just anything but wait until the militias give you the OK that civil authority has been restored.

, The hardest part of hiding is the isolation. However, each time you step out of the bunker may risk the fate of your whole family. Someone may see you entering or exiting your bunker. You may accidentally leave tracks or human scent near the entrance. Search dogs may then be able to find you. Stay in your bunker as long as you possibly can before emerging.


If you are in your bunker for a long time, prioritize your food based on expiration date. Eat whatever might expire soon first.

Have a go-bag ready for the day martial law is declared.If you think martial law is going to be enacted by any military force hostile to you then you should consider being ready.,
Stash guns, ammo, supplies, and survival gear in a hidden bunker.This will be your family's rally point when martial law happens.,
Know the rally point established by the local militia.,
Group up with your militia as soon as humanly possible.,
Establish a chain of command and follow orders.Until now a military chain of command may have been hypothetical or loosely enforced.,
Stay with your militia as you move to a safe location.",How to Survive Under Martial Law3," Will you have a better chance resisting or submitting? Have a go-bag with all the supplies you need to make it from where you are to where you are supposed to be.


Your go-bag should be light but fully stocked. Estimate how far you may ever be from your bunker to determine what you need for your bag. You should favor small and light items as you may be carrying the bag. This includes basic survival gear and food in case you have to walk or hike to your bunker., Be sure to include everything you will need to wait out the storm. Your bunker should be equipped such that once you go in, you won't need to leave for supplies for months. If you have valuables you don't want to leave behind, go ahead and store them in your bunker in advance. You may not have time to go home to pack before the military rolls into town.


Stocking your bunker with supplies can be difficult and cost-prohibitive. Start with a 72-hour setup for natural disaster preparedness.Then move toward a two-week day bomb shelter.Once you get the hang of it, increase to however long you think you'll need.

, Most likely you are not the only person or family to see what's coming. Other people are likely getting ready for the military to take over. Become part of your local militia and find out what your plans are to resist a malevolent military. You may need to be quick in attacking local supply depots and establishing an effective resistance.

, Once you have your own home base established with your family protected, be ready to move. Militias survive as long as there are enough people to protect strategic locations. Your militia will need all the manpower they can get. Take a few supplies and rations but leave most of it in your bunker. Your militia should have their own hidden stockpilesof supplies if they will ever be successful.


Be careful not to reveal your home base or inventory of supplies to your militia. If the militia crumbles you need a safe place to fall back to. If your militia is in danger, they may see your home base as a supply depot leaving you and your family in jeopardy.

, Now its time to follow orders without question. Establish the leadership structure and who you must report to and who reports to you. Most likely there will be people in your ranks with prior military experience. Their expertise will be crucial to maintaining order.

, If you survive and fight long enough, you may need to move to another safe location. This may be a retreat or you may be grouping up with other local militias to form a larger resistance force. You may be moving to re-establish civil authority. Regardless, if the supplies of your bunker are running out your options are limited. You will likely not be alone in this respect. You will need to move with the militia to a safe location to continue resisting the government long term.

Write with your goal in mind.,
Incorporate humor.,
Use irony.,
Exaggerate to make a point.",How to Write Satire About Current Events2," You are using satire to make a point about the current event. Your entire essay is structured around this point. Your goal might be to raise awareness for an issue or improve upon a problem. If you are not clear about your motivation for writing, your writing will seem all over the place and will be difficult for your readers to understand.Help the audience to consider problems they might not have been aware of by poking fun at those problems or addressing the terrible solutions that are currently in place.
Inspire your readers to act. There should not be a specific call to action in your writing, but using your words and humor to encourage people to change the way they think or act is part of well-written satire.
Always support your opinions with facts. This will help your readers to see the point you are making.

, Satire should be fun and make the reader laugh.The combination of humor and critique is what makes satirical writing unique. Think about things that are relatable to your intended audience and that pull from knowledge about your current event. Ask yourself, what do the readers need to know to understand the joke that I am making?
The title of your article can be sarcastic and funny as well.

, Irony is a technique commonly used when writing satire. When using irony you would show some inconsistency between what is said and what is really meant, what is expected to happen and what actually happens, or what is meant and what people understand.An example of irony would be someone getting rich and never working a day in their life.
Another example of irony is telling a person that you love his or her shoes when in reality you think the shoes are terrible. You and your audience are aware that you do not like the shoes, but the person wearing the shoes actually thinks that you were giving a compliment.

, Taking something out of its normal context to show how ridiculous or absurd it is can be used to make your point as well. It should be obvious to the audience that you are exaggerating. Exaggeration is even more effective if you keep a serious tone throughout your writing and do not use any joking language.


For example, Jonathan Swift wrote a satirical writing about the famine in Ireland in the 1700's. His solution to the famine was for poor people to sell their babies to the rich people so the rich people could eat and the poor people would have money. Eating children is obviously a ridiculous solution to a famine and would not solve the root problem.
This exaggeration highlighted how badly the government treated poor people and the negative lens that rich people viewed the poor people in the country.

Understand libel.,
Make it clear that it your writing is satirical.,
Use good taste.",How to Write Satire About Current Events3," If you are publishing your work, you may be concerned about possible legal ramifications for what you are writing. Satire makes fun of and mocks people, institutions, and businesses. It is inevitable that people may find your work offensive or harmful and pursue legal action.


Writers in the United States are protected by the constitutional right to free speech. However this is not a guarantee in other countries. Be aware of the laws and regulations when you are writing outside of the United States.The victim must prove that your writing was an act of malice., It should be clear to the audience that you are not writing actual news and reporting facts. Your use of exaggeration, humor, and over the top language will indicate that you are writing satire. You could also include a disclaimer with your writing to avoid any legal action.Consider using fictional names or names that are close to the real names of people instead of using real names.
Publishing your satirical piece close to the time of the current event will also be helpful. This way the event is still on people's minds.

, There is a fine line between being funny and being offensive. It is expected that your writing will rub some people the wrong way, but you to do want to write things that are in poor taste. Do not purposely inflame religious, racial or social tensions.For example, it is more acceptable to write satire about a group that you are a member of. If you are a working mother, it may be more acceptable for you to write about the problems with maternity leave than a single man with no children.
It may be helpful to have someone that you trust read your writing before you share it with a larger audience.

Get off the Internet completely.,
Delete your information from data mining sites.,
Protect yourself from identity theft.",How to Stay off the Government's Grid1," You will have to go back to the 1980s style of living. The Internet is a key way that companies gather your personal information. It's not just the government. It might be data mining sites or an abusive ex you want to hide from (in the case of the latter, seek help from a shelter or law enforcement).Get off social media. You can’t stay off the government grid if you have a social media presence. That’s just the bottom line. You will have more privacy if you reduce your Internet footprint. Delete your old social media accounts.
Even privatized accounts can be accessed. Don’t friend or follow people you know or you can be traced. Don’t shop online or bank online. Just don’t be online, period. If you feel you must, privatize your accounts and reduce your time spent on the Web.;
, It's rather shocking how much personal information is available online about people, from their addresses to their familial connections.


There are many paid sites online that will delete much of this information for you. Some data mining sites also have a process for you to ask for your data to be removed. This can be very time consuming, but it can be worth it. Step one is to Google yourself to see what's already out there.
The sites tend to have different processes for removal of information. Some will require letters and faxes. Most have a process to do so. Use a post office box to prevent the sites from getting your address in the future (although be aware they often purchase addresses from public records.)

, It's not just the government that may collect your personal information; you may want to protect your privacy from data mining and other sites.


Change your passwords frequently, and don't respond to spamming requests that demand your personal information.Destroy private information with a shredder. Memorize your social security number, and keep it in a safety deposit box or safe instead of carrying it with you.

Familiarize yourself with the different forces.,
Understand the threat to their lives.,
Remember their sacrifice.,
Be a good citizen.,
Support the forces.,
Be patriotic but build bridges between national and international communities.",How to Support Your Nation's Armed Forces," There are more than one department or group which work to ensure the safety of the country. Most nations have an air force, naval force and army, and many also have marines, coast guards, and other forces. Research your nation's forces and understand what they do; you'll be able to offer better support and respect to your military and veterans if you understand their roles.;
, Understand the training they undergo to be equipped enough to take charge. They live each day carrying a heavy responsibility on their shoulders. They must stay vigilant and be ready to serve their nation on any given day of their service.

, They leave home both for training and actual deployment to serve the nation. Everyday poses a threat to them. Many suffer physical injuries during service, and many are affected by the psychological and emotional impact of deployment. They are humans who are subject to fear, homesickness and care. Yet their focus in life changes from their home to their homeland, and they follow the orders handed down to them to protect that homeland. This is a sacrifice worthy of respect, even in instances where your don't agree with the politics behind their deployment. Remember the individual sacrifices they make, no matter what.

, Be a law abiding individual and do what you can to make your community a better place. In order to repay your nation's or the world's forces, respect their sacrifice and keeping the peace and order at home. If they're working abroad to protect your safety, you can help ensure safety and harmony at home.



Be a good world citizen and help your community.

Support those in your community who need help. Help senior citizens, children, and families in need. Volunteer. Get involved in peaceful protest and legislative action to make your community a better place.

Pay it forward. Be a good person, and spread gratitude and happiness. Even small actions that make society a better place, can make a better home for your armed forces to return to.

Prevent war and be a pacifist. Take action to stop war; if you disagree with a war, get involved in peaceful protests, and take action to convince your local representatives to lobby against it. Don't blame individual members of the armed forces for following orders. Take part in the efforts to change those kinds of orders, instead.

, Do as much as you can to help the nation's military members and their families. Whether through personal support and interactions, donations, or ideology, there are many ways to take action and offer support:



Support deployed soldiers. With some programs, you can even ""adopt"" a deployed soldier. This sign of support and appreciation from back home can mean a great deal to deployed members of the armed forces.

Support their families and spouses. Help them survive their partner's military deployment. If you live near a military base, see if they have a community relations department; contact them and find out how you can help.

Support the troops during the holidays. This can be an especially difficult time to be deployed.

Help veterans and show your respect to them. Members of the armed forces need your help even after their service. Get involved with organizations that provide healthcare, job training, and other opportunities to veterans.

Support your local police, too.

, The armed forces are made up of people of all different backgrounds. They're keeping you safe, even if their ethnicity, beliefs, or ideologies are different from yours; in return, embrace their diversity and the diversity in your community. Practice patience and be tolerant towards people regardless of any differentiating factors.


Show your patriotism: stand up for your national anthem and participate in other customs to show respect for your nation.
Respect the armed forces and customs of other nations when you can, too. Being patriotic doesn't have to mean building animosity with other nations. Take pride in your country and your armed forces, but support your allies and other peaceful nations, too. After all, if we didn't have so much world conflict, we wouldn't need so many members of our armed forces to endure deployment.

Pay less money in taxes to the government.,
Use your own power.,
Don’t drive much.,
Vary your routine.,
Watch your reading and viewing habits.,
Live for free.",How to Stay off the Government's Grid2," There are ways you can reduce government's interference in your checkbook at tax time!


Contribute money to a 401K account or IRA. Don't pay off your student loans. You will be able to deduct the student loan interest.Buy a house, contribute to charity, take college classes, save your receipts, and have your taxes done by a professional who knows tax laws better than you do.

, In the most simplistic sense, living off the grid can mean not connecting into government provided electricity. Survive on your own.



Solar energy or your own generator can provide power instead.Try not to use light at night. Perhaps use candles.
Make your own food by gardening. Settle on land that offers available water so you don’t need to depend on government for water., In urban areas especially, surveillance cameras and police devices are able to track your movements through your vehicle’s license plate. Get rid of the GPS device in your car.


Instead, walk or ride a bicycle when you can. In addition, avoid toll roads, toll bridges and HOV lanes because they are monitored with surveillance cameras. Take a cab and pay cash. Rental car information can be tracked.
Avoid parking in garages and lots with surveillance cameras and, if you use public transit, buy the ticket from the machine instead of using a new card payment system.Avoid driving on interstate highways.

, Don’t take the same exact route every time you go to the store or to work. Mix up your routine.


Don’t get deliveries to your home because that will create a record. Use maps instead of GPS. Buy a shredder to shred all paper documents when you are done with them.
Get a post office box so that purchases can’t be traced back to your home. This will make it harder for the government to trace you, not just data mining sites.

, Ordering streaming videos from a service like Netflix can put you on the grid. Instead, order DVDs. Get a game console with single player games so you don't need Internet.


Don’t order books from the library with a library card as these can also be traced. If you really want to disappear, get rid of all trophies and old personal items.

, Earn so little as to be exempt from paying taxes (and consider freeganism to survive). Squat for somewhere to live.


Alternatively, Live in the Wilderness or Survive in the Woods. Make sure you are paid in cash, or cryptocurrency like bitcoin.
Settle in a mid-sized city in a place that is not overly cold. Bigger cities have too many cameras and smaller towns won’t let you disappear enough. "

Get rid of your cell phone.,
Use pre-paid phones.,
Use gift cards for purchases.,
Cancel any bank accounts.",How to Stay off the Government's Grid3," It’s going to be hard to stay off the grid if you’re using a cell phone. Law enforcement can triangulate and track your cell signal.


It’s the built-in GPS in cell phones that makes you easy to track. Even if you don’t make a call, you can be tracked because cell phones and towers are constantly connecting with each other.
You can also take the battery out of the phone. Or leave the phone somewhere if you want to throw people off.

, Instead of a cell phone, use pre-paid phones that you can buy cheaply at department stores or gas stations.


Give the person you want to talk to another pre-paid phone, and only talk using those phones. For now, you don’t even need an ID in most states to purchase a pre-paid phone.
Use a pre-paid calling card for an extra layer of protection when using the pre-paid phone instead of dialing directly with it.

, If you have a credit card, you can be traced. It’s better to use credit card gift cards, and use those for purchases.


You can buy these cards, by big name companies like Visa and American Express, in many department and even grocery stores. You just throw them away when you use up the balance.
There’s no statement attached to these cards, and you don’t provide your personal details when you buy them or use them.

, Use cryptocurrency like bitcoin or a pre-paid card paid for in cash. Or just try to use cash more than you currently do now.


If you decide not to go that far and want to keep a bank account, do not use credit or debit cards, and do not do online banking.
Be aware that banks are filled with surveillance cameras and transactions greater than $10,000 can be tracked by the government. So take out cash in small increments.

Encrypt your emails.,
Get rid of your computer’s hard drive.,
Hide your IP Address.,
Fill the Internet with wrong information.,
Change your appearance and habits.",How to Stay off the Government's Grid4," First, set up a new email account in a different name. Try to use Gmail from Google because it defaults to using SSL encryption.


If you want to encrypt the messages you send using any email, though, you can use tools like Encipher.it, with is an encryptor that you install. It allows you to give the text an encryption key before you send it.
You will need to give the person on the other end of the email the key if they want to decipher the message.

, You can do this by boiling it and then smashing it with a hammer before discarding it.Buy a new computer (do not buy refurbished), wipe the OS and replace it with SSH, or linux-based OSs like Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, or Kali.
Encrypt the hard disk with a strong password using Truecrypt, and use the hidden drive feature. Never connect it to the Internet.

, Better yet: Stay offline completely. This is your best chance at not having a footprint. If you must go online, try to hide your IP address.


Do this by using a proxy server like Tor. It routes your webpage requests through many Internet routers. Some of these services get federal money, as it has turned out, so they may not be foolproof, though.You can also try other Web-based proxy servers like Proxify or the Ghostery extension available on Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.Do Internet searches at public libraries so the searches can’t be traced back to your IP address at all.

, People find you and find out information about you through the Internet.


You can put misinformation out there on social networks and so forth, making it harder to tracers to find you.Loyalty cards given out by places like supermarkets for discounts will also put you on the grid., If you’re trying to completely vanish, adopt a different look, including a different hair color.


Drive a car that is the opposite of what would be expected. Change your lifestyle. Work as a janitor if you used to be a CEO, for example.
Break all of your normal patterns, including where you eat, where you shop, and the kind of work you do. Live a simple life so you don’t stand out."

Write editorial letters to the local newspaper.",How to Start a Local Petition," For a local petition drive, you will need to begin by understanding the important issues in your community. Read your local newspapers. Attend sessions of your city council or other local legislative body. Find out what people are saying or thinking about your issue., As you narrow your focus on your topic, contact leaders in your community to learn more. You should identify those people who may have some influence over your particular topic. You also need to learn what steps may already be in place to address the changes you have in mind.For example, if you are concerned with some issues relating to the use of public parks in your community, you may not need to start by talking with the mayor of your city. You might get more direct attention and positive results by speaking with the director of the Parks Department.
Ask these leaders if anyone has identified the same problem that you see. Find out if they are doing anything about it or if they have any plans to address the problem in the future. If they appear receptive to making change, then you may not need a petition. However, if you find that they do not seem to care, then the petition drive may be needed.

, As you identify a problem area, discuss it with people you know in town. Find out if they share your concerns. You won’t want to spend a great deal of time on a petition drive if you are not already confident that a need exists and people share your opinion.At this level, your conversations can be fairly informal. Just ask, ""What do you think about the noise levels on Friday nights? Don't you agree that we should try to get the city to do something about it?"" You could start sharing some data and information on the topic, if you have it.

, You may want to organize small community gatherings or discussion groups to talk about the problem. Invite some friends to your house or see if you can use a local church, library or community center to hold a small meeting. The purpose of any such meeting will be to discuss the problem and gauge the level of interest and concern among other community members.If possible, invite relevant community leaders to attend. For example, the Director of the Parks Department might come to talk about new regulations for dog walking in public parks.
You can start a meeting like this with, ""I have asked you all to come together to discuss our need for another library branch in this town. I think we need someone to take action, but I want to hear what you think."" As the discussion goes on, you can then begin measuring support for a petition drive by asking, ""How many of you would be willing to help me gather signatures to show the city that we are serious about this?""

, Ask whether the city is taking any steps already focused on the problem you have identified. You don’t want to waste time preparing a petition and then starting a signature drive, only to find out that the city has already reviewed the issue and plans to start some changes in the near future., The first thing people will see and hear is the title of your petition. If you use something that attracts attention, you can get more people to stop and agree to sign. Keep your title brief and use strong verbs that tell people what you want to do.Some examples of powerful petition titles are, ""Stop Torturing Chickens for McNuggets"" or ""Donate Recalled Cheerios to Those in Need.""

, You need a few statements that clearly explain what you want to change in your community. People who sign it and the leaders who will receive it need to understand exactly what you want. You may begin, for example, with a clear statement like, “We, the undersigned petitioners, believe that Smallville needs a separate park where dog owners can allow their pets to run freely. We call on the City Council to identify a location and provide fencing for such a park.”, You need to give the community leaders a reason for what you want. A long list of signatures is powerful, but strong reasoning can be even more persuasive. If you have any research or examples of other communities that have taken similar action, provide this information.You may say something like, “Several surrounding communities, including Gotham, Silver City, and Old York have created dog parks within the past two years.”
You might also include persuasive statistics or data, such as, “Communities that have created designated dog parks have seen a 10% decrease in incidents of dog bites.”

, Some jurisdictions will only accept petitions on an official form. Others will accept any format. You should check with your city clerk or other similar official to find out what is required. If you must use a specific form, ask where you can get it and find out if you are allowed to make photocopies or if you must use only original forms.

, If you only want to present a petition that states opinions, you probably have fewer requirements to follow. But if you are using a petition drive as a way to force a ballot question, for example, you probably have to abide by certain strict requirements. Some of these requirements may include:The minimum number of signatures you need for the petition to be valid.
The use of specific forms or petition sheets.
Whether you need printed names along with signatures.
Whether you must include addresses for each signer, or any other information, and whether signers must live within a certain geographical location.
Deadlines for submitting the petitions to be considered on an upcoming ballot.

, If you search online for ""create petition,"" you will find a variety of free petition services. Some of these provide templates that you can use to draft and print your own petition forms. Some of them actually help you set up your own online petition drive. (You will need to verify that an online petition will be accepted before using this format.), Based on your local rules for petition drives and the size of your community, you will need to establish goals and expectations for gathering names. As a general rule, you should aim to collect up to 50% more names than the minimum requirement., You cannot expect to conduct a successful petition drive on your own. Determine the number of signatures that you need, and then calculate a reasonable number for each person to collect. Using these figures, you can decide how many volunteers you will need for the petition drive.For example, suppose you decide that you want 5,000 signatures for a successful petition drive. A single volunteer might be expected to bring in 500 signatures over the length of your petition drive. This means that you should get at least ten people to help collect signatures.

, Each volunteer will need several copies of the official petition sheet, sufficient numbers of pens to collect signatures, and clipboards. You may also want to set up information stations around town with promotional materials as well. Discuss the cause fully with all your volunteers, to ensure that they all fully understand the issue and are ready to discuss it when they ask people to sign the petition., Your volunteers should not approach the same people repeatedly to gather signatures. Organize the signature drive by giving volunteers assigned locations. These may be fixed stations, such as a table outside the grocery store or train station. You may also assign people to particular streets or neighborhoods to visit door-to-door. It is also a good idea to arrange common times for collecting signatures., Collect the completed petitions and deliver them to the appropriate government office. When your petition drive is complete, find out where you need to send the petitions, and have them delivered. If you do not know, you should probably begin by contacting the city clerk’s office for information.If your petition is directed to a particular department of your local government, you may be directed to deliver your final copies directly to that department.

, If a member of your group is particularly adept at using social media, you may be able to create an online petition. This would serve to bring wider attention to your issue. It also can reach many people much more quickly than physical contact with volunteers.For example, Facebook provides useful materials about creating and marketing an online petition. It provides links to features that help you create a petition, share it with a wide audience, and collect e-signatures without ever having to speak directly with anyone.

, Depending on the breadth of your audience and the topic of your petition, an online petition may not be useful. You should check with your local government leaders to find out if they will accept virtual e-signatures from an online petition.

, When you know of specific dates that you will be conducting your signature drive, you should notify the local paper. A letter to the editor can both generate support for your issue and advertise your signature drive. Provide information that will help the public find your information stations and that will make them want to sign your petition.


For example, you could use a brief letter like, “Dear Editor, We have a strong need for a new dog park in our town. Surrounding towns have already recognized the need and have taken action, and we are behind. A group of concerned citizens will be collecting signatures on a petition in front of the train station on Saturday morning from 8 to 12. Everyone is encouraged to come lend their support and sign a petition.”

Find a central theme around which to organize your revolution.,
Identify a need for reform.,
Create concrete goals.,
Come up with a plan to secure resources.",How to Start a Revolution1," If you’re a Marxist, this may be a central belief that capitalism is the root of all evils because it exploits the working class.


You need to find such a central truth, whatever the revolution you are seeking. Find a way, in a simple sentence, to articulate your cause as a theory. Find a common purpose, and define it. Create a clear and eloquent message. What does your revolution stand for? What does it want to accomplish and why? Create a simple and powerful message that you can push out consistently.You will want a cause that connects to people’s deepest passions and their sense of right and wrong. Anchor this in what really matters and how it will create a better world.;
, You can only build your case for change if you articulate why the present is broken. In addition to theory, you can do this by seizing on a specific need or concern that is backed up with data.


Essentially, you are trying to articulate the reasons that change is necessary. Perhaps you want to change a single institution, like a school. Target a need or concern that is high profile and compelling. To use the educational example, this might be a high drop-out rate.Perhaps you want to change a government. If you can explain specifically how that government is letting people down – or endangering the environment or something specific like that – people will rally more to your cause.

, It’s helpful for the revolution to know what it’s seeking to change. Legislation? A system of government itself? A simpler shaping of minds about a certain concept, like environmentalism?


Breaking down the goals into smaller changes can help the revolution make actual change faster. For example, you might wish you could eliminate poverty throughout the world, but helping some local families in poverty might be a better place to start. You will see effects immediately.You will need an action plan. This should be a written and/or visual model that can include responsibilities, activities, and timelines. Don’t just wing it. Sit down and plan. Measure progress, and use data constantly.

, Perhaps you will need operational support. You will need people who are willing to donate money or time to the cause.


Having a funding backer could be useful. Access to raw materials can also help. You will need to fund basic costs that you might not think of on the front end, such as postage, printing, permit costs, and a website. Seek donations.
You need partners. People with resources (people, intellectual, financial or otherwise) who can join in and assist the organization. Don't try to do it yourself.

Consult with an estate lawyer.,
Remember SPLC in your will.,
Leave assets in a revocable living trust.,
Create a charitable remainder trust.,
Purchase a charitable annuity.,
Give SPLC a life insurance policy.,
Contribute retirement assets.",How to Support the Southern Poverty Law Center2," Before changing your will or creating a trust, you should meet with a lawyer. You want to fully understand the consequences of changing your estate plan to include the SPLC. Your lawyer can also revise your will or trust to include whatever gift you make.


You can get a referral to an estate planning lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association, which you can find here: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx

Also see Select an Estate Planning Attorney for more information.

, Leaving assets to SPLC in a will is the most common planned gift. You can leave many kinds of gifts to SPLC in your will, such as the following:A specific bequest. You can leave a specific dollar amount or specific asset by adding the following language: “I give to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc., a non-profit organization located at 400 Washington Avenue, Montgomery, Alabama 36104, the sum of 1,000 dollars.”

A residual bequest. Whatever assets you don’t specifically leave to beneficiaries becomes part of your residuary estate. You then name beneficiaries to this residuary. If you want to add SPLC as a beneficiary, then include this language: “I give to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc., a non-profit organization located at 400 Washington Avenue, Montgomery, Alabama, 36104, 50% of the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, both real and personal property of whatever kind and wheresoever situated.”

A contingent bequest. If one of your beneficiaries dies before you, you can name SPLC as the backup. You would include this language: “If any of the above-mentioned beneficiaries predecease me, I give his or her share of my estate to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc., a non-profit organization located at 400 Washington Avenue, Montgomery, Alabama 36104.”

A life income bequest. Your beneficiary can receive income from the property. Upon their death, the SPLC gets the property.

, A trust is a legal entity which you transfer assets to. A trustee then manages the assets on behalf of the beneficiaries. You can choose to name SPLC as a beneficiary in your living trust.Like wills, a revocable living trust can be changed in your lifetime.
With a trust, you can avoid probate. At your death, the trustee distributes the assets to your named beneficiaries.
For more information, contact the SPLC at 1-888-414-7752.

, This is an irrevocable trust. You transfer assets to the trust, and the trust pays regular income to you or to your beneficiaries. The trust makes payments either for the life of the beneficiary or for a period of time (not exceeding 20 years). After your death (or the completion of the time period), the assets pass to SPLC. You should contribute at least $100,000 to a charitable trust.A charitable remainder trust is a good way to provide you or another beneficiary with income while also gaining an income tax charitable deduction.
You also avoid paying capital gains taxes on the appreciated property you used to fund the trust.

, In exchange for giving cash or securities, you can sign a contract with SPLC in which they agree to provide you fixed annual payments for the rest of your life. You can claim a charitable deduction in the year you donate the assets.You need to complete an application, which is available here: https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/2015_pff_gift_annuity_application_final_no_crops.pdf.


The minimum donation is $5,000. Your annual payment will be calculated based on the amount you give and your age.
You can purchase the annuity at age 55 or older, but you can’t begin to receive payments until age 60.
You may also create a joint charitable gift annuity for you and another person (such as your spouse). It pays income through the lives of both annuitants.

, You can give SPLC either a fully-paid life insurance policy or a new policy on which you will make premium payments. You can give SPLC the policy outright or name them as a beneficiary.


If you give the policy to SPLC, then you can claim a charitable deduction on your federal income taxes.You can also name SPLC as a beneficiary of your life insurance policy. This allows you to maintain ownership of the policy and to access the cash in it. However, you can’t claim a charitable deduction.

, By law, you can contribute up to $100,000 from a traditional or Roth IRA if you are at least 70 1/2 years old. You cannot claim a tax deduction because the roll-over amount is not claimed as income on your tax return."

Choose a leader and symbol.,
Recruit activists.,
Build partnerships with other people and groups.,
Recruit intellectuals.,
Turn to scientists.",How to Start a Revolution2," Put a charismatic face on the revolution. Revolutions can take off when there is a charismatic face of the revolution to rally the masses. This can be someone already known or just a person who is particularly eloquent or who has standing on the issue. You need someone or something to represent your rebellion like a symbol. For example: Katniss is the Mockingjay.


The leader can be the person with the original idea, or just a person who is courageous enough to take the heat.Choose a spokesperson who is articulate and good on camera. Build rapport with TV and newspaper reporters to get your message out.
There are some who advocate making all decisions by group and staying anonymous with no clear leadership, so leaders can’t be targeted or jailed by the opposition. Remember, though, that having a charismatic leader can be another strategy, and if that leader is targeted and jailed it can, in some circumstances, rally the masses to the cause (as in the case of Martin Luther King Jr.)

, You need the people who will organize and lead the movement. These people must be committed and willing to work in the trenches and to devote their hearts and time to the cause. Motivate people to join because they believe in the cause. Give presentations at coffee houses or music stores or other places where you think receptive audiences congregate.


The organizational team will require people with different skills and techniques. They will know how to interact with the media and how to get the masses to turn out for a protest. The average people might relate more to people like them than a charismatic leader. If they see other people they know or relate to joining in, they will feel more comfortable doing so themselves.You can not create a revolution with a single person. You need to remember the ground game. Creating a revolution is a painstaking process that requires grass roots organization. Build support and consensus: Nothing is going to happen if the only rebels are you and your buddies.This is an important step and the setup for either a successful revolution or a small civilian rebellion flop.

, Seek supporters for your change. You will need people both inside and outside the institution or societal structure in question to have a better chance at achieving change. Don't succumb to the temptation of competition.


Identify these people, and then seek their support. Pick people who are influencers and can themselves reach more people. Pick a mixture of people with different strengths. Build alliances, and link with other partners and people who are already working on the same cause or one related to it.To create change, you will need at least 15% of the population to create a shift. Bring new people on board your team. Don’t only turn to the people you know. Find people whose skills are needed.Try to reach out to groups that are already organized and have membership lists and ground operations (unions are an example).

, It’s easier to start a revolution if its causes are supported by intellectuals. This can mean professors, researchers, authors, artists, speakers, and opinion writers.Intellectuals can help build the rationale for the revolution by articulating compelling theory. They can provide facts that will build the case. Many revolutions ignite with a deeper seminal work, such as Martin Luther King Jr.’s letter to Birmingham. King wrote this letter while in jail in response to a public statement issued by eight white southern religious leaders. It became a central document of the civil rights movement that defused the opposition and rallied support.The intellectuals can also help create a coherent and clear vision that will excite the masses about what the future can hold. Intellectuals can articulate what the new world or system will look like.

, Polemics matters, but grounding the movement in science and data can be particularly effective.


Consider the global warming debate and how important science is to environmental movements as they seek to make their case.
Ground the movement’s cause in scholarly research that is respected in its field, including from those who are not directly involved in the movement. It will be much harder for the opposition to refute the movement’s arguments.

"
"
Remember the power of art and music.,
Embrace all of the potentials of the new media.,
Use social media to organize.,
Frame the debate.,
Expect that people will react different ways to change.",How to Start a Revolution3," The rationale for a revolution can come from all artistic realms and areas of pop culture. You don’t only have to focus on the written word.


Spoken word, poetry, music, and art – including public art – can advance your message and cause more effectively sometimes.
Some art can be lasting. Consider a mural painted in a community. Music has the ability to influence minds all over the world.Try to humanize the movement. Make people care by telling the stories of real people whom the masses will identify with and care about.

, You can also start a revolution through the quality of your own ideas. The Internet has given anyone the ability to publish and reach the masses.


Create a blog. Install WordPress or another blogging service. Write a blog, and push it out to the masses. In it, create the intellectual foundation for why change is needed, and explain how change will look and what it would mean for your audience.
Consider other formats. You might want to create a documentary. This can educate and motivate an audience. Don’t forget the power of shorter video. A You Tube series could help. Don’t have a one-prong media strategy. Use old and new media. Use the written word and multimedia like video. Use social media and blogs, but plant your message in traditional newspapers and magazines. Push your message out through multiple formats and mechanisms.

, Remember to harness the power of social media. Social media is a great way to get your messages in front of a lot of people.


You can use social media to build attendance and events and to reach a targeted audience.Remember not to only have a social media strategy. Revolutions are more successful when they organize both off and on the computer screen. Build support by handing out flyers and pamphlets, by word of mouth and advertisements and through today’s technology.

, You can do this by choosing your words carefully. Choose your model of morality. In America, this is sometimes divided into “nurturant parent” or “strict father.”


Consider how words like “freedom” create emotional response.Anchor your words to people’s needs and your overall mission.
Persuade through a mixture of pathos (emotional appeal), logos (appeal to reason), and ethos (ethical appeal). Build your case with logical reasoning and fact while adding in an emotional element.Demonstrate the popularity of the movement to the people in power, legislature, and military. The greater the popularity among society, the more the likelihood of violent repression is reduced.

, Researchers have found five stages in the process of change.


The first phase is called “uninformed optimism,” and it’s the honeymoon phase of the project. There will be energy and enthusiasm at this point. However, problems will then crop up and “informed pessimism” results. Some change efforts may be abandoned.
In order to continue with the movement, you will need hopeful realism, the third stage. This sets in when efforts succeed even though there were some problems. Informed optimism is when confidence comes back because things are still progressing. Finally, rewarding completion develops when you can show concrete results, and communicate them.

"
"
Take Action.,
Work from within.,
Find a target.,
Study past revolutions.,
Try civil disobedience.,
Plan the protest.",How to Start a Revolution4," This is the most important step because the revolution dies without it. You must take action whether it is a nonviolent protest or a sit-in or a boycott.


Your leader must motivate the support and dutifully work day and night to improve your revolution. But at some point, you need to do something, not just write about it or talk about it.
The power in place will defend itself, for that is the nature of power. Illegitimate ""governments"" are not happy about a rebellion from their people and will do anything to crush resistance. Remember, your goal is the heart of your operation, your consensus is the mind of the revolution, and the actions you and your support take are the hands of your revolution.

, Gain decision-making positions in key institutions. Some of those who have studied revolutions, like Saul Alinsky, have argued that revolutions are slow and require patience.


Penetrate institutions that have power in society. Some of those can be churches, unions, and political parties. Gain influence within the decision-making ranks.
Once in power, use the new platform to create change within the system. Adapt and be flexible. Revolutionary movements must be adaptable to shifting political circumstances. Resilience can be important., You will need a foil to define your movement. Choose a target and then personalize it. Then polarize it. Do not choose violence. In one research study, it was found that non-violent resistance campaigns are twice as likely to succeed.


Freeze the target by centering on the target, whether it’s an institution or a specific leader. Match your strong points against your enemy’s weak points. That’s according to Sun Tzu’s The Art of War. Perhaps the opponent has a stronger military, but you are cooler.Don’t ever cause harm to anyone else. However, you can create an eloquent case for change by focusing on the words and actions of a single target institution, group, or person.

, You can create a revolution that is modeled on some of the principles that worked before. History is replete with revolutions that succeeded. The American Revolution. The French Revolution. The Civil Rights Movement.


Revolutions often start by disorganizing the old or established organizations in society. Disorganize them by challenging their foundations and principles. Revolutions have happened throughout human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration, motivating ideology, and the number of participating revolutionaries. Their results include major changes in culture, economy, and socio-political institutions.
Once the old is disorganized, the new is able to better organize. Determine your tactics. Remember that power is what the enemy thinks you have. Keep the pressure on. Use ridicule. Hold the enemy to its own stated rules. Switch tactics because tactics can lose effectiveness if they drag on.

, Sometimes people decide that political channels are not working so they take to the streets in a show of people power.


For example, people have protested chemical factories in China and mining issues in Washington D.C. They have taken to the streets to protest what they see as police abuse.You can try to work within the system but when that’s not working, you can work outside of it, but in a visible way – a hunger strike, a mass protest.

, Research the rules of public spaces. Pick the time wisely (probably on a Friday so people are available to go.)


Pick a spot that is in an area of public interest, pick a local political issue to activate people, and find a public space that can hold a lot of foot traffic. Research permit requirements and local laws and stay within them.
Make sure decisions are made by groups, and make booths or art in order to generate messages from the scene. Consider offering free services to show what society is taking away (like library books). Follow the law.

Recycling conserves energy and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. It's easy to do, and in some cases can even bring in a little extra money for your school.It shouldn't be hard to find out if your school is recycling. Are there recycling bins? If not, the school probably isn't recycling. Do people seem to be using these bins?
Keep in mind that there are many things that can be recycled. It is possible that even if your school is recycling, it could be recycling more. This includes paper, cans, plastic, and electronic waste like obsolete computers.;
, Composting is like nature's recycling plan. It's a way of turning organic waste such as food scraps and lawn clippings into nutrient-rich soil. It prevents waste and, like recycling reduces trash going to the landfill.Composting can be done on-site in a school garden or in worm bins. It can also be done in a commercial facility that picks up compostable materials.Again, it shouldn't be hard to find out if your school is doing this. Are there designated bins for composting? If not, the school probably isn't happening.

, Being green isn't just about what your school puts out in the form of waste, but also about what it takes in when it buys supplies. Check out the packaging for supplies available in your classrooms. Here are some things to look for:Are the paper products made with recycled content?
Are plastic products labeled as PVC free? PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, is a highly toxic plastic.
Are computers and other electronics energy efficient? Look for an Energy Star logo and rating.

, People often overlook the lunch program as a place to go green. There are many ways that your school can make its lunch program more eco-friendly. Find out if your school is doing any of the following (you may need to ask cafeteria staff or your principal):Buying food from local farms, to reduce emissions from shipping.
Using re-usable serving and eating utensils, like plates, forks, and spoons.
Offering a vegetarian meal option, or participating in a ""Meat Free Monday"" program. Livestock farming is one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions in the world today., Reducing electricity use is another way your school can save money and help the environment, and there are many simple ways to do it. Look around your school and see what it could do to save more electricity. Here are some things to look for:Use of energy-efficient light bulbs, such as compact fluorescents.
Installation of solar panels.
Installation of motion sensors or timers to turn lights off automatically.
A ""turn it off campaign"" encouraging students and faculty to turn off lights, computers, and other appliances at the end of the day or when not in use for an extended period.

, Water waste is another environmental problem your school can help address. Look around your school to see if it has done any of the following:Stopped any leaks promptly.
Installed automatic faucets.
Installed waterless urinals.
Set up a rainwater collection system such as rain barrels or rain gardens to control runoff.

, Many cleaning products, pesticides, and other commonly used chemicals contain toxic substances that can harm plants, wildlife, and even people.


It may not be possible for you to find out what clean products your school is using, but it can't hurt to ask. Your school's custodian, a teacher, or the principal might be willing to let you have a look at the cleaning supplies being used. Look for the Green Seal or EcoLogo symbol on the labels of these products to see if they are green products.Even if you can't check into this now, it's something to keep in mind as you develop your strategic plan for your green initiative.

, You won't be able to get a green initiative off the ground yourself--you'll need the help of many other people. To start, find some friends at your school who are concerned about the environment and ask them to help.


From the planning stage onward, you're going to be working with lots of other people in making decisions and carrying them out.An easy place to start putting your team together is by asking friends to be part of your green initiative.

, Student support won't be enough to make big changes happen at your school. Once you've found some friends who want to be part of what you're doing, keep building your green team by adding some adults.A good place to start is with your parents and the parents of your friends who want to help.
Next, talk to some teachers who you think might by sympathetic to what you're doing. Support from teachers will make your campaign to improve your school more powerful. Teachers will also be important later in helping make sure the plans you make are actually carried out.
Having support from custodial staff is a good idea too!

, There are many organization that exist to help make school-based green initiatives successful. These organizations can provide a variety of resources to help you organize a program at your school.


Green Schools Initiative,Go Green Initiative,and the Healthy Schools Campaign are three of the big national organizations that help with green initiatives in schools.You can sign up on their websites and download a variety of helpful guides and other resources for your campaign.
Look into whether there might be local organizations in your area that could also help.

, Before you try to get your school to start making changes, it's a good idea to do some research about what these changes might cost and what resources are available to help your school.


For example, if you are going to try to get your school to start composting, you might find out who in your area does commercial composting, in case your school doen't want to do it on site. Contact them and find out what it would cost to start picking up compost at your school.
You should also look into what resources your state provides to schools that are trying to go green. In some states, for example, the Department of Environmental Protection will have programs already in place to help schools be more eco-friendly.It's also a good idea to look into steps taken by other local schools in your area. This can help provide ideas, and shows that the steps you suggest taking are actually doable.The more information you can collect before meeting with school authorities, the more likely you will be to persuade them that making some green changes is a good idea.

, To complete your green team and really get things started, you're going to need approval and assistance from authorities and administrators who have the power to actually put your suggested changes into action.Ask for a meeting with your principal, members of the school board, and/or other administrators. If possible, bring supportive parents and teachers to the meeting as well, along with your research.
Explain the ways you think your school could do a better job of protecting the environment, and that you have gathered supporters who are willing to help make these changes happen.
Ask supportive administrators to join your green team to help guide your school's environmental efforts.
Find out what resources the school is or is not willing to make available for your green initiative. Is the school willing/able to spend a little money on this? Will it allow students to construct worm bins for composting? Is the school willing to host an event to raise student awareness? How else can the school help make green changes possible?

, The next step is a more formal assessment of your school's impact on the environment and what it can do better. By now, you should have some ideas already for areas of improvement, but you want your school to take a more official and thorough look.


Your green team and school staff can work together to conduct a systematic study of your school's energy use, waste disposal, and so on.
The green initiative organization that you've joined can provide you with resources to help your school conduct this audit including surveys, checklists, and curricula for teachers who want to make the audit a part of their lesson plans., Once the audit is complete, your green team will need to meet to develop a plan. Pick a time and place to meet that everyone can attend, and use the information from the audit to determine how your school can make the biggest difference, given the resources available.The plan should include both long-term goals, to inspire people, and short-term goals that can reasonably be achieved within the year.
Your short term goals should feature a list of specific actions to be taken (and who is responsible for making these things happen), a list of necessary resources for making these steps take place, and a timeline for when they can reasonably be completed.Your school will need to approve the plan so you can be sure your goals can actually be achieved.

, After your strategic plan is in place, your work is far from over. The green team will need to meet regularly to make sure the plan is being followed and determine how effective it has been.A green initiative is not a one-time change, it is an ongoing process. Your green team should plan on meeting at least once a month to discuss how things are going and revise the plan as necessary.
The green team should conduct an annual review of how much impact the green initiative has had on the school. Once the original short-term goals have been achieved, the team should set new goals and look for ways to make the school ever more environmentally friendly.
Once again, the Green Schools Initiative and other organizations can provide valuable resources for monitoring your school's progress toward the greener future your strategic plan was designed to create.

, A green initiative will work best when everyone in the school understands and (hopefully) supports the changes you are making. In addition to changing school policies and practices, you'll need to educate students about what your school is doing.A great way to start is with a school-wide event.


Your green initiative will be much more successful if students participate. For example, if you add compost bins to your cafeteria, but students don't understand why they should use them or what goes in them, your composting plan isn't going to be as successful. Work with your green team to host an assembly or another gathering of students to promote the green initiative.
Many have found that an Earth Day celebration on or around April 22nd is a great way to raise student awareness and participation in the green initiative while connecting your efforts to global environmental issues.Make this event something fun that students get to actually participate in. This can be more effective than just asking them to listen to a boring speech.

, Supportive teachers can help make your green initiative a success by teaching lessons on the environment and connecting them to the efforts your school is making to be more eco-friendly.


You can encourage teachers who want to help to look at the free lesson plans that are provided by many of the national green initiative organizations (including, hopefully, the one you've joined).The environmental protection agency also offers materials for teaching about the environment.Many people conducting green initiatives have found that hands-on projects, where students get to see first-hand the effects of their actions on the environment, work best.One suggestion for hands-on in class participation is to involve students in monitoring the progress of the green initiative. How much waste is being recycled that wasn't before? How much waste that should be going into recycling bins is still ending up in the trash?

, Not every student at your school who cares about the environment will be able to commit to being part of the green team. For students who want to help but can't join the team, consider starting a green club at school to provide other opportunities to participate.The club can help with monitoring, recycling or composting efforts, building worm bins, maintaining rain gardens, or any other task that will help the school meet its green goals.

Take a deep breath.,
Tell them it's not funny.,
Stick to your guns.,
Respond to common fallacies.,
Remind them that rape jokes hurt men too.,
Use imagery to make your point.,
Cry if you need to.,
Accept any apologies (if genuine).,
Disengage if you feel unsafe or too upset to continue.,
Remember that you are not responsible for others' bad behavior.",How to Stop Someone from Using Rape Jokes," You may be feeling very shaken and unsafe right now, especially if you are a survivor. This person is unlikely to hurt you. Staying calm will help you think and speak clearly.;
, Think of it like a thesis—this is the introduction to your argument. Believe it or not, they do care what others think of them.


""Excuse me, that's not funny at all.""
""Why would you joke about such a terrible thing?""

, They may backpedal, try to dismiss you, or ridicule you. Keep sharing polite and logical arguments. They (or others around them) will realize who is in the wrong here.


Give a basic explanation of PTSD and triggers. Point out that it drives some victims to suicide.Consider mentioning that you know people who have been raped, and state how it affected them. (Do not disclose names without the victim's explicit permission.) If you were raped, you may choose to disclose your survivor status.
Remind them that most women don't think that all men are rapists—rapists think that all men are rapists. Rape jokes make rapists feel that the speaker is on their side., The person may attempt to write the issue off as unimportant. Here are some of the excuses that people frequently use in support of violent humor:



It's just free speech. What are you, the thought police? Free speech means that the government won't prosecute you for having an opinion. It doesn't prevent others from exercising their own rights by condemning offensive jokes, nor can it separate anyone from the consequences of hurtful speech.

It's just a joke. Jokes have measurable effects on people's attitudes—for example, studies have documented that homophobes discriminate against LGBT groups after reading anti-gay jokes.Rape jokes are more than lighthearted humor.It's not hurting anyone. How do they know who is and isn't a victim? Who in this room could have a panic attack, vomit in the bathroom, sob uncontrollably because this ""humor"" brought up memories they tried to suppress? Who is a rapist listening and thinking ""see, it's not a big deal that I attack people, it's a joke""?

, While it is unfortunate that some men are only willing to consider the feelings of other men, sometimes this is the only thing that gets through to them. Women are not the only victims here, and they may hesitate if they realize they're hurting men.


Around 3% of American men are rape survivors.Rape is just as traumatizing to them.
Classifying all men as rapists, e.g. ""It's like putting a steak in front of a dog and expecting them not to eat it,"" implies that men have no self-control or human decency. This is incredibly insulting to men (especially since dogs are actually capable of resisting this,so they are arguing that men have less self-control than dogs).

, Chances are, someone who thinks rape is funny has no idea what rape really is like. Imagery can have intense emotional appeal showing the tragic reality of rape.""How many times have you consoled a sobbing friend at the middle of the night, trying to find words for a horror you can barely comprehend? How many times have you held her shaking hands, searched frantically for medical help, sat with her at a doctor's office trying to get her to slow her frantic breathing?""
""How many times have you had to evaluate whether you should fight for your life, or stop moving in the hopes that you won't be murdered or beaten any harder? How long have you spent wondering whether you should report your assault to the police, knowing that they'd probably dismiss it like they do most cases?""
""When you go out to the parking lot at night, what strategies do you use to prevent being raped?""

, You may feel enraged, frustrated, or panicked if the person keeps insisting that rape jokes aren't hurtful. You don't need to hide your tears. Crying will release the terrible feelings inside you, and also make the person realize that their words have very real effects on others.


This can also get bystanders' attention if the person is becoming aggressive.

, Some people will listen when they are told that their actions are hurting others. If they sound truly sorry, accept their apology and ask that they not do it again.


If anyone has run from the room or is appearing especially upset (hiding face, looking away, looks very stressed) you may suggest that the person apologize personally.

, You are not obligated to educate people who refuse to respect you or your opinions. Men who enjoy rape jokes are more likely to be aggressive,so it's important to be extra careful about safety.


Stop right away if the person begins threatening you, swearing profusely, getting in your face, or touching you (e.g. poking, shoving). They may become violent.
If you are a woman debating with a man, make sure that you are in a safe place where other women are present, so he won't think he can get away with raping you.
If for any reason you want to end the discussion, say ""I'm not interested in talking about this more"" and leave. (If he seems violent, edge towards the door first so he will not attack you when your back is turned.)

, You cannot fix the world. If you didn't convince the person, that is not a reflection on you. Take time to relax and calm down as needed. Your comfort and emotional health come first.

Find a place to store the food.,
Contact organizations in your area that can help bring in food donations and can recommend people in need.,
Notify other area food banks of your operation.,
Set up a schedule for when people or agencies will receive food from you.,
Collect donations.,
Process items as they come in.,
Prepare boxes of food donations the day before you will disperse them.,
Keep records of individuals who use your service, their dietary needs, and the size of their families.,
Search for additional funding.",How to Start a Food Bank," The amount of donations you get may vary throughout the year, so find a place large enough to accommodate the intake. If you are an individual operation, you may be able to start by storing things in your basement or garage.;
, Working with churches, schools, and local government agencies is a great place to start.

, Some banks may have food surpluses that you may be able to purchase. Some food banks do require you to pay for food while others do not.

, Some food banks may only disperse donations every 2 weeks. You may also be able to work with these other agencies to offer your donations on the opposite weeks to help a larger portion of the community.

, You may do this by holding food drives through schools and churches or by setting up a drop-off site outside the local grocery store or other business. Make sure you have permission from the business owner first before you do anything. Grocers may also be willing to donate items that are reaching the expiration dates.

, Have shelving set up in your bank area to separate the items according to product type (cans, boxes, breakfast items, fresh food, dried goods etc). Double check expiration dates and throw out any that are past the freshness date or foods that look suspicious.

, Try to have a variety in each box. If you are packaging for individuals, keep in mind the amount of people the food has to feed and pack accordingly.

, These records can help you better assess what to prepare for them.

, Food donations can decrease during certain times of the year, especially around the holidays when they are needed the most. By getting additional funding, you will be able to fight hunger on a more consistent basis. Reach out to local community groups for monetary funding or check for government funding programs.

Write down or highlight the question asked or purpose of the article.
Take note of the thesis statement or hypothesis.
Highlight any supporting points.
Write or highlight the method used to perform the research, if included in the article.
Mark down findings, conclusions, or results.;
, After marking down the basics, read the article sincerely, paying close attention to detail.


Consider reading each section a few times for an even richer understanding.
Ask yourself about the article as you read it. Mentally track the progress of the article to determine if the results and conclusions drawn seem complete and sensible.

, As you read the article for thoroughness, write down any significant facts or interesting details in your own words.


By writing the information in your own words, you minimize the risk of accidentally plagiarizing the article.
Do not simply ""rephrase"" exact statements by swapping a few words around. Instead, completely rewrite the information and do not look at the text as you write.
If you have difficulty keeping things in your own words, focus on writing down short phrases instead of full sentences.

, At the end of each major train of thought, pause to summarize the main point of the section in a single sentence.If the article unexpectedly begins to move into another main point, stop long enough to write the main point of the previous section before you continue reading.

, A summary meant for your own personal notes should be approached from a different perspective than a summary you plan to include in your essay.


If writing a summary for your own benefit, include as much detail as possible so that you can get the most out of your notes later on.
If writing a summary you wish to include as part of an essay, focus the summary on information that deals specifically with your own thesis.

, In the introduction of your summary, mention the full title of the article and the author's full name.


You do not need to mention the date of publication or the journal, book, newspaper, or magazine you found the article in. This information will need to be included on your ""References"" or ""Works Cited"" page, however.
Only include publication dates and sources if they are applicable to your paper. For instance, if one author wrote an article making one claim but wrote a second article refuting his earlier claims several years later, mention that one article came several years after the other.

, Within the first paragraph of your summary, you should also mention the topic of the original article and the author's thesis or hypothesis.


Make the connection between the article and your essay apparent. For example, if your essay is about a certain health condition and you summarize an article about a certain medication used to treat that condition, make sure that the reader knows that the medication in question is connected to the condition your paper is about.

, Review your notes and rewrite any supporting details in the paragraphs to follow.


Mention all main points and any supporting details that are essential in understanding those points.
Only write information that is absolutely crucial in developing an understanding of the article's contents.

, In your summary's conclusion, restate the conclusion drawn by the author of the original article.


Note that these conclusions can include results, analysis of research or ideas, and calls to action.

, As you write your summary, continually restate the fact that the information you write comes from another source.


For example, include phrases like ""Smith believes,"" ""Smith finds that,"" and ""Smith expresses disbelief about.""

, A summary should be written in your own words. As a result, you should use direct quotations only when the information cannot be meaningfully rephrased in any other way.If possible, do not use any direct quotations in you summary.

, The summary should be short, complete, true, and unbiased.


The text of your summary should be at least one-quarter the length of the original article, if not shorter. Refer to the parameters of your assignment for further guidelines.
The summary must include all of the major ideas included in the article without repeating exact phrases.
The summary should accurately portray the thoughts and assertions portrayed in the original article.
The summary should not include your own analysis or opinion of the original article. If you do decide to analyze the article's findings, do so in another part of your essay.

, This is, in essence, the ""topic"" of the article. Explain what the research was about and why the researcher felt inclined to research it.


Indicate if or how the researcher's purpose meshes with the purpose of your own essay as you introduce the article.
Briefly mention the authority of those performing the research to lend validity to the summary and the article.

, In the introduction of your summary, mention what the researcher expected to find by the end of his or her research.


Do not hint around about whether the hypothesis was correct.

,


Mention who the subjects were.
Describe the design of the experiment. This includes the timeline for the experiment, how subjects were split up, and what distinguished the experimental group from the control group.
Also describe the tasks or actions subjects needed to take during the duration of the experiment.

, After describing the method used, state what the results of the experiment were.


Include percentages and rates if applicable.
Mention any irregularities in the results.

, State what the researcher concluded based on his or her own results.


Do not include your own analysis in the summary. If you do analyze the results, do so in another portion of your paper.

, In your introduction, restate the thesis of the original article in your own words.


The thesis should be a single sentence that sums up the idea or belief the original author is attempting to make.
You can also provide brief context about how this thesis fits in with the topic as a whole or a brief summary about the topic in general, but this is not necessary if you already described the general topic in the introduction of your overall essay.

, Explain each of the main points found in the article and include enough supporting detail to make sense of these points.


This part of the summary can be tricky. The author of the original essay will include many details in an attempt to support his or her argument, and you need to pick through these details to determine which are essential and which can be skimmed over in the interest of brevity.
Focus on summarizing the biggest points and those that connect directly to your own essay. If a point has nothing to do with your own essay, you might be able to skip it completely as long as the author's thesis is not completely dependent on that point.

, Since argumentative articles are often arguing against another viewpoint, you should mention any evidence or ideas the article uses in an attempt to address opposing arguments.


If the article does not address any specific counterarguments, however, do not speculate about counterarguments the article could work against while writing your summary. If you wish to speculate on such information, wait until the summary is complete.

, Usually, this will mean restating the thesis in new terms.


Do not draw your own conclusions in the summary. Only state the conclusions or ideas of the article's author.

, In your pre-writing notes, mention all of the main events described in the news story.


The events in the article may not be written in chronological order. As you write the main events down in your notes, write down each event as it is given to you and number them in chronological order before writing your summary.

, If the news article was not written in chronological order, rearrange the events as you write them down so that they do fall in chronological order.


The summary of the original article is, basically, a summary of the story or event that took place. While the article may focus on a specific element of that event, your summary should detail the full scope of the story.

, If the individual news article is part of a larger chain of events, you should also explain how it connects to this chain of events.


This is especially important if it is the chain of events, rather than the actual individual article, that ties into your essay.
For example, if you are summarizing an article about a school banning students from bringing peanut butter sandwiches, you could consider mentioning other schools in the area doing the same thing.

, If the journalist or editor writing the article reached a conclusion or has an opinion about the story, include that in your summary.


Do not state your own opinion or analysis of the article within the summary.

You’ll need time to rebound and to change topics. College professors recommend that you get started on your research paper the day it is assigned. The more time and effort you put into it, the better your grade will be. So get started now. Don't procrastinate.

, If you are in school, you’ll need to read the prompt provided by your teacher. If you are writing a research paper for your job, know what your employer expects. Your paper will undoubtedly have guidelines or requirements that will fundamentally shape your research. Know what those guidelines are at the very beginning. You don’t want to start working on it and find out later that you need to start over again.For example, if you are writing a research paper for a college course, you should know how long it should be, what sources can be used, the topics you can choose from, and the deadline to turn it in. Once you understand the parameters, you can set out a schedule to complete the paper on time., The best way to narrow down a research paper is to see what else has been written on the subject. Consult Google Scholar or do a quick web search to see what the major trends are.


For example, if you are taking an American history course and you want to write a research paper on the origins of the American Revolution, you’d probably want to begin by reading other books on the subject. You’ll soon realize that historians have discussed the Revolution’s origins primarily in political and economic terms, but have given less attention to the social dimensions of the revolutionary experience. So you decide to focus — broadly — on the social origins of the American Revolution.

, Depending on the size requirements of your paper, you’ll need to narrow your research question. Papers that are really short — 1 to 2 pages — will need a narrower question than a dissertation spanning hundreds of pages.Let’s return to the social origins of the American Revolution. You might be able to cover this topic in 500 pages, but if you are writing a 20 page research paper for a class, you’ll need to focus your topic further. What social group or groups will you focus on in order to address the social origins of the American Revolution? Break down the ""social"" into categories — women, racial minorities, farmers, city-dwellers, writers, travelers, businessmen, or children. There are numerous different angles you can take. See what hasn’t been written before and then write on that subject.

, At some point, you’ll need to settle on a topic and begin research. Remember that after the researching phase, you’ll probably adjust your topic. This is normal. Everyone does it.Let’s say that you’ve decided to focus on the role of farmers and the American Revolution. Try to formulate a question based on your narrowed field such as: What role did farmers play in the origins of the American Revolution?

, These are potential answers to your research question. Use what you know about the topic to surmise possible answers to your question.For example, you could answer the above question (i.e., What role did farmers play in the origins of the American Revolution?) in several ways. Farmers directly participated in public riots against British officers. Farmers refused to sell their crops to British contingents. Farmers refused to quarter British soldiers in their homes. Farmers refused to pay taxes on their goods.
It is a good idea to start with several hypothetical thesis statements. If one proves to be false or isn’t supported by enough evidence, you can start in a new direction quickly.

, Your thesis statement is the key to your entire paper. Be sure to include all necessary information in it, so the reader knows exactly what you’ll argue over the course of the paper.For example: The quartering of British soldiers in the homes of poor farmers caused them to protest British taxes and to attack British troops.
This is a single sentence thesis statement that addresses both why the farmers chose to revolt and how they did so.

, Sometimes, our ideas make great sense to us, but don’t translate clearly to others. Be sure to ask others to evaluate your thesis statement before you begin your research process. This is a fail-safe. It will make sure that you don’t fall down a rabbit hole. Show your thesis statement to your professor.If your professor wanted to you to focus on the political causes of the American Revolution, she might stop you from researching farmers. This would save you time in the long run.

, Depending on your project, you’ll need to find ways of collecting information to back up your claims. If your paper is on a science topic, you’ll need to set up an experiment and collect data from that experiment. If you are writing a history paper, you’ll need to find primary sources (information produced during the time under investigation) that support your thesis statement. Primary sources can be found in a variety of locations. Some are reprinted in primary source collections. Others can only be accessed in archives or libraries.For our paper on the role of farmers and the American Revolution, we might need to visit local archives and the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration to get the necessary documents.
If you're feeling overwhelmed by the volume of research, see if your library has appointments with a research librarian. Librarians stay up to date with current trends in scholarship and can help guide your search., While you are performing your experiment or conducting research in an archive or a library, you’ll want to create a detailed record of your findings. Take notes on a computer or using note cards.Include author, title, and publication information in your notes, so that you can type up a reference list at the end of your research paper. You can also use a program such as EndNote, RefWorks, or LaTEX to help you manage your citations.
Create a note sheet of quotations that you may want to use in your research paper. It is better to gather more than you need at this point, since you will need evidence from reputable sources to support your thesis., Do some research about the author, so that you can establish their credibility. Were your documents created by somebody with an obvious bias? Are your documents original or were they reproduced after the fact? Is the document complete?For web sources, use sources from peer-reviewed journals, government institutions and organizations, and public archives first. Blogs and other unauthoritative web sources are usually inappropriate for a research paper.
Organize your notes. Put your notes/data in a logical order that backs up your thesis statement. Organize them so they flow from one to the next. For our imaginary project, it would be best to put your notes on quartered British troops before notes on farmer's revolutionary actions. Since our argument is that quartered troops angered farmers into action, we need to discuss them in that order. , Does the information you’ve found support your thesis statement? Does it cause you to rethink your original hypothesis? Or does your research further clarify your original thesis statement? If so, make the necessary adjustments.For example, if you discovered that farmers were primarily unhappy quartering British soldiers because they ate all their food, you’d want to include that information in your thesis statement.
Quartered British troops consumed large quantities of food while housed with poor farmers. Because they couldn’t feed themselves and quarter troops, these farmers chose to protest British taxes and to attack British troops. As such, farmers played a significant role in the origins of the American Revolution.

, An outline is a great place to organize your thoughts before you sit down to write. It is also a great place to figure out what needs to come first. Once you have a general idea of the trajectory of your paper, you'll be able to introduce it more efficiently.Consider composing an outline as a list of questions you would like to answer. Start with your thesis at the beginning, then break it down into sections that back up your argument. Write questions like ""Why is this research important?"" and ""What studies support my thesis?"" Then insert information you found while researching into your outline that answers these questions.
You can also write a prose outline, instead of a question-based outline. Place headers that are the subjects of each paragraph or section of your research paper. Add quotes and other notes in bullets below the subject. You can begin your composition directly from a prose-based outline.Continue researching if you need to fill holes in your outline. Be sure to gather bibliographic information as you go.

, Some people like to start broad and work their way into a research topic. This reaches those people who want to know the broad appeal of your work. If you're writing a paper on the importance of comics, you could assert the importance of comic books since the 1930s. If you want to discuss the role of farmers in the American Revolution, you can make a blanket statement about the complex causes of the revolutionary movement.


This is how most people begin their research papers. They don't want to make their subject seem too obscure, so they write about larger points before jumping head first into their topic.Just make sure that your broad statement is related to your thesis statement. And make sure that everyone can agree with your broad statement. You don't want to have your readership criticizing your argument from the beginning. You need to build a certain degree of trust.
By all means, avoid the ""Throughout history"" or ""In modern society"" types of opening lines. These are so overused that they have become hackneyed, and they will damage your credibility as a writer before your reader has looked at another word., One of the best ways to begin a paper is to tell your audience what else exists. If you are writing on the role of farmers during the American Revolution, begin by discussing those works that directly or tangentially discuss the subject. Then explain how your work adds to the conversation or does something differently. This will answer that nagging question in your readers' minds - why do I need to read this research paper?, We've all seen those individuals who begin papers or speeches by quoting Webster's Dictionary. It is hackneyed most of the time because the speaker or author defines a common word that most people know. If your topic is more obscure or the audience knows nothing about it, you might need to start by establishing a baseline of knowledge.For example, if you want to write a research paper on philately (stamp collecting), you should probably begin by defining your key term. But don't go for the standard ""Webster's Dictionary defines philately as..."" opening. See if you can make your opening line attention-grabbing or intriguing., This works well for history papers in particular. A story about an individual family that attacked a quartered British soldier in the middle of the night for eating all of their bread would be a suitable story for a paper on the role of farmers in the early American Revolution.


By setting up this story at the beginning, you'd be able to return to it periodically over the course of your paper to illustrate points and to re-assert your thesis statement.Interesting anecdotes or surprising facts can be a good way to hook your readers and lead in to your thesis statement., You can begin with broad analytical statements or with a story for most fields, but in some it is less appropriate and helpful than others. While historians can make use of both broad claims and stories, biologists might not be able to. If a biologist wanted to write a paper on the photosynthesis process in celery stalks, they might not want to begin with a story - especially not a hypothetical one. ""A celery stalk was basking in the sun working on its tan"" would be a terrible way to begin a biology research paper. It would just seem silly. In short, know your audience. Who will read this paper? Will they enjoy the way you began your story?


If you aren't sure about how to start your essay, have a look at some published works in your subject. They'll be a lot fancier than your paper needs to be, but they can give you a sense of that subject's conventions.

, During this draft, you will answer your primary question with your thesis statement and then systematically support that statement with evidence acquired during your research phase. Write a complete rough draft before you start editing. It is easier to get all of your thoughts out on the paper (especially if you have a solid outline to follow) and then go back and edit. Don’t edit as you go. It will disrupt your thought process.


Some writers find it helpful to write the body of the text and then return and write the introduction and conclusion. This gives them a better sense of what exactly they want to argue.

, Remember that spellcheck is not 100% foolproof. You must always edit spelling, grammar, and content personally. Spellcheck won’t tell you if you’ve typed the wrong word unless that word is misspelled. Be aware of homonyms. They are the primary type of word missed by spellcheck. “Bare” and “bear” are examples of homonyms., If you use another person’s words or ideas, you’ll need to give them credit. Check with your professor to find what kind of style you should use. MLA, Chicago, and APA are commonly used citation styles. They each use a different method of citation.


Be sure to give the author credit. You don’t want to be accused of plagiarism., Depending on the assignment, you may write a works-cited page instead. Works-cited pages include those sources you specifically drew from. A bibliography can include other works that you are aware of, but did not reference in the body of your paper.


In general, bibliographies should be organized by type of source and by alphabetical order., Consider printing it out and making notes with a pen and pencil. Some writers read their papers aloud. Hearing your words forces your brain to process them differently. This makes finding errors a little easier., Make sure to give yourself plenty of time before the deadline to submit your essay, especially if you are submitting it online. If many students all try to turn in their papers at 11:59PM, the servers could crash, making your paper late.

Assess your students.",How to Teach World History," If you've already decided that you don't want to scramble to teach isolated histories of many world countries, you could focus on teaching themes. If you teach a theme, you can highlight a variety of world histories over a large period of time. You might use a theme like humans and the environment, humans and other humans, or humans and ideas.For example, if you're teaching about humans and technology, you might divide your class into groups. Assign a time period or region to each group and ask them to note every instance of new technology. Once they've done this, ask them to argue their most important technology against the other groups' technological innovations.;
, You could also break the course into set periods of time instead of trying to cover the earliest recorded history to the present. If you do this, try spending a week or two covering each era, but be sure to present it from different historical viewpoints. For example, you could do a modern era that covers post-World War II history to the present. Other big eras could be:From prehistory to the beginning of agricultural societies
Early encounters (1200 BCE to 500 CE)
Age of empires (300 to 1500 CE)
The state and globalization (1400 to 1800)
Industrialization (1750 to 1914)
Modern war (1900 to 1950)
Postwar challenges (1950 to present)

, You may find that even though you're teaching the course using themes or eras you're still teaching about isolated cultures. For example, you might have spent a week focusing on the plague as it devastated Western Europe. Remember to connect the individual lessons to other civilizations and cultures. Try to include a variety of histories to do this. Look at women's history, economic history, philosophical history, and indigenous histories.


It's fine to spend one week teaching a time period in a specific region, like Western Europe in the 15th century. To connect with other civilizations and cultures, spend another week discussing the history of 15th century South America. You can then cover their encounter from both perspectives.
So if you were teaching about the plague, you could discuss its origins in China, its spread along the Silk Road, or its impact on religion, learning and the economy.

, Check with your school's administration to ensure that the way you're teaching the course and your expectations follow guidelines and requirements held by the school. Structure your course so that they learn information that is tested by the school.


For example, if your students will be tested on the French Revolution at the end of the term, you need to at least cover it in class.
If your school requests understanding of themes and events, consider assigning an essay. Your students can write about how a current event connects to a past world event of their choosing.

, Once you've determined how you're structuring the course, create a detailed outline or syllabus that you can give your students. You should list the required readings, lesson topics, assignments due, discussion days, and exam dates.


Go over the syllabus with your class on the first day. Encourage students to ask their questions about the course or world history. You may even want to ask them if they have any historical questions they'd like to discuss during the term.

, You might feel like you have so much material to cover that you need to assign a lot of reading. This can overwhelm your students, making them less likely to closely read the text. Instead, divide a reading assignment into smaller parts. You or your students can paraphrase the text. Chunking the text can make it easier to understand.For example, if you're having the students read an excerpt from a primary document, choose several difficult sentences or phrases. Create a worksheet that lists these chunks of text. Next to the text, give students a space to write the main ideas of each of these passages in their own words.

, Many teachers mix lecturing with having their students read silently. Instead of keeping the classroom quiet, call on students to read passages of primary sources or the textbook aloud. This can engage students who learn better through listening and it makes the students more involved in learning.If the text is long, go around the room and have each student read a sentence or two. This can also help students pay better attention during class.

, Students learn well when they feel like they're not just being lectured to. Make your students curious by asking the right questions. You should ask factual questions, inferential or interpretive questions, and universal questions that create discussion. For example, after reading a primary document you might ask:Where and when did this historical event take place?
What did the author mean by writing this passage? What did he/she want us to understand?
How does this passage challenge our understanding of (the main theme)? Have things changed significantly in our time?

, Since you'll probably be spending a significant amount of time lecturing, your students will need to record important notes. Many students have never been instructed on how to take effective notes. Teach them two-column note taking where they record key ideas on one side/column of paper and write their own responses on the other side/column.For example, they might write ""Magna Carta"" with key dates/places on one side. On the response side, they could write, ""Held all accountable to rule of law for the first time.""
Your students need note-taking help if you see them writing down every word you say or not writing anything at all.

, Students can become bored by simply reading the textbook every week. Encourage curiosity by assigning primary documents or historical novels. Ask your students to act like historians by considering what these documents or novels tell about the time period or region you're covering. You could also show a historical movie and talk about how accurate it was or what the inaccuracies tell about its creation.


You can assign speeches, poetry, novels, advertisements, political cartoons, or letters.

, After a lecture or week of instruction, ask your students for their feedback. This will help you gauge how much your students understood and what you may need to clarify. When you're ready for their feedback, ask them to write down:3 things they learned
2 questions they still have or things they're confused about
1 thing they really enjoyed

, Your students should be able to tell that you're interested and excited about the material that you teach them. In turn, they may feel more curious about what you're teaching and will pay more attention to lectures. When you lecture, you should focus on the questions about history instead of overwhelming your students with names and dates.Remind your students that they can meet with you during your office hours or ask questions after class. Make your students feel like they can come to you if they're struggling or are confused by a particular lecture.

, Students may quickly tune out to your course if you rely completely on completely on lecturing. Get the students to interact with you and one another by holding weekly discussions. You can hold discussions about primary documents that you assign before the class or about different sides in a historical debate.For example, you might divide the students into two groups that debate if World War II was inevitable or preventable.

, Since you'll be covering a large geographical area, vast time periods, and a number of civilizations, you may want to give several assessments over the course of the term instead of one final at the end. This will also give you a chance to do a variety of assessments like:Biographies of people (either major historical figures or common people that lived during the period you've covered)
Mapping projects: have the students create a poster or annotated map about a place. This gives them a chance to show off geography skills while including a timeline of basic information.
Defending a timeline: give your students a handful of important historical events to place on a timeline, but limit them in how many they can use. Make them argue and defend why their timeline contains critical events.

The center leg has adjustable heights and pin holes for the heights of 1.5 M (5 ft), 1.8 M (6 ft), and 2.0 M (6.5 ft). The maximum height for this setting is 2.0 M (6.5 ft).







, Once pin is inserted, lock the center leg by tightening the black knob.

, Adjust the three legs of the tripod to get it level, using the level on the control rod. The leg of the SECO tripod that has a brass screw must be tightened with the pinky finger and the thumb to avoid stripping the brass threads.


It may be easier to attach cables to the base receiver (base receiver is marked with a “tx” with permanent tape or permanent marker) BEFORE placing the base receiver on top of the SECO tripod. As the tripod can get quite tall if set to the maximum height of 2.0m.

,, Make sure you wiggle the brass piece on top of the tripod to secure it in place and tighten with brass screw underneath the base plate. (Optional base extension may also be used. If using the port 2 cable, it will need to be used. It’s 0.25m (9 in) in length and may be noted in the data collector for height of instrument.)

, Tripod may have to be moved while base receiver was attached.


There will be only two legs with loosening grips and one leg with a brass screw. Place one hand on the leg itself, and the other hand on the loosening grip.

,,,


The third leg will have a brass screw and a black knob. Loosen both screw and black knob, level.







, Use the pinky finger and the thumb to tighten brass screw to avoid stripping the brass threads.

,

Put black carbon fiber rod together, by screwing the two pieces together.






Attach the small black antenna to the bottom of the rover receiver. (Rover receiver will be the last receiver in the case, and will be labeled with a ""t"" or a permanent marker)






Attach rover receiver to black carbon fiber rod.






Place black fiberglass rover rod into trimble bi-pod to sturdy it, and place it somewhere out of the way, or on a Bench Mark- (If placed on a bench mark-rover rod will need to be leveled as a shot will be taken on the point.

,

Attach the silver tip to the black rubber antenna.






Attach black rubber antenna to the black antenna base. This will have a long antenna cable attached to it.






Attach it to the long yellow antenna mount. Fully extend the yellow antenna mount until a black button snaps into the hole on the bottom of the yellow antenna mount.






Attach yellow antenna mount to a standard tripod using the black washer provided to prevent the antenna from falling through the tripod.
Place the external radio on the standard tripod and attach antenna cable to the back of the radio. The antenna cable must be the first cable you hook up to the external radio, and the last cable to be removed. This is to release the energy through the antenna, and avoid electrocution of the radio.

Behind the external radio are two settings: Low (2 watts) and High (35 watts).
The setting should be at Low (2 watts) for smaller surveys and High (35 watts) for extended range for larger surveys. Place the setting at Low for now.



,


Connect one of the ends of the black lemo cable to the lithium “cow bell” battery.

Remove the cables from the large battery pouch. Because Trimble provided two different types of cables to gain a connection from the base receiver to the external radio, it’s important to know both ways. The two ways to connect the base receiver to the external radio are labeled option 1 and option 2.

Start your dissertation content with a short introduction.,
Write the literature review.,
Demonstrate why your dissertation has merit.",How to Structure a Dissertation1," This introduction should present the scope of your research, while it also establishes the need for your research. It should expand upon the abstract’s summary. The introduction should include any context or background information that the reader needs in order to understand your research.


Writing the introduction after the rest of the content can sometimes be a good way of ensuring the introduction covers everything.;
, The literature review should be beneficial to both the layman and the expert. It should cover the literature related to your concept, link literature similar to your own, and demonstrate the issues related to your chosen research.


If your research improves upon or clarifies a specific flaw in previous research, be sure to highlight the importance of your original content.
The literature review should also pinpoint wherever previous research conflicts., A dissertation should be written because there is a knowledge gap of some kind in the industry. Explain how your dissertation fills the gap, and why the information is even needed. The dissertation should prove to be original. Given their respective experience, your advisors should be able to provide considerable guidance on the dissertation topic choice, and how to prevent a certain degree of redundancy.Consider if your dissertation really interests you. The work will take a considerable amount of time and losing interest will make research difficult.

Quote and paraphrase responsibly.",How to Research Effectively," You may have a general idea of what you want to research or write about, but chances are you aren't writing a multi-volume treatise on the subject. The more narrow your topic is, the more likely you will be to contribute something of value to the field.If you're working on a research paper for school, you can use the page requirements (or limits) as a guide to narrow your topic.
Use the same approach if you're writing an article for a website or print publication, and have been given a word limit.
For example, ""butterflies"" probably is too broad for a 20-page research paper. If you know you want to write about butterflies, narrow your topic to a particular species of butterflies, or butterflies found in a particular geographic area.
You may have to do some basic preliminary research to appropriately narrow your topic. This gives you a sense of how much information is available. If it's more than you could possibly dig through, consider narrowing your topic again.;
, For a science-based research project, it can help to think of your goals as the hypotheses that guide a scientific experiment. For other types of research, think in terms of questions you hope to answer through your research.Typically, you'll want to create a basic thesis statement for your final report. This is what you ultimately want your research to prove.
Creating a thesis statement before you've even begun your research might seem backwards, but to research effectively, you need to know what you're looking for.
For example, maybe you have narrowed your butterfly topic to focus on why butterflies are attracted to a particular park in your hometown. Your thesis statement at this stage might be ""Butterflies are attracted to Panorama Park because of the flowers planted there.""
Keep in mind that you can adjust your thesis statement later if your research shows that it's inaccurate or inappropriate.
To return to the butterfly example, your thesis statement means you are focusing your research on the park you named and the flowers that are planted in that park. If you find out through your research that the butterflies are not particularly fond of those flowers, you may have to adjust your thesis.

, To accurately plan the scope of your project, think about who you are and why you're doing this research. If you're doing research for a school project, your scope will be more limited than if you are attempting to unearth a new discovery or theory in a particular field.Essentially, the scope of your project is how far you're going to go. For example, if you're writing a research paper on the role of the Germans in the American Revolutionary War, the role of the French in the same war would be outside the scope of your project.
The scope of your project may be dictated to you, for example through an assignment sheet from your teacher or professor.
Keep your scope in mind as you're planning your research strategy. You don't want to get bogged down in your research or spend too much time chasing after information that turns out to be irrelevant.
If you find something that doesn't fall within the scope of your project, you can quickly discard it and move on to something else.

, Target your research by figuring out what types of sources will be helpful to you and potentially have information you need for your project. Understanding the types of sources you'll need helps you make the most efficient use of your research time.For example, if you're doing research on the butterflies in a local park, surveys of local residents on how they feel about the butterflies probably isn't going to be helpful for you. However, research conducted by students at a nearby university might be beneficial.
Focus on the type of source you need. If you're working on a political science or sociology research paper, polls and statistics may be relevant.
However, if you're writing a paper in the hard sciences, you want to focus on scientific experiments and journal articles.
If your teacher or professor has given you a reading list or identified good sources, start there. Consider it a jumping-off point rather than something to hit as a last resort.

, Particularly if you're going to be doing a lot of your research on the internet, the key words you choose will determine how successful your research is. Based on your general knowledge and early reading on your topic, think of words that will get you the information you need.You may want to do basic internet searches just so you can get an idea of how effective your key words will be.
For example, if you're writing a research paper on butterflies in a local park, the key word ""butterfly"" will bring up entirely too much information to be useful for you.
Try to make your key words as specific as possible. Once you have your basic key words, look for synonyms of those words, or other related words or phrases.
Write all the words you brainstorm on a sheet of paper so you don't forget them or lose track of them.
Leave plenty of space around each word so you can take notes or make comments on the effectiveness of each word search as you research.

, Before you set out to research, you need a few basic items so you can take notes and organize your thoughts. Effective research requires not just finding the information you need, but being able to put all the pieces together to complete a cohesive report.One of the easiest methods to organize your research notes is to buy a stack of index cards. At the top of each card, you'll write the name of the source you're taking notes about.
If you're required to use a particular citation format, you might want to create a formatted citation for the source at the top of the card. It will save you time later on when you're working on your final paper.
Beyond index cards, you'll also want to gather highlighters, tabs or flags, and adhesive notes. These will help you keep track of information you find in print sources and organize your thoughts as you research.

, The most effective research focuses on primary sources, which are documents or objects directly related to or involved in the subject of your research. Primary sources are considered the most reliable.Whether a source is considered primary depends on its relation to the topic. Some sources can be primary for one topic but not for another.
For example, if you're doing research on D-Day, newspaper articles from June 6, 1944 or a few days afterward would be considered primary sources. However, newspaper articles from 2014 would not.
Primary sources are the heart of research, and what differentiates an actual research project from a book report. If you're reading what someone else wrote about your topic and then summarizing what you read, that's a book report – not research.
Focusing on primary sources means you may have to get off the internet and go to a library. Some primary sources, such as historic documents and newspapers, have been digitized and are available online. However, many have not.
Additionally, databases and digital archives of primary sources often are only accessible by subscription. Public and university libraries often maintain subscriptions to these digital resources, but you'll have to use a library computer to get to them.

, As you're reading the sources you've found, note-taking is important. You don't want to have to read the same thing over and over again. Framing the ideas or facts presented in your source also is a way to learn the information.If you're using the index-card method, jot down a few words to indicate the idea or fact you found in that source. Include a page number if available so you can cite to it directly or quickly find it again.
If you see something in a source you want to quote, put it on your notecard. However, do something to make it stand out from the rest of your notes so you don't inadvertently include it in your report as your own words.
For example, you may want to highlight a quote so it stands out at a glance as a quote, and not your own notes. You also could write it in a different color.
Likewise, as you read a source you may have thoughts of your own, or additional questions you want to explore. Highlight those or write them in a different color so you can instantly recognize them as your own thoughts, not something that should be attributed to your source.

, Secondary sources are, as the label indicates, second to primary sources. Typically these are academics, journalists, or other researchers commenting on or interpreting information related to your topic.The authors of secondary sources are not involved directly in the subject they're discussing – otherwise they would be primary sources.
Rather, they are using their own knowledge and expertise to interpret, comment, analyze, investigate, or contextualize something.
Secondary sources can be extremely valuable to you in making sense of the primary sources you've found, but it's important to avoid over-using them.
With secondary sources, the most important thing to keep in mind when taking notes are ideas. If an author you read has an idea or theory about the topic you're researching that resonates with you, take out a note card and write that idea down. Then if you bring it up in your report you can credit them with having the idea.
Taking a theory or idea you read somewhere else and acting like you came up with it is plagiarism. The most effective research builds on ideas and theories introduced by others, rather than stealing them.

, A strong secondary source typically will have extensive footnotes and a bibliography that includes citations to works you've already encountered in your research. This lets you know that you're on the right track.When something was published can be a strong indicator of whether you should rely on it. Ideally, you should check the date of publication before you even read the material.
Whether dates matter depends on the subject you're researching. If you're researching a historical event, you'll likely be making use of material dated any time from the date of the event to the present.
However, in other areas of research older sources are likely to be outdated and unusable. For example, if you were researching how schoolchildren use the internet, you wouldn't want to use an article written in the early 2000s as a source. Use of the internet has changed significantly since then.

, With primary sources, the authority is obvious. However, with secondary sources, you need to examine the identity and expertise of the author, as well as the biases they might have.If an author is biased, it can undermine their authority, even if they have tremendous expertise on the subject you're researching.
For example, suppose you're researching the butterflies in a local park. You find a lengthy, detailed, and informative article in a reputable science journal that discusses the very butterflies you're researching.
However, the article is written by a scientist who is infamous for their denial of climate change. This position means they aren't well-respected by most of the scientific community.
If their bias has little to nothing to do with the subject at hand, or if they wrote the butterfly article before they spoke out against climate change, you might still be able to use that source.
If you do plan to use a source with a potentially biased or compromised author, use caution. If you're working on a project for school, ask your teacher or professor about it.

, Tertiary sources go one level beyond secondary sources. Frequently they are a summary of secondary sources, such as an encyclopedia article or a review in a scientific or academic journal.These sources can be helpful for you in finding new articles and sources to use, but you typically don't want to cite them directly in your research.
Newspaper and magazine articles also can be tertiary sources. Pay attention to what you're reading. If the writer is talking about, for example, a series of studies conducted at different universities that came to opposing conclusions, seek out the studies themselves rather than citing to that article.
At the same time, tertiary sources can be a quick way to find new sources, and to understand more about a potentially dense article or book before you dive into it yourself.

, Plagiarism means taking someone else's words and presenting them as though they are your own. Not only is this wrong from a moral or ethical standpoint, but if you are in school it could result in you getting a failing grade on your project or worse.To understand plagiarism, put yourself in the author's shoes. They put a lot of work into their own project to come up with those words. Properly citing them acknowledges that work and shows that you appreciate it.
Moreover, you are showing your teachers, editors, or colleagues that you are an upstanding and respectful member of the academic or journalistic community – and that you're making a productive contribution to the field of research.
Be aware that many high schools, universities, and other publications use plagiarism checkers that will find words you have copied.
Even if you think you won't get caught because you're using a relatively obscure source, the proliferation of plagiarism checkers makes it more likely that you will.

, Whether you're using footnotes or a ""works cited"" section at the end of your paper, actively citing the sources you used strengthens your own original work by building the research foundation on which it relies.Always provide a citation for facts – things that can be proven true or false. This is so your reader can confirm the fact that you've presented in your report. The best source for a fact is always a primary source.
You also should cite opinions, analysis, speculation, or interpretation that is not your own. For example, suppose you have a source for your butterfly research that believes the butterflies are attracted to the park because people walk their dogs there and butterflies love dogs.
If you want to use this opinion in your report, credit it to the specific person that said it. Using phrases like ""studies show"" or ""some scientists believe"" won't tell your reader anything.
Instead, you might write ""Meredith Monarch, butterfly expert at the University of Lepidoptera, speculated that butterflies frequent the park because they enjoy frolicking with the dogs there.""

, If you're writing a research report for school, your teacher or professor may require you to use a particular citation method. Otherwise, you typically want to use the method that is prevalent in the field.Citation styles or formats may seem arbitrary to you, but for those in the field, the punctuation and formatting serve as short-hand. Someone familiar with a particular style can look at a citation and instantly know what each thing means.
Different fields use different citation methods, which can be confusing if you've done research in several areas of study.
For example, if you're writing a science paper, you typically will use APA (American Psychological Association) style.
However, for a research paper in history or political science, you'll more likely use the Turabian style.

, If your research report is 90 percent quotes, you haven't personally contributed anything. You're simply summarizing what you've read. To adequately report on your research, you need to bring your sources together in a cohesive and original way.Generally, you only want to have a direct quote from a source when the words themselves are of particular importance, or if the language is so original and succinct it would be nearly impossible to phrase it better.
For example, if you're writing a research paper on the Gettysburg Address, you likely will include direct quotes from the speech itself, since those words would hold particular importance.
A source's original words can provide color or enhance the meaning of your own thoughts, or can be quoted as an example of a particular line of thought.
When you paraphrase, you're putting the information from a source into your own words, rather than quoting the source directly.
Keep in mind that paraphrasing doesn't mean simply changing a few words to synonymous words, or altering the word order.
For example, ""Quick brown foxes jump over lazy dogs"" would not be an acceptable paraphrase of ""The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.""

Identify your research topic.,
Understand the assignment.,
Determine the types of information you'll need.,
Do preliminary research.,
Narrow your research focus.,
Access academic sources.,
Evaluate your sources.,
Organize your information.,
Cite your sources.",How to Research a Topic," Sometimes you get to pick a topic and sometimes your teacher or professor assigns you a topic. Even so, you usually still get to pick your angle of focus. Pick an idea you find interesting and go from there.


In the beginning stages you don't need to have your topic super focused. A basic idea of what you're looking for is fine. As you do more research you'll narrow it down.
For example: If you're researching Shakespeare's Hamlet, you can start with just looking into information about Hamlet before you narrow it down to focus on, say, the importance of madness in Hamlet.;
, There are a variety of things you need to understand about your assignment before you start researching. How much information do you need? If you're typing a 10 page report, then you'll need more information than a 5 paragraph essay. What information do you need?If the assignment is a research paper, you're going to need facts rather than opinions about the topic, especially if it is a research paper about a scientific topic like depression.
If you're writing a persuasive essay or creating a persuasive presentation you'll need your own opinions and facts to support those opinions. It's a good idea to include opposing opinions so you can address and/or debunk them.
If you're writing an analysis piece, such as the importance of madness in Hamlet, you're going to be using your opinions on the piece in question, as well as opinions of scholars who have worked with the text and information about madness in Shakespeare's time and Elizabethan literary conventions.

, This includes things like the format of the material, how important time is to your topic, how important place and languages are to your topic. Do you need facts, opinions, analyses, or research studies, or a mixture?


Think about the format of the material. Are you going to find the best information in a book, or a journal, or a newspaper? If you're doing medical research you'll probably need to look in a medical journal, whereas research Hamlet will need books and articles in literary periodicals.
Consider whether your information needs to be up-to-date (like medical or scientific discoveries) or whether you can use sources that were written in the 1900s. If you're looking at history, do you need specific documents from your time period?

, When you're starting out it's best to do some basic, over-view type of research. This will help give you ideas for a potential focus for your topic. Stick to broad sources that give an overview of the work.If you have a course textbook look at the bibliography at the back of the book. This can give you some basic overview ideas for research material.
Look through sources like the Oxford Dictionary of X (your topic), or the Cambridge Companion to X. Reference sources and books (like encyclopedias) are great places to start getting your basic information.
Make sure that you take notes on things that interest you about the topic, because you can choose from your notes what how you will narrow the focus on your topic.

, Once you have your preliminary research completed you'll need to narrow the focus of your topic. If you have a bunch of different information on Hamlet, instead of trying to cram it all into a 10-page essay, tease out your favorite angle (like the importance of madness).


The narrower the focus, the easier it will be to find relevant research material. This means coming up with a specific thesis statement that says what exactly you are trying to argue or research.
It's okay if you need to adjust your focus as you research if you find something that disproves or changes your thesis.

, You'll need to look at valid research sources and you'll need to evaluate those materials as you research. While the internet can be useful for research, it is particularly difficult to evaluate the validity of the information it provides. Always remember to record your research and where you found it.Look for books through WorldCat. It will show you if your library has the books you need and it will give you ideas for books for your research topic. Usually you can borrow books through your university or library (through programs like ILLiad).
Look into databases like EBSCOHost, or JSTOR for a variety of articles about different topics.
Try to find academic and trade journals on your topic, or government reports, legal documents. You can even use radio and t.v. broadcasts, or interviews and lectures.
Many databases are divided up by subject, so you can type in your research topic and see what articles and suggestions come up. Try to be as specific as possible when you're putting in research topics. So don't just look up ""Hamlet,"" but look up things like ""Hamlet and madness"" or something like ""Elizabethan views on madness.""

, It can be difficult when you're researching (especially on the internet) to find and make sure you have credible research material. You'll need to pay attention to who is making the claims in your sources, where they get their information, how much is it supported by other scholars in the field.Make sure that your sources clearly indicate the author(s) and who the author is affiliated with.
Is the author offering facts or opinions? And are these facts and opinions clearly substantiated with further research and citations? Do these citations link to credible sources (universities, research facilities, etc.)? Cross-check the information provided and see if it can be backed.
If the author uses vague or sweeping generalizations without any information to back them up (example: ""Madness was despised in Elizabethan times""), or if the arguments are completely one-sided without acknowledging other opinions and viewpoints, it's probably not a good research source.

, Once you feel you've done enough research, organize the information you've gathered. This will help give your final paper or essay or project a form, so you know where and how the information is going to be used. It's also a good way to see if you have any gaps in knowledge that you need to plug.


Make sure that you've come to a definite result or conclusion about your research topic. If you haven't, you'll need to do some more research., Once you're finished with your research topic (be it essay, paper, or project) you'll need to cite your sources. Different courses and disciplines have different ways of citing so make sure you use the correct citation method for your discipline or course.APA tends to be the social sciences like psychology, or education.
MLA format tends to be literature, arts, and the humanities.
AMA tends to be used for medicine, health, and the biological sciences.
Turabian was designed for college students to use with all subjects, but is one of the lesser known formats. You can use this one if you aren't sure which to use.
Chicago style is used with all subjects in the ""real world"" by books, magazines, newspapers, and other non-scholarly publications.

Define the goals, objectives, and research question.,
Read previous studies and researches to find out the most commonly and/or effectively used methodological approaches to collect data.,
Find out the time, resources, and capabilities you have that would enable you to carry out a research design better than the other.,
Write down the entire research methodological approach in detail and review.",How to Select a Research Methodology," It is essential to understand and have clarity about what you want to research before deciding upon how to research. To use an analogy, if Research is a journey goal is the destination and methodology is the route. Determine the variables that need to be studied in order to get an answer to the research question. If the goals serve as the destination of the journey then the variables are the milestones. Just as the milestones guide you through the journey and keep you from going astray, sticking to the variables, and working upon the variables, helps reach the end goal on time in the best possible way.;
, There are a slew of ways to conduct a research but not all are meant for your research. Determining the right methodology in dark can be very difficult. It is a good idea to read previous studies in your area and find out the methodology they used and the limitations or recommendations of the same.

, Not all forms of data collection are same, while some are time consuming, others might need more labor days, while the rest might be expensive. It is essential to base your decision after giving a thought to these limitations.

, Once you choose a particular approach to conduct your research, it is essential to put down everything on a paper, including the approximate time and resources each step might consume. This will help you get a clear idea of the route that your research would take and the hurdles on the way.

, The dissertation should be organized so that chapters are focused on a specific question. The questions could be wide-ranging, based on a thought-process, an aspect of your methodology, or other issue related to the research. Be sure the chapters not only address t he questions, but answers them., Once the research is done, the chapters should support a central idea you’re attempting to make. They should support what you are attempting to prove through your detailed research and methodology.Help support your argument by avoiding debatable statements related to the chapter’s questions.A few examples follow:


Debatable – Approximately 60% of the voters supported the referendum.

Non-debatable – Microprocessors are smaller today than they were 10 years ago.

Ensure you understand what your field and your department require in a dissertation. You may also want to read approved dissertations from past students to gain a better understanding of how to structure a dissertation in your field.Find out if there is a word limit, and which parts of your dissertation (e.g. references, tables, abstract) are included in the word-count.
Determine which material should be included or excluded. There may be specifics on what is acceptable.
Ask which materials are less important in the committee’s opinion, and should be demoted from main content to appendices.

, The title page may be specific to your university, maybe even your department or discipline. In general, however, it should be in all capital letters, with centered margins. Exclude page numbers, but the following attributes are usually a part of the dissertation title page:


The dissertation title is at the top.
The dissertation statement or purpose, which includes the degree for which the dissertation will be submitted, follows the title.
The name of the person submitting the dissertation, and the date of submission, are the final pieces., The abstract should summarize the dissertation and explain why the research is significant. Include your study’s background first. Next, breakdown both the methods and findings of the research. Finally, clearly explain all conclusions to the research. Each section should have enough words to provide sufficient information, but the overall length of the abstract should be no more than 350 words.Because the abstract needs to be a high-level summary, avoid using quotes or references in this section. The only exception is if you base your dissertation upon another’s work. In that situation, it’s appropriate to mention the work upon which yours rests.
One recommendation is to include a note or two devoted to each portion (e.g. introduction, methodology, conclusion) of the subsequent dissertation., On the page following the abstract, thank those who made your dissertation possible. Sometimes this section acknowledges only a handful of individuals; sometimes it’s more than a page long. From inspiring people to proof-readers, all manner of people can be thanked in whatever method desired.


The dissertation acknowledgements are not necessarily mandatory, but they provide a great opportunity for the writer to really thank those who have influenced and aided in the arduous dissertation process., Following the acknowledgments, start the content page(s) on a new sheet. Include both the sections of your dissertation and its sub-sections. It should also include the acknowledgement page. Center the words TABLE OF CONTENTS at the top of the page.
Make sure you right align the page numbers.

, Sometimes a bibliography is used, where all references, even those uncited, are listed.There are multiple possible structures in which the sources can be cited. Be sure to clarify beforehand whether your references should be in APA, MLA, Harvard, or Chicago style., The point of appendices is to include material that may not directly tie into your research, or information that has been referred to in the results of the dissertation. The appendices should be supplementary in nature, and not superfluous. Exceedingly large items like questionnaires and robust tables are perfect appendix inclusions.


Appendices aren’t typically included in word counts. Be sure to ask the committee or your advisor to clarify."

Change the tense.",How to Restate a Thesis," Many writers/speakers restate their thesis at the beginning of their conclusion, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be the first sentence.Sketching out a rough conclusion (the main points you want to get across) will give you an idea of the best place for the restated thesis before you actually try your hand at writing the restatement.
Depending on the nature of your paper or of your conclusion, you may want to open your conclusion with a question or some other kind of rhetorical device, rather than a restatement of the thesis. While writing often follows prescribed formulas (such as the 5-paragraph essay), there is no one-size-fits-all approach for writing a concluding paragraph, and you may need to try out several positions for your thesis restatement to find out what works best.;
, When your reader read the original thesis in the introduction, s/he hadn’t read the rest of the paper, but now s/he has—use that to your advantage. In restating your thesis, draw on the information you’ve discussed or relationships you’ve established throughout the paper.


You can use the restated thesis to provide a greater level of sophistication or emotional impact to the original argument. For example, if your initial argument was that buying pets as holiday gifts is dangerous, you might restate your thesis this way: ""Remember: buying that puppy as a Christmas present might seem like a good idea at the time, but it could end in the tragedy of another homeless dog by Easter.""
You can also restate your thesis to incorporate the relationship you've built with your reader. For example, if your essay was about developing business partnerships, you could begin your restatement by saying something like, ""As a businessperson...."" Not only will this make your restatement different from the original, it will help draw connections with important elements from the essay/speech.

, question. A good thesis statement will address the ""So what?"" question -- in other words, it will explain why your argument is significant. Why should your reader care about your topic? Revisiting this issue in your conclusion will help give your conclusion the weight it needs.

For example, if you have written an essay about alcohol use on college campuses, you could revisit the ""So what?"" question in your conclusion by providing a statement about what that means for students and for college officials. It could look something like this: ""Because alcohol abuse depends on more than just the legal drinking age, it is crucial that students be educated about how alcohol abuse occurs, and also that college officials broaden their perspective to include a greater variety of aspects."", When beginning your conclusion with the restatement of your thesis, avoid using phrases such as “In conclusion” or “As this paper has shown.” These are tired, overworked phrases that signal to the reader a lack of creativity and originality, rather than a fresh take on what you’ve said in your paper, which is what you want your restatement to achieve.


You may be able to use something like “In conclusion” at the end of a speech, however. Signaling or signposting words—like “in conclusion” or “next”—are very important in speeches because listeners only have one chance to follow along with what you’re saying, and these words help them to keep their place.

, When restating the thesis, assume that you have proven it over the course of the paper and don’t make apologies or hedge, which will weaken the conclusion and thus the paper.


Avoid saying things like, “It seems like” or “It is possible that” in the restatement. One exception would be if this conditional language is part of your original thesis statement and your paper is devoted to discussing a topic that is only a possibility, not something you are stating is definitely the case. Otherwise, maintain a level of confidence.
While maintaining confidence is crucial to the success of your paper, it’s important to acknowledge when opposition exists and not to use absolute statements which may alienate readers. Confidence in your position and in the fact that you’ve proven your point is one thing; blind certainty in your opinion is another!

, Find synonyms for important words and concepts in your original thesis and replace them in your restatement.You can use your word processor’s thesaurus function for this, an online thesaurus, or a good old-fashioned paper thesaurus. If you use a thesaurus, however, check your chosen word in the dictionary to ensure that you know its precise meaning. Thesauruses group words very loosely by general meaning, and there is often a significant difference in connotation between them.
It’s not necessary to change every single word, such as prepositions (“in,” “on,” “above,” “over”) and articles (“a,” “an,” and “the”). Spend your time focusing on words/phrases that receive the most emphasis, like those that are central to the points you’re making.

, The restatement should be different from the original thesis not only in its language but also in structure. This applies at the level of clauses (within sentences) and the overall sentence level.Try varying your sentences by starting with different parts of speech. For example, if you began the original thesis with a prepositional phrase, start the restatement with the subject of the sentence. For instance, if the thesis starts out “Around the turn of the nineteenth century in England, women frequently…”, you might start your restatement out with something like “Women in early nineteenth-century….”
Another way to vary the structure is to present your points in a different order. Many thesis statements include three ideas, presented in the order in which they will be discussed in the body paragraphs. When restating, you can list the points in an alternate order., In your introduction, your thesis statement was probably one sentence (or maybe two), with all the points made right in a row. In your restatement you can try splitting your points up across multiple sentences and spreading them out across the paragraph.This will create variety between the thesis and restatement and also allow you to suggest how you have proven the various points throughout the body of the paper.

, If you’re writing a speech, your thesis statement was likely written in the future tense, telling your audience what you are about to do over the course of your speech (e.g., “I will analyze the effects of oil drilling”); in your restatement, you should change to the past tense and tell the audience what you already have done (e.g., “I explained how detrimental oil drilling is for wildlife and humans”).

Begin to write.",How to Research," It is important, with any assignment, to understand fully what is expected of you before you start. Be sure that you know the details of your instructor’s expectations for the research process and the resulting product. If you have a printout with assignment details on it, keep it with you while you work and reread it occasionally to be sure that you are staying on track. A few questions to ask or keep in mind about your research follow:


How many sources are expected or required?
Is the final project a paper or a multimodal (creative) project?
How long should your final product be?
Are there minimums for the types of sources (ie: print versus web-based)?
How long do you have to work on your research?
What resources are available for you to conduct your research (for example, customized databases, reserved library books, etc)?;
, Consider yourself lucky if you are assigned a topic; you can skip this step! In some ways, determining what topic to research can be the most difficult part of your project.It’s often best to select something that you already have some interest in and at least a cursory knowledge about, but not something that you are so passionate about that you may find it difficult to be objective.


Many instructors will provide you with a list to choose a topic from: if you have such a list, circle 3-5 topics that jump out at you. If you have time, look them up online and see if you feel genuinely curious about one of the topics. Rank your top 5, as you may not be able to use your first choices if others in your class have already “claimed” them.
If your topic selection is wide-open, brainstorm a list of potential topics within the parameters of the assignment. If you are not given parameters, you may have to come up with them on your own; you can assume, for example, that if you’re in a biology class, your research topic will have to do with biology. If you are assigned parameters, such as “research an endangered species,” you should be able to find a list and select a specific animal, such as the cheetah.

, The outcome of your final research project will partially determine the depth and breadth of your research. It is important to know ahead of time whether the purpose of the project is to convey information, make a persuasive argument, or present differing viewpoints about an issue.


If the research project is simply a factual report about an endangered species, you will want to present as much information as you can about the animal, its habitat, and influences on its livelihood.
If your research project is an essay about a controversial topic, you’re likely to need to take a position and persuade your audience towards your position. For example, an essay about the effectiveness of juvenile imprisonment would likely require you to take a position on the issue.

, It is important that you limit your project to an appropriate scope before you begin.If your instructor has provided a list of topics, she has likely already considered appropriate scope. However, if you are selecting a topic, you will need to find a balance between broad and specific that is appropriate to the length of your final project.


For example, the topic “imprisonment in the US” is extremely broad, as it covers a range of issues and life stages as well as a large geographical area. Instead, limiting the scope of your research to “juvenile imprisonment,” “post-prison reintegration into society,” or “prison conditions at Rikers Island in NY” will lead to a more focused project.

, It may be helpful to have a central question that guides your research. You could even write the question on an index card and keep it with you while you research. Revisiting your research question while you are working will help keep your research focused and may cut down on wasted time.


For example, your research question for the cheetah as an endangered species could be either “why is the cheetah endangered?” or “how can we save the cheetah?”
For example, your research question for an essay about juvenile imprisonment could be “is juvenile imprisonment effective?” or “what is a more effective solution to juvenile delinquency than imprisonment?”

, Research projects often take more time than you expect them to, and they are quite difficult to do at the last minute. To make a research schedule, begin with your final project due date and work backwards, setting dates for yourself for your rough draft, your prewriting, your research organization, conducting your research, and selecting and limiting your topic. Be sure to plan adequate time outside of your home, working at your school or public library.

, If you are having trouble choosing a topic, limiting your topic, or developing a research question, try talking to your instructor or a school or public librarian. These individuals are trained to assist students do research, and they can help guide you to find a topic that you will enjoy researching that will produce a successful paper or project.


It is best to talk to your teacher early in the research process, soon after the project is assigned. If you were given 2 months to work on a research project and you wait until the week before it is due to approach her, she may not be as enthusiastic about helping you select a topic.

, This may seem like an obvious step, but you will need to choose the words that you use to research.To do this, brainstorm a list of words that are related to your topic. You may find that you need to revise your search terms as you progress.If you are searching for sources about the endangered species cheetah, your search terms may be “cheetah,” “endangered,” “habitat,” “climate change,” “grasslands,” “fur trade,” and “conservation.”
If you are searching for sources about juvenile imprisonment, your search terms may be “juvenile,” “youth,” “imprisonment,” “prisons,” “juvenile delinquency,” “effectiveness of imprisonment,” and “detention.”

, Boolean operators are words that function as limiting commands. They give you the ability to combine keywords and limit your search. The most common Boolean terms are AND, OR, and NOT. Another common Boolean limiter is to place quotation marks around exact phrases.For example “juvenile detention” (with quotation marks) would give you sources that use the terms together as a phrase, while juvenile detention (without quotation marks) would yield results for both “juvenile” and “detention” separately.
For example, you may want to search prisons AND juvenile to ensure sources talk about both terms.
For example, you may want to search cheetah NOT girls to exclude the Disney movie Cheetah Girls from your search about cheetahs.

, Many instructors and librarians will compile research resources for a particular research project. There may be a customized database on your library’s webpage that automatically limits your search to pre-approved sources, or your librarian may have set aside a cart of printed books that will be reserved in the library for the duration of the research project. These types of customized resources will save you time and make your research process easier.


If customized research aids are not available, you should still consult the library’s databases. Often, the sources in the databases are legitimate academic sources that are appropriate for an academic assignment.

, As tempting as it can be to open up your favorite search engine and look up your research keywords, this shouldn’t be your first stop for research. If you use a common search engine, you will have to evaluate the legitimacy of each source you find, and you will have to sort through many, many pages of often irrelevant search materials.


Common search engines use some limiters, but often the Boolean operators do not work effectively.

, If you feel overwhelmed by starting your research project, talk to a librarian who specializes in research assistance. Remember that you are not bothering them; it’s their job to help students research!


Ask for a few specific starting points (don’t let them overwhelm you further with a long list of research sources) and let your research “snowball” on its own.
You’re likely to find that once you get started, it will become easier to find and evaluate sources, find the research you need, and move forward with your research project.

, Now that you have started to research, you need to collect the information. As you read sources, collect notes from the source. You can either take direct quotes from the source (word-for-word; indicate that the information is a direct quote by putting quotation marks around it) or you can paraphrase the information (put it in your own words). Either way, you will need to keep track of and cite the source.


You can take notes by hand by putting them in a research notebook or put individual facts on index cards. Be sure to indicate the source when you write the notes; you might want to number your sources and place the number from the source next to the piece of information/research.You can also take notes on the computer by copying and pasting source material into a word processing document. Be sure to keep track of what source information came from; you may want to provide a link to a source and a citation, then place research from that source below the citation.

, Plagiarizing information, or taking someone else’s writing or information without giving them credit for it, will likely result in (at best) failing the assignment or (at worst) facing disciplinary action and/or failing the course. Always cite any material that does not come out of your own head. This means that much of your work will be cited from other places.


Some information that is considered common knowledge, like facts that are found in many different sources such as dates of birth scientific names, do not need to be cited.However, when in doubt, cite it out!

, Primary sources are sources that come directly from a person. Original writing, interviews, and the first time scientific studies are published all count as primary sources. Secondary sources are sources that write about or analyze the primary sources. Your instructor may specify that you need to include primary as well as secondary sources. Some projects, however, may not require primary source data.

, The easiest way to find high-quality sources is to search through your library database. If you cannot do that and you need to evaluate the source yourself, ask yourself the following questions:


Who published the source?
What seems to be the goal of the publication?
Is the source objective or academic?
If an organization produced the source, is it a nonpartisan and fair organization?
If an individual wrote the source, do they have any credentials listed?
Some sources to avoid include: blogs (which are almost entirely opinion-based), sites that are trying to sell you something, sites with excessive (and obnoxious) advertisements, and sites from biased or questionable organizations.
Sources that tend to be better include: government sources, peer-reviewed academic journals, big-name newspaper articles (but not opinion sections or letters to the editor), national nonprofit organizations, university-affiliated sources, and scientific organizations.

, Some sources, particularly those printed in academic journals, can be difficult for someone outside the field to understand. This can lead to frustration and confusion on your part, as well as a misuse of information; if you don’t fully understand what is being said, you may use the information improperly.


Consider using the “five finger test:” go to one page of the source. For each word that you don’t recognize or understand, put a finger up. If you get to all five fingers up before the end of the page, stop and find a new source., You should use some print sources if possible. Most libraries have high-quality books and reference materials to aid research. Use a few print sources as well as academic database sources. Try not to rely too heavily on one author or organization for your researched information.

, Also known as a “works cited” page, a reference page is essentially a list of the sources you used for research. Do not wait until you have finished the research project to compile the reference page; have a working reference page as you do your research, and finalize it before you turn it in.Be sure that you format your reference page in the appropriate style. If your assignment does not specify, ask your teacher or librarian which style would be appropriate for the subject area., It’s important to keep track of which research comes from which source, but you may also want to be able to physically move around your research. If you can “tag” each piece of research with its source (ie: by providing a source number or writing the last name of the author of the source next to each piece of research), you will have the flexibility to cut and paste the pieces of research so that you can group the research items into what will become sections of your project. Some ways you can cut and paste your


Write your information on index cards, with one fact or quotation on each card.Type information and quotations on separate lines in a word processing program so that you can move the items around.
Print out your typed research and physically cut each piece of research into strips that you can move around.

, Once you have the flexibility of being able to move the research items physically or within a word processing program, group items together into what will become sections of your paper or project.


For example, if you are writing about juvenile imprisonment, you may group your information into “causes,” “short-term effects,” “long-term effects,” “alternatives,” and “education.”
For example, a research project on cheetahs may be grouped into “habitat change,” “species information,” “conservation efforts,” and “future predictions.”

, One of the best ways of preparing to convert your disparate research into a more cohesive final project (particularly a paper) is to write an outline. With an outline, you will create several main topics (usually indicated by roman numerals), followed by sub-topics (indicated by uppercase letters), and then sub-sub topics (indicated by numbers). An outline can help you organize your research, reveal places that are unbalanced and need more or less research, and prepare you to begin writing.An example for an outline may be:


I. Predictors of juvenile imprisonment.

A. Race and Ethnicity Factors

1. “Direct quotation” (source 1)
2. Facts and figures (source 4)
3. Additional data (source 2)


B. Family Situation

1. Data on parental imprisonment (source 2)
2. Data on economic status/poverty (sources 3 and 4)




Note: the numbered sections in the example above would be your actual research items from your index cards or other research method.

, Now that you have conducted and organized your research, you should be ready to compile it in the form of an essay or project. Be sure you include source citations in the proper format as you write, and don’t be afraid to go back and conduct more research if you feel like you have a weak section or missing information.

Identify the sample type and size.,
Examine the survey questions and responses.The questions asked of respondents are usually presented in a survey report or paper that summarizes the survey findings.,
Understand the numbers and percentages.,
Distinguish between the categories of respondents.For example, a survey report might present the opinions of people in various age groups, such as 18 to 25 year olds, 26 to 40 year olds, and 41 to 65 year olds.,
Look over tables and charts.You might encounter one or many types of charts and tables in the survey data.,
Read the survey report implications and conclusion.,
Determine what kind of survey it is.,
Determine the objective of the survey.,
Read the directions.,
Answer the questions.,
Move on to follow-up questions, if applicable.,
Ask questions.,
Answer honestly.",How to Read a Survey," Surveyors may have selected a representative sample (a sample size that represents the general population) or a planned sample (a sample that focuses on the opinions and views of a certain subset like Millennials).Knowing what type of sample you have and how large it is will help you figure out how valuable the information is.


Generally, the larger the sample size, the better. If the sample size is below the threshold that you’ve determined is relevant, you will not get an accurate picture of overall sentiment.
Identify samples that are too narrow.For instance, if half of a business’ customers are women and half are men, but the survey is administered mostly to women, it won’t offer a truly representative sample of that business’ customers.;
, The inquiries may be presented as verbal descriptions or summaries, and/or as raw survey responses.


Use the category headings to better understand how groups of questions work together to answer or explore a single idea. For example, a survey about transportation habits might have a series of questions regarding individuals’ transportation habits on the weekend, with questions pertaining to this issue grouped in a separate category.

, Survey results are typically presented, at least in part, as numbers and percentages.For example, in a publication's survey to 100 readers about their opinions of article length, 82% might respond with ""about right."" In other words, 82 out of 100 people were content with the publication's article length.


Look for abbreviations. Survey questions may be presented as abbreviations or in code form. In this case, a chart key or explanation is generally included somewhere on the survey report elaborating on the abbreviations and/or codes.

, Alternately, they might differentiate between individuals who are white, black, Asian, Native American, or Hispanic. Look for breakdowns of data by age, race, economic status or other characteristic.

, Pay attention to color, direction, and line when looking at tables, charts, graphs, and other visual representations of survey data.


When reading graphs and charts, look for labels on the horizontal and vertical axis. These indicate what is being measured on each axis.
Look for color-coding on bar graphs. A graph may also make use of different colors to denote specific groups or responses.
A chart may present survey data in the form of dotted, solid, bold or otherwise formatted chart lines to distinguish different data sets.

, The report's conclusion will summarize survey findings in a general way and -- possibly -- suggest next steps, if any are necessary.The implications might require specific actions, and the authors of the survey report might suggest that more studies or surveys are necessary to learn more about whatever topic the survey was interested in.


Determine if the survey data requires action. For example, the survey data might indicate that your employees are very unhappy, and that you should therefore make necessary changes to specific tasks, manufacturing processes, or workplace arrangements.With your survey data in hand, you can make informed decisions about important matters.

, A survey is a method of gathering information by asking specific questions of a group of individuals.The survey asks standardized questions of different people, and the answers are evaluated later by the researchers who designed the survey. The information this group (or “sample”) provides can be used to better understand attitudes or preferences about some topic (often a political, economic, social, or organizational topic). The main types of surveys you might read include:


internet surveys (questionnaires administered online)
in-person surveys (surveys given to you by a person in a controlled environment or on the street)
mail-in surveys (surveys that you get in the mail, complete, and then return to sender)

, The survey may be designed to gauge the popularity of a product or assess compliance to a regulatory requirement. Whatever the purpose, it should be stated explicitly on the survey or explained directly to you before the survey is administered.Surveys that do not state their purpose are unethical.

, Some surveys have directions that require you to circle one of several options (yes, no, or maybe). Other directions are more complicated and operate on a scale, usually 1-10 or 1-5.Reading the directions is important for understanding what responding with a value of 1 means compared to responding with a value of 10.


For instance, if answering a question like “How satisfied are you with your product?” you might be very satisfied and therefore circle 10. If the directions set 10 as very dissatisfied, however, you will have answered the question incorrectly.
Surveys are often broken down into sections, with a new set of directions at the top of each section. Read slowly so you understand the directions of each section. Don’t assume directions will remain the same throughout the survey.

, Be careful when reading survey questions. Small changes in wording can dramatically alter the meaning of the questions.For instance, a question that reads “How often do you go to the movies?” is not the same as a question asking, “How often do you watch movies?” since the latter could include watching movies at home as well as at the theater.

, Certain questions lead to other questions.For example, a survey may ask, “Do you smoke?” with an option to circle yes or no. After answering, the survey might then provide specific directions like “If yes, go on to the next question. If no, skip the next question.” Follow these directions carefully.


If there are no follow-up questions or directions, just move on to the next question. Continue until you’ve completed the survey.

, If you’re filling out a survey in person it is possible to ask questions for added clarity.For instance, suppose a survey asks, “Did you go to the movies more than three times this month or less than three times this month? Circle one.” Your answer might be neither if you went to the movies exactly three times that month. Therefore, you should ask the person administering the survey how they wish you to respond to this question.


Mail-in or online surveys, unfortunately, do not offer the chance to ask questions of the person who is administering the survey. In this case, just answer as best you can.

, The quality of the survey results depends on the honesty of the individuals responding. If you are given a survey, be honest in your responses. That way, the data the researchers are interested in collecting will be accurate."

Try writing a list of ideas, or create an ""idea map"" by circling your topic in the center of a page and writing new questions, arguments, and facts branching off of the central topic.Hopefully, your course readings, lectures, and class discussions will have given you enough background knowledge to select a topic. If not, review your class notes and browse online for additional background information.
It is not uncommon to change your topic after doing some research. You may end up narrowing the questions your essay will answer, or changing your topic completely.

, It will be easier to write on a topic you care passionately or curious about than one you have on which you have no strong feelings. You will feel motivated to research the issue thoroughly and should enjoy the writing process more.


If you can, try to focus on an are of the law that affects you. For example, if your family is involved in agriculture, you may be interested in writing about water use regulations.

, Academic researchers use ""primary, secondary, and tertiary sources. Primary sources are firsthand accounts of the subject matter. Secondary sources analyze primary sources. Tertiary sources provide an overview of primary and secondary sources.Your prompt may require you to use a certain number of primary and secondary sources, and may prohibit you from citing tertiary sources entirely. You may also be limited in the number of internet-based sources you can use, and may be required to do a certain amount of library research.


If you are prohibited from citing internet resources, you can still use online research to guide you to physical primary and secondary sources in your local library or bookstore.

, Tertiary sources include encyclopedias, dictionaries, guidebooks, and textbooks that distill or collect information from primary and secondary sources.Encyclopedia articles, well-sourced Wikipedia.org articles, and your course textbook should provide an overview of your subject and provide references. Usually, you should not cite to a tertiary source in your essay. Use these sources to find primary and secondary sources.


Look at footnotes, citations, and indexes in tertiary sources. These are great for finding books, articles, and legal cases that are relevant to your topic. Also take note of the names of authors, who may have written multiple works on your topic.

, If you can, go to a law library, which will have more specialized resources. A librarian can help you locate sources and navigate through state and federal case law reporters and books of statutory law. He or she may also provide you with access to subscription-only legal search engines.

, Different academic fields often use different search engines. In the Unites States, law students typically use HeinOnline.org for law review articles, Lexis Nexis or Westlaw to look up court opinions, and WorldCat or Google Books for books. Google Scholar is an excellent free resource for books and case opinions.


Also find search engines for related fields, such as history or political science. Ask your librarian to recommend specialized search engines tailored to other disciplines that may have contributed to your topic.

, Highlight or make note of important arguments, facts, and statistics. When you sit down to write your essay, you will want to be able to easily refer back to your sources so that you can quote and cite them accurately.

, Write down the structure of the argument and any helpful quotes. This will help you condense the argument when you reference or summarize the source in your essay.


Never cut and paste from the web into your notes or essay. This often leads to inadvertent plagiarism because students forget what is a quotation and what is paraphrasing. When gathering sources, paraphrase or add quotation marks in your outline.
Plagiarism is a serious offense. If you ultimately hope to be a lawyer, an accusation of plagiarism could prevent you from passing the character and fitness review.

, Law is a political subject, and any law adopted by a democracy is the product of debate. Thus, you should be able to find rich counter-arguments on both sides of any legal issue.

, Your thesis statement is the argument you are making. A thesis statements should be phrased as an argument, often using the word ""because."" For example, ""The exclusionary rule furthers justice because it discourages police and prosecutors from infringing on the rights of the accused,"" or ""The exclusionary rule impedes justice because it hampers the prosecution of criminals.""

, An outline typically begins with the thesis statement, and then lists each argument and counter-argument that will be addressed in the essay. Under each argument and counter-argument, include a bulleted list of facts from your research that support the argument. Note the source of each fact for use in your citations later.

, Briefly situate your topic within its greater historical context with a broad introduction. For example, if your topic is the exclusionary rule of evidence in the United States, open your essay with the importance and impact of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Finish your introduction with your thesis statement, which is the narrow question your essay will address.


An effective introduction takes the reader out of his world and into the world of your essay.Explain why the subject is important and briefly summarizes the rest of your argument. After reading your introduction, your reader should know what you are going to discuss and in what order you will be discussing it.
Be prepared to revise your introduction later. Summarizing your essay will be easier after you have written it, especially if you deviate from your outline.

, An essay is more than an outline with the bullet points removed. Explain each section of your outline in complete sentences, and remember to do the following:


State each argument of your essay as a statement that, if true, would support your thesis statement.
Provide supporting information drawn from primary and secondary sources that support your argument. Remember to cite your sources.
Provide your own original analysis, explaining to the reader that based on the primary and secondary sources you have presented, the reader should be persuaded by your argument.

, A strong piece of writing always addresses opposing points of view. You should accurately paraphrase any counter-argument to an argument you put forth, and then use evidence and analysis to argue why your reader should be persuaded by your argument and not by the counter-argument.

, A conclusion briefly summarizes your argument without restating each individual point. It should cement in the reader’s mind a new way of thinking about the subject. Conclude by strongly restating your thesis statement.

, The prompt provided by your professor should include instructions for the formatting of your essay. Make sure that your work complies with these instructions to avoid having points deducted from your grade.

, If your essay is for a college course, you most likely be asked to follow the Chicago Manual of Style or the Modern Language Association (MLA) style of citation.Law school journals and some undergraduate courses might require the Bluebook format, which is the traditional format for legal writing.Use the format requested by your professor.

, Make sure that your margins, spacing, font, and page numbers comply with the prompt. Check the font of the body of your essay, as well as the footnotes, if applicable. If a heading is required, review any guidelines for formatting your heading.

, Your prompt may impose minimum and/or maximum limits on your word count or number of pages. You may need to revise your work to meet those requirements.

, Start with the last sentence and read it. Then read the next one, slowly moving toward the beginning. This forces you to pay attention to the sentence construction without allowing you to get caught up in the flow of the argument.

, When listening to something read aloud, we more easily hear dropped words, misspelled words, and other errors. Microsoft Word comes with a “text to speech” function that will read your essay to you.To activate:


Open up a Word document. On the Quick Access Toolbar at the top, click on the down arrow. The words “Customize Quick Access Toolbar” will appear when you hover over the arrow for two seconds.
Click on the arrow. Then click on “More Commands.”
In the “Choose commands from” drop-down box, choose “All commands.”
Scroll down to find “Speak.” Highlight this and then click “add.” Then click “okay.” Now the Speak function should appear on your Quick Access Toolbar.
Highlight the text you want read back to you, and then click on the Speak icon. The text will be read back to you.

, Certain typos show up over and over in legal writing. For example, using “statue” when you meant “statute” is a common error. Other common errors in legal writing include using “well” for “will” or “torturous” for “tortious.”


Do not rely on a spell checker exclusively, as it will not catch typos like ""statute"" versus ""statue.""

, Ask her to poke holes in your argument or tell you what passages are vague or confusing. An outside reader will read your work more objectively than you can.


You can share the essay with someone outside of class, but a classmate more likely has the requisite knowledge to understand the subject matter of the essay.

, Your professor might require that you submit a rough draft. Read his or her comments carefully and address them in your final draft. Schedule a meeting with your professor to review any comments that are unclear.

, After taking some time away from your assignment, return to it with fresh eyes and an open mind. Sit down with your rough draft and a red pen and cross out sections that need to be rewritten. Dig back into your research and re-read your sources. You might see things differently now after getting outside input on your writing.

"
Decide what type of annual report you want.,
Get a company’s annual report.,
Get a 10-K.,
Read the letter from the chairperson.The letter from the chairperson of the Board of Directors or the CEO of the company is the opening section of an annual report.,
Read the business description.,
Look over the list of directors and officers of the company.This section might give short biographies of the individuals sitting on the board and company officers like the President or CEO.,
Look over the ten-year summary.,
Check out the risk factors.One of the areas in which the regular shareholder’s report and the official government annual report (form 10-K) differ is that the latter requires a risk assessment.,
Read the management discussion.,
Review the sales and marketing section.,
Read about the company’s holdings.Subsidiaries, brands, and addresses where the company has offices or plants will be listed here.,
Read the letter of certified public accountant (CPA) opinion.,
Review the financial statements.The financial statement of an annual report is the most critical part of the document.It includes the company's financial performance statistics, balance sheet, income statements, and cash flow statement.,
Review the stock price history.,
Look out for companies with changing messages.If a company is devoted to creating healthy customers one year and selling soda and candy the next, something may be wrong with its management and leadership.,
Beware of changing accounting practices.If, for instance, a company suddenly tallies up a large impairment charge (a reduction on the balance sheet due to a loss of goodwill), you should be worried why the company’s goodwill has diminished.,
Read the proxy statement.The proxy statement, or proxy, is an attachment to the official 10-K form that shows how much the company’s executives are being paid.,
Look for actual, not adjusted, earnings.",How to Read an Annual Report," The annual report could be an official document – the 10-K required by the Securities and Exchange Commission – or a less formal report distributed to shareholders and company insiders.While there is no universal format for annual reports, they usually contain the same basic components, including information about management and directors, financial data, projections on future growth, and market analysis.;
, If you own stock in a publicly traded company, the annual report should be mailed to you. You can also find a company's annual report on its official website. If you want to read the annual report of a private company, however, you must ask and receive permission from the company, which will also provide the report if approved.Private company annual reports are not generally held to the same standards as public companies, including the requirement to have audited books.

, While not every company puts out an annual report, all public companies must file a 10-K annually. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website has a database which allows you to search for and download a public company's official annual report. Check out http://www.sec.gov/edgar/quickedgar.htm for more information and to locate the annual report of the company whose annual report you want to read., It typically gives a broad overview about the company’s fortunes over the past year. The chairperson may also address problems and issues that arose, and outline what has been or will be done to solve these problems. Finally, the letter should also discuss future goals.


Look for specific, clear plans for the company’s future.
An analysis of the company’s gains and losses over the preceding year comprises the bulk of the chairperson’s letter.

, To learn more about the company and what exactly it does, read the business description, which is usually part 1. This will describe the company's offerings and its industry. It will generally also include brief descriptions of their business sectors, including main products and services, sources of materials, and the status of new products. This should be your starting point as you read the annual report, particularly if you're unfamiliar with the company.This section may also include industry trends, both favorable and unfavorable., This section is intended to celebrate the hard work of the company’s personnel, as well as inspire confidence in investors and shareholders.


Compare the current year’s list of directors and officers to those of prior years. If the list changes significantly year to year, it could be an indication of continuing company problems.

, The ten-year summary analyzes where the company is financially compared to where it was every year for the past ten years.This section will give you a good idea of what the long-term growth trends have been, as well as where the company might be headed in the future.


If the company has not been around for ten years, the report might feature a similar section on “long-term growth” or a “five-year summary.”

, These can be instructional for potential investors or stockholders, since the factors addressed in the risk assessment provide information about how financial projections might differ from actual results if certain conditions are met (or not met).


Most companies list standard risks like an inability to maintain brand value and the threat of legal proceedings.
Other risks, however, are more specific to the company. An oil and gas company might, for instance, list risk factors like changing technology, levels of oil and gas reserves, and corporate assumptions about energy consumption as risk factors.
Risk factors shed light on how companies think and arrive at their outlook statements and financial projections.
Risk factors are generally expansive and designed to protect the company in the event they occur, no matter how unlikely. You must determine for yourself the likelihood of a negative event occurring and its actual impact on the company.

, Management discussion and analysis is the section in an annual report that gives the management team an opportunity to voice their views on the company's financial trends. They will discuss both how the company performed over the past year as well as where they see the company headed in the future.Management discussion will usually address the company’s debt and equity structure in addition to financial indicators like income and sales trends.
Don’t blindly take the management discussion at face value. Hopefully, the company will have competent management, but if it does not, the opinions presented in the management discussion portion may not be accurate. The management statements are not vetted by independent CPAs.

, This section discusses the products and services the company provides.After reading this portion of the report, you’ll be able to understand what products and services the company is handling well and which are flagging.


This section might contain information about company slogans and why they work to promote the brand.The sales and marketing section should explain the key concepts associated with the product or service, and how the marketing department has employed them. For instance, a car maker might state that “youth, speed, and adventure” are the main themes behind its marketing campaign.

, Read the section to discover more about the various locations where the company does business, and what its acquisitions or holdings look like. The specific products a company produces or develops will each be described here.


If the company has several major divisions or holdings, each will be reviewed. For instance, a company like Disney might talk about sales and performance of Marvel, Star Wars, ABC, and ESPN, all of which are brands or companies under its corporate umbrella.

, The CPA opinion is the portion of the document where an independent CPA analyzes the company’s financial status.Without a CPA opinion, the annual report is a far less reliable and objective document.


In addition to financial records, the CPA’s opinion is based on a review of tangible assets and documents like purchase orders and contracts. He or she will have also collected information from banks, customers, and suppliers that the company dealt with.
Accounting records must comply with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures (US GAAP), which is a set of accounting practices that all public companies in the United States must adhere to.

, You need to look at each when reviewing a company to get a full picture.


The income statement will show how much money the company took in. Both investment income and income from sales of products and services will be included here, as well as expenses incurred to reduce the revenues within the same period.
The cash flow statement will show the company's starting cash balances at the start of the period, the sources and uses of cash during the period, and the ending cash balance. It might show, for instance, the company is investing in new plants, raw materials, property, or personnel.The balance sheet shows the company's assets and liabilities as well as the owner's equity (the difference between assets and liabilities) on close of a specific date.
When reading the annual report, pay special attention to the footnotes in the financial statement portion of the report because they may reveal additional details about the company's operations and properties., The stock price history illustrates how the company's stock value has fluctuated over the course of the past year. It will usually be presented as a graph, along with an explanatory section offering analysis of the stock’s trends. The company's stock symbol and stock exchange listing are also listed in this section.Compare the stock price of the company with others within its industry. Look for similarities and differences between the companies. If the stock price of the company decline much lower than those of other companies in the same industry, or did not rise as much, this variation may have been a result of mismanagement.

, A close read of the chairperson’s opening statement will give you a good idea of what the company’s values and vision are from year-to-year.


While it might be normal for a company to tweak their message over time -- for instance, by targeting modern, fashionable consumers, then by narrowing in on fashionable, trendy consumers who are on-the-go -- companies that move too far from their successful market niche might be in trouble.
A company that takes on an entirely different target audience or seems to be overextending itself should be avoided.For instance, a company that states it wants to make the best computers one year, then wants to make the best toothpaste the next year is probably not

, Similarly, a large decline in inventory could indicate that the company is overpaying for materials or personnel, and might be mismanaged.

, It also gives information relevant to a the company's owners (shareholders) who are about to take a vote affecting the company.

, Adjusted earnings are the earnings a company expected or would have earned had extraordinary misfortunes, special events, or extraordinary circumstances not occurred. Instead, check what the company actually earned and review previous reports to confirm that the event was extraordinary. A large gap between the adjusted and actual earnings suggests that the company has run aground.


Similarly, check the company’s expectations against reality. If a company’s annual report states an expectation to grow by 10% in the next year, but instead loses 5% of its value over the course of the year, finding an answer for discrepancies as they can be caused by a variety of events, including stock fraud.

Write the conclusion.,
Check for divergences away from the question.,
Assess the quality and depth of your argument.,
Check spelling, grammar and style.,
Check your referencing and bibliography.",How to Write a Good Economics Essay," The first thing to do if you have an economics essay assigned is carefully read and analyse the question. It’s essential that you fully understand what you are being asked and keep this in your mind throughout. Pick out the essential point from the question and highlight it. If it is a complex question you find it helpful to breakdown it down into component parts.


For example a question such as “Discuss the macro economic consequences of rising house prices, alongside falling interest rates” could be divided into two parts
One part could be on the effects of rising prices, and one on the effects of falling interest rates.
In this example you could begin by discussing each separately and then bringing the two together and analysing how they influence each other.
Be sure to keep the question at the forefront of your mind and don’t veer off topic.;
, Once you have a clear understanding of the question you are being asked, it’s time to do some thorough research on the topic. Consult any reading lists and economics textbooks you have, and ask your teacher or lecturer for some recommendations if you are struggling to find reading material.


Be sure that you understand all the key terms that you are being asked about.
Try to keep your reading focussed closely to the essay question.
Don’t forget to look at any lecture or class notes you have made.

, After thinking about the question, and doing some research, you will have developed some ideas about what to write in your essay. Writing a good essay plan will help you stay focussed on the key points, and produce a clearly structured essay that flows and develops. Start by writing the key points you want to focus on in a basic list.


Once you have put together a list of key points, then try to add in some more detail that brings in elements from your research.
When you come to write out your essay, you can develop a paragraph based on each point., Now you have mapped out the key points that you want to discuss in your essay, you need to spend some time thinking about how you will put it all together. The structure of your essay is very important, and shouldn’t be overlooked. Generally essays will be structured in three parts: Introduction; Main Body; and Conclusion.All of the evidence and explanation will be in the main body of the essay.
Order the key points in the body of your essay in such a way that they flow logically.
If you are writing a longer essay, you can break the main body into different sections.If you have a word limit, be sure to take this into account when you are planning.
Allocate yourself a rough number of words per section.
The introduction and conclusion can be just a paragraph each.

, The introduction is the part of the essay in which you should provide a clear outline of your main argument, and a basic outline of the content of your essay. You’re introduction should concisely address the following points:


What your essay is about.
What material you will cover in the essay.
What your argument is., Try to summarise your main argument in one or two sentences in your introductory paragraph. Directly address and answer the question.For example, you could say “rising house prices alongside falling interest rates make property a very attractive investment as opposed to saving in a bank. While interest rates remain low, the upwards pressure on house prices will continue.”


Having this stated clearly at the start can help you to stay focussed on the question as you work your way through the essay.
Try writing out this one or two sentence statement and sticking it up in front of you as you write, so it’s stays at the forefront of your mind.

, The body of your essay is where you will elucidate your argument, and introduce the evidence that supports it. It’s important that this section of the essay flows and has a clear order. For the example question, you could start by having the first few paragraphs discuss the effect of rising house prices on the economy. This could be followed by the paragraphs which address the impact of falling interest rates. A third section could bring the two elements together and examine how each impacts on the other.


Try to begin each paragraph with a sentence that outlines what the paragraph will cover.
Look at the opening sentence of each paragraph and ask yourself if it is addressing the essay question., In each paragraph of the body of your essay you should explain and evidence the paragraph’s opening sentence. Bring in appropriate evidence from your research and engage directly with this material. Your evidence might include real world examples, and should always be full referenced.Try to engage with arguments that run counter to yours, and use the evidence you have found to show the flaws.
It might help to imagine someone reading the essay, and anticipating the objections that he might raise.
Showing that you have thought about potential problems, and you can make an argument that overcomes them, is a hallmark of an excellent essay.If there is conflicting evidence, discuss it openly and try to show where the weight of the evidence lies.Don’t just ignore the evidence that runs counter to your argument.

, Once you reach the conclusion, the bulk of the work is done and you should have introduced all the material you wanted to use in the essay. In the conclusion you can summarise what your essay has argued, and what the evidence you introduced has indicated.Think about it as wrapping up the content of the essay in a neat package that the reader can take away.Restate what your argument is, but avoid using exactly the same phrasing you used in the outline sentences in the introduction.


In the conclusion you can add a few sentences that show how your essay could be developed and taken further.
Here you can assert why the question is important and make some tentative suggestions for further analysis., Your work isn’t finished at the end of the conclusion. Re-reading and revising your essay is an important part of the process, and can make a big difference to the grade you achieve. Going back through your essay will also help you see common mistakes or recurring problems in your writing. This will help you become more attuned to them, and avoid repeating them in future essays.


As you read through it, think about how closely you stick to main overarching question.
If you notice paragraphs that drift off into other areas, you need to be tough and cut them out.
You have a limited number of words so it’s essential to make every one count by keeping tightly focussed on the main question.

, Think about the quality and consistency of argument when you read back through your essay. Your argument should be clear and obvious to the reader, with evidence introduced to support it, and counter-arguments discussed. Read it through carefully, and try to identify any points at which the argument is getting lost.


Think about how you use the evidence too. Do you critically engage with it, or do you merely quote it to support your point?
A good analytical essay such discuss evidence critically at all times.
Even if the evidence supports your argument, you need to show that you have thought about the value of this particular piece of data.
Try to avoid making any assumptions, or writing as if something were beyond dispute., Don’t forget to thoroughly check your spelling and grammar. Make sure all your paragraphs are well-ordered, and well-structured. Avoid long and complicated sentences with many clauses. Try to read it out-load to see if the sentences are too long. Try to write in a clear and concise style that reads easily. Avoid unnecessarily ornate language or phrasing, and focus on making your argument comprehensible.Remember an academic essay should be written in a formal style, so avoid colloquialisms.
Avoid contractions, such as “don’t”, or “won’t”.
Try to avoid paragraphs that are more than ten or fifteen lines long.
Think about how it looks on the page., In an academic essay, proper referencing is very important. If you miss a reference, or incorrectly reference something, you may be accidentally guilty of plagiarism. When it comes to referencing, ensure you follow the style set out for you in your department or class.


Always include a bibliography, but don’t include references to things you haven’t read or didn’t inform your argument.Your teacher will know if you just add a load of titles into your bibliography that are not evidenced in the body of your essay.
Always follow the bibliography format used by your department or class.

Lay out a basic outline of what the essay is supposed to do.,
Research the topic, and try to get material that is from established sources.,
Once you have the research done and you think you have enough to complete the essay, find five more articles that can back up your point.",How to Write a Good Essay in College1," Ask questions during class to find out if there are any off limits sources. Write down any outlines you were given by the professor, as well as recommendations about what sources are acceptable by that professor.


Know that the sources allowed by one professor may not be allowed by another, so be careful. Treat every class as a unique course with unique demands.





;
, Established sources include university publications, research journals, etc. Try not to get too lost in off-topic research. When researching for an essay, you do not need to get drawn well off topic into material that you can't use. Be aware of where the material you are reading is from, as it may be material that sounds perfectly valid, but has no basis in provable fact, or could be from a source that isn't considered valid by the professor.

, This gives you a good amount of material to pull snippets of fact from to better defend your point.

Use formal vocabulary.,
Pick strong verbs.,
Write strong transitions.,

Use correct spacing.,
Work with proper margins.,
Use proper citations.",How to Write a Formal Essay," Brainstorming is one of the most common methods of topic formation. It allows you to explore multiple possible topics without committing to any of them until you decide what will work best for you.


Set a timer. Choose a time span that will allow you to cover a lot of ground, but not so large a time span that you find yourself feeling lost and aimless. Five to ten minutes is generally a good starting point.Write down any ideas for topics that come to mind. Try to come up with as many ideas as you can, and jot them down as quickly as possible. You want to have a large list to work with.When the timer goes off, review the list you've compiled. Look for any patterns or recurring themes in the subjects that you've written down., Your topic should be a subject that is interesting to you, since you want to be able to write about it at length. If you are writing an essay for school, be sure that your topic fits the assignment you've been given.Choose a topic that you can write the most about. If you had multiple items in your brainstorming session that are all related to a central issue or theme, it's a good sign that you will be able to write a lot about that issue.Be sure that the topic you choose can be sufficiently researched, if research is required for the essay.Be flexible in choosing your topic. You may find that your initial topic idea changes considerably as you conduct research and begin writing your essay., Once you've chosen a general subject for your essay, you may need to narrow down the focus of your essay. You don't want a topic so broad that it will take a hundred pages to adequately cover the subject matter, but you also don't want a topic so narrow that the subject will be exhausted in one or two pages.For example, European art history might be too broad a topic, but Van Gogh's painting techniques might be too narrow. In this case, a particular movement in art history would be a good topic to explore in an essay.


Try making an idea map to help you narrow your topic. This entails writing related sub-topics around the central topic you've chosen. It can be helpful because it allows you to visualize how your topic relates to other concepts., A thesis statement serves as a short preview of what the ensuing essay will address. It should be a claim or opinion that you will work to defend, and it should incorporate or acknowledge any relevant lenses through which you will be analyzing your topic (if, for example, you will be applying certain theories to your subject).The thesis of your essay should directly answer the question you are posing in the essay.Choose a thesis that is highly debatable or contestable. If your thesis is simply a statement that anyone else who's done the necessary reading would agree with, you will need to rework your thesis to stake out a stronger opinion.A strong thesis should address some issue that is important to you or within your field of study.It may be helpful to think about what possible questions arise naturally from the topic you've chosen. Considering those possible questions can help you develop a claim that you can defend which seeks to answer one of those questions., The introductory paragraph should provide readers with sufficient information to know what the essay will be about and what you will seek to prove or disprove in the ensuing text.Provide the reader with any necessary background/expository information.Insert your thesis statement somewhere near the end of your introductory paragraph., The body paragraphs contain the bulk of an essay. The body should come after the introduction and before the conclusion. The more research that you have done, or the more you have to say about your subject, the longer the body section will be in your essay.The standard expectation in academic writing is that each paragraph should introduce and explore each ""point"" that will ultimately prove or disprove your thesis statement.Compose a topic sentence for each paragraph, and insert that sentence somewhere near the beginning of the paragraph. The topic sentence is usually the first sentence of a body paragraph.A topic sentence should introduce or express the ""proof point"" of that paragraph, and the ensuing sentences should explain or elaborate on the topic sentence.Use the so-called ""P.E.E. structure"" of paragraphs: Point (make your point/offer the proof of that paragraph), Evidence (give supporting quotes/examples from a book or article), and Explain (relate the evidence to your thesis and elaborate on how it proves your point).Each paragraph in the body of your essay should work toward addressing your thesis statement., The final paragraph of a formal essay is called the conclusion. It should not introduce any new information, and should not actually say the words, ""in conclusion"".The conclusion paragraph may summarize the proof that was laid out in the preceding body paragraphs, or it may offer some larger implication based on the assumption that the thesis has been adequately proven.Some essays may require one or the other, while others may require both a summary and a prediction/implication. How you compose your conclusion will vary, depending on the assignment (if it's for school) or the goal of your essay., Most formal essays avoid using first person pronouns like ""I"" or ""we"". This is because the essay seeks to support the thesis statement, and using first person pronouns would render the thesis statement as mere opinion.Make concrete statements in your essay that are presented as your opinion. Think of the thesis statement as an absolute truth that you are supporting, rather than just your own interpretation of a text or event., A formal essay should not use slang or informal words or phrases. Think of a formal essay as a professional or academic piece of writing, and make choices appropriate for the audience that might be reading a professional/academic essay.Aim for Standard English, and keep a dictionary and thesaurus at hand.In a formal essay, you should avoid using:


slang/colloquialisms (such as ""cool,"" ""weird,"" and ""busted"")contractions (such as ""can't,"" ""isn't,"" and ""ain't"")abbreviations (such as ""ASAP"" and ""lol"")clichés (such as ""think outside the box"" and ""avoid like the plague""), Strong verbs are verbs that adequately convey the action of the sentence without requiring a preposition. Verbs that require a preposition are called phrasal verbs, and within the academic community they are typically considered weaker verbs.An example of a strong verb choice would be ""eliminate"" or ""eradicate"", instead of the phrasal verb ""wipe out""., Transitions help weave the various parts of an essay together into a single, cohesive piece of writing.Transitions should make sense in the context of the sentence that precedes the transitional sentence and the new sentence that follows the transition.Be sure that transitions are necessary. If a transition feels forced and the sentences before and after the transition are still on the same subject, you most likely do not need a transition.Common transitional phrases include, ""In contrast"" and ""On the other hand,"" as these signal an acknowledgement of the previous sentence while simultaneously segueing into a sentence that will shift focus., A strong formal essay should avoid using any unnecessary words or phrases, including words that repeat what has already been said.Some examples of redundancies include ""past histories"" and ""new innovations"". In both examples, the adjectives ""past"" and ""new"" are redundant, because ""histories"" implies the past, and ""innovations"" implies something radically new.Comb through each sentence in your essay and assess whether each word is necessary to communicate your intended meaning., Formal essays should be typed on a computer, which means that you have access to a range of font types. Choose a serif font, as these font types are generally easier to read.Common serif fonts include Times, Times Roman, and Times New Roman.Use 12-point font size throughout the essay., Some people were taught in years past to use a double-space after a period. Generally, in today's writing world, the standard is to use only one space after punctuation marks, but there are exceptions.If you are following the Modern Language Association (MLA) style, the recommended spacing after punctuation is one single space, but the MLA acknowledges that two spaces are sometimes an acceptable option.
If you are following the Chicago Manual of Style (CMS), the recommended spacing is one single space after punctuation.If you are following the American Psychological Association (APA) style, the recommended spacing in a manuscript is two spaces after punctuation.However, the APA acknowledges that most print publications will alter the spacing to display one single space after punctuation.If you are using APA style, you will probably have to use two spaces, but it's best to ask your instructor or editor what they prefer with regards to spacing.

, The standard format is one-inch margins on all sides of the paper, though some instructors or publication editors may request a slightly larger margin on one or more sides.If you're unsure about the proper margin size for an essay that you will be submitting for a grade or for publication, ask your instructor or the editor what an acceptable margin size would be.

, The formatting of your essay and any sources you cite in your work will vary, depending on the writing style you are working in. Two of the most common formatting styles are American Psychological Association (APA) style and Modern Language Association (MLA) style.


MLA style is typically used for publications in the humanities, while APA is most often used for publications in the social sciences.MLA style uses a ""works cited"" page at the end of the essay to list all citations, while APA style uses a ""references"" page at the end of the essay to list all citations.Ask your instructor or editor what the preferred formatting style is for your essay.

"
Begin your first draft.,
Draw a simple map that allows you structure the essay.,
As you compile the first draft of the essay, focus mainly on ideas.,
Take a break.,
Come back and refer to the essay map first.,
Get out the pen and start putting the assorted pieces in place just like a puzzle.",How to Write a Good Essay in College2," Get a pen, some paper, and paper printouts of your sources. The reason to write it in paper form with paper sources is that you can spread the material out on a table, and will allow you to see if one source conflicts with another, or if one article states a fact better than another.

, Your map should let you, at a glance, see the flow from idea to idea, placing the first idea you want presented in the beginning, and the following ideas placed in the order you'd like them to appear in the essay. This will allow you to see what the progression of the essay will be as you write it. Make it pretty neat because you'll use it throughout the rest of the essay process.

, Do not put a lot of emphasis on the spelling of complicated words, or picky punctuation. Just get the basic ideas stated in a manner that you can both understand later and expand on. The first draft is the place to get a very general layout going that will allow you to see what the final product will look like.

, Once you have a first draft that puts all the ideas you wish to incorporate into the essay on paper, and feel that you are prepared to make a second draft, take a 15 minute break away from the work. Try not to think about the essay during the break. If you want to have a snack, go for it.

, Use it to acclimate yourself with what you are going to write, and in what order you intend to write it.

, Try to form sentences that, while they may not be correct from a grammatical standpoint, they allow you to get the ideas on paper in more detail than those in the first draft. Keep the first draft close at hand and refer to it often. At the end of this writing session you should have an essay that clearly states at the top what the essay is about, and elaborates from there. Include source references when they are relevant, and that back up the text you put it with.

"
"
Take a ten minute break, clear your mind and try not to think about the essay.,
Start to clean up the draft.,
Finally, write a third draft.,
Look for typos, oversights, problems in logic, and clarity problems.,
Go to the computer, and type it up.,
Print the essay, and read it, trying to be as picky as you can.",How to Write a Good Essay in College3," You want to go back to the table with the mindset that the next draft needs to be a more polished form of the previous one, not an extension of it, not a 'fine tuning' of the previous one.

, The next draft should be written to clean up poor sentence structure, get the punctuation worked out, and try to make some of the vague ideas more concrete. If there are any elements that you have neglected to include, now is the time to work them in. Try to make it look like they belong where they end up, not like they were crammed in because they were forgotten until the third draft. Try to make the piece flow from idea to idea smoothly and cleanly.

, The third and final draft should directly follow the previous one, and should fix all the problems with the previous drafts. Get the sentence structure nailed down, and make sure that all the ideas are well stated and well placed within the piece. If anything feels like it needs 'tuning' this is the last opportunity. Get a clearly written and well stated essay on paper that, if handed to someone with only a little knowledge of the subject, could be understood without too many questions. Take care to use easy-to-read penmanship that you won't have to study to determine what you meant. Also, this is the time to adjust awkwardly worded phrasing.

, Read the piece, and look specifically for sentences that don't seem to work well as they are written, for statements that may be more suitable elsewhere within the piece. Using a red ink pen, jot down notes within the margin, clarify statements, correct order-of-words, and try to polish the essay to perfection.

, This is the first typed draft. Try to make it sound thoughtful, have it flow well, and clearly state whatever you have to state., Go over it with a fine-toothed comb, and locate any and every weakness. Correct any problems and type up the final copy, which will be handed in."
"
Set the tone and hook your audience in.,
After your hook you must introduce your topic!,
State your thesis.,
Transition into your paper.",How to Write a Five Paragraph Essay2," The opening line of your introduction must immediately engage your audience. This opening line could be a generalization about life that pertains to your topic, a quotation, or a little anecdote. You want to lure in the reader to continue reading the rest of your essay, making it captivating and intriguing, yet accessible.


Whatever you do, don't announce your intentions. Saying, ""In this paper, I am going to..."" will automatically put your audience to sleep. The same goes for, ""The Oxford New Dictionary defines...."" Just avoid it.

, Say something about your topic in a few sentences. Define terms or give an example of your topic.

, Alright, so you've grabbed your audience and they're hanging on your every word. Now you have to tell them what you're here for, what they're here for -- what the meat of your argument is. This is where your thesis comes in. It should be one sentence (at the very most two) that summarizes your argument and briefly states what the main text has in store.


Let's say you are writing an essay about the importance of seat belts. The introduction might start with some statistics about car accidents, plane crashes, and survival rates. It might also have an emotional appeal about someone who survived a terrible accident because they were wearing a seat belt. The thesis would succinctly advocate your position regarding the usage of seat belts, and each reason would be discussed, with evidence, in the main body of your essay., The last sentence of this paragraph (the introduction) must also contain a transition that moves the reader to the first paragraph of the body of your paper. The easiest way to do this is to make a confident assertion -- for example, after summing up the reasons to use seat belts, you'd include, ""Wearing seat belts needs to be mandatory in all vehicles for all passengers -- and it needs to be made mandatory now.""


Always stay in the active voice; it is much more powerful. A creative paper may have time for the passive voice, but this paper is most likely more academic and therefore should remain active.

"
"
Start off with the strongest point.,
Put your weakest point in the middle of your paper.,
Vamp it back up in your third paragraph.",How to Write a Five Paragraph Essay3," The first paragraph of the body of your essay needs to contain your strongest argument, hands down. Get to this argument automatically -- it should be in the first or second sentence. If there's an obvious starting point to your reasoning, use it. Though it's only listed here, each body paragraph should contain the following:



Introductory Sentence. This should include the theme of the paragraph and how that loops to the thesis statement.

Concrete Examples. These should be facts or evidence that comes straight from text like a quote or plot point. This should somehow prove the thesis. Each paragraph should have a minimum of 2-3 concrete examples.

Commentary. This should explain the concrete example, not summarize. Discuss what this fact shows about/means to the theme and/or thesis. What does it prove? Traditionally, each concrete example should have 2-3 sentences of commentary following it.

Conclusion Sentence. This should include the theme of the paragraph and how that proved the thesis statement. This is wrapping up the paragraph, not the paper.

, You want to pad your poorest argument between other, sturdier arguments. The second paragraph is the place to do that.


Again, the topic sentence for this paragraph should be included first thing and should relate back to the thesis in the introductory paragraph. The last sentence in this paragraph should finish off the argument, naturally leading into the third paragraph of the body.

, Body paragraph three should follow the exact same rules as body paragraphs one and two and should contain the second strongest point.


Again, you must open this paragraph with your reasoning. Once you've established your third point, if at all possible, wrap up the evidence. The body of your work is done. Which brings us to...

"
"
Restate your thesis and summarize your points in the conclusion.,
Proofread your work.,
Edit your essay for format and flow.,
Never end with, ""in conclusion.""",How to Write a Five Paragraph Essay4," Explain how your three supporting body paragraphs provide the evidence for the conclusion you've made. Tie up any loose ends from the introduction or body paragraphs, but be careful not to outwardly repeat what you've written. Be powerful and assertive -- this is the last thought you are leaving with your reader and, therefore, one of the few things they'll walk away with.


Summarize your argument with some degree of authority; this paragraph should leave your reader with no doubt as to your position or conclusion of logic.

, Walk away from your paper for a bit before you do this, though. Your eyes need the break before they can spot the less egregious of errors. Grab a Snickers, a glass of water, go on Facebook, and return. Then go over your paper with a mind for grammar, punctuation, and spelling.


Just worry about the small stuff now. Get the spellcheck out of the way, monitor for run-on sentences, and make sure it's all in the active voice.

, This might be where having a friend comes in handy. Ask them to go over your work and spot any incongruities or places where they're left with questions. Often a new set of eyes will spot different things.


In addition to revising the bulk of your paper, remember to format it to your professor's liking! Have you got margins, headings, headers and footers, and font style as specified? No point in losing unnecessary marks!

, It's overused and clichéd.

Confirm that your idea fits the assignment.,
Practice brainstorming.,
Do research.,
Determine what interests you.,
State the topic of the paper and give a judgment about it.,
Provide the reader with a blueprint for the paper.,
Offer evidence.,
Revise your claim to accommodate evidence that doesn’t seem to fit.,
Refrain from simply stating facts.,
Find the line between too broad and too narrow.,
Don’t generalize.,
Practice different writing methods.,
Avoid preconceptions.,
Take a break and revise.",How to Write a Good Thesis," Carefully read the assignment prompt from your professor or whatever instructions you have for your writing project. Make sure you clearly understand the requirements of the assignment and what the expected outcome is. This will give you clues as to what kind of research you should do, what kind of question your thesis should answer, and what the paper should accomplish.;
, Once you have picked a subject, practice a brainstorming activity in which you write down everything you know about the topic. This will help you make connections about what you already know and figure out where there are existing gaps in your knowledge. True brainstorming involves simply writing down everything you know about a topic without much care given to the organization, time spent, or outcome. But there are several more structured methods of brainstorming that include:



Freewriting. Freewriting is an exercise that involves giving yourself a time limit (usually 5-10 minutes) and writing continuously until that time is up. Don’t worry about grammar, punctuation, sounding academic, or anything like that. The most important thing is that you don’t quit writing at any point. At the end of the exercise, hopefully you’ll be able to see that you know more than you thought you did and start making connections between your existing ideas.Clustering or mapping. This technique involves making a kind of map by jotting down some of your ideas and then visually (by color coding or drawing lines between connected items) linking items that share some similar traits. This will help you see connections more clearly., Do some preliminary research about your topic. Choose reliable, reputable sources and focus specifically on areas that you already know less about.Reputable sources for papers include scholarly books and articles that you can find in the library, in online academic databases (like Academic Search Complete, JSTOR, World Cat, etc.), or in Google Scholar.
Avoid sources like Wikipedia, personal blogs, or other non-academic websites. A good way to tell if a source is reliable is to look at the credentials of the author. If the person who wrote the source has a PhD in a related field, they are an expert, whereas a journalist or blogger might have less strict requirements for fact-checking their information., A good thesis statement should be many things, and interesting is one of them. A topic you find boring will be boring to your readers as well. Try to think of something that you are genuinely interested in understanding because that will help you create a paper that is more engaging for your audience.

, Your introduction paragraph, and your thesis statement in particular, is like a preview of your entire paper. It should tell the reader what your main idea is and why it matters. The reader should be able to understand the position you will take in the paper simply by reading the thesis statement.Look, for example, at this thesis statement: “Because certain herbal supplements promote rapid weight loss that results in the loss of lean body mass and muscle, they pose a potential danger to customers.” This thesis idea tells the reader what your main idea is (assessing the risks of herbal supplements), what side of the argument your opinions fall on (that these supplements can be dangerous), and gives a piece of evidence (loss of muscle and lean body mass) that grounds your claim in fact.

, One of the main goals of a thesis statement is to tell the reader where this paper will take them. The reader should have a clear understanding of your main idea, where the paper will start, and, in general, what conclusions you will draw at the end., It is important to show your reader that you are making claims based on facts, not just your opinions or whims. Provide some (but not all) of your evidence in your thesis statement to prove that you have done your research and that your paper will be a fair accounting of the topic.

, It is okay to change your thesis as you get further into your research project. As you discover new evidence, your ideas about the topic will change. So, you should expect to end with a different version of your thesis than you started with., A thesis statement should be an arguable idea, meaning that someone could potentially hold and argue the opposing view. For example, the following thesis statement is weak because it just states a fact: “Exercising is good for you.” It is a proven fact that exercise is good for you and no one would legitimately argue against that. This kind of thesis statement leads to an uninteresting, underdeveloped paper.

, Writing a thesis is tricky business. You must give enough background information to guide your reader, but not overshare and provide too much material in your introduction. A broad thesis statement makes claims that are ambiguous, vague, or overreaching. They attempt to address too many topics for the assignment and don’t have a clear focus. A narrow thesis statement is too single-minded or specific to use in crafting a well-developed essay.Example broad thesis statement: “Sigmund Freud is one of the greatest psychologists in medical history.” This thesis statement is too broad because it is too general/vague and could discuss almost anything. It doesn’t tell you where the paper will go, what the main idea is, or any support for this claim.
Example narrow thesis statement: “Sigmund Freud’s theories on dream interpretation single-handedly changed the evolution of psychoanalysis.” This thesis statement is too narrow because it only allows for one viewpoint (that Freud was the only influence on psychoanalysis), which will lead to an essay that ignores a lot of evidence (other influences on psychoanalysis).

, Generalizing, especially in thesis statements, is dangerous because it attempts to summarize all of the paper’s content into one lump sum idea while omitting any of the supporting details. Statements that generalize tend to start with a phrase like “What it all boils down to is…” or “What this adds up to is…” These kinds of statements are weak because they make a claim that is not backed up by evidence., Some people prefer to write their thesis statement first (and most thesis guidelines are intended for that kind of writing), but others prefer to write the body of their paper first and figure out their argument/claim along the way. Sometimes you don’t know what you’re going to say until you’ve already said it. Give yourself the freedom to change your mind as you discover new information during your research process and amend your thesis idea accordingly.

, What works for one person, might not be the best course of action for you. Don’t get caught up in rules and regulations for writing that might be counterproductive for the way that you work best.

, Once you have finished the process of writing the entire paper, take some time away from the project. In a couple days, review your work and you will see it with fresh eyes. This will allow you more clarity to revise, to see if your argument works, and to determine if your thesis is an accurate representation of the claim you are trying to make. Things to look for include:


That the thesis is supported throughout the paper. In other words, you should not discuss topics in the paper that don’t fit with your thesis idea. Staying on topic is important for clarity in your paper.
That the thesis statement is reflected in the concluding ideas of the paper.

Revise the essay for clarity and length.",How to Write a Descriptive Essay," One option for a topic is to describe a person that you know well in your life. This could be a family member like your mother or your father. It could also be a best friend, a coworker, or a mentor. Choose a person that you have a lot to write about so you have enough material for the essay.You could also choose a fictional person to write about, such as a character in a book, a story, or a play. You could write about a character on your favorite TV show or video game.;
, Another option is to focus on a specific place or object that you have strong feelings about. This could be a place like your high school, your workplace, or your childhood home. You could also write about an important family heirloom or a gift from a friend.Another take on this option is to write about a made up place or object, such as the fantastical school in your favorite book or the magic wand from your favorite TV show.

, Some descriptive essays are about an emotion that you connect to or relate to. You may choose a strong emotion like anger, loss, desire, or rage. You could then try to describe the emotion using your own experiences with it.You could also choose a more specific emotion, such as brotherly love or self-hatred. These emotions can make for powerful descriptive essays.

, Once you have chosen your topic, draw five columns on a piece of paper or a word document on your computer. Then, label each column for the five senses, “touch,” “sight,” “sound,” “taste,” and “smell.” Write down as many details you can think of for the topic based on each sense. You can then use these notes in your essay.For example, if you were writing about a person like your mother, you may write down under “sound” : “soft voice at night, clack of her shoes on the floor tiles, bang of the spoon when she cooks.”

, Organize the essay by creating a brief outline. Do this in sections: introduction, body, and conclusion. The standard is to have a five paragraph essay, one paragraph for introduction, three paragraphs for body, and one for conclusion. But you can also try having sections instead, allowing you to have as many paragraphs as you want for the body section of the essay.If you are writing the essay for a class, your instructor should specify if they want a five paragraph essay or if you have the freedom to use sections instead.

, A thesis statement is the key idea or theme for the essay. It states the purpose of the essay and acts as a guide for the rest of the essay. The thesis statement should appear in your introduction and be restated in your conclusion.For example, if you were writing a descriptive essay about your mother, you may have a thesis statement like: “In many ways, my mother is the reigning queen of our house, full of contradictions that we are too afraid to question.”

, The introduction to the descriptive essay should set the scene and introduce the reader to the subject. Use the list of sensory details to describe the subject. Have a strong opening line that grabs the reader’s attention. Then, end the introduction with your thesis statement.For example, if you were writing the essay about your mom, you may start with: “My mother is not like other mothers. She is a fierce protector and a mysterious woman to my sisters and I.”
If you were writing an essay about an object, you may start with: ""Try as I might, I had a hard time keeping my pet rock alive.""

, Use adjectives that express emotion. Be as specific as you can. For example, rather than use a broad adjective like “angry,” go for a specific adjective like “rageful” or “tempestuous.” Choose adjectives that will paint a clear image in the reader’s mind.You can also use adjectives that connect to the senses, such “rotting,” “bright,” “hefty,” “rough,” and “pungent.”
For example, you may describe your mother as ""bright,"" ""tough,"" and ""scented with jasmine.""

, Metaphors are when you compare one thing to another. Use metaphors to show the reader what you think about the topic, rather than simply tell the reader how you feel. For example, rather than tell the reader, “My mother sacrificed a lot for us,” you can use a metaphor like, “My mother is a workhorse. She hasn’t taken a vacation in decades.”

You can also use similes, where you use “like” or “as” to compare one thing to another. For example, you may write, “My mother is like a fierce warrior in battle, if the battlefield were PTA meetings and the checkout line at the grocery store.”

, Do not be afraid to express your emotions in your essay. Use first person “I” to discuss your feelings about the subject in detail. Do you feel joy, sadness, angry, or disgust with the subject? How do you respond emotionally to the subject?For example, you may write about your complicated feelings about your mother. You may note that you feel sadness about your mother’s sacrifices for the family and joy for the privileges you have in your life because of her.

, Your conclusion should tie all the thoughts in your essay together. Restate your thesis statement in the conclusion and end with a strong final sentence. Do not add anything new to your essay in the conclusion. Simply evaluate your thoughts in the essay and wrap things up with a short, final statement.For example, you may end a descriptive essay about your mother by noting, “In all that she has sacrificed for us, I see her strength, courage, and fierce love for her family, traits I hope to emulate in my own life.”

, Once you have completed a draft of the essay, read it aloud to yourself. Listen for any awkward or unclear sentences. Circle these sentences so you can revise them later.You can also read the essay aloud to others to get their feedback. Ask them to let you know if there are any unclear or vague sentences in the essay.

, Show the draft to peers, teachers, family members, and mentors. Ask them if they think the essay is descriptive and full of sensory detail. Have them tell you if they got a clear picture of the subject by the end of the essay.Be open to constructive criticism and feedback from others. This will only make your essay stronger.

, Go through the essay and remove any sentences that do not feel necessary to the paper. Replace any weak adjectives with strong adjectives. Make sure your descriptions of the subject are clear and easy to follow.If you have a word count requirement for the essay, make sure you meet it. Add more detail to the paper or take unnecessary content out to reach the word count.

Begin by exploring different topics in the field.,
Choose a topic that you love.,
Do some more specific research.,
Keep in mind that you want your topic to be unique.,
Talk to your advisor.,
Don’t worry if your direction is not completely clear.,
Begin by introducing your broader topic.,
Construct the body of the proposal.,
Break the body into sections.,
Finally, move on to your conclusion.",How to Write a Dissertation Proposal," If you’re doing a PhD or a master’s degree, you’ve already chosen your general field of study. Now, you need to narrow that field down to choose a specific topic. In order to do this, read an introductory book if you’re not already doing so as part a class. Try to read as widely as possible; you never know what’s going to catch your eye.


If it’s a field like literature, try exploring different authors.
If it’s a scientific field, begin with an area that interests you. Start reading more about that topic.;
, The most important thing when choosing a topic is making sure you are passionate about it. You will be working on the topic for a significant amount of time, investing part of your life into it. If you are not passionate about it, you will fizzle out, and you may find it difficult to finish your dissertation. Wait for something that makes you want to keep reading about it and that makes your heart beat a little faster.


Also, if you’re not excited about it, you won’t be able to write in a way that gets your readers excited about it, either.

, Once you’ve narrowed down your topic a good amount, research more deeply. This will allow you to identify a very specific topic that can serve as the basis for your dissertation proposal.


Maybe your field is literature, and you’ve narrowed down your topic to Charlotte Brontë. Now you need to narrow even more. Keep reading all you can. Do you want to write about how Brontë portrays women? Maybe you want to write about how she uses setting to set up her story.
If you’re topic is more scientific, begin narrowing down the field. Say you’re interested in Mendel’s theories of genetics, but you want to update his experiments. Start reading about contemporary genetic experiments to get an idea of how you can narrow your focus.

, A truly unique topic is of paramount importance, especially if you are writing a PhD dissertation. That type of dissertation is meant to show the university that you are ready to enter the academic world as a researcher and thinker. Therefore, any topic you do should be original, though of course you will build on other people’s thoughts and ideas.


However, your final committee will expect it to be a unique discussion of the topic or a unique experiment exploring a scientific hypothesis.

, He or she can be instrumental in helping you choose a topic, especially if you don’t know what direction you want to take. Your advisor will bring a second opinion and expert guidance to your topic, allowing you to better approach your proposal


Once you have a specific topic (“Charlotte Brontë’s Use of Color in Jane Eyre and Its Effect on the Narrative” or “Modern Mendel: Genetic Traits in Mice”), you will write a proposal.

, It is not a problem if you’re not exactly sure where your topic is going to go; your dissertation can and probably will change over time. Your advisor and/or committee are mostly looking for the way you are planning to begin your research. You haven’t done enough research at this point to know exactly how your dissertation will develop, but you will make an educated guess at it.


With a scientific hypothesis, you should have an educated guess about how the experiment will turn out. But your experiment and research will prove your hypothesis or not, and that is an important part of the process.

, Like an essay, you’ll need an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. In your introduction, you are laying out the general ideas you want to discuss. Talk about why you think it is an important topic. You’ll need to include a basic thesis or hypothesis in the introduction.


The thesis is the main argument you will make throughout the paper, while the hypothesis is your guess on how the experiment will turn out.
In this case, Jane Eyre and color are your main ideas or Mendel’s theories and your hypothesis about how your experiment will turn out. Even though it may change, you still want to present your argument in your proposal.

, In the body, you are basically going to give an idea of what the dissertation as a whole will look like. Think of it like an outline for the bigger paper, discussing the main ideas you are going to cover, in addition to organizational structures like chapters and sections. Of course, you haven’t written the dissertation yet, so you don’t know exactly how it will look. However, your reader wants an idea of how it will go generally, although he or she knows that it will change over time.


Make sure you know where your topic fits into the critical discussion. Talk about similar research that has been done, and how your topic is similar and different. Establish your parameters.
In a scientific paper, you do have a better idea of how the dissertation will turn out.

In the dissertation, you’ll need a discussion of methodology, a literature review (an overview of what’s already been said/experiments that have been done on the topic), details on the experiment, and the conclusions drawn.
In the proposal, talk about some of the literature you’ve already explored and discuss the methodology you plan to use in your experiment.



, Breaking up the body into sections depending on the contents of each one will allow the reader to more clearly understand your thought process. A variety of sections will illuminate the different ideas and methods that you will include in your dissertation.


One section will be methodology: How are you going to do your research? What type of critical theories are you going to use to make your argument? Name specific people whose theories you’d like to look into more thoroughly.
In another section, outline your chapters/sections. Let your reader know where you’re going with this paper. For each paragraph or section, take a paragraph to discuss it; give the main ideas, and spend the paragraph discussing how you see that idea developing in that chapter.

, Talk about how the sections will come together as a whole. Yes, each chapter will have its own mini-thesis or topic, but all of those need to work together for the overall thesis. In a scientific proposal, you obviously cannot talk about the conclusions yet, but outline how your thinking fits together to form the basis of your hypothesis.


Generally, you want to make a thorough outline of what you want to talk about in your dissertation.
Nonetheless, it should still be concise and to the point. You are not actually writing your dissertation, just giving your reader an idea of where it will go.

Use negation to explain what the term does not mean.,
Provide background information.,
Introduce the standard definition.,
Define the term in your own words in your thesis.,
Separate different parts of the definition into separate paragraphs.,
Conclude with a summary of your main points.,
Mention how the definition has affected you, if desired.",How to Write a Definition Essay,"

Typically, nouns that refer to a person, place, or thing are too simple for a definition essay. Nouns that refer to an idea work better, however, as do most adjectives.
For example, the word “house” is fairly simple and an essay written around it may be dull. By switching to something slightly more abstract like “home,” however, you can play around with the definition more. A “home” is a concept, and there are many elements involved in the creation of a “home.” In comparison, a “house” is merely a structure.;
, Aside from being complex, the word should also refer to something that can mean different things to different people.

A definition essay is somewhat subjective by nature since it requires you to analyze and define a word from your own perspective. If the answer you come up with after analyzing a word is the same answer anyone else would come up with, your essay may appear to lack depth.

, Dictionary definitions can only tell you so much. Since you need to elaborate on the word you choose to define, you will need to have your own base of knowledge or experience with the concept you choose.

For instance, if you have never heard the term “pedantic,” your understanding of the word will be limited. You can introduce yourself to the word for your essay, but without previous understanding of the concept, you will not know if the definition you describe is truly fitting.

, While you will not be relying completely on the dictionary definition for your essay, familiarizing yourself with the official definition will allow you to compare your own understanding of the concept with the simplest, most academic explanation of it.

As an example, one definition of ""friend"" is ""a person attached to another by feelings of affection or personal regard.""Your own ideas or beliefs about what a ""friend"" really is likely include much more information, but this basic definition can present you with a good starting point in forming your own.

, Look up your chosen word in the Oxford English Dictionary or in another etymology dictionary.These sources can tell you the history behind a word, which can provide further insight on a general definition as well as information about how a word came to mean what it means today.

, Analyze and define each part in its own paragraph.

You can separate “return” into “re-” and “turn.” The word “friendship” can be separated into “friend” and “ship.”
In order to analyze each portion of a word, you will still need to use additional defining tactics like negation and classification.
Note that this tactic only works for words that contain multiple parts. The word “love,” for instance, cannot be broken down any further. If defining “platonic love,” though, you could define both “platonic” and “love” separately within your essay.

, Specify what classes and parts of speech a word belongs to according to a standard dictionary definition.

While this information is very basic and dry, it can provide helpful context about the way that a given word is used.

, An unfamiliar or uncommon concept can be explained using concepts that are more accessible to the average person.

Many people have never heard of the term ""confrere,"" for instance. One basic definition is ""a fellow member of a profession, fraternity, etc."" As such, you could compare ""confrere"" with ""colleague,"" which is a similar yet more familiar concept., Explain any physical characteristics or traditional thoughts used to describe your term of choice.

The term ""home"" is often visualized physically as a house or apartment. In more abstract terms, ""home"" is traditionally thought to be a warm, cozy, and safe environment. You can include all of these features in a definition essay on ""home.""

, People often relate to stories and vivid images, so using a fitting story or image that relates to the term can be used in clarifying an abstract, formless concept.

In a definition essay about ""kindness,"" for example, you could write about an act of kindness you recently witnessed. Someone who mows the lawn of an elderly neighbor is a valid example, just as someone who gave you an encouraging word when you were feeling down might be.

, If a term is often misused or misunderstood, mentioning what it is not is an effective way to bring the concept into focus.

A common example would be the term ""courage."" The term is often associated with a lack of fear, but many will argue that ""courage"" is more accurately described as acting in spite of fear.

, This is when your research about the etymology of a word will come in handy. Explain where the term originated and how it came to mean what it currently means., You need to clearly state what your word is along with its traditional or dictionary definition in your introductory paragraph.

By opening with the dictionary definition of your term, you create context and a basic level of knowledge about the word. This will allow you to introduce and elaborate on your own definition.
This is especially significant when the traditional definition of your term varies from your own definition in notable ways.

, Your actual thesis statement should define the term in your own words.

Keep the definition in your thesis brief and basic. You will elaborate on it more in the body of your paper.
Avoid using passive phrases involving the word ""is"" when defining your term. The phrases ""is where"" and ""is when"" are especially clunky.Do not repeat part of the defined term in your definition.

, Each tactic or method used to define your term should be explored in a separate paragraph.

Note that you do not need to use all the possible methods of defining a term in your essay. You should use a variety of different methods in order to create a full, well-rounded picture of the term, but some tactics will work great with some terms but not with others.

, Briefly summarize your main points around the start of your concluding paragraph.

This summary does not need to be elaborate. Usually, looking at the topic sentence of each body paragraph is a good way to form a simple list of your main points.
You can also draw the essay to a close by referring to phrases or images evoked in your introduction.

, If the term you define plays a part in your own life and experiences, your final concluding remarks are a good place to briefly mention the role it plays.

Relate your experience with the term to the definition you created for it in your thesis. Avoid sharing experiences that relate to the term but contradict everything you wrote in your essay.

Work upon a prompt.,
Research the topic.,
Make up your mind about the issue and… put it aside.,
Organise your problematic questions around the heart of the matter.,
Build an outline.,
Add the supporting material to develop your outline.,
Re-read your essay to correct possible mistakes and check out whether you remain neutral and supportive towards both of the opinions presented.",How to Write a Discussion Essay," If you have a prompt, you should carefully analyze it by defining the key words and asking problematic questions about them. For example, a problematic question (a key word) is the one that is relevant and provokes disagreement. However, since no question has a universally accepted answer, can we classify problematic questions as a separate group? (a problem). Note that the prompt question should have no more and no less than two opposite answers, so that you can make your opinion either in favor or against the claim. This is necessary when you don’t have a ready-made prompt and the assignment requires you to compose it by yourself.Here is a prompt randomly taken from EssayDB.net;
, Define the unfamiliar terms in your prompt. Find out how they are related to each other and some other concepts. Try to find the comments from different parties with different interests and opinions.

, You will need to be objective, but also decisive. It’s the best practice to mind your stance but remain open to new perspectives.

, This may take up the form of a table. The left column is for the issues that may incline the reader to your position. The right column is for the points that stand in the way of your claim.

, That is to say, organize your supporting material according to the accepted requirements to the structure of a discussion essay. Basically, you need:


an introduction where you introduce the issue and present your viewpoint in a thesis statement
a paragraph for the arguments for your position (the left column)
one more for the arguments against your position (the right column)
a conclusion where you make a synthesis of the arguments given and affirm your own claim.


In our case, you may tell why the question about Baudrillard’s theory is formulated this way. Then, you proceed to advocate that photography is, say, a mechanism of simulation rather than its casualty. You give the counter-arguments, refute them if possible and synthesize what you’ve learned in a conclusion.
You may want to make the structure more complicated by discussing one issue after another, so that each of your paragraphs contains the arguments both for and against your claim.

, Rely on credible sources only. Cite the primary source if possible (in our case, cite Baudrillard). Try to remain neutral and present the opposing viewpoints in equally detailed way.

, If possible, do this a day/a night after you finished the work. This way, your mind is refreshed, and you can notice more.

Pick your angle.,
Be yourself.,
Relax.",How to Write a Good College Essay2," A personal essay, fortunately or unfortunately, can be about anything. This works against you because it opens up every possible door; you can't possible know which one is best. But it can also work to your advantage because it gives you the freedom of choosing what most suits you. What do you love? What do you hate? What's an experience that changed you? What's the best part of your day? All in all, what would you enjoy writing about?


Don't be afraid to be controversial. Universities are places for the learned and the worldly. It is perfectly fine to write about politics, religion, or something serious as long as your paper is well-written and thought out. If a global issue applies to you, write about it. You won't be one of those papers that is forgotten.
Don't be afraid to be mundane. However, there's something to be said for a beautifully simple paper. How many essays will the panel read that are a scene from the family dinner table? Your morning process of waking? Something incredibly minute--not some life-altering event--can stand alone in it's uniqueness if made relevant and thought-provoking.

, Striving to be anyone else in this paper will shine through more than any other quality. The purpose of the essay is to show the admissions committee the real you, why you think and act the way you do, and what motivates you. So don’t write as if you are someone else, use stilted language, or gloss over how you really feel.


Write as you speak. Use a conversational tone; you want the reader to feel like more of a friend and less of an evaluator. A casual, relaxed tone will make you seem like a human and not just an applicant.
Don't pad your paper with big words that you just looked up in the thesaurus. What's more, don't show them what you think they value or are looking for; show them what they should value and be looking for.

, Before you set off to write your paper, know what you want to write. Take a moment to just think. Go slow. That way, when you do sit down to put pen to paper, you'll have a better idea of what you want to say and won't get frustrated with writer's block.


Give yourself a while to write it. If you start the night before it's due, you'll be pounding Red Bull and pulling your hair out. Take a day off to let it come to you. Lie in bed, stare at those glow-in-the-dark stars on your ceiling and let inspiration wash over you.

"
"
Be concise.,
Be likable.,
Show enthusiasm.,
Be genuine.,
Create mystery.",How to Write a Good College Essay3," The panel is reading piles and piles of applications every day. Halfway through your life story, they're bound to write you off. Keeping it simple and to the point is in both parties' interests.


Most essays have a suggested minimum of 250 words or less. If you have to go beyond this for some reason, keep it under 500. Too long and your reader may put it off.
Don't waste any of those precious words on statements like, ""...and that's why I want to go to your college."" It's awkward, forced, and downright unnecessary.

, But just like you wouldn't go up to someone and shout, ""LIKE ME!"", it's best not to be so eager to please in your paper. Exercise subtlety in your writing; make it clear that you're someone they'd like to have in their discussion section without saying it forthright.


This will be easy to do if your paper is you--honest and accurate. Colleges are concerned with the community life on their campus, too. They want to make sure their student body is full of people with character, people willing to make their community even better.

If you know something about their college, slip it in. An organization of theirs that parallels your past experiences, a fact you learned that ties into your life, too, whatever. Keep this minimal, but feel free to show you've done your homework. However, make sure it's accurate. Showing you're misguided is not the intention.


Be funny. Though you shouldn't become Chandler Bing (read: too much) or Cosmo Kramer (read: inappropriate) in your essay, making the reader smile is definitely appropriate. That being said, humor should not be a defining word about your essay; but if it comes naturally to you, let it show.
Be logical about it. Offensive jokes and self-deprecating humor are not acceptable here.

, Writing something you couldn't care less about--even if it's stereotypically controversial or generally unique--would scare off anyone. They want to see why you are the way you are; if you aren't interested in that, why should they be?


If you can make it indicative of your personality, genuine, relevant, and concise, it's doable. If the thing that excites you most in this world is Star Trek, make it work. If it's breeding ferrets, go for it. If it's finding clean water for children in Libya, by all means. Don't think something isn't possible just because it's not protocol.

, Can't seem to drill this in hard enough: be genuine. That means honest, sincere, and, ultimately, you.


Honesty is the best policy (at least in this situation). Any information you fabricate can be followed up upon and disproved before the application process is out. This is not a job résume--be accurate in every detail of your paper.
A part of being genuine is being modest. Okay, so maybe you've won 26 golf trophies and have the longest drive in the land, but should you go around spouting off about it? Don't think so. It's more than fine to write about an event related to your accomplishments, but putting your acclaims in the spotlight might make you seem self-absorbed, shallow, and immature. Three things no university is looking for.

, At the end of the day, this is a paper before it's an application. The same way you would write your literary analysis, write this. Well, sort of. Maybe skip the thesis statement, but concentrate just as much on drawing the reader in.


Paint a scene before you go about explicitly making everything clear. Maybe you were scaling Mount Tibidabo, cutting down brush, wandering in the cold of night, searching for inner peace...as a part of a boy scout expedition. Create an image so vivid that the reader forgets that they're really just reading a request from a teenager to study at their institution.

"
"
Make it flow.,
Have someone else proofread your essay.,
Check and double check your work.",How to Write a Good College Essay4," Again, this is a paper. You can write the most eloquent, eye-welling, nose-blowing piece since Marley & Me, but if you've forgotten all your commas and transition words, your efforts will be lost.


Give your paper logical order. Each paragraph should flow into the next. If you find yourself asking questions when you go over it, answer them. The reader will be asking them too.
Let it come to a conclusion. This paper is not an episode from a soap opera--it should open and close within the maximum number of words allowed. Don't use the element of suspense as a literary technique.
Make it flow on a micro level as well. That means checking your sentences for clarity and meaning. Is there anything that's a little hard to understand or requires assuming? Could you be more concise in your wording?

, You've been working on this paper so long you can barely wrestle out of this pile of candy wrappers and Starbucks cups. Once you're done, let someone else review it. A second set of eyes will prove very valuable.


Make sure they look for content and grammatical errors. In writing it, you may have become blind to both. After a while, our eyes stop seeing mistakes and gloss over them in our heads. Have a friend or family member read it and bring up any questions they have or notes on grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

, Have you gotten the points across that you wanted? Did you set the right tone? Is there anything you left out? Take the time now to assess if you've met all your goals.


Did you use active verbs? Too many passive sentences and your paper will lose its oomph. Did you spellcheck with your brain and not your computer? Eye mean, watch this. And the oldie but a goodie: Did you write your name on it?

Double check to make sure that you have written all names correctly.",How to Write a DBQ Essay," When those 15 minutes are up, it is time to begin writing. This section covers those 15 minutes.;
, Determine what sort of evidence you will have to find in the documents based on the prompt question. Always circle or underline the specific society (or societies) being asked about, the time period, and the key concepts (like economic or cultural problems) that are mentioned in the prompt. DBQ essays will ask you to do one of the following:


Prompt 1: Analyze the extent to which a historical stereotype is true for a given period or concept. Example: Analyze the extent to which the Suffragettes were depicted as manly, uncivilized women during the 1890’s to the 1920’s.
Prompt 2: Analyze multiple reasons that cause a particular movement to develop. Example: Analyze the reasons that the Progressive Movement gained momentum during the 1890’s to the 1920’s in the United States.
Prompt 3: Compare and contrast differing attitudes toward a concept or policy. Example: Compare and contrast the differing attitudes towards women’s rights in America from 1890 to 1920.
Prompt 4: Analyze the degree of truth in a particular statement. Take a stance on the statement. Example: Analyze the degree of truth in the statement: Women’s rights were a major part of the Progressive Era in America from the 1890’s to the 1920’s.
Prompt 5: Analyze the impact of an event or concept on some part of American society. Example: Analyze the impact of the Progressive era on American society in the 1890’s to the 1920’s.
Prompt 6: Analyze the relative importance of a specific factor or factors on an event or concept. Example: Analyze the importance of women’s roles in WWI to the passing of the 19th Amendment in 1920.

, This should be information you learned in class or read about in your textbook. This outside information will make up most of your essay. You should use the documents provided to support this outside information. Outside information can be events in history, themes you have studied about the specific time period you are writing about, movements, people, etc. List the relevant outside information on a piece of scratch paper.


Example for any of the prompts listed above: Think about the major goals of the Progressive era (such as increased health and safety codes in factories, limiting child labor etc.), the political and economic climate of the era (such as WWI, the rise of unions, and the monopoly of major men such as Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc.)

, Is there a specific answer that jumps out at you?


Example: What stands out about the Progressive era? What do you think about woman’s fight for suffrage?

, By doing this, you will more quickly be able to determine how each document will fit into your essay. Here are example theses for each prompt listed above:


Prompt 1: Suffragettes were seen as unpatriotic, unfeminine women by those who opposed the idea of women having the right to vote during the 1890’s to 1920 in the United States.
Prompt 2: The Progressive movement gained momentum in the 1890’s to 1920’s because many American citizens were appalled by the living conditions of the poor and the economic climate in which trusts dominated the major sources of income in America.
Prompt 3: During the 1890’s to the 1920’s in the United States, some women joined the suffragettes in their fight for the right to vote, while other women, particularly those of the elite class, looked down at the suffragettes because they believed that women were meant to stay in the home.
Prompt 4: The Women’s Rights movement was a major part of the Progressive era from the years 1890 to 1920 in the United States.
Prompt 5: The Progressive era majorly impacted American society economically, politically, and culturally during the 1890’s to the 1920’s.
Prompt 6: Women were able to gain the right to vote, in part because of the fact that they made up most of the workforce during WWI.

, Documents can include historical writings or publications (such as quotations, diary entries, letters, book excerpts etc.), charts, maps, photographs, illustrations, pictures of artifacts or cartoons. What is the main idea of each document? How does a document fit into the prompt? How does the document fit your tentative thesis? Jot down notes next to each document. Pay attention to the chronology of the documents. Look for change over time (or for LACK of change over time). Analyze it!

, For instance, what documents could you use to compare and contrast (if your prompt asks you to do so)? You must use all documents except one in your essay.



Example: A letter about the methods used to obtain the right to vote sent from one suffragette to another could be contrasted with an article in a newspaper depicting suffragettes as unpatriotic women who hoped to sabotage WWI for the United States.

, You should discuss the points of view of authors that support your thesis. When reading through the documents, note who the author of the document is, what his/her point of view is, and why you think his/her point of view is the way it is.



Example One of the documents is a suffragette’s diary entry in which she writes about her passion for the Women’s Rights Movement. The author is the suffragette, her POV would be that she strongly believes in the Women’s Rights Movement (you would list specific details) and the reason behind her POV is that many women, and some men, thought it was wrong for women to not have the right to vote and believed something needed to be done.

, Grouping historical documents must be done at least twice in your essay. The groups you make must support your thesis and make sense logically. The two (or more) groups must make sense and present two or more sides to your argument. You can group them as main groups, groups within groups, or in cross groupings.



Main Group Example: Documents 1, 3, 4, and 6 support the ideas and methods of the suffragettes in the Women’s Rights Movement. Documents 2, 5, and 7 support the ideas of the men and women of society who did not think women should have the right to vote.

Groups Within Groups: (Within the main group of 1, 3, 4, and 6): Documents 3 and 6 support the methods of the suffragettes at the beginning of the Women’s Rights Movement.

Cross Groupings Documents 1 and 5 support some of the shared views about society that both suffragettes and men and women against women’s suffrage had.

, This is a document that is not provided in the essay question. This additional document could be any historical document and can be made up. You must identify a document that would be helpful to you in proving your point, and explain why it would be helpful. This document could be a government document, a treaty between nations, ship logs, a letter to a king or queen, etc.



Example of a real additional document for an essay about women’s suffrage: The Bill of Rights. The Women’s Rights movement resulted in the establishment of the 19th Amendment.

Example of a made up additional document for an essay about women’s suffrage: A list made by suffragettes at a meeting about their strategies for getting the right to vote.

, Go back and make sure that you can support your thesis with the documents you have been given. Make it clear and concise.

, Plan your time so that you can cover each topic you wish to discuss and analyze each document.

, This should be the first sentence(s) of your introduction. Do not make this introductory sentence too long.



Example of introductory sentence: The Progressive Era, which took place roughly from 1890 to 1920, was a time of political, economic, and cultural reform in the United States. The Women’s Rights Movement was one of the movements that gained momentum during this time.

, Follow your thesis statement with a brief sentence that addresses the topics that will be covered in each following body paragraph.



Example of thesis statement and following sentence: During the 1890’s to the 1920’s in the United States, some women joined the suffragettes in their fight for the right to vote, while other women, particularly those of the elite class, looked down at the suffragettes because they believed that women were meant to stay in the home. In the following paragraphs, these two differing reactions to suffragettes will be compared and contrasted.

, Your body paragraphs should be placed in a logical order. When referring to documents, use the title of the documents rather than calling them ‘document 1’ etc. Each body paragraph must have a topic sentence. A topic sentence explains what the body paragraph is going to be about. Write as many body paragraphs as makes sense for your prompt. For instance, if it is a compare and contrast essay, you might only need two body paragraphs.


The content of body paragraphs may vary depending on which type of AP History you are in. AP United States history (APUSH) requires that you cite information from a majority of the documents, but the majority of information must be outside evidence, meaning, what is not in the documents provided. On the other hand, AP European History requires that most information is from the documents.
Do not just list the documents as they are presented in the DBQ. You must have some kind of analysis involved with them.
If you decide to quote one of the documents directly do it in a meaningful way. This usually means quote sparingly (quote only part of the document, and only do this method with one or two documents).

Example of a topic sentence and following sentence: Many women who did not consider themselves suffragettes still supported the Women’s Rights Movement. In a letter entitled, “Regarding Suffrage”, a woman discusses her support of women’s suffrage. She states, “Even though I cannot be out there picketing like those other girls, I want to show my support in some other way.”

, Points will be taken away from you if you do not logically show how the documents, your chosen POVs, and your additional document support your thesis. Make sure that all of your outside information is also relevant. Also make sure that you demonstrate your knowledge about how important the era or event you are writing about was.

, Whenever you mention a document or information within a document, you must add parentheses and the number of the document at the end of the sentence.



Example Women who were not suffragettes but still supported the movement wrote letters discussing their desire to help (doc 2).
Explain why three of the articles might be biased in your body paragraphs. This could also be in a separate paragraph. Doing this will get you an extra point when your essay is scored.

Example: A letter that states that everyone who is against women's rights is an idiot has a bias that is pro-suffragette.

, It is very important to write a conclusion that restates your thesis and summarizes what you have just proved in your essay. Judges reading your essay can choose to grade off of the thesis you state in your conclusion if they think it more adequately states what you have written in your essay. 

, You should:


Have one thesis statement.
Group the documents in two or more ways, depending on the question.
Explain how each document supports your thesis.
Discuss two authors’ points of view.
Identify and explain one additional document not provided in the document selection.

, DBQ essays are timed so try to leave some time for revision at the end if possible.

, You should also double check dates and places by looking at the documents and making sure that what you have written down matches the information with the documents.

Complete your paper by carefully proofreading a printed version of your final draft.",How to Write a Critical Essay," As soon as your teacher assigns the paper, read the guidelines and highlight anything that you do not understand. Ask your teacher to clarify the instructions if anything seems unclear or if you just don’t understand the assignment., A critical essay assignment asks you to evaluate a book, an article, a movie, a painting, or some other type of text. In order to perform a critical analysis of any text, you need to become very familiar with the primary text.


Get to know the text inside and out by reading and rereading it. If you have been asked to write about a visual text like a film or piece of art, watch the film multiple times or view the painting from various angles and distances.

, Taking notes as you read will help your to remember important aspects of the text, and it will also help you to think critically about the text. Keep some key questions in mind as you read and attempt to answer those questions through your notes.What is the text about?
What are the main ideas?
What is puzzling about the text?
What is the purpose of this text?
Does the text accomplish its purpose? If not, why not? Is so, how so?Don't: summarize the plot — you should already be familiar with it.Do: jot down thoughts that may guide your paper: Does he mean __? Does this connect to __?



, After you have finished reading and taking notes on your text, look over your notes to determine what patterns are present in the text and what problems stand out to you. Try to identify a solution to one of the problems you have identified. For example, you may notice that Frankenstein's monster is often more likable than Doctor Frankenstein, and make an educated guess about why this is.


Your solution to the problem should help you to develop a focus for your essay, but keep in mind that you do not need to have a solid argument about your text at this point. As you continue to think about the text, you will move closer to a focus and a thesis for your critical analysis essay.Don't: read the author's mind: Mary Shelley intended Frankenstein's monster to be more likable because...Do: phrase it as your own interpretation: Frankenstein's monster is more sympathetic than his creator, leading the reader to question who the true monster really is.



, If you are required to use sources for your critical essay, you will need to do some research. See your assignment guidelines or ask your instructor if you have questions about what types of sources are appropriate for this assignment.


Books, articles from scholarly journals, magazine articles, newspaper articles, and trustworthy websites are some sources that you might consider using.
Use your library’s databases rather than a general internet search. University libraries subscribe to many databases. These databases provide you with free access to articles and other resources that you cannot usually gain access to by using a search engine.

, It is important to use only trustworthy sources in an academic essay, otherwise you will damage your own credibility as an author. Using the library’s databases will also help to ensure that you are getting plenty of trustworthy sources for your paper. There are several things that you will need to consider in order to determine whether or not a source is trustworthy.The author and his or her credentials. Choose sources that include an author’s name and that provide credentials for that author. The credentials should indicate something about why this person is qualified to speak as an authority on the subject. For example, an article about a medical condition will be more trustworthy if the author is a medical doctor. If you find a source where no author is listed or the author does not have any credentials, then this source may not be trustworthy.Citations. Think about whether or not this author has adequately researched the topic. Check the author’s bibliography or works cited page. If the author has provided few or no sources, then this source may not be trustworthy.Bias. Think about whether or not this author has presented an objective, well-reasoned account of the topic. How often does the tone indicate a strong preference for one side of the argument? How often does the argument dismiss or disregard the opposition’s concerns or valid arguments? If these are regular occurrences in the source, then it may not be a good choice.(Note, however, that literary criticism often presents a very strong preference for one reading; this is not usually considered ""bias"" because the field of literary study is inherently subjective.)

Don't: dismiss an author for favoring one point of view.Do: engage critically with their argument and make use of well-supported claims.


Publication date. Think about whether or not this source presents the most up to date information on the subject. Noting the publication date is especially important for scientific subjects, since new technologies and techniques have made some earlier findings irrelevant.Information provided in the source. If you are still questioning the trustworthiness of this source, cross check some of the information provided against a trustworthy source. If the information that this author presents contradicts one of your trustworthy sources, then it might not be a good source to use in your paper., Once you have gathered all of your sources, you will need to read them. Use the same careful reading strategy that you used when you read your primary source(s). Read the sources multiple times and make sure that you fully understand them.

, Highlight and underline significant passages so that you can easily come back to them. As you read, you should also pull any significant information from your sources by jotting the information down in a notebook.


Clearly indicate when you have quoted a source word for word by putting it into quotation marks and including information about the source such as the author’s name, article or book title, and page number.

Don't: highlight a phrase just because it sounds significant or meaningful.Do: highlight phrases that support or undermine your arguments.


, Once you have developed your ideas about your primary source and read your primary sources, you should be ready to write a thesis statement.Effective thesis statements express the main focus of a paper and state an arguable claim. You may find it helpful to use a multi-sentence thesis statement, where the first sentence offers the general idea and the second sentence refines it to a more specific idea.Make sure your thesis provides enough detail. In other words, avoid simply saying that something is ""good"" or ""effective"" and say what specifically makes it ""good"" or ""effective.""Place your thesis statement at the end of your first paragraph unless your instructor tells you to place it elsewhere. The end of the first paragraph is the traditional place to provide your thesis in an academic essay.
For example, here is a multi-sentence thesis statement about the effectiveness and purpose of the movie Mad Max: Fury Road: ""Many action films follow the same traditional pattern: a male action hero (usually white and attractive) follows his gut and barks orders at others, who must follow him or die. Mad Max: Fury Road is effective because it turns this pattern on its head. Instead of following the expected progression, the movie offers an action movie with multiple heroes, many of whom are women, thereby effectively challenging patriarchal standards in the Hollywood summer blockbuster.""

Don't: include obvious facts (Mad Max was directed by George Miller) or subjective opinions (Mad Max is the greatest movie of 2015).Do: present an argument that you can back up with evidence.


, Writing an outline before you begin drafting your essay will help you to organize your information more effectively. You can make your outline as detailed or as scant as you want. Just keep in mind that the more detail you include in your outline, the more material you will have ready to put into your paper.You may want to use a formal outline structure that uses Roman numerals, Arabic numerals, and letters. Or, you may want to use an informal ""mind-map"" type of outline, which allows you to gather your ideas before you have a complete idea of how they progress.

, Your introduction should immediately begin discussing your topic. Think about what you will discuss in your essay to help you determine what you should include in your introduction. Keep in mind that your introduction should identify the main idea of your critical essay and act as a preview to your essay.Don't: start with a cliche such as In modern society...; Throughout history...; or The dictionary defines....Do: open on an intriguing fact, an anecdote, or another attention-grabber with relevant content.Other good techniques to open an essay include using a specific, evocative detail that links to your larger idea, asking a question that your essay will answer, or providing a compelling statistic., Providing adequate background information or context will help to guide your readers through your essay. Think about what your readers will need to know in order to understand the rest of your essay and provide this information in your first paragraph. This information will vary depending on the type of text you have been asked to write about.Don't: summarize parts of the plot irrelevant to your essay.Do: tailor your introduction to your audience. A conference of English professors needs less background info than a blog readership.


If you are writing about a book, provide the name of the work, the author, and a brief summary of the plot.
If you are writing about a film, provide a brief synopsis.
If you are writing about a painting or other still image, provide a brief description for your readers.
Keep in mind that your background information in the first paragraph should lead up to your thesis statement. Explain everything the reader needs to know to understand what your topic is about, then narrow it down until you reach the topic itself., Rather than trying to talk about multiple aspects of your text in a single paragraph, make sure that each body paragraph focuses on a single aspect of your text. Your discussion of each of these aspects should contribute to proving your thesis.For each body paragraph, you should do the following:


Provide a claim at the beginning of the paragraph.
Support your claim with at least one example from your primary source(s).
Support your claim with at least one example from your secondary sources.

, Your conclusion should emphasize what you have attempted to show your readers about your text.Before you write your conclusion, spend some time reflecting on what you have written so far and try to determine the best way to end your essay. There are several good options for ending an academic essay that might help you decide how to format your conclusion. For example, you might:


Summarize and review your main ideas about the text.
Explain how the topic affects the reader.
Explain how your narrow topic applies to a broader theme or observation.
Call the reader to action or further exploration on the topic.
Present new questions that your essay introduced.

Don't: repeat the same points you made earlier in the essay.Do: refer back to earlier points and connect them into a single argument.


, By taking a break after you have finished drafting your paper, you will give your brain a rest. When you revisit the draft, you will have a fresh perspective.


It is important to begin writing a paper far enough ahead of time to allow yourself a few days or even a week to revise before it is due. If you do not allow yourself this extra time, you will be more prone to making simple mistakes and your grade may suffer as a result., As you revise your paper, you should consider multiple aspects of your writing to make sure that your readers will be able to understand what you have written. Consider the following questions as you revise:


What is your main point? How might you clarify your main point?
Who is your audience? Have you considered their needs and expectations?
What is your purpose? Have you accomplished your purpose with this paper?
How effective is your evidence? How might your strengthen your evidence?
Does every part of your paper relate back to your thesis? How might you enhance these connections?
Is anything confusing about your language or organization? How might your clarify your language or organization?
Have you made any errors with grammar, punctuation, or spelling? How can you correct these errors?
What might someone who disagrees with you say about your paper? How can you address these opposing arguments in your paper?, Read your paper out loud to make sure that you have identified any typos, grammatical errors, wordy or incomplete sentences, and other minor mistakes that may negatively affect your grade. Once you have identified any minor errors, revise your paper and print a fresh copy to turn in.


If you are submitting your paper online or through email, check with your teacher or professor to find out what format s/he prefers. If you have used any textual formatting in your paper, you may wish to save it as a PDF file to preserve your formatting.

Pour the coconut sauce over the dough.,
Sprinkle with raw sugar.,
Bake 20 to 30 minutes.,
Serve fresh.",How to Make Pani Popo1," Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it. Let the mixture sit for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the yeast is dissolved and the mixture is frothy.


The water should be between 105 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit (40 and 46 degrees Celsius) for best results.
If you plan on using a standing mixer, combine the two ingredients in the bowl of the mixer.;
, Combine the four ingredients in a medium microwave-safe bowl, mixing them together lightly with a whisk.


Break the butter into chunks before adding it. Doing so will allow the butter to melt quicker.

, Place the coconut milk mixture in the microwave and heat it on full power for 1 minutes.


Stir the mixture thoroughly after removing it from the microwave. The ingredients may not be melted when you remove the dish from the microwave, but adequate stirring should be enough to melt them down afterward.

, Add the two ingredients to the coconut milk mixture and whisk lightly to combine evenly.


You may want to let the mixture cool slightly before adding the egg. If you add the egg while the mixture is steaming hot, it could curdle.
The other option is to temper the egg by beating it in a separate dish and adding a small amount of the hot coconut mixture. Stir the two together until evenly combined, slowly bringing the temperature of the egg up in the process. Add this tempered egg into the rest of the mixture and whisk to combine.

, Dump the coconut milk mixture into the bowl containing the yeast mixture. Mix with an electric mixer at medium speed for 2 minutes.


You can use a stand mixer or an electric hand mixer for this.
When done, everything in the bowl should be smooth and evenly combined.

, Sprinkle the flour into the liquid ingredients. Continue mixing the dough on medium speed for another 2 minutes, or until all of the ingredients have combined evenly into a dough.


The ingredients need to form a soft, sticky dough. If the dough does not hold together, you may need to add up to another 1/4 cup (60 ml) of flour.

, Dump the dough out of the bowl and onto a clean, lightly floured counter or table. Knead the dough for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.


This step incorporates more air into the dough, so you'll have airy bread if you complete it. If you prefer dense bread, however, skip or shorten the knead time.
You can add a little flour to the dough as you knead it, but try to avoid adding too much. This dough must remain sticky and soft. If the dough becomes tough, the rolls will become tough, too.

, Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover it with a clean dish towel and let it rise in a warm spot for 1 to 2 hours, or until doubled in size.


Spray the bowl with a little nonstick cooking spray before placing the dough inside.
After placing the dough inside, it's also a good idea to turn it once so that all sides are coated in the cooking spray. This reduces the surface stickiness of the dough.
For best results, let the dough rise in a spot that is both warm and draft-free.

, After the dough has doubled in size, use your fist to lightly punch it back down.


If you the dough clings to your hand when you touch it, you can spray a little cooking spray onto your skin or dust your hands lightly with flour.

, Break the dough into 12 evenly sized pieces. Roll these pieces into balls.


The simplest way to form dough balls is to simply pinch the dough off in chunks and roll them into shape.
Another option would be to roll the entire portion of dough into a long cylinder. Use a knife to slice that cylinder into evenly sized 1-inch (2.5-cm) rounds.

, Place the dough balls in a lightly greased 12-inch (30-cm) round baking pan.


Spray the baking pan with nonstick cooking spray before placing the dough balls inside.

, Loosely cover the unbaked rolls with the same dish towel and place them back in a warm location. Let them rise for 30 minutes, or until they have nearly doubled in size.


Alternatively, you can let the dough rise slowly by placing it in your refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours.
Prepare the coconut sauce as the dough balls rise.

, Before you measure out the coconut milk, give the can or container a thorough stir.


Coconut milk has a tendency to coagulate. When you are working with an unopened can, you can usually smooth it out by shaking the can. When working with an opened can, you'll need to stir the contents to combine them again.

, In a medium bowl, combine the coconut milk, water, and sugar. Whisk together until smooth and evenly combined.


Note that the mixture may seem overly sweet at this point if you taste it now. As it bakes, though, much of the sweetness will be absorbed by the buns, making the sauce itself a little less sugary.
Cover the coconut sauce loosely and set it aside as you wait for the dough to finish rising.

, You may want to preheat the oven shortly before the dough has fully risen.

, Evenly pour the coconut sauce over the unbaked rolls, making sure that each roll is thoroughly drenched.


Some of the sauce should cling to the surface of the dough, coating the tops and sides. Note that most of the sauce will sink to the bottom of the pan, though.
If you prefer crispier buns and less sauce, you can brush a little of the sauce on the tops and sides of each roll with a pastry brush instead of pouring the entire batch of sauce on top. When using this option, you will not use all of the prepared coconut sauce and there should be very little sauce sitting in the bottom of the pan.

, If desired, lightly sprinkle a little raw sugar over the tops of the buns.


Since the sauce is so sweet as it is, it might be best to skip this step the first time you prepare the pani popo. If the sauce itself does not overwhelm you when you taste the finished product, you can add this final dusting of sugar the next time you prepare the dish.

, Place the rolls in your preheated oven and cook until the crust is a deep golden brown.


Note that the internal temperature of the buns should be 190 degrees Fahrenheit (88 degrees Celsius).

, Let the finished buns cool slightly, but enjoy them while they are still warm and fresh.


Try waiting for 30 minutes before serving the buns. This allows the bread to set and the sauce to thicken.
Serve the buns straight from the pan and scoop up any extra sauce with a spoon, or invert the pan and serve the rolls upside-down.

Reserve the liquid from a can of oysters.,
Combine the canning liquid with soy sauce.,
Dissolve the sugar.,
Adjust the seasonings as needed.,
Use now or store for later.",How to Make Oyster Sauce1," Collect 4 tsp (20 ml) of canning juice from a can of shucked oysters. Pour this liquid into a small bowl.


You will not need to use the oysters for this recipe. You can discard them or use them for another recipe. Transfer the oysters to a plastic or glass container with an airtight lid and refrigerate for up to one or two weeks.;
, Pour 8 tsp (40 ml) of soy sauce into the bowl of oyster juices. Use a whisk to thoroughly mix the liquids together.


You could use light or dark soy sauce, or a combination of the two.
Alternatively, if you do not have any soy sauce, you could use teriyaki.

, Sprinkle 1 tsp (5 ml) of sugar into the liquid and whisk rapidly until the sugar is fully dissolved.

, Taste the oyster sauce. If necessary, add another 1 tsp (5 ml) of oyster juice and/or another 1 tsp (5 ml) of sugar. Mix well.


You can add more soy sauce, as well, but do so carefully to avoid making the mixture too salty. Neither the saltiness of the soy sauce nor the sweetness of the sugar should be too overpowering.

, The oyster sauce can be used immediately, but if you want to save it for another time, pour it into an airtight plastic or glass container and refrigerate for up to one week.

Cut the dough circles into quarters.,
Pour the oil into a wide, deep frying pan over medium heat.,
Test the oil.,
Drop four mahamri into the oil.,
Flip the mahamri.,
Remove the mahamri.,
Fry the other mahamri in batches.,
Serve while warm.",How to Make Mahamri," In a medium sized bowl, measure in the yeast and mix in a pinch of sugar, a pinch of flour and ¼ cup (59.15 ml) of warm water. Leave the yeast in the bowl to rise for about ten minutes.The sugar and flour help the yeast to rise.
When the yeast rises, it will expand and have a foamy texture.;
, In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients, excluding the cooking oil. The mixture should form a dough., Take the dough out of the bowl and kneed it on a clean counter or cutting board. Kneed gently for a minimum of 15-20 minutes until all the ingredients are incorporated and the dough is soft and smooth.If the dough is still sticky, it means that you should continue kneading.

, After kneading the dough, place it back inside the large bowl and cover it with a clean cloth. Leave the dough to rise in a warm place for around eight hours, or overnight. This gives the dough enough time to fully rise.When the dough is double its original size, it means that it has finished rising.
If you live in a warm or tropical area, the dough may only need a couple hours to rise. Keep checking on the size of your dough if you are unsure how long you should leave it.

, After the dough has finished rising completely, divide it into five equally sized balls. Treat the dough with a light hand and do your best not to squash or over-handle it. , After you have made your five balls of dough, sprinkle flour on a counter or cutting board and gently roll the balls in the flour to coat them. Then cover the balls with a clean cloth and let the dough rise for 15 minutes., Sprinkle more flour onto the cutting board, then use a rolling pin to roll each ball until flat. The flattened balls should now roughly look like circles. Use your hands to cup and shape the dough into circles if they are misshapen., Use a sharp knife to cut each circle into quarters. You will have 20 triangular pieces of dough, which you will now fry up and make into your mahamri.

, Once the dough is prepared, pour the cooking oil into a deep frying pan. Make sure to pour at least three inches of oil into the pan.Try to use a cooking oil with a high smoke point that is meant to be used in deep frying. Peanut oil, for example, has a high smoke point, while olive and vegetable oil do not.

, When frying mahamri, it’s essential that the oil is hot enough to properly fry the dough. To test whether or not the oil has heated completely, tear off a small corner of dough from one of the triangles and drop it into the pan. If the dough stays at the bottom of the pan for a couple seconds, then comes to the surface of the oil and starts to puff up, the oil is hot enough for frying.If the scrap of dough immediately rises to the top of the oil after you drop it in the pan and does not change size, you will need to keep heating the oil. Check after another five minutes to see whether the oil is ready.

, Drop in four dough triangles into the pan, making sure they don’t overlap. Use a spoon to splash oil over the top of the mahamri a few times while they are frying., After you notice that your mahamri are starting to turn golden brown on the bottom, flip them with a spatula. Cook them for a minute on this side until both sides are golden brown., Use a slotted spoon to scoop up the mahamri after they have finished frying. Place them on a large plate lined with paper towels, which will help soak up the excess oil.

, Repeat the same process of frying for the other sixteen mahamri, frying in batches of four at a time. After they have finished frying, place the mahamri on the platter lined with paper towels., Leave the mahamri to cool for a few minutes, then serve them while warm! Eat them alongside the traditional dish of pigeon peas cooked in coconut milk, or just enjoy them with a steaming mug of coffee or chai!

Bake the knishes.",How to Make Knish," Get out a large bowl and put all of the dry ingredients into it. Stir the ingredients until they're combined and then set the bowl aside. For the dry ingredients, you'll need:2 1/2 cups (312 g) all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon table salt;
, Get out a small bowl and crack one egg into it. Add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon of white vinegar, and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water. Whisk the wet ingredients until the egg is completely blended into the liquids.If you'd prefer, you could use schmaltz instead of vegetable oil.

, Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir the mixtures together. Put the dough onto a work surface and knead it until it forms a rough ball.You'll need to work the dough for about a minute so it comes together.

, Transfer the knish dough back to the mixing bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Put the dough aside for one hour to rest while you make one of the fillings.If you'd like to make the dough in advance, chill the dough in the fridge. You can prepare it up to three days before you want to make the knishes.

, Wash 1 1/2 pounds (680 g) of Russet potatoes. Use a vegetable peeler to peel the potatoes. Take a sharp knife and carefully cut each potato into four pieces. Put the pieces of potato into a large pot., Pour enough cold water over the potatoes in the pot to completely cover them. Turn the heat on to high so the water comes to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium and cook the potatoes for about 20 minutes. Drain the cooked potatoes and put the potatoes into a large mixing bowl. Let the potatoes cool.To see if the potatoes are done cooking, poke one of them with a fork. If you can insert and remove the fork easily, the potatoes are done.

, Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable or olive oil and 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Peel and dice 1 small yellow onion. Add the onion to the hot pan and turn the heat to medium-low. Stir and cook the onion until it's dark golden brown and softened.You can saute the onion for 20 to 30 minutes to get a deep caramelized flavor.

, Scoop the caramelized onion into the mixing bowl with the potatoes. Mash the mixture until it's almost smooth. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon table salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Set the filling aside while you roll out the knish dough., Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Peel and dice enough shallots to get 1 1/2 cups (150 g) of diced shallots. Add them to the pan and stir them. Stir and saute the shallots for a few minutes and then remove them from heat.The shallots should soften and become translucent. Keep an eye on them since shallots can burn quickly.

, Place a few layers of cheesecloth into a fine mesh strainer. Set the strainer over a sink. Put 2 cups (450 g) of cottage cheese into the cheesecloth and let it drain for 30 minutes to 1 hour. You don't need to save the liquid that drains out of the cottage cheese. Transfer the drained cottage cheese to a mixing bowl.If you don't have cheesecloth, you can line the strainer with large coffee filters.

, Scoop the sauteed shallots into the bowl with the drained cottage cheese. Add the remaining filling ingredients and stir the filling mixture until it's combined. You'll need:1 egg
1 teaspoon low sodium salt
1/8 teaspoon ground pepper
2 tablespoons low-fat crème fraîche

, Turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C). This will ensure that the oven is ready to use once you've rolled and filled the knishes. Get out a large baking sheet and lay a sheet of parchment paper over it. Set the sheet aside while you roll the dough., Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl with the dough and place the dough on your work surface. Cut the dough in half to get two equal pieces. Set one piece aside. Sprinkle your work surface with some flour and put the other piece of dough on it. Roll the dough into a thin square that's about 12 inches (30 cm) in size. You'll need to roll the other piece of dough into a square too.Sprinkle more flour on your work surface if the dough begins to stick.

, Take your filling and divide it into two portions (one for each square of dough). Shape one portion of filling into a 2-inch (5 cm) long and place it across the bottom of the dough. Fold the dough over the filling and roll it up to the end. Roll and fill the other portion of dough and filling.Avoid rolling the dough too tightly or it may split as it bakes.
If you'd like to make two different kinds of knishes, make a half batch of each type of filling. Use one filling on each of the squares of dough.

, Use a knife or bench scraper to trim off the ends of each log of filled dough. These ends are the parts that don't contain any of the fillings. Use your finger to press indentations on the log at 3 inches (7.5 cm) and 6 inches (15 cm) across. Twist the dough at these points.Twisting the dough will seal off individual knishes (kind of like how sausage links are strung together).

, Cut the dough at the twisted points so you end up with 3 segments for each log. Pinch the ends of one segment together to make a sealed bottom of one knish. Press the knish with the palm of your hand to flatten it a little. If you want, you can pinch the top ends like you did on the bottom or you can loosely fold them over the dough so they're slightly open.If you're using different fillings for half of your knishes, consider sealing the tops differently so you can tell them apart.

, Get out the baking sheet that you lined with parchment paper. Set the six knishes on the paper and ensure that they aren't touching one another.If your knishes are large and your baking pan is small, consider using two small baking sheets.

, Whisk the egg yolk and water together until they're combined. Dip a pastry brush into the egg wash and brush it over the knishes on the baking sheet.The egg wash will make the knishes turn golden brown as they bake. It will also make them slightly glossy.

, Put the knishes in the preheated oven and bake them for 45 minutes. Check the knishes halfway through baking to ensure that they're baking evenly. If one side of the pan is browning faster, you may need to turn the tray so they bake evenly. Serve the knishes once they're warm enough to handle.Knishes are best served the same day you bake them, but you can freeze them unbaked. Put unbaked knishes into an airtight container and freeze them until you're ready to pop them in the oven. You don't need to defrost them before baking the knishes.

Let rise for 2 hours.,
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).,
Combine the remaining three ingredients.,
Pour the coconut milk mixture over the rolls.,
Bake for 30 minutes.,
Cool and enjoy.",How to Make Pani Popo2," Coat a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) baking dish with cooking spray.


A round 12-inch (30-cm) baking dish would also work.

, Cover your hands with nonstick cooking spray. Take each thawed ball of dough in your hands and roll it gently, coating all sides of the surface with the cooking spray.


You can use shortening or cooking oil instead of cooking spray, if desired.
Each dough ball must have a light coating of oil.

, Evenly arrange the balls of dough in your prepared baking dish. Set the dish aside and let the dough rise until doubled in size.


Cover the dough with a clean dish towel to protect it from dust and debris.
For best results, place the dough in a warm, draft-free spot as it rises.

, Depending on how long it takes your oven to preheat, you may want to do this shortly before the rolls have finished rising.

, Add the coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, and white sugar to a small mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients together into a smooth, even sauce.


This sauce will be quite sweet. If you would prefer a milder sauce, decrease the amount of sugar down to 2 or 3 Tbsp (30 or 45 ml).

, Once the rolls have finished rising, evenly pour the coconut sauce over the tops and sides of the dough.


The sauce should cling to the surface of each roll, but most of it will sink down to the bottom of the pan.

, Place the rolls in your preheated oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they turn golden brown in color.

, Remove the finished pani popo from the oven. Let the rolls cool for a few minutes, then enjoy them while they are still warm and fresh.


Scoop the individual rolls directly out of the pan and onto serving plates. Spoon any extra sauce from the bottom of the pan over the top of each roll before enjoying.
Alternatively, invert the pan onto a large serving platter and serve the rolls upside-down (sauce-side up).

Bring to a boil.,
Simmer for 10 minutes.,
Add salt.,
Separate the liquid.,
Add the soy sauces.,
Boil and simmer for another 10 minutes.,
Use now or save for later.",How to Make Oyster Sauce2," Drain the shucked oysters and reserve the liquid. Use a sharp kitchen knife to rough chop the oysters into smaller pieces.


Use a container of pre-shucked oysters for this recipe instead of fresh oysters.
The actual oysters will be filtered out of the sauce later, so you do not need to worry about cutting them into precise sizes. Making them smaller can help release the flavor faster, though, which is why chopping the oysters beforehand is generally a good idea.

, Place the chopped oysters in a small saucepan with the reserved oyster juice and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of water.

, Place the saucepan on the stove and heat it on high until the liquid reaches a steady, rolling boil.


Stir the contents of the saucepan occasionally to prevent the oysters from sticking to the bottom of the pan.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low, allowing the liquid to drop to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook for 10 minutes.


Keep an eye on the saucepan during this time. You do not need to stir the mixture inside, but you should make sure that the liquid remains at a steady simmer. Adjust the heat settings as necessary.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat. Sprinkle in 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of salt and stir well to combine.

, Pour the contents of the saucepan through a sieve or strainer. Save the liquid and discard the solid ingredients.


If you want to save the cooked oysters, you can do so by transferring them to a plastic or glass container with an airtight lid. Place the container in the refrigerator and store the oysters for up to four days.
Pour the liquid portion of the mixture back into your saucepan after filtering out the solids.

, Add 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) light soy sauce to the mixture and stir well. Pour 1/2 to 1 Tbsp (7.5 to 15 ml) dark soy sauce into the mixture and stir it in, as well.


Using both light and dark soy sauces will give the taste of the oyster sauce more depth, but if you only have one type of soy sauce on hand, simply use a full 2-1/2 to 5 Tbsp (37.5 to 75 ml) of that soy sauce, instead.
If you aren't sure about how much soy sauce to add, start by adding a smaller portion. Taste test the results and add more soy sauce if you want a stronger flavor.

, Return the saucepan to the stove and heat it on high until the liquid reaches a rolling boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking for another 10 minutes.


Keep the lid off the pan this time. The oyster sauce should thicken as some of the liquid simmers away, but the thickening process will be hindered if you keep the lid on.

, Let the oyster sauce cool for a few minutes before you use it. If you want to save the sauce for later, pour it into a plastic or glass container with an airtight lid and refrigerate it for up to one week.

Place the mushrooms in a dish and pour enough cool water inside to cover them by a full 1 inch (2.5 cm). Soak for four hours, drain the water, then rinse with running water. Cut the mushrooms into strips and set aside.
Place the flax seeds in a small bowl and pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) water over them. Let soak for four hours. The flax seeds should absorb the water during this time.

, Pour the vegetable oil into a medium saucepan or deep skillet. Warm the oil on the stove over medium-high heat.

, Scatter the sliced ginger in the hot oil. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until the ginger turns golden-brown.


Remove the ginger from the oil when ready. Set it aside temporarily.

, Toss in the prepared mushrooms and drizzle in the sesame oil. Reduce the heat to medium, and stir-fry for several minutes until the sesame oil becomes fragrant.


You should only need to cook these ingredients for a minute or so before the heat draws out the scent of the sesame oil.

, Stir-fry the contents of the pan for 30 to 60 seconds, blending the seasonings in thoroughly.


If you do not have both light and dark soy sauces, use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of whatever soy sauce you have on hand.

, Pour the water and sugar into the pan and stir them into the rest of the contents. Cover, and let simmer for a full 10 minutes.


Watch the contents of the pan. You do not need to stir the mixture, but you need to make sure that it remains at a gentle simmer for the full 10 minutes. Adjust the heat settings as needed to maintain that simmer.

, Remove the pan from the stove and transfer the mixture inside to a large bowl. Allow it to drop to room temperature.

, Pour the cooled mixture into a blender. Add the flax seeds, as well as the pre-cooked ginger, and pulse the ingredients together until texture becomes smooth.


You won't be filtering out any solid ingredients for this recipe, so any visible chunks left behind need to be very small and hardly noticeable.

, Pour the pureed sauce into a saucepan and return it to the stove. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat for roughly 5 minutes.


Essentially, you're just heating the sauce through during this step. You don't want it to boil or simmer.

, You can serve the vegan oyster sauce now or pour it into a plastic or glass container with an airtight lid. Refrigerate it for up to one week.

Place the stomach in cold salted water and let it sit overnight.Soaking the stomach will soften it so that it's easier to fill and boil the next day.;
, Bring a large pot of water to boil and add a handful of salt. Rinse the sheep organs (liver and heart) and the tongue. Add the liver, heart, and tongue to the pot and cook them over medium heat for 2 hours. Carefully remove them from the pot using kitchen tongs and place them on a cutting board.


A long cooking time is needed to soften and tenderize these tough-muscled meats.

, Let the liver, heart, and tongue cool a little so you can easily handle them. Take a sharp chef's knife and mince the liver, heart and tongue on your cutting board. Mince them into very small pieces, as small as you can manage. Trim off any gristle or skin from the meat and throw the trimmings away.If you're having trouble mincing the meat, try grinding it in a food processor or with a cheese grater.Always use caution when cutting with sharp knives. Ensure your cutting board is on a firm and stable surface when you're mincing the meat.

, Transfer the minced meats to a large mixing bowl. Stir in 1/2 pound of suet, 3 medium onions that have been minced, 1 cup (225 g) of toasted pinhead or steel-cut oats, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of kosher salt, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon of dried coriander, 1 teaspoon of mace, and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg. Stir in a few tablespoons of the water from your pot into the mixture just to moisten it.Avoid adding so much water that the haggis mixture binds together into a ball. You want to keep it loose enough to fill the casings.

, Take the stomach that soaked overnight out of its salted water. Rinse the inside and outside of the stomach with fresh unsalted water. Pat the stomach dry and lay it on a clean surface.Depending on the sizes of your haggis, you can make several small haggises or just one or two larger ones.

, Take a large spoon and scoop the haggis mixture into the stomach casing. If you want to make one large haggis, fill the stomach 2/3 full with the haggis. If you choose to make smaller haggises, just fill the stomach as little as you like. Tie off the loose end of the stomach using kitchen twine. Pierce the stomach casing in several places so that steam can release as it cooks. If you really want a tight seal on the stomach casing, you can sew the stomach closed.
You can use a sausage stuffer tool to quickly fill several haggises.

, Heat a large pot of water to barely simmering (around 180 degrees F or 82 C). Carefully lower the haggises into the water. If you're doing one large haggis, let the haggis cook in the simmering water for three hours. Several thinner haggises will take less time to cook, around 1 1/2 hours.Watch the haggis as it cooks. If you see any air bubbles form, take a sharp skewer and poke the air so that the haggis doesn't burst.
Avoid splashing the hot water as you lower the haggises. You might want to wear oven mitts to protect your hands.

, The haggis will probably float near the surface of the pot once it's done cooking. Carefully remove the haggis and place it in a bowl of ice cold water to stop the cooking process. Let the haggis cool completely before you slice it and serve it.You can cut into the haggis while it's still hot, but the haggis will spill out of the casing and you won't be able to cut it.
Consider serving the haggis with neeps and tatties.

Cook on medium-high heat until dumplings are firm.,
Remove the dumplings from the heat and serve.",How to Make Flour Dumplings1," The amount of ice water or cold milk you need will be determined by the consistency of the dough, but it will likely be between 3⁄4 cup (180 ml) and 1 cup (240 ml). Some recipes recommend using cake flour, but any flour should work., Mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt. You can add spices to taste as well., Bring the water or chicken/vegetable stock to almost boiling over medium-high heat in a wide soup pan or Dutch oven. Reduce the heat to medium once the water or stock is nearly boiling.


The liquid will begin to form small bubbles on the bottom of the pan. When these small bubbles begin to float to the surface, the liquid is about to boil and the heat should be reduced.
If you are making chicken and dumplings, you will prepare chicken soup and then drop the dumplings into the soup mix instead of heating liquid for them separately., Slowly add the cold liquid into the flour, mixing gently. The batter should become wet but remain fluffy. If it becomes runny, you have added too much liquid and you may need to mix in a bit more flour.Do not over-mix the batter. This can cause your dumplings to deflate.

, Scoop out heaping spoonfuls of the dumpling batter and drop them into the near-boiling water or broth.Be sure to drop all of the dough while it is still cold.

, Continue cooking the dumplings for approximately 15-20 minutes, or until they are firm and solid in the middle.


Cover the pot while cooking to ensure that the dumplings heat evenly. This may require you to reduce the temperature slightly.When you think the dumplings are done cooking, you may want to remove one of the largest dumplings from the water/broth and cut it open to ensure that it is cooked through.

, Most dumplings are served in the broth that they were cooked in,so there is no need to remove the dumplings from the liquid they were cooked in. Just move the pot off of your cooktop and prepare to serve.

Some recipes call for nearly boiling water, some call for warm water, and some do not specify a water temperature. Try different methods and see which one works best for you., Dumpling batter is traditionally mixed by hand, and often not measured in exact measurements. If you do want to measure, the ratio of flour to water is typically 2 to 1, but you can always add more flour if your dough seems sticky or more water if it seems too dry.









Add the flour to the water in a medium bowl. Mix together with a wooden spoon or a spatula until it begins to be sticky.Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it by hand on a clean surface. (Use caution if you used boiling water to form the dough.)
Continue kneading until the dough is smooth.

, After you have kneaded the dough into a smooth ball, let the dough rest for about 10 minutes. This will help the texture and consistency of your dumpling batter.







, Begin with one section and cover the others with plastic wrap to keep them moist. This gives you ample time to form each dumpling without having the remainder of your dough dry out.


You may be able to skip this step once you are able to make dumplings quickly or if you have help filling them.

, Using one of your divided sections, roll the dough into a rope by placing both hands on it and rolling them towards and away from you while slowly extending them out from the center. The dough rope should be no more than 1 inch (25 mm) in diameter.








, The segments should be less than 1 inch (25 mm) long. Consistency in the size of your dough segments will lead to consistency in the size of your dumplings.








, Use your hands to flatten each ball of dough into a flat piece. Then use a rolling pin dusted with flour to roll each dumpling skin very thin.









The ideal method of rolling the skins leaves the center of the dumpling a bit thicker and the edges very thin. You can do this by applying more pressure with the rolling pin as you reach the edge of the dumpling wrapper., Repeat this process until all of the dough has been made into wrappers. If you have a helper, have someone begin filling and sealing the dumplings while you are still making the dough skins.

, Dumplings can be filled with a wide variety of things. You can make your dumplings vegetarian or fill them with ground meat or seafood, according to your tastes.Most dumplings are traditionally filled with a combination of ground meats and finely-chopped vegetables. Here are a few filling ideas:


Ground pork, chopped shrimp, and chopped cabbage
Chopped cabbage, and shaved carrots
Chopped shrimp, chopped cabbage, and cilantro
Mashed potatoes and mushrooms
Berries and sugar (for a sweet dumpling)

, Scoop a small amount of the desired filling onto the center of the dumpling. Be sure you have enough to fill the dumpling, but not so much that the dumpling cannot be easily sealed shut. You probably need less filling than you think you need., Fold the edges of the dumplings towards each other and pinch them together.Be sure no excess flour or meat is in the way of the dough adhering to itself. Pinch the dough tightly across the top, then fold the pinched part towards you to make a crescent-shaped dumpling., If you are not going to eat all of the dumplings at once, the best way to store them is uncooked, after you have assembled them. Place dumplings on a cookie sheet in the freezer until they are frozen, then transfer them into a large freezer bag or other airtight container. No need to defrost them when you are ready to cook them later., Cook the dumplings in a large non-stick pan that has a lid. Oil the pan and preheat it over medium-high heat.








, They can touch each other while cooking. Once all of the dumplings are in the pan, add water to the pan until the bottom third of the dumplings are submerged in water.

, Cover the dumpling pan and cook over medium high (or high) heat for about 20 minutes. Check to ensure that the dumplings still have water around them, and add water if the pan starts to go dry.


Check the bottoms of the dumplings to ensure that they are not burning.
Adjust the cooking temperature as necessary.
When the dough on top of the dumplings appears to be cooked, remove the lid and allow the water to cook off.
Allow the dumpling bottoms to sizzle for a few moments to add a crispy flair to your dumpling, but do not allow them to burn.If you think your dumplings are done, remove a larger dumpling and cut it open. Check the temperature of the filling with a meat thermometer to ensure that the meat has cooked thoroughly.

, Alternatively, you can drop the dumplings into a large pan of boiling water. This will slightly change the texture of your wrappers. You can try cooking either way and see which type of dumpling you prefer.







, If you have allowed the bottoms of your dumplings to crisp, serve them with the crisped side facing up. Also serve with a dipping sauce or soy sauce.

Write conclusion.",How to Write an Essay About Global Warming," Choose a specific topic within global warming to elaborate on, so that you don't go over the word limit trying to cover too much. Global warming is an extensive subject that may be regarded from different angles. For example, you could choose one of the following angles:


The greenhouse effect and global warming
Global warming: real challenge or far-fetched issue?
Global warming: mechanism of action
Is it possible to reverse global warming?
What caused global warming?
And so forth.;
, With various information sources available, you can conduct a profound research but the extent of information out there can mean you run over time just with research alone. In order to minimize efforts spent on investigation and enhance your performance, act with a goal in mind. Global warming, being a scientific topic, is based on facts, therefore:


Stick to a certain number of reliable sources. Don’t confuse the essay with a research paper, where you would need to cite dozens of references. Writing a composition, limit yourself to five if possible, or a maximum of 10 sources.
Narrow down the allowable sources. Many teachers view some websites with some skepticism and wouldn’t want you to cite them. Instead, you may be recommended to use printed sources. Ask if your teacher hasn't already made this clear.
Choose reliable sources, scientific journals or government supported websites. For example: climate.nasa.gov, nrmsc.usgs.gov, epa.gov, etc.
Write down facts, figures, statistics or other accurate data that will serve as strong arguments to support your statement.
Consider the evidences that are at odds with the view you adhere to. For example, if you are aimed at expanding on the global warming problem, you can’t ignore information saying that our planet faces an opposed process – global cooling. Further, these arguments will come into play and help you reach the appropriate conclusion.
Don’t forget to note the information needed for designing the bibliography. Doing so, bear in mind the required reference format (MLA, APA, Turabian, Chicago, etc.) assigned to you by your teacher.

, Once you are in the picture of the global warming problem, generate the ideas that you will unwrap in the essay. To help you achieve this, try the following:


Write a mind map. Suppose you need to cover the topic “Effects of Global Warming”. Put the theme in the center and briefly list the most burning consequences.
Proceeding from the scientific data you have collected, come up with your original ideas. For instance, if you dwell on the impact of global warming on ice caps, you may suggest a scenario provided that the ablation isn’t stopped.

, Once you've produced topic-related ideas, highlight the ones that will govern the thesis statement of the essay.


If you can incorporate all ideas within one extended sentence, you will get a powerful statement. For example: Global warming is just a fanciful problem invented to suppress substantial challenges that constitute a real threat for humanity.
Irrespective of the way you formulate the topic, global warming is a pressing issue, and it shouldn’t leave the reader feeling indifferent. Thus, your thesis statement should provoke feedback and come across as challenging. For instance: Lifestyle change is the most considerable contribution to global warming problem treatment.

, Start with a paragraph that will set the tone for the whole essay and make it exciting to read.


This may be a quote, such as: “We have passed the tipping points, but, we have not passed a point of no return. We can still roll things back in time, but it is going to require a quick turn in direction”, Dr. James Hansen - top climatologist of NASA. You may get a glimpse of the future and come up with a scene that depicts the potential dire consequences of global warming.
Use the techniques applied in an expository essay to explain what global warming is about. Utilize figures and statistics that could not be bettered to speak about the seriousness of the problem.
Be specific and don’t waffle, since the core of the matter you are to develop in the body of the essay.
Write a thesis statement, which is the embodiment of the problem.

, Now it is high time to put forward your arguments supported by valid facts. For the reader to tune into the beat of your vision of the global warming problem, demonstrate succession in your case presentation.


Provide an explanation of the evidence you describe in the body of the text. If you are writing about factors that contribute to global warming, give specific scientific support. For example: Carbon dioxide emissions, coming from electricity production, top the list of causes for global warming. Just imagine, emissions have increased by 16 times since 1990 and have now reached a dangerous level.

As far as global warming problem is the issue that touches all and sundry, you might have felt its impact in everyday life. Share your experience with the reader. It will definitely strengthen your arguments: Look out of the window! It is mid-January, but instead of snow banks, there is mud and drizzling rain. Isn’t it a vivid demonstration of global warming?
Suggest solutions to the problem. People like happy endings, where the good always wins. Similarly, there are sure to be methods to reverse global warming. And they do exist. Provide the ways to handle the problem that, in the first place, are within power of every person. After all, to change the world, one should start with himself/herself.

, Writing a conclusion is your chance to create traction in the reader’s memory and to keep your audience pondering the global warming issue beyond reading your piece. For this:


Go back to the thesis statement. It is known that repetition has a powerful effect, though, you shouldn’t reword thesis statement. Instead, paraphrase it, keeping its primary meaning intact. For instance, instead of saying ""Lifestyle change is the most considerable contribution to global warming problem treatment"", write ""Having changed our social behavior and consumer attitude to nature, we can reverse global warming problem"".

Explain the value of using ficus religiosa to the community.,
Understand how 'Ficus religiosa' works as a sustainability concept.,
Use ficus religiosa as a way to improve ecological sustainability.,
Social sustainability is maintained through use of this tree.,
Create financial sustainability.",How to Use Ficus Religiosa Trees in Nepal to Encourage Local Sustainability," Some of the things to point out include:


That it captures CO2 and releases O2 more efficiently than many other plants.
It is an evergreen tree and grows in hot climate like that of India and cool climate like that of Nepalese high hills.
It is regarded as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and The Buddha (high religious importance).;
, The ideas and definitions surrounding the vision of sustainable development are many and various. Nevertheless, there is a broad measure of agreement among both academics and business practitioners that sustainable development is desirable and necessary. Sustainable development requires effective achievement of targets in each of the following dimensions: ecological, economical, social, and financial. Thus, the general business task resulting from the goal of sustainable development on the one hand is effective satisfaction of ecological and social needs, and on the other is skillful integration of environmental and social management in the conventional economic management. Using Ficus religiosa could be a valuable model to demonstrate this concept on real ground.

, The CO2 capturing capacity of Ficus religiosa could be utilized for climate change management:


The traditional approach for watering these trees has been through maintaining ponds near by the tree (pond culture).
The tree could be shelter for various birds and insects.
Planting this tree on riverbanks can help control soil erosion.

, Because Nepalese villagers consider the Pīpal as incarnation of Viśņu and Buddha, they have a spiritual attachment with this tree. Tree worship on Saturday, constructing stone platforms around the tree, tree marriage of Ficus religiosa with Ficus bengalensis are special aspects of Nepali culture demonstrating the villagers' love of trees generally, and this species in particular. Saturday worship to pleased the planet Saturn is part of popular folk culture of the region, which is made difficult by the lack of availability of the tree in many localities. (The situation is bad enough that some folk have resorted to planting Ficus religiosa in pots.) Planting this tree on the bank of the holy river may help villagers to maintain tree worship culture, while supporting the integrity of the river bank.


The number 108 has sacred importance in Nepal. Aiming to concentrate 108 trees on the banks of the holy river will be viewed as yet more auspicious. Additionally, if we can plant Ocimum basilicum L along with this tree, and surround them with all types of fossil stone, it may help to develop a locality into a pilgrim site.

, Equity investment in a conservation project is very important. Planting the Pancapallav tree on sacred place could generate people participation. By planting this tree, we can generate grass root awareness of climate change with minimum effort.


Link the social value of Ficus religiosa to make the local people more aware of their cultural heritage.
Concentrate on one locality, as this can innovate tourism. The place could be effective product to demonstrate the slogan "" Naturally Nepal, once is not enough"". The site could be equal productive on Spiritual tourism, Academic Tourism and Eco tourism.
Use for craft sales. By applying simple techniques to remove the green layer, the leaves with attractive tail like tips could be utilized for crafts. By disseminating the technology among young and disadvantage groups, you can disperse the tourism opportunity among targeted people.
Besides leaf-craft, develop the conservation-based micro business by applying the concept of social marketing. The site could provide market incentives to conserve the product, if you can explore the message in the tourism market. This approach may prove as effective in-situ conservation of agro-bio-diversity.

Acquire emission permits.,
Reduce your emissions.,
Take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.,
Offer your extra credits for sale.,
Buy carbon credits so your company can emit more carbon dioxide in excess of your emission permit.

,
Make your personal carbon footprint smaller by purchasing carbon credits to offset activities such as plane trips, use of a car or running your home air conditioner.,
Invest in carbon credits by buying them and then selling them for a profit.",How to Understand Carbon Trading," These are issued by governments that administer a carbon trading program according to the size of your company and what it does. Some companies that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide fulfill key roles in the economy and must be allowed to continue operating, yet even these are required to reduce their emissions.;
, You will accumulate a carbon credit for every ton of carbon dioxide you don't emit (up to what your emission permit allows). You can reduce your emissions through methods such as carbon sequestration, consolidating your offices or developing ""green"" technologies.

, A common way to do this is by planting trees. For every ton of carbon dioxide, you take out of the atmosphere, you earn one credit.

, There are several online trading firms that specialize in trading carbon credits. The value of the credits is determined by the demand for them.

,, Most carbon trading websites have calculators that can help you determine your carbon footprint and afford you carbon credits if you make home improvements that reduce greenhouse gasses, such as installing solar panels.

, The market for carbon credits works very much like the market for other commodities.

Stop mowing your lawn.,
Participate in beach or river cleanup.,
Stop using pesticides.,
Plant native trees and shrubs.,
Catch your rainwater.,
Plant flowers that bees will like.",How to Take Action to Preserve Nature1," The grasses and weeds will go to seed, and offer haven for insects and birds. Wildflowers will bloom, providing nourishment for bees. When you maintain a standard grass lawn, you’re depriving these creatures of their natural environment.You might wish to set aside part of your lawn to leave unmown, or you might decide to mow paths through longer grassy areas.
Be prepared to share your reasons with your neighbors, who might at first not realize the benefits of long grass.;
, When people litter, their trash often makes its way to our local waterways, destroying the natural homesites of birds, fish and other waterland creatures. Help out by joining with others in beach or riverside cleanup events.If there’s not a cleanup in your area, consider creating one. All you’ll need are trash bags, rubber gloves, and a team of like-minded volunteers.
You can select any lake, river, creek, swamp, marsh, beach, or wetland you prefer to help clean.

, Pesticides, despite the name, don’t actually solve pest problems. Rather than spraying toxic pesticides that are dangerous to humans, pets, fish and birds, the best solution is to alter the garden environment in a way that causes the pests to leave.Try using beneficial insects that can control the pest population, or natural pesticides which have been developed to make the plant taste bad to the pest.
Pesticides include insecticides, herbicides, biocides, fungicides, and nematicides.

, By planting trees and shrubs that are native to your area, you’ll be working with the local ecosystem rather than against it. Check with your local nursery, or with your state’s cooperative extension agency, to learn more about the particular varieties of native plants that might thrive on your property.Planting native plants helps with water conservation. Once established, little or no irrigation should be needed for most well-placed native plants.
You’ll be increasing the local biodiversity, establishing native pollinator and songbird habitats in your yard.

, A ½ inch of rain on a 1000 sq. foot roof produces about 280 gallons of water that you can then use to irrigate your garden, and clean items around your home. Most people use a rain barrel to save their rainwater until it’s used for irrigation. You can put a rain barrel directly beneath your gutter, or you can install a diverter that pulls water from your water drainage system.Rainwater isn’t safe for drinking; it should only be used for irrigation and cleaning purposes.
Saving your rainwater helps protect nature by preventing stormwater runoff from carrying trash, nutrients, and other pollution to your local lakes and streams.

, Small, diverse plantings that bloom for multiple seasons will help support your local bee population. There are many reasons that bees are vital to your local ecosystem, including pollination of fruit trees and food crops.Examples of favorites among bees include borage, cleome, cosmos, “bee-balm” or monarda, verbena and zinnia.
Herbs that bees frequent include rosemary, thyme, mint, basil, and all kinds of sage or salvia.

Gather resources and food.,
Be more self-sufficient.,
Raise rabbits and chickens.,
Learn to hunt.,
Avoid urban areas.,
Take yourself off the grid.,
Gather weapons for defense.,
Pack all non-essential objects so that in the event you need to retreat you can do it as quickly as possible.",How to Survive the Fall of Society," Gathering as much food or resources will benefit you and anyone else with you greatly. Make a hoard of non-perishable items (canned foods) before the fall of law and order.;
, We are all reliant on the supermarkets for food these days, but as the population increases, demand will rise and farmers will struggle to meet it, causing costs to increase - supply and demand, just like anything else. For example, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe meant that even a loaf of bread rapidly grew too pricey for the average Joe to afford. Learn to grow your own food; even if it starts with growing vegetables in your back garden and having a greenhouse. You won't need to pay through the nose when you can just grow your own inexhaustible supply of food. Though you'll need to grow more than you'd think.

, Related to the above. Rabbits will be a nearly inexhaustible meat supply. They reproduce rapidly and in large numbers (hence the term ""going at it like rabbits."" They are cheap to keep, also. Chickens are a good one as well, though more for their eggs than for their meat.

, When food in the supermarket becomes either scarce or too expensive, this will apply doubly to meat. If you can learn to hunt or trap game, you will have an advantage over everyone else who will be spending their life savings on chicken breasts at the store.

, If you can, move out to the country. The more rural you are, the fewer people there will be, which means less competition for food. It also makes it more likely for you to have the space to start growing your own food - if you live in an apartment in the city or a semi-detached house in the suburbs, you're not going to have the space available to grow enough to live on. Move somewhere rural with a lot of lands, and start farming.

, Although our ancestors survived without power we have a difficult time doing that. Using solar panels and windmills you can have your own power source for things such as refrigeration and cooking.


Electricity is a luxury really. Though if you must have it, set up solar panels, wind turbines, or even have a generator connected to an exercise bike (giving you power while also staying in shape!)

, People who did not take precautions will need food and shelter. Purchase small handguns and large long guns and hide them through your house.


Know how to use the weapons and how to assert yourself without actually having to fire them. It is one thing to own a weapon; it is quite another to know how to use it, how to read people accurately and how to avoid conflict as much as possible, etc.

, Have bags ready so you can quickly pack essential equipment. Leave things that don't fit in a bag or backpack such as ovens and beds.

Join an environmental activist organization.,
Spend time volunteering.,
Raise awareness of threats to nature.,
Sign or create a petition in response to a particular threat.",How to Take Action to Preserve Nature2," You can maximize the impact of your action by joining together with others who want to preserve nature. Being a part of an activist organization will help you keep abreast of any environmental legislation, or changes in legal threats to natural environments.Be aware that there are organizations with environmental-sounding names that actually work to dismantle legal protection for natural space. Research the organization thoroughly before getting involved with action.
For example, The Center for Whale Research does research on Orca whales in the Pacific Northwest, but the Institute for Cetacean Research is a front group for Japanese whaling concerns.

, Most communities have nonprofit environmental organizations that rely on volunteer help in order to do their work. Look in your local area for organizations that are doing the kind of work to preserve nature that you expect.Internships and international opportunities are also available to those who are able to travel.
You might find that your volunteer work leads to new actions and opportunities. Even if it starts with stapling flyers or doing data entry, your actions will help support protection of the environment.

, Make sure you share news about the threats to the environment, both inside and outside your community. Follow social media campaigns, and share their posts. Write letters to local newspapers and community blogs. Consider joining in with rallies and protest marches if you’re able.Connect with other activists on social media.
Share information through videos, photographs and facts. Create online polls that are quick to share with friends to collect information.

, While research is unclear on the legislative impacts of signing a petition, petitions often serve to raise awareness of particular issues and to draw interest. There are a variety of online organizations that make it very easy to create and share your own petition.It might help to know that research shows that people who sign online petitions are actually more likely than those who sign paper petitions to follow up with other forms of activism.
Follow up your petition with real-life action, such as calls to law-makers, organize a march, and talk to your friends about doing the same.

Conserve water in your home.,
Turn off unnecessary lights.,
Use biodegradable cleaning products.,
Consider your transportation options.,
Reduce the carbon footprint of your home.",How to Take Action to Preserve Nature3," Wait until you’ve got a full load of clothes before running the washing machine. Don’t turn on the dishwasher until it’s full, and allow your dishes to air dry rather than automatically drying.By minimizing the amount of drinkable water you use for other purposes, you’re helping to protect your local water resources which are jeopardized in many areas.


Taking shorter showers, or turning off the water while you lather up, will save water. Set a timer if you need to.
Use water-conserving faucets, shower heads and toilets. Turn the faucet off while you brush your teeth or shave.

, When you leave a room, make sure the lights are off. Having lights set on a timer may help you reduce the time they’re left on. If you use lights outdoors, make sure they’re motion sensitive so that they don’t get left on.Use natural lighting whenever possible, and consider installing skylights or light tunnels to light darker areas of the house.
Switch to energy efficient lightbulbs. Using less electricity translates to fewer greenhouse gases being discharged into the environment from your energy company.
Unplug chargers when they’re not in use. Chargers for your electronic devices are constant energy users, even when your device is unplugged.

, Remember that whatever goes down your drains will eventually end up in your local streams and creeks. Using biodegradable, or biocompatible, products will have less impact on the local wildlife.Usually biodegradable products will list this information on their labels. Look for this designation.
Avoid ingredients that are “antibacterial” or “antibiotic” as these will negatively impact the ecosystem.
Also avoid scented products, bleach, boron/borax, chlorine bleach, or ingredients with the word sodium in them, such as sodium hypochlorite.

, Before you fly, consider the option of driving. If you can drive, consider carpooling, or taking a train or public transportation. If you’re in the habit of driving or flying, you may be using unnecessary fossil fuels and negatively impacting the environment.If you’re going to fly, try to fly non-stop, as this will use less fuel.
Consider walking anyplace less than a mile away. Try biking to nearby destinations. Look into telecommuting into work occasionally to conserve energy.

, Conserve energy in your home by providing weatherstripping and caulking all windows, insulating your ceilings and floors. Purchase appliances that are energy-efficient; look for the “energy-star” designation.Use a programmable thermostat to conserve energy when you’re less active.
Make sure your heating and cooling systems are well-maintained and operated efficiently.

Make sure the food you’re eating is grown sustainably.,
Eat lower on the food chain.,
Look for food that’s grown locally.,
Buy from trusted retailers.",How to Take Action to Preserve Nature4," Eating sustainably means eating foods that support both your own good health and the sustainability of the environment. If you’re eating seafood, make sure that it’s not at risk of being overfished, or farmed in a way that’s damaging the environment.Try to buy from local growers whenever possible. Local farmers are usually invested in employing sustainable farm practices.
Read the labels on your food products. If you don’t recognize more than ⅓ of the words found there, look for something less processed.

, This means eat less beef (high on the food chain) and more roots, vegetables, and fruits. Smaller fish, being lower on the food chain, are usually better than larger fish. Plant-based foods require still less energy to produce. Shifting to a more plant-based style of eating will slow the deforestation that meat production requires.Healthy diet guidelines encourage at least 50% of your daily diet consist of fruits and vegetables.
If you do eat meat, treat it as a condiment rather than a main dish. Be aware that factory-farmed meat is produced in ways that contribute to greenhouse gases and environmental degradation.

, You’ll avoid the energy required to transport products from far away. In addition, getting to know your local food producers will help you how your food was grown and harvested.Most fresh fish must be transported by air, if it’s not local. Even out-of-season frozen fish will be more sustainable than fresh fish flown in.As the nutritional value of food diminishes with time, eating locally grown food increases the amount of nutrition you’ll receive., Many international food growers use unregulated or under-regulated environmental practices. American grown products, while not always perfect, are usually farmed with more sustainable practices. Take the time to research products you purchase regularly.Good retailers will be well-informed on the way their sellers practice sustainability.
Knowing more about your farmers and food sources through your retailers can help support local business, which are invested in protecting and preserving the environment.

Follow instructions.,
Go above and beyond.,
Choose activities that work for the age range.,
Be consistent.,
Be yourself.",How to Volunteer at the Local Nursing Home2," As a volunteer, it's important to follow the rules and guidelines provided by the volunteer coordinator or staff member. Even if you think something could be done a better way, there might be an important reason for the current system. Avoid causing problems or throwing off the schedule by following the rules of your assignment.

, Following the rules and guidelines doesn't mean you have to do the bare minimum. If you're assigned to wheel patients from one room to another, take the time to talk to them, hold their hands and learn their names. If a staff member ever asks for your help with anything, be willing to jump in -- even if it takes extra time or effort.

, If you are given the freedom to plan the activities yourself, put yourself in the shoes of the residents and consider what they will enjoy. If you're going to play music or do karaoke, choose songs from their time era that they will actually recognize. Ask the residents or the staff members what past activities have worked really well, and incorporate some of those into your plan. Even if it's not always an activity that you personally enjoy, remember that this time isn't about you.

, If you say you'll be there for an hour every Tuesday afternoon, be there for an hour every Tuesday afternoon. Not only is it stressful for the staff and other volunteers if you miss your assignment, it can also be disappointing to the residents. Life at a nursing home can be very monotonous, and they look forward to special visits and activities. Before committing to a volunteer schedule, make sure it's a reasonable commitment that you can definitely keep. If you ever need to adjust your schedule, let the volunteer coordinator know well in advance.

, It can be intimidating when you start volunteering because you don't know any of the residents. Keep in mind that not every resident is the same -- they have different personalities and interests, just like you. Act like you're meeting people your own age and don't be afraid to be yourself. Tell them about your hobbies and interests and ask them about theirs. Chances are, you might have more in common than you initially think.

Meet with an estate planning attorney.,
Consider leaving assets to the NRDC.,
Make a gift that will pay you income.,
Consider a charitable lead trust.,
Request additional information from the NRDC.",How to Support the Natural Resources Defense Council2," There are many ways you can leave assets to the NRDC using estate planning. You should meet with an estate planning attorney to fully understand the tax consequences of making a gift to the Natural Resources Defense Council.


You can get a referral to an estate planning attorney by contacting your local or state bar association, which you can find here: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx.
Also see Select an Estate Planning Attorney for more information.

, You can help support the NRDC by leaving them property or cash in your retirement instruments. Consider the following ways you can leave assets:Leave assets in a will or living trust. You remain in control of the assets during your lifetime. At death, the assets pass to the NRDC to use. You can also change your mind before you die and remove the gift from your will/living trust.Name the NRDC as a beneficiary to your retirement plan, such as your IRA, 401(k) or other qualified plan. You can continue to make withdrawals during your lifetime. You will need to contact your plan administrator and then tell the NRDC.Donate a life insurance policy. If you have a paid-up life insurance policy, you can transfer ownership to the NRDC.Leave stock and other appreciated assets. You can transfer stocks, bonds, or mutual fund shares to the NRDC, which then sells them and uses the money for its programs. You must have owned the assets for at least a year. You receive a tax deduction in return., It’s possible to donate assets to the NRDC and receive income in return. You should talk about the following options with your estate attorney:Purchase a charitable gift annuity. In exchange for transferring cash or securities to the NRDC, you get paid income for life. The minimum gift must be $10,000 and you should be at least 60 years old. After all beneficiaries die, the NRDC keeps the balance of the assets.If you are under 60, then you can begin funding an annuity early with a deferred gift annuity (provided you are at least 40). When you turn 60, you can begin drawing the annuity.Contribute assets to a pooled income fund. In return, you receive income for life. This is like a charitable gift annuity, and your initial minimum gift should be $10,000.Create charitable trusts. You can transfer cash, securities, or other property into a charitable remainder trust and receive a percentage of the principal in payment. When the trust terminates, the NRDC keeps the assets. You must have at least $100,000.A charitable annuity trust is similar, though it makes annual payments in fixed amounts., Another option is to fund a trust with securities or other appreciating assets. The trust makes yearly payments to the NRDC. However, when the trust terminates, the assets pass to your heirs.The NRDC recommends a minimum gift of $1,000,000 to a charitable lead trust.

, You can request additional information here http://www.legacy.vg/nrdc/articles/41.html. You may also call 212-727-4421 if you have questions.

Learn more about UNICEF.,
Share information with family, friends, and co-workers.,
Use social media.",How to Volunteer at UNICEF2," In order to educate others about UNICEF's charitable initiatives, you should deepen your own knowledge about the humanitarian organization. Visit https://www.unicefusa.org/mission to read the organization's mission statement, as well as descriptions of its current initiatives in over 190 countries across the world. UNICEF's efforts include:providing immunizations for 45% of the world's children
giving access to clean, safe water in over 100 countries
prevention of mother-to-child transmission of the HIV virus
educational initiatives that can include building schools, training teachers, bringing education to child refugees, and reforming school systems
emergency relief to victims of war and natural disasters

, Start educating people about UNICEF on a small scale, starting with your own inner-circle (i.e. friends and family) and co-workers. Garner interest by sharing facts about UNICEF's work, noting specific, individual examples. When it comes to charity, ""identifiable victims"" elicit a greater level of emotion and sympathy than statistics about a great number of people do.For example, you could show friends, family, or colleagues a picture of Rukaia, a one-year old baby whose family fled the city of Aleppo, receiving new winter clothing from UNICEF to stay warm as temperatures drop;this picture, and others like it, are available via the UNICEF U.S. Fund Instagram account.

, Follow UNICEF on any social media platforms that you use (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube). The internet is arguably the fastest way to share knowledge and news, so put your online time to good use by sharing information about UNICEF and its global initiatives. For instance, share posts from UNICEF USA's Facebook page on your own wall to be viewed by your Facebook friends.

Join a congressional action team.,
Sign and distribute petitions.,
Write to elected officials.",How to Volunteer at UNICEF3," UNICEF has 14 congressional action teams in the United States; teams consist of UNICEF volunteers who are trained and supported by the U.S. Fund for UNICEF staff, and who interact with Congress members on behalf of the organization. Team members meet monthly for a national conference call where they discuss issues and prepare to take action (e.g. visiting or writing to elected officials). To join, send an email to volunteer@unicefusa.org to express your interest.No experience or special credentials are required to join a UNICEF congressional action team.

, Influence legislative action and policy-making by distributing petitions related to UNICEF's mission. On the UNICEF U.S. Fund website, for example, volunteers are urged to sign a petition to make child survival issues a priority in Congress. To start, write a brief (and easily readable) summary of your point of view, proposal, and a few convincing arguments for it; leave space for people to write their name and address, with each line numbered to keep track of signatures.To make a petition that can be widely circulated, use a web platform like Change.org - petitions made on the site can be disseminated on Facebook and Twitter, quickly and easily. , Take a direct approach to advocating for UNICEF by writing to members of Congress and other elected officials, urging them to take action to make the survival of children a priority. Visit the U.S. Fund for UNICEF website to read about specific issues you can write to government officials about right now.


For instance, UNICEF is, as of December 2016, asking volunteers to write to the President, imploring him and other world leaders to make good on their commitment to child refugees and migrants after the September 2016 United Nations summits."

Plan an event.,
Submit an application.,
Advertise your event.",How to Volunteer at UNICEF4," Brainstorm ideas for fundraising events that you trust will raise money for UNICEF. Contact friends, family, and colleagues for leads on any venues you might be able to borrow or rent for a small fee to host your event, or look for local sponsors for your fundraiser. For inspiration and ideas, visit the U.S Funds for UNICEF website for volunteer highlights and stories; some popular fundraising choices have included:dinner parties
art auctions
film screenings
sporting activities

, As a UNICEF volunteer, you can organize a fundraising event as you see fit, but you must submit a proposal for your event to the organization first. An application form is available on the website, and requires you to have many details of the events planned out ahead of time. The application asks for:the name of the event host or hosts, and their contact information
what the event will be named
what type of event it will be
the location, date, and time of the event
the number of people expected to attend
the amounts of funds you anticipate raising

, Use social media to advertise your fundraising event, in addition to more traditional printed invitations, banners, and flyers. Once your event application is approved, you will be allowed to use UNICEF's logo for your event and advertising. You will first have to submit copies of these documents to the organization for approval before distributing them."

Stop litter where it starts.,
Reduce waste.,
Spread the word to friends and relatives about why littering is so bad.,
Start cleaning up.,
Get others involved.,
Ask for help from your local government or government agency.",How to Pick Up Litter," The reason there is so much trash around is because not enough people recognize that it's a problem. Start with yourself, and make sure you're not generating litter, intentionally or otherwise.


Be on the lookout for trash bins, and be willing to carry your trash for a little while.
Keep a bag or container for trash in your car, if you drive.
When on the road, make sure items in your vehicle are secure and nothing can blow out. Keep your truck bed clean and free of loose litter. Be especially aware of plastic sheeting and bags.
Close the lid to any outdoor trash can or dumpster you maintain. If necessary, secure them against animals or weather.
Check around for loose items when you bring your trash can in after collection.
If you own a business, keep your parking lot and the area around your dumpsters clean. Have trash containers available for customers. Keep them emptied so trash will not blow out of the containers.
Encourage local businesses in your area to keep their facilities clean, too. Whether or not they are concerned about the environment, most business owners and managers will recognize that litter detracts from their appearance and the impression they give to prospective customers.;
, With a little care, it's possible to produce a whole lot less trash than most people do.


Buy food with less packaging, and eat less processed or manufactured food.
Buy in larger packages and avoid single-serving items.

Pack your own lunch in containers that can be reused.
Drink water and other beverages from your own reusable container. If you have a coffee habit, ask your coffee shop if they'll refill a reusable container instead of giving you disposable items.
Choose fresh fruits and vegetables over packaged snacks and desserts.

Carry reusable bags when you go shopping.
Dine in at restaurants; skip the takeout and fast food.
Refuse excess items. If you do order takeout, decline the bag, the heap of plastic forks, the stack of napkins, the straws, the condiment packets, and so on.

Don't buy what you don't need. Choose durable items to last a long time. Try renting or borrowing things you need only briefly or occasionally.
Resell, donate, or give away usable items you no longer need.
Clean with reusable supplies, too. Use a broom or vacuum cleaner rather than Swiffer. Use washable fabric rags or towels rather than paper towels.
Take yourself off junk mail lists.
Recycle all you can of what remains.
If you need to dispose of special items (hazardous wastes, large items, electronic waste, unused medications, etc.), find out how to do so properly where you live.

,


Don't hand out flyers because those could become litter themselves.
Create awareness by writing letters to the editors of newspapers.
On social media, post updates on your anti-litter efforts and pass along articles you find. Recruit community members to help.
Talk ""Trash"" and emphasize how litter not only mars the beauty of the cities and countryside, but also pollutes and threatens wildlife.
Encourage citizens to work together and clean up the environment.
If you live near a river or coast, learn about plastic pollution in our oceans, and spread the word. A lot of the plastic in our oceans comes from coastal communities, and it's deadly to birds and marine wildlife. , This can be done solo, with friends or in an organized group. Once you get started, you will not want to quit. Getting started is the hardest part. Don't be embarrassed to do it alone; feel good about doing the environment a good turn.


Pick up litter while walking for exercise or transportation.
Clean up your bus or transit stop if you have a few minutes to wait.
Bring a plastic bag with you on trips, outings and walks.
You can pick up litter on the way to work or school if you don't drive. You may feel embarrassed if this is uncommon in your area. But you will eventually inspire others. You could occasionally take different routes for variety and to see if your actions have taken root with others.
Pick up three things. If you can't carry much or don't have time for a detailed cleanup of an area, just pick up three things. If you pick up three things each day, or each trip out, it can really add up. This is a good thing to suggest to get others involved, too.

, You can make a big difference by yourself, but you'll make a far bigger difference with more people.


Gather up a group of friends or neighbors for an informal litter pickup party. Have participants meet somewhere afterward for a meal or have all bring food for a potluck afterward at your home.
Recruit a group you belong to, or find out if there are groups already active in your area. An area cleanup is a worthwhile community service activity, and can be a good thing to do with a scout troop, service club, or neighborhood association.
Participate in a regional cleanup day. Organize one group and know that there are many others all out making a difference. In 2015, Coastal Cleanup Day volunteers picked up over 1 million pounds of garbage throughout California. .
A litter cleanup can also be a way to get like-minded neighbors together and thinking about opportunities for vacant or underutilized land. Could it be reclaimed as a park, community garden, or open space? Reclaiming or ""activating"" a space for a public use also discourages litter and blight.
Pick an area near a restroom if possible. Keep the area of the project small or the time frame within an hour. Otherwise people may become soured about how much time or work it took.
Have a contest to see who can pick up the the largest number of pieces or the most pounds of trash. Or the most unusual trash. The winner gets a free beverage, cloth bag, or other small prize. (See if a local merchant will donate a prize.)
Don't forget to take photos and thank the volunteers. You can also use the photos to bring attention to the problem and promote subsequent events.

, Many cities support litter cleanup volunteers. If yours doesn't yet, maybe your efforts and requests will convince them to help you and your group. Here are some of the things cities and counties can do to help:


Supply tools and equipment to litter cleanup volunteers. Some cities offer litter sticks, bags, gloves, buckets, safety vests, and other equipment to people who are willing to help clean up litter.
Offer pickup. Ask your city what they can do about larger amounts of trash you collect. The occasional empty cup is easy to deal with, but if your team collects a dozen large bags of trash, you will have difficulty carrying them and disposing of them yourself.
Recognize volunteers who clean up litter. You might get your group's name on a sign for an area you've adopted, or you might get invited to shake hands with the mayor at a city council meeting or other event. Either way, it's good publicity for your group, and it will help to remind everyone that litter is a problem. Official recognition is also a great way to put an end to the negative attitudes that may trouble litter cleanup volunteers.
Install public trash cans in public spaces and maintain them. It's easiest to avoid littering and to clean up occasional litter when there is a trash can close by. It should cost less to empty trash cans than to pick up loose trash from the roadside.
Encourage businesses to clean and maintain their properties.
Sweep the streets, improve the street sweeping schedule, or restrict parking on street sweeping days.
Direct workers to help maintain ""hot spots,"" or certain busy places where litter accumulates too quickly for volunteers to keep up.
Organize, publicize, and support community cleanup days through official or public channels.
Respond to illegal dumping or litter problems beyond the ability or reach of volunteers. If you find a freeway in need of cleanup or an entire sofa that's been dumped down the ravine into the creek, call it in and ask for assistance.
Respond to other maintenance problems you may notice while cleaning up litter, such as graffiti, a leaking fire hydrant, or an abandoned vehicle. Some regions now have apps to allow citizens to report maintenance requests using the GPS and camera on their phones.
Review local trash collection policies and practices to ensure that they do not inadvertently encourage illegal dumping. Is trash getting collected as frequently as it should be? Do residents know when collection day is? Is it costly or difficult to dispose of a large item or excess quantity of trash correctly? If so, are residents or businesses dumping their trash, instead?
Put vacant lots to use as parks or community gardens, or encourage landowners to improve them. Maintain existing parks, schoolyards, and other public spaces and facilities.
Consider an ordinance to reduce single-use plastic shopping bags. Many cities in California passed local bag ordinances, starting with San Francisco in 2007. The state legislature subsequently passed a state law. Plastic bags are a particularly difficult kind of litter because they can fly away even when disposed of correctly. Once in water, they tend to break down into smaller and smaller pieces, without decomposing, which results in micro-plastic pollution. They are also difficult to recycle and produced and distributed in very high volumes. Install trash capture devices in storm drains and creeks to reduce the amount of trash flowing into waterways and oceans.

Book with an airline that offers carbon offsets.,
Use a carbon offset calculator.,
Determine the type of offset you want to purchase.",How to Offset the Carbon Footprint of Flying1," Quite a few major airlines, including Air Canada, Lufthansa, United Airlines, and Delta offer passengers the option to voluntarily offset the carbon footprint of flying. When booking your next flight, choose an airline that offers to offset carbon emissions. Typically, these airlines will calculate the CO2 emissions of your trip and then charge a fee to remove that amount of carbon from the atmosphere.The money will be given to a third party who will either plant trees, invest in energy efficiencies, help to prevent deforestation etc.
Some airlines, such as United Airlines, will even allow customers to offset the carbon by using air miles.;
, If the airline you have chosen does not offer a voluntary carbon offset, you can still offset the emissions yourself by partnering with a company that specializes in carbon offsets. For example, you can use a carbon offset calculator to determine your personal carbon footprint as a result of the flight. The calculator will translate the CO2 emissions into a dollar amount that you can then donate to a carbon offset company.For example, climatecare.org will calculate CO2 emissions for air travel and allow you to donate money to offset the emissions. The site also offers the ability to offset your car, household, and business carbon footprints.

, There are a variety of different types of carbon offsets that you can purchase and whether you are purchasing through an airline or independently, you will be given a choice. In order to choose the most effective way to offset your carbon you will want to consider the type of offset.For instance, planting trees can help remove CO2 from the atmosphere, but they are not permanent and they do not address the global dependence on fossil fuels.
Instead, you may want to invest in renewable energy research or energy efficiencies in developing countries.
Make sure the offset is certified with a recognizable standard, such has the Gold Standard, CDM, or VCS.

Follow all safety rules.,
Show up to required training courses.,
Ask questions when you are unsure.,
Treat the animals with respect.",How to Volunteer at the Humane Society1," Most Humane Society volunteers are required to complete at least a basic training program or orientation in order to learn all of the safe practices in place at the shelter.Safety is of the utmost importance to shelter workers. Follow all safety rules and suggestions.
Only approach animals you have been cleared to interact with, as some animals may require special handling.;
, While you are not a contracted employee of the shelter, you should always show up to required training courses and attend your volunteer duties on time. Though you may be donating your time, failing to be prompt and helpful will reflect poorly on you and waste other workers’ time. If you are going to be late, be sure to call ahead.Most shelters have predetermined orientation dates, so check with your designated chapter to find out which dates work best for you.

, If, as you are going about your duties, you find that you’ve run into a problem or you are not sure how to handle a situation, make sure you ask! Shelter workers want to make sure both you and the animals you are working with are safe and well taken care of.

, Animals held in shelters have often been neglected or abandoned, and are usually jittery and afraid. Always treat the animals with respect, refraining from making loud noises or sudden movements. Although animal attacks within the ranks of volunteer staff are rare, you do not want to risk further damaging an already-struggling animal’s sense of safety and trust.


Shelter animals require a lot of love and attention. If you are having a rough day, or you are running low on patience or attention, consider changing your duties for the day, or requesting a rescheduled volunteer slot.

Take part in a Day of Action.,
Get involved in a Community Care Day.,
Help with food drives.,
Make yourself available.",How to Volunteer at United Way2," This event usually happens in June. Work with other volunteers to promote the work of the United Way. Some communities do flash mobs, hand out t-shirts, or host fundraisers., This event happens in different months, depending on the community. Help feed the homeless. Read to school children in an after school program. Collect pennies, canned goods, and other items for affiliated non-profits., Help collect and deliver food for low-income families in your community. Many chapters collect food during the holidays. In May, U.S. chapters partner with the Postal Service for Stamp Out Hunger. You can sort and deliver the food that postal workers collect., If volunteer registration is closed, sign up to receive updates when help is needed. At the top of the global website, click “Get Updates.” Then, enter your email address and zip code. You can also receive email blasts and text alerts by signing up at your local chapter's website."

Become a mentor.,
Organize a team at your workplace.,
Use your talents and skills at the branch.,
Check with your local chapter about other long-term opportunities.",How to Volunteer at United Way3," Many United Way programs match adults with at-risk children. Get involved in literacy programs. Volunteer as a tutor. Hang out with an at-risk child after school. Just a few hours a week could help at-risk youth get into college or stay away from drugs., Pick a community service project to work on. You might focus on cleaning up parks, restoring historical buildings, or preparing taxes for low-income families. Ask your employer to invite a United Way representative to talk to your team about what's available., Consider this if working within in the community isn't for you. Design posters for upcoming events. Write emails to volunteers and donors. Answer the phones in the office. Chances are, your local chapter will be grateful., Find out if they need volunteers with your skills. Spend your lunch break reading to school children. Help plant community gardens on the weekend. Teach citizenship classes for new immigrants after work. Regardless of the size of your community, your local chapter can match you with an opportunity."

Select an eco-friendly airline.,
Combine trips.,
Take direct flights.,
Fly in economy class.",How to Offset the Carbon Footprint of Flying2," Newer planes are often more fuel efficient and as a result newer airlines often have lower carbon emissions. In order to compare the carbon emissions of different airlines, use Google’s ITA Matrix software. Although the site was developed to find cheap flights, it also provides consumers with the carbon emissions for each flight. You can simply choose the airline with the lowest carbon emissions., A great way to reduce the carbon emissions of air travel is by combining trips. If you are required to go to New York City for business you could schedule multiple meetings in order to save trips. Alternatively, if you need to go to Shanghai for business you could try extending your trip and adding some personal time. This way you can avoid revisiting the same place twice: once for business and once for pleasure., Take-offs and landings use the most fuel. As a result, you should always take the most direct route possible when travelling by air. Even though you may be able to find cheaper flights with layovers, you are actually increasing the carbon emissions significantly., If you have to fly, make sure that you purchase economy class tickets. These seats are closer together allowing more people to fit on each flight, ultimately reducing the carbon emissions per passenger.This also means that you should avoid flying on private planes, which only transport a few people, but still burn a lot of fuel.
Similarly, you should avoid any unnecessary air travel, such as a helicopter ride while on vacation.

"
"
Find other means of transportation.,
Vacation close to home.,
Use video conferences for meetings.",How to Offset the Carbon Footprint of Flying3," Flying is often considered more convenient because you can travel vast distances in a fairly short period of time. Before you take your next flight consider if there are other modes of transportation available. Taking a train, bus, or car can reduce carbon emissions considerably and is ideal when traveling over shorter distances.For example, opt to take a train if you are travelling from London to Paris.

, One way to reduce carbon emissions is by travelling close to home. Many people from around the world likely vacation to an area near you. Look into regional destinations when planning your next vacation.For example, if you live in Toronto try vacationing to northern Ontario and take advantage of the outdoor activities available.
Similarly, if you live in San Francisco vacation in the surrounding wine region.

, Businesses can also reduce costs and consequently carbon emissions by using video conferencing for meetings. Rather than flying employees across the country for a meeting, hold a video conference. This will save the company money and will help to reduce carbon emissions.Video platforms such as Skype and Facetime can allow you to communicate with friends, family, and business associates as if you were in the same room.

"
"
Drive less or carpool.,
Use energy efficient lightbulbs.,
Hang-dry your laundry.,
Eat local foods.",How to Offset the Carbon Footprint of Flying4," Although this will not offset the carbon emissions of an entire flight, you can take steps to reduce your carbon footprint in other areas of your life. This is a great idea for people who are required to fly. For instance, you could drive less frequently or carpool whenever necessary. One way to reduce your car-based emissions would be to ask your employer if you can work from home one day each week. This can help to decrease your carbon footprint and offset emissions related to flying., Install energy efficient lightbulbs throughout your household. These bulbs will reduce your household carbon footprint and can help to offset the emissions associated with flying. Not only will you be reducing your carbon footprint, but LED lights can save you approximately 90% of your lighting costs., Drying clothes using a tumble drier uses a lot of energy. You can reduce your carbon footprint and help to offset flights, by hanging clothes to dry. Set up a clothes line in your yard or house and hang dry your wash. For a family of four this can actually save about 153 kg of CO2 per year (assuming you do approximately 150 cycles of wash/year)., Purchase local meats, fruits and vegetables in order to help reduce your carbon footprint and offset the CO2 emissions of flying. Instead of getting all of your groceries at a supermarket, try shopping at roadside stands, local butchers, farmers markets, or pay particular attention to food labels to ensure they are locally sourced. This can significantly cut the carbon costs associated with transporting foods vast distances."
"
Decide on a local or national branch.,
Reach out to the director of the branch you’ve chosen.,
Fill out a volunteer application.,
Provide your name, contact information, and interest in volunteering.,
Be prepared to provide an essay or references.,
State your availability.",How to Volunteer at the Humane Society2," The Human Society has both national offices and local branches that welcome eager volunteers. While you can volunteer at both eventually, you will likely want to get experience at one before tackling the responsibilities of both.Remember that your tastes will come into play here. To interact with animals more, you would be better off at a local branch. To work more in the administrative or educational aspect of the Humane Society, the national branch is a better option.

, For local Humane Society volunteering, you should be able to quickly and easily contact a worker or manager of the local shelter. If you opt for the national branch, you may need to go through a few levels of screening or emails before receiving a response regarding volunteer opportunities.Some shelters are extremely busy and have a lot of volunteers, so do not become discouraged if you are unable to begin volunteering immediately.

, Before you are able to jump in and start volunteer work, many shelters will require you to fill out a volunteer application. Doing so will give them a better idea of whether or not you are a good fit for their organization., Introduce yourself to the volunteer coordinators, giving them your name, your contact information, and a few details about your interest in volunteering. While they may not have a volunteer opportunity that suits your exact tastes, knowing what you like and prefer will give them a better idea of how you can be of help., Some branches may require you to submit a written or verbal essay regarding your interest in volunteering, while others may require you to submit some letters of reference or reference phone numbers. If this is the case, don’t despair: working with frightened animals can be a difficult job, so they will likely use references to make sure you are up to the task.While not all branches require references, they do require background checks. Keep this in mind when you sign up to volunteer.

, It would be extremely frustrating for a volunteer coordinator to receive a call about volunteering, only to find that the volunteer has no idea what his or her schedule might look like. Before calling, identify the times and days you’re most likely to be available.If you are not sure what your availability will be over the next few months, ask the volunteer coordinators if there are any single-day volunteer opportunities.

"
"
Ask yourself why you want to volunteer.,
Take inventory of your skills.,
Research local and national chapters.,
Create a “volunteer resume.” Much like you would create a resume before a job interview, you should create a simple, one-page volunteer resume, listing any relevant skills, projects, or volunteer opportunities.",How to Volunteer at the Humane Society3," The “why” of volunteering will lend tremendous insight into how you might be of value to the Humane Society. If you love seeing animals well cared for, you may be best suited to bathing and walking animals as a volunteer worker. If you want to see more organization in your local chapter, office work may be better suited to your needs.Shelters want you to enjoy volunteering as much as possible. Make sure you choose something that you can truly commit to long-term.

, Take some time to evaluate any pertinent skills you might have. Your skills do not have to be honed--you do not need to bring a graphic design degree to the table, for instance--but should be consistent. If you are a very patient person, you would likely do well acting as a bather. If you are great with customer service, you might be an excellent choice to work the front counter.Some shelters will conduct interviews, of sorts, to determine how you should volunteer. Be prepared for your interview by having all of your relevant strengths and weaknesses compiled.

, Before deciding what chapter to call or email, do some research to determine what type of volunteering you’d like to do. Volunteering with your local Humane Society branch is going to provide you with the most hands-on volunteer opportunities, while the national branch may be more of an effort to raise awareness.

, While not everyone will require you to present a volunteer resume, it will help the branch know where to place you."

Switch off and unplug.,
Opt for renewable energy sources.,
Change your light bulbs.,
Conserve water.,
Cut down on the air conditioning.",How to Help Take Care of Our Planet1," If you're not using it, why have it on? Switch off everything you don't need -- it saves power and it's a lower electricity bill for you! Before you walk out the door, make a quick scan a habit.


Even better, unplug it. Leaving devices plugged in, such as laptop chargers or toasters, can eat up ""phantom"" energy. Even when an appliance is turned off, it may still use power.;
, Electricity production accounts for more than one-third of U.S. global warming emissions, with the majority generated by coal-fired power plants (which produce approximately 25 percent of total U.S. emissions). In contrast, most renewable energy sources produce little to no global warming emissions. So go for an upgrade now.


Install solar panels or sky lights in your home. The power of the sun will light up your home -- no more unflattering fluorescent lighting on your turf.
Innovative programs around the country now make it possible for all environmentally conscious energy consumers to support renewable energy directly by participating in the ""green"" power market. Contact your local power company to see if they participate in the program.
Let your local representatives know that this is an issue that you (and your friends and family) care about. With enough pressure, your government will take strides to helping take care of our home that they may not do unprompted.

, Compact fluorescent or LED light bulbs may cost more initially, but they last much, much longer. Two decades could pass before you need to buy a new one.Really.


LEDs (a little more so than CFLs) are much more efficient than incandescent bulbs; the old kind uses a vacuum/filament method that's up to 85% worse for energy-saving. If every home in America made just one switch, the equivalent amount of energy saved would light 3 million homes for the year., Helping the planet isn't just about electricity -- it's about water, too. There are many ways you can help the planet just by changing your habits at home.


Take shorter showers. The average American uses 25,300 gallons (95,770.9 L) of water a year (69.3 gallons daily). An average shower uses about 5 gallons (18.9 L) of water per minute. If you shorten your shower by 2 minutes, you can cut your water use by 10 gallons (37.9 L). You can further reduce your water consumption by turning the water off while soaping.Turn off the water or run it lighter. While you're shaving, washing your hands, or doing dishes, you don't need to run the water all the time. While you're lathering up, turn it off. Your good habits will accumulate to a huge amount of over time.
Wash full loads of laundry and dishes. You'll run your appliances less (and hey, less electricity, too!), consuming less water on a weekly basis.

While you're at it, instead of using your dryer, hang your clothes out on the clothesline to dry.



, When you have windows and fans, why use the air conditioner? If you don't absolutely have to (and most times, you don't), skip the AC. It consumes a lot of unnecessary power.


And if it's winter, bundle up! Lower the thermostat for that excuse to cuddle up in a blanket with a glass of hot cocoa. Your body will adjust in no time.

Long-term effects include the possibilities of respiratory disease, cancer, and heart disease. Currently, research is underway to determine precisely what level of certain pollutants cause these effects.;
, Potential sources include combustion, building materials and furnishing, heating and cooling devices, products you bring into your home, and products outside that affect the indoor air, too.


Combustion sources of indoor air pollution include oil, gas, coal, kerosene, wood, and tobacco products.
Building materials and furnishings that can cause air pollution include asbestos-containing insulation, wet/damp carpet, furniture made of particular pressed wood products, and formaldehyde in textiles.
Other indoor air pollution sources include: lead, household cleaning products, personal hygiene products, central cooling and heating systems, as well as humidification devices.
Outdoor sources of air pollution include radon, pesticides, and outdoor air pollution.

, Signs of bad air quality in your home include unusual odors, stale or stuffy air, faulty central heating or air conditioning equipment, damaged flue pipes or chimneys, excessive humidity, mold or mildew, and feeling significantly healthier when outside.

, Eliminate or seal sources of radon, lead, and asbestos. Verify that gas stoves have been properly adjusted. Prevent mold through moisture control. Do not use tobacco products indoors.

, Open windows and doors, and run fans in kitchens and bathrooms.

, Clean and change air filters regularly and keep air ducts clear. Empty and clean water tray in air conditioner. Turn on fans when using air fresheners. Schedule a complete air vent cleaning the next time you have your carpets, tile and other areas of the home cleaned.

, Clean any water spills immediately. Report and fix water leakages. The EPA recommends that indoor spaces stay between 30 and 60 percent humidity: you can measure and maintain these levels.

, Air cleaners are usually highly effective in removing air particles. Maintain air cleaners according to manufacturer’s directions.

, Even new homes are subject to air quality issues; the raw materials used in manufacturing, flooring and other products are known to give off volatile compounds for quite some time. Consider having carpets cleaned in new homes to reduce the effects.

, Air quality specialists can test your home's quality and suggest improvements.

, Instead of using dry dusters, use a spray or moist dust towels to pick-up and eliminate dust. Dry dusting techniques fill the air with dust particles that later settle back on furniture, drapes, and flooring.

, Dirt and grime easily collect on carpets and flooring throughout the home. Use HEPA filters when vacuuming to eliminate the spread of particles through the air and mop floors on a regular basis.

, Upholstery, drapes, and other fabrics throughout the home trap dust, pollen, and other pollutants, including tobacco smoke. Have all fabrics cleaned on a regular basis to reduce the incidents of irritants.

, Use fans or open windows put filters on air handling equipment and use an air purifier to keep the air clean. For an even more convenient option, the Realty Guild Blog explains that heat recovery ventilators (HRV) allow fresh air into a house while retaining the temperature of the indoor air.

, Many products on the market actually contribute to poor air quality; heavy fragrances often use harsh chemicals to make the air smell good for a short period of time. Unfortunately, these chemicals become part of the problem in the long run. Headaches, eye irritation, and other health problems have been associated with the use of heavy household fragrances and deodorizers and even the overuse of candles.

, Chemical cleaners can leave a toxic residue that may be harmful to your health. Read labels carefully and avoid using toxic chemicals that can cause breathing problems, eye irritation, skin rashes, or other potential medical problems. Many of these toxins can linger in the home long after the original cleaning took place.

Avoid needless trips.,
Combine errands and trips.,
Avoid ""cruising"" for parking.,
Telecommute.,

Take transit.,
Carpool.,
Organize a ""walking school bus"" for your neighborhood, if you're the parent of a school-aged child.,
Work with your school to organize a biking and walking day.,
Use map and transit applications to plan your trips.",How to Drive Less," Reducing the length of your trip to work, school, shopping, and wherever else you need to go is a painless, easy way to cut down the distance you drive and the time you spend in the car. It also makes it easier to use transportation other than driving.
, Do what you can online or by phone.

Comparison shop online rather than hunting all over town, or call merchants to ask about prices and availability.
Make an appointment online or by phone.
Deposit checks with a phone camera and app.
Pay bills and send messages online rather than go to the post office.
Call into a meeting or webcast.
Don't shop or drive simply because of boredom. If you're going just to get out of the house, take a walk or bike ride around your neighborhood.

,

Make a shopping list as you run out of items around the house.
Shop in fewer, larger trips.
Reduce the number of separate stores you visit. Is it worth your time and fuel to go all over town for specialty items or better deals?
Combine shopping with other trips, too. Should you visit the post office or doctor while you're in that part of town? Is the store on your way home from work or school?
Take your shopping list with you so you don't have to return to get a forgotten item.

, It's no fun hunting around for a parking spot, and it's a waste of time and resources, too.

Go at times when there will be less demand for parking. You may also manage to miss the crowds in your favorite restaurant or on the roads, by avoiding peak hours.
Don't circle the lot in a quest for the very closest spot. Park further from the building and walk a few more steps.
If you know parking will be costly or in short supply, try to avoid driving. Take transit, carpool, bike, or take the bus.

, If you can perform your work remotely, ask about telecommuting. Not all jobs are suited to it, and not all managers and workplaces are amenable, but if you can save even one day's commute per week, it will add up. Some people find they can be more productive without all the distractions of a busy office., If your trip is less than about 10 miles, try going by bicycle. You'll get exercise and fresh air, and you'll have a lane all to yourself. You might even get there as fast as you could sitting in traffic in a car. Riding a bike is fun, too.

Get a rack, backpack, panniers, or trailer if you need to carry things.
If it's been awhile since you've been on a bicycle, get together with an experienced rider, and make short, easy trips at first.
Don't forget to inflate your tires. It's much easier and you'll go faster with good tire pressure.

, If you're going less than a mile, enjoy some fresh air and get there on foot. It's great exercise, and it offers a nice break from other fast-paced activities., You can walk or bike to the stop, or drive to a park-and-ride.

Use your bus or train time for things you couldn't do while driving. Read a book or magazine, sleep, catch up on your email, plan your day, learn a language, or do a portable handcraft.

, If you do drive, take along passengers. You can share the costs and the driving time, and you may be able to use a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane to save additional time.

Use apps to connect with neighbors with similar commute patterns.
Use rideshare boards to identify people going your way if you are taking a longer drive or road trip.

, There's no bus involved. Instead, children walk to school together in groups, and neighborhood parents take turns supervising the groups., Then, remind everyone to keep it up. Biking and walking to school is more fun the more people do it. It's also safer.

If safety is a difficulty near your child's school, work with the city, the school, or the district to get crossing guards at nearby intersections.
More kids and parents biking or walking to school makes for fewer cars around the school, which is safer for everyone.

, You might spot a way to avoid driving. You might also shorten your route or avoid traffic slowdowns. Some map applications can give you typical or historical traffic, too. Use that information to avoid traveling at peak hours."

Don't use disposable items.,
Get a hybrid or bicycle.,
Start carpooling.,
Opt out of paper mail.,
Recycle.,
Avoid fast food and wasting.,
Buy less.,
Compost.",How to Help Take Care of Our Planet2," So much of today's society is based on grab-and-go convenience. Unfortunately, these items are all ultimately trash. Throughout your day, make an effort to only use items you can use again.


Switch to cloth paper towels and diapers.
Use your own silverware, plates, and cups -- never go plastic to avoid washing.
Don't buy bottled water. Carry around your own water bottle to stay hydrated.
Bring eco-friendly bags to the grocery store. What do you do with those paper or plastic bags when you go shopping? You either end up throwing them out or stockpiling until you have an entire cupboard full of bags you'll probably never use.

, Cars are a huge culprit when it comes to pollution and, put more formidably, destroying the ozone. Who wants to get stuck in traffic anyway?


Less fuel consumption affects oil digging across the world -- a finite resource (that is just getting more and more expensive thanks to demand). Another important consideration in using less fuel is in the amount of toxic gases being released into the air as the fuel is burned to make the engine run.And it saves you money, too.


A bicycle is even better. You know why? You spend zero money on gas, you emit zero toxins into the environment, and you burn way more than zero calories while riding. Win. Win. Win.

, Alright, hybrids are expensive. And bicycles don't go fast enough. What's the next best alternative? Car pooling. And the more people who do it, the better for the environment (and traffic).


As if being greener weren't enough, you'll now get to be one of those people that uses the carpool lane honestly. Because let's be honest: Everyone hates the guy driving down it alone.

, Nowadays, everything is available online. Whether it's your bills, junk, or the newspaper, get out of it. Instead of resenting the pile you're accumulating, you'll get excited when special mail does come.


For all your statements, go green. Get an online account for your bank, credit cards, and subscriptions. Emails don't hurt the environment.
Start reading online. Magazines and newspapers are slowly becoming a thing of the past -- for the environment (maybe not so much for nostalgia), that's a good thing.

, This is one of the most obvious and easiest ways of helping the environment. Whether it's paper, cardboard, plastic, aluminum, or tin, recycle it. If you don't have a recycle bin given to you by your local government, ask for one. They'll take care of it for you.


Recycling doesn't stop there. Nowadays, you can even recycle your old electronics and even get paid to recycle your old phones and MP3 players.Set up your own program in your home. Have your family or roommates put recyclables in designated areas. Have different tubs or containers for different products. When it comes time to recycle, it'll be a cinch.

, When you get fast food, it comes in wrappers and bags that you just throw away. Apart from it not being good for you, it's also not good for the environment. Do what you can to avoid buying packaged goods. Fewer packaged goods on your end means less trash. And our landfills definitely aren't going away.


Moreover, don't waste your food. Though food is better because it's biodegradable, it's still wasting. Keep it for leftovers -- you'll save money and end up using fewer packages or containers.

, Less everything. The fewer things you buy, the smaller your footprint. Get into DIY projects to turn your trash into treasure. Donate your unwanted goods to a thrift shop. Cook more at home.


Don't assume something is trash. Could someone else use it? Is it fixable, but you're just too lazy to fix it? Could it be turned into something else?

, It's good for the environment and for your garden. Designate an area in your yard to put your yard waste, fruit peels, and uneaten food. After a while, you'll be able to use it to fertilize your lawn or garden.


Unfortunately for us and our children, landfills are slowly running out of room. Composting slows the growth of these facilities, making them last longer and ultimately putting trash to good use. It also is a cheaper alternative to reinvigorating soil.That means less methane in our air to boot!

Sound-proof your interior space.,
Drown out the noise with pleasant sounds.,
Turn on white noise.,
Turn off the television.,
Meditate regularly.,
Wear earplugs.",How to Take Action to Prevent Noise Pollution1," Throws rugs are great for absorbing sound, as are carpeting and wall hangings. Even pictures, paintings, and prints on the wall will keep noise from reflecting and bouncing around the room. Installing double-paned windows will help keep the outside noise outside and if you have a noisy neighbor to one side, put a large bookcase (preferably full of books) against the wall between your space and theirs.Also try to make sure that your laundry area has its own door so you can close it and shut out those noisy machines.
Add 1” thick acoustic panels on your walls. These can be purchased in an array of decorative colors and design styles.Putting up curtains can help with sound absorption while making your home more pleasing to the eye.
Cork, cement, and floating wood floors all will help dampen the noise pollution inside your home.;
, This is a natural choice that serves two purposes: it eliminates unpleasant noise while filling the space where you are with sounds that give you pleasure. Put on your favorite music, the sounds of the ocean, or even a book on tape. Whatever you choose, it will be a marked improvement over the stress-inducing noises of the outside world., While it may sound counterintuitive, adding more noise on top of other noise, the drone of a fan can be a pleasant white noise if you have a quality fan. You can also have the hum of a humidifier or dehumidifier or a ceiling fan., Not only can it be a stressor and effect your moods and sleep but studies have found that children who grow up in noisier homes suffer from the effects of noise pollution. Their anxiety levels are heightened and their cognitive, physical, and emotional growth is affected as well. A little TV can be entertaining, just make sure it’s handled in moderation.In fact, turn off ALL electronics, particularly when you are not specifically using them.

, Meditation can solve or alleviate many issues in life and it is extremely effective in the relieving stress of noise pollution while simultaneously teaching you how to block it out. Try meditating twice a day for twenty minutes each time. Do this for at least one month and see if you start noticing the difference.Deep-breathing exercises can also assist in relieving stress and prevent you from noticing the noise pollution. Place the tip of your tongue against the ridge behind your top teeth. Inhale through your nose for a count of four, and exhale through your mouth for a count of seven. Do this for four complete breaths and repeat as necessary.Try guided Imagery by imagining a quiet and motionless place, such as a deserted beach or mountaintop. Fill in all of the details: the sights, sounds, and smells. Soon enough, this peaceful image will replace the world around you., Just like when you go to a concert and are intent on saving your eardrums from damage, these small, spongy devices can help block out noise at home too. From construction to a neighbor’s pool party, earplugs can turn all that noise into a soft, barely audible background hum."

Set an example.,
Remind people of the environmental consequences of littering.,
Don’t confront strangers about littering.,
Explain the laws your state may have about littering.,
Remind people that littering costs the taxpayer money.,
Educate children about the importance of disposing of trash properly.,
Report people for littering.,
Encourage local business owners to maintain their dumpsters.,
Lobby for more trash receptacles around your town.,
Choose a day.,
Choose an area.,
Limit the amount of time.,
Have supplies.,
Advertise your event.,
Consider providing an incentive.,
Be prepared to do it alone.",How to Take Action to Prevent Littering," The best way you can discourage people from littering is by setting a good example. Don’t throw your litter on the ground, pick up litter you see and dispose of it in the trash when you see it, and don’t throw any litter (including cigarette butts) out of your car.


You can also check to make sure that any trash cans you own have a securely fitting lid. A huge source of litter comes from the trash cans that we set out to be collected. If the lid doesn’t fit securely and the trash can gets knocked over, the litter will be blown all around the neighborhood.;
, If you see a friend or family member littering explain to them how that one piece of garbage can have a huge environmental impact. Explain how litter that you throw on the ground may not seem like much, but that litter is usually blown around until it ends up in a stream, river, or the ocean. In addition, litter can harm or even kill many animals who might ingest or get caught in litter.Try to remind people that even if they don’t see what goes on, litter that is thrown on the ground will, at some point, become the problem of another human or animal.

, It may be tempting to go point out that littering is bad, but you may provoke someone into a physical confrontation if you catch them on a bad day. If you want to do something about the littering, go pick up the trash they left and dispose of it yourself.

, Unfortunately, some people don’t really care about the environmental consequences, but they probably care about spending money. Talking about the potential fines and even jail time that a person can face if caught littering might give people a reason to dispose of their garbage properly.Every state in the US has created strict laws about littering. If you are caught littering, you will probably have to pay a fine that can range from $20 up to $3,000, and you could even face jail time depending on the situation. Be sure to warn people that when they litter, they are breaking the law.
On this webpage you can find out what the penalties are for littering in your state.

, Many people don’t realize that the state often spends millions of tax dollars in order to clean up litter. Explaining that litter actually costs them money could be enough to encourage some people to stop doing it.


You can find out about how much your state spends on litter prevention programs by doing an internet search. For example, using the search terms, “litter prevention program” plus the name of your state.

, It is particularly important to set a good example for children, who rely heavily on the actions of others to decide what is OK and not OK for them to do. If you have children, or are with children, never throw litter on the ground. If you do, you are showing them that this is acceptable behavior.


If you are with a child, and they see someone littering, set an example. Go pick up the litter that the person dropped, and throw it in a trash can. Explain to the child that although that person littered, it is a very bad thing to do, and they shouldn’t use that as an example of what is right.
Spend time talking with children you know about why it is important not to litter. Explain how litter harms the planet and the people and animals who live on it.
If you are a kid, and you see your parents or another adult family member littering, don’t be afraid to remind them not to litter.

, In many states, you can report people you see littering to the authorities. For example, in the state of Texas, if you see a motorist littering (e.g. throwing trash or cigarette butts out the window of their car), you can report them using the license plate number, make and model of the car. The state then sends a car trash bag to the litterer along with educational information about litter prevention.You can find out if your state has such a program by doing an internet search using the terms, “litter prevention program” plus the name of your state.

, If you notice a dumpster outside a business that is overflowing or that has lots of litter strewn around the ground, go into the business and ask to speak with the manager. Politely let them know that you’ve noticed that they are creating a lot of litter in the community, and that you hope they will take steps to fix the problem as soon as possible. Most business owners want to maintain a reputation as a community team player, so most will want to address the issue right away, especially if a member of the community has mentioned that they have noticed it.You might consider going back in a few days to see if the problem has been fixed. If it hasn’t, consider going in and letting them know that you see they haven’t fixed the issue, and that you’ll be reporting them to your local authorities if they don’t do something about it soon.

, People will be less likely to litter if they have convenient places to put their garbage. You can contact the mayor of your city or you can approach businesses and ask them to provide a trash can outside their business with a sign that asks people to not litter.Some businesses might be more willing to participate in this kind of thing than others. For example, a cafe, deli, or restaurant that serves food to go might be happy to do something like this because they produce a lot of waste that customers might leave lying around.

, The first step in arranging a community litter pick up is to decide when you will do it. Try to choose a day and time that will allow the most people to come. Though it’s not possible to predict what the weather will do for certain, try to look at the weather forecast, and pick a day when it is expected to be warm and sunny.For example, if you choose to do your litter pick up on a weekday at 2pm, you won’t be able to expect that any working person will be able to come. Therefore, if possible, a Saturday or Sunday may be a good choice. If you want to do it during the week, try to choose a time in the evening before it gets dark.

, You will also need to let people know where you will be picking up litter. Choose an area where you’ve noticed a problem with litter, then limit the cleanup to that area. You can also have the cleanup in your neighborhood, if you want.If possible, choose an area that has boundaries so that people won’t think they’re expected to clean up an entire forest in one day, for example.

, People will be more likely to come if you plan your pick up for a shorter amount of time. If people think they are going to have to give up an entire day to help you they probably won’t feel like coming.Try to choose a one or two hour window during the day, and advertise this as your scheduled pick up time. You can always stay longer if people want to, but this way, people won’t feel like they have to do a full day’s work on their day off.

, Fortunately, a litter pick up doesn’t require much, but it’s good to have enough supplies. Make sure to bring large garbage bags to collect the trash in, gloves to protect people’s hands, and a place to dispose of the garbage bags when the cleanup is over.You can ask people to bring along their own gloves, too. However, try to have at least a few pairs with you for anyone who didn’t bring them.

, Make flyers and post them around the community. Be sure to include the day, time, and address where you will meet for the cleanup. If you need people to bring supplies, be sure to make that explicit in your flyer.You should also not forget to invite people directly. For example, go to all of the homes in your neighborhood to speak to your neighbors directly. Let them know what you’re doing and that you hope they’ll be able to come along and help.
You should also contact your local news station. In some cases, they may be willing to help you advertise your event to the people of your community by making a short announcement about what you will be doing.
Also let schools in your community know about your cleanup. Many schools require their students to participate in volunteer community events at one point or another, so you may be able to get some students to help you.

, This isn’t completely necessary, but if it is within your means, having refreshments at your cleanup event may encourage some people to come. You could, for example, bring lemonade or ice water for people to drink. You could also bring some snacks. For example, you could make a big batch of homemade cookies for all participants to share., Unfortunately, you may end up with no help on the day of the event. If this is the case, don’t just give up and go home. Go out and pick up the trash yourself. Hopefully you will at least have a few friends or family members there to help you, but even doing it completely alone sets a good example for others.If you do end up completely alone be sure to call and let someone know that you are out picking up trash, where you are, and when you plan to be done.

Plant trees and shrubs.,
Talk to your neighbors.,
Control your own noise.,
Start a petition.,
Request acoustical site planning.",How to Take Action to Prevent Noise Pollution2," The USDA National Agroforestry Center states that planting trees and shrubs is a natural noise buffer that can lower noise by five to ten decibels. It’s important to note that they should be planted closest to the source of the noise rather than the area being protected. Using plants that have dense as well as varied foliage shapes will help make your “plant wall” more sound absorbant.The closer together you plant your trees and shrubs, the more complete and effective the barrier will be.
Trees like evergreens will provide year-round protection as their leaves never drop.
If tall trees are restricted due to zoning, use the tallest shrubs you can and perhaps consider ground cover that will help create a solid wall.

, If they are making too much noise or the music is up too loud, politely ask them if they mind turning it down. This can be a touchy subject as some neighbors are more amenable to being asked this than others. Usually, however, if you approach them and build a rapport they will comply because they know that one day the situation just might be reversed.

, Show your neighbors respect by remembering that you are capable of being the noisemaker as well. Just because you’re enjoying the sounds of your life doesn’t mean your neighbors are. Keep them in mind and keep your own noise to a minimum. Here are some of the ways you can make a difference:When you listen to music, keep the volume down and close the windows.
Use manual lawnmowers instead of electric or gas powered ones.

Commute by bike rather than driving a loud, polluting car.
Keep the noise level at parties down.
Don't make noise at night.

, If there are specific, consistent noises that are ruining the quality of life for your neighborhood or near your office, consider raising the issue with the local or city government to do something about it. Solutions can range from large-scale replacement of road surfaces and building barriers to lowering speed limits and banning trucks on certain roads.Lobby companies that make too much noise by writing letters to those that are producing a lot of noise that interferes with neighborhood peace.

, If a new business is being built in your neighborhood, be sure to attend any and all land use meetings and request that the builders use this method to minimize the impact of noise on the surrounding community. There are many things they can do, including:Increase the distance between the source of the noise and the surrounding community.
Put nonresidential portions of the property like parking lots and utility areas between the source of the noise and the surrounding community.
Place insulating barrier-type buildings that run parallel to the noise source (or highway).
Point the noise source away from the surrounding community.
They can also design the area containing the noise source to be windowless, to be acoustically sound-proofed, etc.

Pull down the blinds.,
Use ""warm"" lights in your house lighting.,
Install smart lights.,
Leave some activities for daytime only.,
Spread the word to your family and friends.,
Reach out to the neighborhood.,
Write a letter to your city council.,
Join a light pollution awareness group.,
Support green buildings.",How to Take Action to Prevent Light Pollution," Both LED and low-pressure sodium bulbs are very energy efficient for the light they produce. Low-pressure sodium bulbs produce a very warm light that does not heavily affect the atmosphere.It's vital when choosing LEDs that they are reduced in brightness/lumens, are fully shielded, and are a warm (yellow or amber) correlated color temperature (CCT) or 3000K or less (2700K is preferable).The key is to limit blue and green light emissions.;
, Use reflectors outside to help light any pathways. This saves you from purchasing a whole row of lights to brighten the same pathway.Always opt for the more directed, lower light options where possible to avoid excess glare.

, Bulb caps and shields ensure the light does not emit straight into the sky. These range from “non cutoff” all the way to “full cutoff” lights. Full cutoff shields prevent the largest amount of light ""bleeding"" among the shields., This helps prevent stray light from entering the atmosphere. Light reflecting off of the ground, even at night, provides plentiful light for night activities., These lights only turn on when they sense movement in their field of view. These can be placed on garden paths, near garages, around dark spaces and even in hallways. By turning on only when useful to someone, the lights pay for the investment rather quickly.If you have family members who need to use the bathroom frequently, these lights are more energy efficient than leaving one on all night.

, There is no need to have your entire house lit up at all times. Turn off the lights in rooms that are not currently in use.


Turn off the lights when you exit a room, even if you are only leaving the room for a brief period of time.
Try making signs and place them near light switches to remind everyone in the home to turn off the lights when they leave the room., Having a brilliantly lit party? Keep it inside and don't let the light glow out. Pull down the blinds, pull across the drapes and dim the switches just a bit to add to the mood.

, ""Cool"" or lights on the blue end of the spectrum are harsh and more noticeable from a distance.Warmer lighting, such as those with yellow or orange hues, is less harsh and does not spread as easily into the atmosphere., Smart lighting kits are a great option for maintaining a greater level of control over your lights. Smart lights are able to be controlled and programmed through your smart device, allowing for a pinpoint level of efficiency in your home.Dim your lights according to the task at hand, and save the setting for later use. This can give you the minimum lighting you need at the press of a button.
Program your smart lights to turn on only at particular hours of the day, or to turn off at certain intervals. This ensures that all of your lights will be off when you leave for work, even if you forget to turn them off yourself.
Smart lights can also be controlled remotely. If you have left the house and a light has been left on, you can turn them off from your smart device.

, Activities that require strong lighting, such as painting walls or artwork, sewing, and cleaning, are best left to when the sun provides a light source.


Painting for example requires strong, white light to properly display the true values of the colors you are working with. This light can easily bleed from your windows., Many people either don't know about or don't understand sky glow and the negative impacts too much light at night. Be an ambassador and explain the issues to others. You will then have growing ranks of night sky protectors.


Show them images of what the night sky looks like without light pollution. NASA has an assortment of images that can help argue your case by showing the beauty of the night sky., Fighting light pollution requires a group effort. Even a few houses in a neighborhood can make a noticeable difference in night sky visibility.


Reach out to your neighbors in a friendly manner. Consider sending them a letter or bringing it up during a block party. Many people are unaware that their lights are harmful or distracting.
Suggest alternatives to their existing lights, and offer to help them choose and install replacements., Suggest that they change local street lights to more eco-friendly variations. There are a variety of new street lamps that are designed to reduce light pollution as well as cut back on costs., Several awareness groups dedicated to light pollution have been created in recent years. They offer a way to put your head together with like-minded individuals to create change on a larger scale.These awareness groups provide additional tips for eco-friendly lighting, as well as which lighting products are healthiest for the environment.

, Many buildings have begun building “green” in order to become more eco-friendly. If the building where you work is renovating or if new construction is starting in your neighborhood, ask the party responsible about their plans to combat light pollution.


Direct your employer to organizations such as LEED. LEED recognizes and certifies buildings that build green, which can help bring some positive attention to your company."

Drive less.,
Maintain your car.,
Fuel up in cooler temperatures.,
Purchase a hybrid or electric vehicle.",How to Reduce Smog1," Traditional cars and trucks produce nitrogen dioxide as a byproduct of driving and idling so one easy way to cut back on emissions is to drive less. Try walking, biking, or taking public transit instead.


If your location is close enough, try walking or biking, especially if the destination has showers for clean up (workplace, gym, etc.).
Many large cities offer public transportation such as buses, subways, trains and ""park and ride"" which allows you to park your vehicle and take public transit to your destination.Don't drive during certain times. For example, drive less during peak traffic periods, when it is extremely hot, or when there are ozone warnings in effect.If driving is a necessity, try setting up a carpool so there are fewer cars on the road and fewer trips being made.;
, Keeping your car ""healthy"" will not only improve mileage, but can also reduce emissions. Get regular tune-ups and oil changes and make sure your tires are properly inflated to ensure your car is functioning at its best.


Many states require smog and emission tests to make sure your car isn't emitting too much pollution. These are usually required annually or bi-annually.Inflating your tires to the correct pressure allows the engine to function better by maintaining a steady load.Consult your mechanic or your owner's manual for specific information regarding maintenance for your vehicle.

, Pump gas early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures drop. This prevents the fumes from gasoline from heating up and creating harmful toxins at ground level (ozone).There are alternative fuel sources that are in the works such as ethanol, natural gas, and hydrogen, but not all engines can function off of these fuel sources., These vehicles have been known to dramatically reduce emissions for many reasons (depending on the type of model). Some decrease the consumption of fuel while others do away with fuel altogether. The result is a reduction in tail pipe emissions and therefore a reduction in smog.Hybrid vehicles are fueled by gasoline alone but have the ability to recapture energy and use it to power the car, resulting in less fuel consumption.Electric vehicles are powered by electricity alone and must be plugged in and charged in order to drive.Plug-in hybrids are the best of both worlds, running off of either electricity or gasoline."

Avoid high VOC products.,
Avoid gas-powered yard equipment.,
Buy local.,
Be energy efficient in your home.",How to Reduce Smog2," VOCs are chemicals that easily escape into the atmosphere through common use around the house. Check the front label of household products to determine if they contain VOCs.


Examples of common products include nail care products (acetone, ethyl alcohol), paint strippers or adhesive removers (methylene chloride), and aerosol spray products (butane).Check the National Institute of Health's household product's database for more information about specific products and their ingredients.Shop for ""green"" products that don't contain VOCs.
If you must use VOC products, buy in small quantities that can be used quickly instead of stored. If you must store the product, do so in a tightly sealed, original container, in a well-ventilated area.

, Gasoline emissions is one of the major causes of smog--whether from vehicles or lawn equipment. Try eco-friendly lawn mowers, hedgers, trimmers, or any other lawn equipment that can be powered electrically.


You can also avoid mowing altogether by changing the material in your yard. Opt for artificial grass, succulents, hard landscapes, or rock gardens to do away with mowing forever.There are also ""real grass alternatives"" that look and act like traditional grass turf, but require less maintenance., When you buy products that are made locally, it cuts down on the cost of transport which reduces emissions. Local farmer's markets and grocery stores can help you determine where items were produced.


There are many sites online that link local buyers and sellers such as Direct Local Food, GrowBuyEat, and AgLocal.Besides farmer's markets, try local farmer's stands, farms, and wineries.
There are even many restaurants that are joining the movement towards supporting locally grown items.Make a community garden. Grow vegetables and fruit for your community and local distribution.

, The less energy you consume at home, the less pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. There are many ways to decrease energy consumption including through lighting, heating and cooling, and appliance use.


Replace your old incandescent light bulbs with energy saving halogen incandescents, CFLs, and LEDs which can be found at your local hardware store.For heating and cooling try energy-saving thermostats that automatically reset temperatures while you're away from home.
Shop for energy-efficient appliances that use less energy such as washers, dryers, refrigerators, and dishwashers.

Don't support countries or organizations without smog laws.,
Promote your stance.,
Contact local politicians and business leaders.",How to Reduce Smog3," While America has done a fair job in passing laws to protect the environment, many countries still don't regulate environmental pollution levels (Haiti and Malaysia have the poorest regulations).By not supporting commerce from countries or organizations, you raise awareness of the problem.


You can also boycott companies that add to the pollution problem. For example, companies like Nestle, Pfizer, and Walmart have been known to not only add pollution to the air but to also violate pollution regulations.An app such as Buycott can help you identify products and companies with poor environmental track records, simply by scanning a product's bar code., Don't be afraid to tell people your opinion on the issue, and what you are doing to help solve it. You can do this by speaking to those closest to you (family, friends, co-workers) or reach more people through social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube).


Start a community project such as an initiative to replace light bulbs or a carpool to a farmer's market once a month.
Start a carpool with your co-workers. Not only will it cut down on emissions but it will demonstrate your passion for the cause.

, Ask them for information about what they are doing to reduce smog levels in your community. If they do not reply or reply with inadequate measures, consider lobbying for change.


Sign a petition. There are many petitions online that are lobbying for better air quality control by our government. Find one that peaks your interest, or start your own.
Try sites like change.org or petitions.whitehouse.gov to look for petitions or start one on a smaller, local level.

Contact local farms or your political representatives to advocate for more efficient fertilizer use.,
Write to your local or national representative.,
Talk to your friends about how they can protect the ozone layer.",How to Protect the Ozone Layer2," Organic and inorganic fertilizers are by far the largest human source of nitrous oxide production, and this gas is now the prime culprit in depleting the ozone layer. Fertilizers are of course important, but to limit their impact on our atmosphere, suggest these practices that both save money and reduce emissions:Better matching fertilizer rates to crop requirements.
Using fertilizer formulations and additives that reduce emissions.
Improving fertilizer timing to assure maximum nitrogen absorption.
Using precision fertilizer placement to minimize nitrogen loss to the atmosphere.

, The majority of man-made ozone depleting chemicals now come from agriculture. Encourage your representative to put forth laws governing fertilizer use. Be sure to point out that by using fertilizer more effectively, these laws can save farmers money while also protecting the environment.

, Shrinking the hole in the ozone layer will take all of us working together. Encourage your friends to drive less, eat less meat, buy local, and to properly dispose of old fire extinguishers or cooling appliances containing ozone depleting substances.

Drive less.,
Eat less meat.,
Buy local.",How to Protect the Ozone Layer3," Nitrous oxide is now the largest ozone-depleting substance released by human activities (as well as a potent greenhouse gas),and it is produced in the internal combustion that powers most cars. In the U.S., about 5% of all nitrous oxide pollution comes from vehicles.To reduce the amount of nitrogen oxide your car produces, consider:


Car pooling
Public transport
Walking
Biking
Driving a hybrid or electric car

, Nitrous oxide is also produced when manure decomposes, making poultry, beef, and dairy farms large producers of the gas., The further your food or other goods have to travel to reach you, the more nitrous oxide will be produced by the engines that bring them to you. Buying local is not only a great way to find the freshest produce; it will also protect the ozone layer.

Locate the appropriate state or local agency.,
Gather information about the problem.,
Decide whether you want to remain anonymous.,
Fill out your complaint form.,
File your complaint.,
Follow up on your complaint.",How to Take Action Against Pollution on Private Property1," Depending on the type of pollution or environmental hazard present, you may need to file a complaint with a particular state or local agency to get the problem resolved.You may have to call your state agency in charge of environmental affairs to find out the appropriate agency with which to place your complaint.
You also may be able to find information on your state or county's website. Look for an agency with ""environmental"" or ""pollution"" control or prevention in its name.
Particular types of pollution may be handled solely on a local or county level. Knowing which agency has the ability to do something about the problem you're experiencing can save you a lot of time and hassle.;
, Before you can file a complaint with a state or local agency, you must have as much detail as possible about the situation that's occurring, including the names of the owners of the property and the type of pollution involved.Keep in mind that the more details and specifics you have, the more likely it will be that the agency will decide to investigate the problem.
If your report is vague and gives them little to go on, investigators may lack the basic information necessary to launch an investigation, which may require obtaining search warrants or other permission to enter private property.

, Most state agencies allow you to file an anonymous complaint. However, if you don't provide your name and contact information the authorities will have no way to get in touch with you if they need more information, and you will have no way to check on the status of your complaint.There are some situations in which the value of remaining anonymous outweighs any of the benefits of giving your name – but you want to weigh the pros and cons carefully.
For example, if you are filing a complaint about your neighbor and you want to preserve a reasonably civil relationship with them, you might consider remaining anonymous so they don't harbor ill feelings and resentment toward you.
However, you should keep in mind that in most cases the property owner won't learn the identity of the person who filed the complaint. Your identity and contact information will only be shared with investigators.
If you're concerned about maintaining the confidentiality of your name and other personal information contained within your report, speak to someone with the agency about it.

, Typically you can find a complaint form to fill out online, however, you may have to go to your local agency office to request a paper form. Some agencies also have a hotline you can call to submit your complaint.If you call a hotline, you should be prepared to tell the representative the same information that you would've included in a written complaint.
Generally, the agency needs to know where the property is located, who owns it, what type of pollution is occurring, and whether the pollution was a one-time thing, is sporadic, or continuous and ongoing.
Some agencies also allow you to attach photos or other information as evidence of the pollution.

, Once you're satisfied that the information in your complaint is true and complete to the best of your knowledge, file it with the agency using the agency's procedures. If you had to fill out a paper form, it usually will include instructions on where and how to submit it.You may want to make a copy of your complaint for your own records before you send it.
If you receive a confirmation or reference number when you submit your complaint, keep it in a safe place. You may want to write it on your copy of the complaint so all the information is together in one place.

, If you provided your name and contact information on your complaint, you may have the ability to contact the agency and find out if any action has been taken on your complaint.When you submit a complaint online, some agencies will send you an email confirming receipt of your complaint. That email may contain a reference number or contact information if you want to update or check the status of your complaint.
If you receive further information after you've submitted your complaint and weren't given a procedure on how to update it, you may have to file an additional complaint. Mention the previous complaint when you file a new one.
Keep in mind that agencies have broad discretion on whether to launch an investigation as a result of a single complaint. If you have neighbors who also are experiencing problems with the pollution, encourage them to file complaints as well.

Visit the website of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).,
Collect information about the situation you want to report.,
Complete the online complaint form.,
Send your complaint.",How to Take Action Against Pollution on Private Property2," The federal agency maintains information on national pollution laws and agency regulations for dealing with pollution on private property, as well as an online complaint form you can use.On the website you can find information regarding the types of pollution issues the EPA handles. Often the EPA requires that you first submit a complaint to your state or local government before the EPA will step in.
The EPA provides a list with examples of typical situations people might encounter and who you should call to deal with the problem.
If you've looked over the information on the EPA's website and determined you should file a complaint with them, you can click the ""report environmental violations"" link to access the online complaint form.

, To file a complaint with the EPA, you will need to have information about the property, including the names of its owners, and the type of pollution that is occurring there.You will need to have information about the property causing the pollution and the person who owns it, as well as the dates you experienced the problem.
If the pollution is a continuing issue, you'll need to be able to provide an estimated date when the problem occurred.
You may want to review the types of issues addressed by the EPA to determine the types of details you should include in your complaint to get the EPA involved.

, You can file a complaint with the EPA right from the agency's website. The agency allows you to remain anonymous. However, if you don't provide your name and contact information, investigators won't have any way to contact you.If you've already contacted your state or local agency, the EPA provides space for you to indicate that and list the name of the person handling the complaint, if you know the name of someone who investigated or otherwise handled your situation.

Gather information about the problem.,
Consider consulting an attorney.,
Draft your complaint.,
File your complaint.,
Wait for a response.",How to Take Action Against Pollution on Private Property3," Before you file a lawsuit, you need to know the owners of the property who are responsible for the pollution. You also must conduct whatever research is necessary to formulate allegations that demonstrate the pollution is a violation of your state law.Keep in mind that to claim the pollution is either a public or private nuisance, you must have proof that it interferes with your reasonable use and enjoyment of your property.
A private nuisance affects people individually, while a public nuisance affects the general public. Some pollution may qualify as a public nuisance.
However, for you to file a lawsuit regarding a public nuisance you must be able to prove that some exception applies, such as the fact that you have a special injury caused by the pollution that is different from the general harm suffered by the public at large.
If your claim is based on health conditions, you probably should have medical evidence, particularly statements from medical professionals to the effect that your physical condition was caused or exacerbated by the pollution.
You might also want to talk to neighbors about how the pollution is affecting them. Filing several lawsuits at once may increase the chances that the judge will issue an injunction against the property owner to stop the pollution.

, Because environmental law can be complex, you may benefit from the assistance of an experienced environmental attorney who has previously handled cases dealing with pollution on private property.Typically attorneys won't take these types of cases on contingency, since often the only thing you can ask for is a court order for the property owner to cease the polluting activity.
However, you may be able to sue for attorney's fees as part of your lawsuit. If you win, the defendant will be ordered to pay your attorney's fees which you owe or have already paid out of pocket. Whether you can include attorney's fees in your damages depends on your state's law.
If you're concerned about the cost of attorney's fees, you might want to check with any nonprofit environmental organizations in your area. Many of them have legal teams that provide assistance to individuals taking action against pollution.

, Your complaint includes allegations that together demonstrate that the pollution constitutes a violation of state law, or that it is a nuisance as defined by your state law, and that you personally have suffered damages as a result of this pollution.If you've decided to represent yourself, check with the clerk of the court where you want to file your lawsuit for forms. You also may be able to download these online. If the court doesn't provide fill-in-the-blank forms, ask for copies of complaints filed in other lawsuits that you can use as guides to format your document properly.
Identify yourself as the plaintiff and the owners of the property as the defendants. Then list your allegations in numbered paragraphs, one factual allegation per paragraph.
You also must explain how those allegations add up to a violation of the law, and tell the court specifically what you want it to do as a result of this violation.
Sign your complaint. Some jurisdictions may require you to sign your complaint in the presence of a notary public if you are not being represented by an attorney.

, Once you've completed and signed your complaint, make at least two copies of it and take them all to the clerk of the court in which you want your lawsuit to be heard. The clerk will stamp your originals and copies, and return the copies to you.You'll have to pay filing fees when you file your lawsuit, typically several hundred dollars for a civil suit in county court. If you don't think you can afford filing fees, ask the court clerk for a fee waiver application.
On the fee waiver application, you'll have to provide information about your income and assets. If the money you have available falls below the court's threshold, you won't have to pay court costs for your case. Often you automatically qualify for a fee waiver if you receive public benefits.
After you file your complaint, one of the copies you made must be delivered to the defendants using a particular process called ""service."" Complaints in county court typically are hand-delivered by a sheriff's deputy.
You also may be able to mail the complaint to the defendants using certified mail with returned receipt requested. When you get the receipt back, you'll be responsible for filing a proof of service document with the clerk.

, When the defendant is served with your lawsuit, they have a limited period of time – typically 20 or 30 days – to file some sort of response. If the deadline passes and you don't receive a response, you may be eligible to win by default.The defendant may file a motion to dismiss, which at this stage argues that even if all of the allegations in your complaint are true, they don't add up to a violation of the law for which you can sue for damages or a court order.
You also may receive an answer denying most of your allegations. This doesn't necessarily mean the defendant is saying your allegations aren't true. Rather, the defendant is forcing you to meet your burden of proof in the trial.
Assuming the defendant responds before the deadline, you typically will begin the process of litigating the lawsuit. Don't be surprised if you also receive some sort of settlement offer from the property owner.

Gather evidence of pollution.,
Report the pollution to your state government.,
Contact your city attorney.,
Meet with a lawyer.",How to Take Action Against Pollution on Public Property1," Take pictures or video, if possible. If dead fish wash ashore, then you can collect those as well. Also collect the following information, which you will want to share with the appropriate government authority:the identity of the polluter, including the individual’s name, company name, and contact information
the type and quality of materials used
where the pollution occurred
the dates of the polluting
any bodies of water impacted
whether you have contacted any other government agency;
, Your state probably has a department that accepts complaints about pollution. In Virginia, for example, the Department of Environmental Quality makes an online complaint form available to the public.To find your state’s agency, search for “your state” and “report pollution.” There may be a phone number you can call.
You might be able to report anonymously. However, you should think about giving your name. If you give your name, then the government agency can contact you with follow-up questions. You may also be asked to testify if the government sues the polluter.

, You generally cannot sue for pollution on public property. This is called “public nuisance.”Instead, you will need your city or state to sue a polluter.


Find the phone number in your phone book or look online. Call and report the pollution. Offer to show the lawyer’s office your evidence.

, If you were injured by the pollution, then you should meet with a lawyer. The lawyer will help you understand whether you can bring a “public nuisance” lawsuit. Typically, you can only bring a public nuisance lawsuit if you were injured in a way that is different than the rest of the public at large.For example, the pollution might have triggered a family member’s allergies, leading to their incapacitation. You might be able to sue in this situation.
To find a qualified attorney, visit your state or local bar association and ask for a referral. Once you have a name, call the lawyer and schedule a consultation.
Take all relevant documents to the lawyer, including medical records, your pictures of the pollution, and any response from government officials.

Check how you can testify.,
Prepare your testimony.,
Dress appropriately.,
Testify before a government body.,
Answer questions.",How to Take Action Against Pollution on Public Property2," Most state legislatures allow members to testify about bills the legislature is considering. However, the process for signing up may differ by state. You can find the process by calling the office of the committee that is holding the hearing. Ask where the hearing is being held. Also ask how you can testify.


You usually have to sign up to testify. The process will differ by legislative committee., If you are going to testify before a legislative committee, then you should probably write out your testimony ahead of time. Some legislative committees actually recommend that you do so, and that you bring multiple copies with you to the hearing. You should bring enough so that each committee member has a copy.Try to keep your written remarks brief. Many other people may be testifying, and you don’t want to take up too much time., You should look professional if you want to be taken seriously. This means dressing in a business manner—preferably suits for men and women. Women can wear either pant suits or skirt suits.


You should avoid “Greenpeace” T-shirts or anything like that. People will assume you care deeply about the environment simply by virtue of your appearing to testify, so there is no need to hammer the point home with your clothing.

, Remember to keep your voice up. Also, try not to read directly from what you have written. Instead, make an outline of your written remarks and refer to the outline as you speak.Look up and make frequent eye contact with the legislators.


Begin by introducing yourself and stating why you are testifying. For example, you could say, “Madame Chair and members of the committee, I am Tanya Smith from Skokie. I am here representing myself in opposition to the bill to renew the license for this power plant because it is already one of our community’s worst polluters….”
If someone speaking before you made the same point, then skip it or try to rephrase it.You don’t want to repeat things other people have said.

, The legislators may have questions that they want to ask you. You should be prepared for them.Listen to the question and don’t talk over the legislator.


Try to keep your answers as brief as possible.
Also be honest. If you don’t know the answer to something, then say so. The legislators do not expect you to be an expert. You can always tell the legislators that you will gladly follow up with a written response after you do more investigation."

Reach out to the media.,
Contact universities and medical centers.,
Discuss the pollution with other affected parties.",How to Take Action Against Pollution on Public Property3," Government action can often take a long time and their resolutions may not meet your expectations. In addition to taking government action, or in lieu of it, contact large media outlets in your area. When you talk with the media, you will bring awareness to the pollution. The more people that become aware of the pollution on public land, the quicker the government will get involved. Call newspapers, television stations, and radio stations and tell them about the pollution.


Before you contact the media (i.e., radio, print, or television), make a plan and media statement. You do not want to be quoted inaccurately or sound like you do not know what you are talking about. When you create a media plan, think about who you want to contact, what you want to say, and who you want to connect with.
You may even want to hire someone to help you with your media blitz. These individuals may help you schedule appearances, create talking points, and stay on track. In addition, if you hire a pollution expert, they may be able to speak on your behalf about the particular pollution taking place.

, If the pollution is affecting the health and well-being of people, you may want to contact university medical centers about the problem. Universities may be privately owned and may be willing to advocate on your behalf. In addition, universities often have professors that always want to be involved and students who want to help as well. If there are health concerns, medical specialists may be willing to test the pollution and gauge its affect on individuals. These results may push the government to respond to your concerns.


Even if the health and well-being of people are not at risk, universities are a great resource for concerned citizens. Professors and students are usually very involved in their communities and their help can push for change. In addition, a lot of universities provide specific programs that help students learn about pollution. For example, Rutgers University has an Air Pollution Training Program that helps teach people about testing processes. They offer classes and training programs for students, governments, and private citizens. Contact these programs and alert them about pollution. They may be able to use it as a learning tool and it might lead to increased awareness.

, The more people you can get on your side the better. Governments will be more likely to respond to complaints or concerns if a lot of people are voicing the same issues. Therefore, contact individuals abutting the public land where the pollution is occurring. Tell them about the pollution and what needs to be done to fix it. Once you contact those that are the most affected by the pollution, start contacting others you think may be concerned. This might include lawyers and business owners.


Apart from contacting interested parties, make sure you urge them to make their voices heard. Ask if they will file complaints, talk to the media, and make phone calls to their representatives. It is not enough to make people aware; you also need to demand action.

Reduce the use of harmful products to the environment.,
Reduce the amount of plastic you use.,
Reduce your garbage amount.,
Reduce paper use.",How to Prevent Land Pollution1," Ways to reduce pollution in your home:


Buy biodegradable products.
Store all liquid chemicals and waste in spill-proof containers.
Eat organic foods that are grown without pesticides. Look out for fertilizer or pesticide free products when you go to the market.
Don’t use pesticides if you can.
Use a drip tray to collect engine oil.
Buy products that have little packaging.
Don’t dump motor oil on the ground.;
, Researchers fear that such plastic bags may never fully decompose; instead, they gradually just turn into smaller and smaller pieces of plastic. How to reduce the amount of plastic you use in your home:


Don’t use garbage bags—just empty your trash into the garbage bin.
If you don’t like that approach, get yourself some recycled or biodegradable, compostable garbage bags.
Request that your daily newspaper not be wrapped in plastic when delivered. (Or cancel your newspaper subscription and go totally online for your news fix– you’ll save hundreds of trees as well.)
Take your own plastic or metal container to the restaurant to take home your leftovers when you’re eating out. Sure they’ll look at you funny, but remember you’re an eco-trend-setter!
Remind your favorite take-out place to leave out the plastic utensils, straws, napkins, and condiment packets when they pack your food to go. And politely decline the bag if you only have one or two items to carry home. Better yet, dine in the restaurant where you can use a real plate and fork.

Take reusable bags with you to the store. Decline the bag if you only have a few items.
Ask your favorite dry-cleaners to eliminate the plastic wrap on your clothes. Don’t forget to choose an eco-friendly, non-toxic dry cleaner too.

Pack a waste-free lunch to take to office or school.

,


Properly maintain all underground storage tanks, like oil, septic, and sewer lines. Have your septic tank pumped on schedule and look for signs of leakage, such as soggy areas in the yard, odor, slowing and backups in the home, and excessive plant growth over a particular area. Most septic systems need pumped every three to five years.
Be diligent about picking up and disposing of trash. Dispose of animal waste into a septic or sewage system as promptly as possible--do not leave it on the lawn or place it in a storm drain.
Do not burn trash, particularly plastics or tires, because the residue in the smoke will settle and pollute the soil.

,


Choose digital subscriptions, statements, and bills.

Ask to be removed from junk mail lists and avoid signing up for new ones.
Say no to receipts.

Dry your hands using just one paper towel. Use a washable fabric towel when you're at home. If possible, carry a small fabric towel with you to school or work, too. Bring it home occasionally and wash it with the rest of your laundry.
Use reusable fabric cloths, a feather duster, or a broom instead of paper towels or Swiffer.

",How to Prevent Land Pollution2," This will help reduce the amount of water and lawn chemicals needed to maintain your yard.

, Water more deeply and in the morning when it is cooler. This prevents nutrients from leaching out of the soil during excessive watering and reduces the need for fertilizers, while encouraging a deeper root system in your lawn.

, As much as 85 percent of the energy used to machine-wash clothes goes to heating the water.

, Not only is bottled water expensive, but it generates large amounts of container waste.

Use ""gray water"" on ornamental gardens and plants.,
Use sink water to flush toilet waste.,
Harvest rainwater.",How to Prevent Land Pollution4," ""Gray water"" is a term for water that has already been used in showers, bathtubs, sinks or dishwashers. This water is certainly not fit for human consumption, but it is clean enough to be used in gardens and on plants around the house. Bathwater or shower water is best, but water that has been used to wash dishes is also okay, as long as there's not too much grease or food left on the dishes before they go into the washer. Water may be collected manually by scooping it out of the bathtub, or drainage pipes can be re-routed to a small storage tank.

, 13,000 gallons (49,210.4 L) of water are used by each person each year in developed countries to flush away only 165 gallons (624.6 L) of waste! To make water usage more efficient, some water can serve two purposes before it leaves the home. Since it's not necessary to flush a toilet with clean water, pipes can be re-arranged so that gray water from the bathroom sink will fill the toilet's tank.

, Just place a barrel at the bottom of a downspout and collect rainwater there. The EPA claims that a house with a 1,500 square foot roof in a region that gets at least 20 inches (50.8 cm) of rain a year could potentially collect 18,680 gallons (70,711.5 L) of water annually. This water may then be used for watering lawns and gardens.

Sound-proof your space.,
Keep noisy machines away from your bedroom and living areas.,
Spend time away from noise.,
Learn to meditate.,
Use earplugs and noise-canceling headphones.,
Install noise-reducing insulation and glass.",How to Prevent Noise Pollution1," When you can't stop the noise at it's source, you can do your best to keep it out. Sound-proofing your home will help you rest easier at night and keep your home quieter during the day as well. If you can't sound-proof your entire home, you might want to invest in sound-proofing your bedroom, so you'll have at least one respite from the noise when you just can't take it anymore.


If you don't want to reconstruct your walls and floors with sound-proof building materials, consider the less expensive option of installing carpeting and wall coverings that soften and absorb sounds.
Acoustic foam panels are a cheap, easy-to-install option when you want to quickly soundproof a room. For an even easier solution, try hanging blankets on the walls or installing extra bookcases filled with books.;
, Situate your home so that your bed isn't right next to your noisy furnace or air conditioning unit. If there are any other sources of constant noise, try to locate them far away from your sleeping and living areas so you can have some peace and quiet.


You might also want to consider using these machines less to give yourself a break from the noise. Turn off your air conditioner and open the windows, even if it means being a little hotter than normal. You might find the less noisy atmosphere more relaxing than a cooled-down room.

, Sometimes it's simply impossible to truly get away from the noise. If you live on a busy street with lots of traffic, you know there's never really a respite from traffic sounds, sirens and honking horns. Getting away from it all is a good way to restore your emotional balance. Go to a quiet spot that's as free of sound as possible. Stay there and enjoy the silence for a few hours, until you feel renewed and ready to reenter the noise of daily life.


See if you can go for a walk in a quiet natural spot away from busy roads.
If you can't make it to a quiet outdoor space, try sitting in a library for a few hours. The librarians will make sure it stays nice and quiet.
Churches and cemeteries are also good places to find some peace and quiet.

, With more and more rural areas being developed, noisy engines and construction sounds aren't going away any time soon. Learning how to meditate can help you deal with noise and destress without needing to drop everything and leave.


When you're feeling overwhelmed, sit very still, close your eyes and focus on taking deep, even breaths. Do 10 breaths and try to let your worries go and ignore the noise around you. No matter where you are, whether it's on a noisy subway car or in your own kitchen, you can try this technique to calm yourself down., These inventions help millions of people deal with everyday noise. Earplugs are a cheap drugstore purchase that buys you hours of sleep, once you get used to falling asleep with them in your ears. Noise-canceling headphones are a bit more expensive, but if getting peace and quiet is at the top of your priority list, they're probably worth the splurge.

, This is by far the most expensive method, but if nothing else is working for you, and you are serious about the peace and quiet, this is a most effective way to stop noise from getting in your home."

Determine if you have been exposed to indoor air pollution.",How to Spot Signs of Indoor Pollution," Pet dander is a common source of indoor pollution. Even people who don’t have pets can have pet dander in their homes or offices. People can leave behind pet dander, including hairs.Pet dander includes particles from pet hair and fur, skin, and even feathers.;
, Indoor pollution can be caused by any pests inside your home or building, like insects. Cockroaches are one common cause of indoor pollution, as are dust mites. Rats or other vermin can also cause indoor pollution as well as transmit infectious diseases.Dust mites are microscopic pests that can cause allergic reactions. Dust mites can be found in furniture upholstery, carpeting, bedding, and even fabric wallpaper, open shelving, and venetian blinds. You can wash bedding in hot water of at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4 degrees Celsius) to kill dust mites., Pollen can get on every surface during the spring. You can end up with a thin yellow coating in your home, office, or even car. Pollen can cause allergic reactions and respiratory problems for people with asthma.Pollen may come in through open doors or windows. You may also track it in on your shoes or clothes.

, Mold can cause a lot of problems for people who inhale it every day. Mold can trigger asthma attacks as well as allergic reactions. Rooms with a lot of moisture, such as basements and bathrooms, often have mold problems.Leaky plumbing can be a source of mold, as can a dish drainer or other kinds of drip pans., Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can cause sudden illness and even death. Install carbon monoxide detectors throughout your home or workplace to alert you of dangerous carbon monoxide buildup., Inhaling ozone can create respiratory issues and damage the lungs. Most indoor ozone comes from outdoors or is created by the exposure of air pollution to sunlight or ultraviolet light. Use a B1-C ozone detection card to test your home or office.Avoid buying ion generators that claim to reduce indoor air pollutants, as these products actually create harmful ozone.

, Radon is a colorless, odorless gas that naturally occurs in soil and rocks. It can get into air and water and causes lung cancer. Place a radon measurement device in the lowest level of your home or building., Pesticides include toxic chemicals used to eliminate pests, insects, rodents, fungi, and microbes. Exposure to pesticides can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat as well as more severe issues with the kidneys and the central nervous system.Bathrooms and kitchen areas are most likely to house pesticides., Anything that causes smoke or smoke by-products can cause air pollution. Common sources of smoke pollution include stoves, furnaces, or space heaters. Smoke pollution can also occur due to products from combustible sources, like oil, gas, kerosene, coal, or wood.Tobacco smoke is a common and dangerous indoor pollutant. Even second-hand smoke can cause cancer., Some household cleaning products contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which cause indoor air pollution. The fumes can be toxic and cause side effects immediately, or they can build up over time.Make sure to ventilate whatever room you use cleaning products in. Keep all windows and doors open, or use a fan when cleaning. Refrain from cleaning in poorly ventilated rooms.
Mixing chemicals can produce toxic fumes, so refrain from mixing the chemicals.

, Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral fiber that was used in insulation and other building products until the 1970s. Asbestos is very damaging to the lungs. Contact a trained professional to check your home or building for asbestos., Lead can be found in paint, soil, food, and water. Exposure, inhalation, or ingestion leads to lead poisoning of the blood. A certified inspector can test your home, building, or grounds for lead., Arsenic is a toxic heavy metal that was used in pesticides, applied to orchards, and used in the wood industry prior to 1988. It accumulates in the soil and can leach into wells, and causes several forms of cancer. Contact a professional to test your wood, soil, and water for dangerous arsenic levels.Older decks and playsets can contain wood treated with arsenic.

, Finding sources of indoor air pollution can be a difficult task. You should walk through your home or the building to check for any signs of pollution. You should look for any signs and use your nose to smell around for odd odors. You are searching for:Dust and pollen
Construction materials, including insulation
Appliances that release moisture, smoke, or gases into the air
Moisture on surfaces or water stains
Musty odors
Evidence of pests (such as rat droppings)

, You should contact a professional to test for lead, arsenic, and asbestos. They will be able to safely remove or seal these materials, should they be found. Don’t attempt to clean or remove them yourself, as this could lead to dangerous exposure., Pollutants can remain inside buildings if the building is not ventilated. You can use natural ventilation to help circulate outdoor air in and indoor air out. There are also air cleaning ventilation devices can help remove pollution in a building.You can provide ventilation to your business or home by opening windows and doors so that air can circulate through. You can also use window fans, or fans in the attic.
Use exhaust fans in bathrooms or kitchens to remove any gases or other pollution from the rooms.
In larger buildings, you can install mechanical ventilation systems.

, Air cleaning devices can help remove pollutants in your home or building. This can help reduce the indoor air pollution you breathe. Air cleaners can be placed throughout the rooms in your home or office to help remove air pollution.You can buy multiple kinds of air cleaners, like HEPA filter mechanical air cleaners.
You should also frequently change the air filter in your home or building’s air conditioning or heating system.

, Once you figure out what the sources of the indoor pollution are, you should eliminate those sources. You can either remove the sources, block them off, or update the sources.Gas stoves and other out-of-date appliances can be updated or adjusted to reduce the amount of pollution.

, To help reduce air pollution due to cleaners, try using non-chemical cleaners. You can purchase natural cleaning products or even make your own.Try using baking soda or vinegar, which are good natural cleaners.
You should also consider fragrance-free products, including detergents and other cosmetics.Avoid using aerosol spray, including those for cosmetics and cleaning products.

, You can buy vacuum cleaners that are specifically made to clean dust and other pollutants from the carpet. For places you can’t vacuum, use a mop to grab all the dust from the floor, ceiling, walls, or fans.You can use vacuum cleaners that have HEPA filters.
Remember to vacuum furniture, walls, and the edges of the carpet. If you don’t want to vacuum curtains or rugs, wash them regularly.
Vacuum and mop often to remove dust and pollen particles.

, Moisture can cause mold and even dust mites in your home. You should try to reduce the amount of humidity in your home. Aim to keep your humidity levels around 30-50%.Use a dehumidifier to help eliminate moisture in the air.
Exhaust fans in the bathroom help reduce humidity.

, If you find surfaces in your home or building that have signs of air pollution, like mold, pollen, dust, or pest remnants, clean these surfaces with a mild, non-chemical cleanser and hot water.If the mold in your home or building is too bad, you may have to get a professional to remove it.
Wash bedding often to remove dust mites, dust, or other contaminants.
If you have pests, like cockroaches or rats, call an exterminator who uses an integrated pest management (IPM) system which decreases the use of toxic chemicals to remove pests., The symptoms associated with indoor air pollution are often confused with a cold or allergies. One way to determine if they are connected to air pollution is if they symptoms abate when you leave a room or building. Symptoms include:Coughing
Sneezing
Watery eyes
Headaches
Dizziness
Fatigue

, Indoor air pollution can cause a lot of upper respiratory problems. This may be due to asthma, allergies, pre-existing lung problems, or just irritation of the respiratory tract. Watch for:Nasal congestion
Nose bleeds
Difficult or painful breathing
Sore throat and cough
Wheezing

, Exposure to many indoor pollutants, particularly from chemical or toxic materials, can create long-term effects. Watch for:Asthma
Headache
Nausea
Loss of coordination
Chest pain
Nerve or brain damage
Kidney or liver damage
Cardiovascular disease
Mesothelioma
Emphysema
Cancer

, If you believe you or your family have been exposed to indoor air pollution, you should go see a doctor. Before you go see the doctor, you should gather some information about your exposure to indoor pollution to share with your doctor.Have you or your family members been experiencing symptoms? Do these symptoms include respiratory problems?
Have you recently moved to a new home? Have you recently started a new job?
Do the symptoms disappear when you leave certain buildings or rooms?
Have you recently done any remodeling to your home?
Has your home been tested for asbestos, radon, arsenic, lead, ozone, and carbon monoxide?
Is your home more humid than normal?
Are there signs of mold or mildew in your home?
Do you own any pets?
Do you have evidence of pests inside your home?
Does anyone in your home smoke?

Go to the media.",How to Take Action Against Corporate Pollution," The EPA is the main federal agency tasked with enforcing federal environmental laws. Examples of laws the EPA enforces include the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. If you see or hear of a corporation polluting water resources or air resources, among other things, contact the EPA as soon as possible. To identify pollution, look for drilling, dumping, discharges, leaks, and gas being dispersed into the air. Take pictures of anything you see and document things in as much detail as possible.


After you document the pollution, fill out an EPA complaint form. You can find and submit the complaint online on the EPA's website. Within the complaint form you should identify yourself as well as the alleged polluter. Include the polluter's business, identity, and contact information if you have it available. You will also need to characterize the pollution and describe it in as much detail as possible.After you file your complaint, you may be contacted for more information if the EPA finds your allegations credible. The EPA will conduct an investigation that might lead to administrative actions, civil judicial actions, or even criminal actions.While filing a complaint with the EPA is an easy process, it is not always effective. The EPA does not have the budget to investigate and enforce every single instance of pollution, which is why you might need to take your complaint elsewhere to make sure it is heard.;
, If the federal government chooses not to listen, or if you think you will have better success alleging a corporation polluted in violation of state law, then you should contact the state agency in charge of enforcing environmental laws. Each state's agency should have a complaint process very similar to that of the federal government.


For example, in Illinois, you can visit the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency website and submit a complaint online. The online form will ask you to fill out your personal information, as well as any information about the corporation you believe is polluting. You will then describe the pollution you see, which might include industrial emissions, open dumping, discharges into waterways, or odors coming from farms. To complete the complaint form, you will write a detailed description of what you saw, when you saw it, and if any person or property was damaged., If you want to take matters into your own hands, you can write a cease and desist letter directly to the polluter. A cease and desist letter is a cautionary letter sent to the polluter describing the pollution and requesting that the corporation stop. The letter also provides notice that legal action will be taken if the pollution does not stop.If you are going to write a cease and desist letter, consider hiring a lawyer to make your letter more official. While you may be able to write one on your own, most corporations will throw it away unless it has some legal force behind it.


If you are writing a cease and desist letter, include the corporations name and contact information at the top. Also, include the attorney's information if you are working with one. In the opening paragraph, explain the evidence you have against the corporation and respectfully request that they stop the polluting activities. In the next paragraph, state that you will bring legal action under a specific law and in a specific court if the pollution doesn't stop.

, If the corporation responds to your cease and desist letter, listen to their response and attempt to settle the dispute before it ever gets to court. Often, a corporation will want to avoid the cost of litigation and will work with you to alleviate your concerns. If an agreement can be reached, be sure you have the corporation sign and commit to a ""consent decree."" A consent decree is a document that lays out what the corporation must do to fix the pollution problem and when they must do it. The consent decree also states that if the corporation does not follow the requirements they can be sued.


Common requirements within a consent decree include updating treatment facilities, fixing broken infrastructure (e.g., cracked concrete allowing seepage, broken curbs allowing wastewater to flow by), and creating or redrafting a corporate environmental handbook for employees.Be aware that if you enter into a consent decree without getting a court involved, you may be ultimately responsible for ensuring the corporation follows it. This is another situation in which it will be helpful to have a lawyer.

, If you feel like you need to file a lawsuit in order to have the corporation stopped, you will need to find a law to sue under. If you are simply a concerned citizen who has seen the pollution first-hand and felt its effects, you will need to find a law that prohibits corporate pollution while allowing for citizen suits. A citizen suit provision is a piece of a statute empowering citizens to bring lawsuits against polluters when agencies procrastinate or do not take action.A number of federal environmental laws include citizen suit provisions. For example, you can find citizen suit provisions in the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act., Federal jurisdiction over citizen suits is set by statute. Most federal environmental statutes explicitly state that cases need to be brought in federal court for certain causes of action (e.g., for violations of emissions standards or orders). These statutory bases for federal jurisdiction will help you get into federal court without having to prove citizenship or have a certain amount in controversy., Most federal laws allowing for citizen suits require that you give the EPA Administrator, the state, and the violator at least 60 days notice telling them you plan to bring legal action.These provisions are meant to give the polluter an opportunity to come into compliance with the law (i.e., stop polluting and clean up their mess), and to give the EPA notice in case they want to be involved in the action.


Check with your lawyer or federal law for more information about providing adequate notice. In general, you should provide each required party with a written letter stating your intent to bring legal action and that the letter is meant to serve as the required 60 day notice.

, When you file a lawsuit, you have to file it in the proper venue. In federal environmental statutes, the proper venue is almost always the judicial district where the polluting source is.For example, if you found a corporate polluter dumping water into the ocean in Los Angeles, California, you would have to bring your lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California., Courts require plaintiffs to have standing in order to bring a lawsuit. This requirement ensures that courts are only hearing actual controversies between two parties where the plaintiff has actually been injured. Therefore, before you will be able to bring a federal lawsuit to stop the corporate polluter, you will have to show that (1) there has been an injury, (2) the defendant's pollution caused the injury, and (3) there is redressability, which means the court could remedy the violation.

, If you pass all the tests and you are able to sue in federal court claiming that a corporation has polluted, you will start the litigation process by drafting a complaint. A complaint is a legal document that tells the court and defendant why you are suing and what you are seeking. The complaint will be the basis for your lawsuit and must include:A caption, which includes information about the parties and the court you are filing in.
An explanation of jurisdiction and venue. For your case, you will explain that you are filing a citizen suit provision and that the statute dictates where the case must be filed.
A description of your lawsuit, which will include a brief statement of facts along with a citation to the law you are suing under.
A request for relief where you will ask the court to make a certain determination and award a certain amount of money.

, A summons form notifies the defendant that they are being sued and requests that they respond. In federal court, the summons form can usually be found on the court's website or by visiting the court in-person. Once you find the form, all you will have to do is fill in the defendant's name and the number of days they have to respond. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, available online, will tell you how long the defendant has to respond.Each law may have different time requirements, but generally the defendant will have to respond within about 30 days.

, When you complete your complaint and summons, take the originals, plus at least two copies, to the federal courthouse and file them with the clerk of courts. The clerk will check your documents and make sure everything is in order. Once approved, you will be required to pay a filing fee of $400. If you cannot afford the filing fee, you can file a motion to have the fee waived.


If you pay the filing fee, you will immediately have your documents stamped ""filed"" and you will receive an official summons form from the court.
If you filed a motion to have the fee waived, you will need to wait for the judge to rule on your motion before you can move forward. Once the judge approves of the fee waiver, your documents will be stamped ""filed"" and you will receive an official summons., You must notify the defendant that a suit has been filed naming them as the defendant. To do this, you must serve them with a copy of your complaint and summons. Find an individual over the age of 18 who is unrelated to the case to give the documents to the corporation in-person or through the mail. Service must be completed within 120 days of filing the lawsuit.


Because you are serving a corporation (i.e., not a person), you will need to serve the lawsuit on the corporation's ""registered agent."" A registered agent is someone who is authorized to accept service on behalf of the corporation. To find the corporation's registered agent, contact your state's secretary of state., Once the defendant corporation receives your complaint, they will most likely respond by filing an answer and serving it on you. An answer is a legal document responding to each of the allegations made in your complaint. In addition, the defendant's answer might include counter-complaints, which are like mini-lawsuits filed against you if the defendant things they have a cause of action.


Read the defendant's answer carefully as it will give you clues about how the defendant plans to fight the case. Talk with your lawyer about how to proceed after getting the defendant's answer.

, During discovery, each party will exchange information about the case in order to prepare for trial. You will be able to talk with witnesses, gather documents, take pictures, and see what the other side is going to say at trial. To achieve these discovery goals you can use the following tools:Depositions, which are formal interviews with witnesses and parties conducted under oath.
Interrogatories, which are written questions that a witness or party must answer under oath.
Requests for documents, which are written requests to the defendant asking them to hand over documents not otherwise available.
Requests for admission, which are written statements the defendant must admit or deny.

, As soon as discovery concludes, the defendant corporation will likely file a motion for summary judgment. If successful, the court will end the litigation immediately and rule in the defendant's favor. In order to win, the defendant will have to show there is no genuine issue of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the defendant has to persuade the court that even if every assumption was made in your favor, you would still lose at trial.


You can defend against this motion by submitting affidavits and evidence to the court showing that there are disputed facts that need to be settled at trial. If you are successful, the litigation will continue., Before trial starts, you might want to consider trying to settle the case. Trials can be time consuming and expensive. Start by sitting down with the defendant and discussing the case and what you would consider an agreeable outcome. Listen to the defendant and see if an agreement can be made. If informal negotiation methods don't work, try the following:


Mediation, which involves bringing in a neutral third party to try and find common ground in order to reach an agreement. The third party will not take sides and will not make opinions about the case.
Arbitration, which involves bringing in a judge-like third party to review the case and draft an opinion. The arbitrator will listen to each party's story and will then draft an opinion and take sides.

, If a settlement cannot be reached, you and the defendant corporation will attend one final pretrial hearing in order to set the trial schedule. You and the defendant will sit down with the judge and discuss every issue that needs to be resolved. The judge will then make a road-map of the trial including timelines.Be sure you mention every issue in dispute during this meeting. If you neglect to raise an issue here, you may not be able to raise it at trial.

, If you invoked your right to a jury trial in your complaint, you will choose the jury before the trial starts in a process called ""voire dire."" During voire dire you will have the opportunity to question potential jurors about the issues in the case in order to find out if they are biased. If you think a potential juror is biased, you can ask the court to have them removed. Once a jury is chosen, they will be paneled and the trial will begin.


If you waived your right to a jury trial, all the factual determinations will be made by the court., The trial will begin with you making an opening statement. An opening statement is an opportunity for you to tell the court your story as well as give an outline of the trial. You should tell the court in very plain terms why you are going to win. Do not make the opening statement very long and never introduce evidence or other important pieces of the puzzle here.


When your opening statement is complete, the defendant will have an opportunity to do the same. However, some defendants may choose to hold their opening remarks until after you have presented your case.

, When you present your case you will call witnesses to the stand and introduce testimony, as well as physical evidence, through them. You will ask them questions about the alleged corporate pollution until you get the answers you want. Once you are done asking each witness questions, the defendant will have an opportunity to cross-examine them., When you have rested and presented your entire case, the defendant will have an opportunity to present their case. After each witness they question, you will have an opportunity to cross-examine them. When you cross-examine a witness you are trying to poke holes in their testimony. For example, if the defendant claims they never discharged any sewage into a a river, but you have a picture that said they did, you would present that., When the defendant is done presenting their case, you will close the trial out by making a closing argument. A closing argument is your opportunity to bring everything full-circle and emphasize all of the great evidence you presented. Be clear that your evidence proves the defendant polluted and that the case should be decided in your favor.


The defendant will have an opportunity to make a closing argument when you are done. Once the defendant makes their closing argument, the trial is complete.

, When the trial is complete the fact-finder (i.e., judge or jury) will take a moment to review the case and analyze the evidence. When the fact-finder comes to a conclusion, they will present the verdict in court. If you win, the defendant will probably be required to pay damages and fix the pollution problem. If you lose, the defendant will not have to do anything., When you take on a polluting corporation in both legal and non-legal battles, you should hire a lawyer to help whenever possible. A lawyer will be able to forcefully draft a cease and desist letter, negotiate a settlement, and navigate the legal process. To hire a lawyer, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. When you contact them, they will ask you a series of questions about your case and you will be put in contact with qualified lawyers in your area.


Be sure you look for a lawyer who specializes in federal environmental litigation, especially citizen suit provisions.

, There are a number of nonprofit organizations out there with missions to protect the environment from pollution. Most of these nonprofits even have legal teams that sue corporations who pollute. For example, water-keeper organizations throughout the world bring citizen suit provisions to protect waterways from pollution. These types of organizations are constantly looking for ""standing witnesses"", which are individuals who testify in court to ensure the nonprofit has standing to sue.


Do a quick online search for organizations tasked with protecting the environment from pollution. Contact the ones you find and ask about their programs. Specifically, ask if they have a litigation team that files citizen suit provisions.

, Corporations rely on their identity and reputation to make sure business is good and profits are high. because of this, many corporations are afraid of bad press. Therefore, if you find out that a corporation is polluting, go talk to the media. Conduct interviews, provide news outlets with evidence, and bring the issue to the public. When you do this, corporations will likely be quick to settle a claim and fix the problem in order to avoid further bad press.


However, be sure you are not lying when you speak with the press. If you are found to be stretching the truth, a corporation might sue you for defamation.

Understand what causes noise pollution.,
Check into the noise pollution laws in your area.,
Make sure community spaces are following the rules.,
Speak up about banning noisy motors near your home.,
Get involved in a community tree-planting project.Communities with more trees are quieter than those without them, since large, leafy trees can help absorb noise.",How to Prevent Noise Pollution2," As urban development stretches into rural areas, the noise level increases. Construction sites, airports, train stations, and highways are all sources of loud noises that grate on the ears. If you know the sources of noise pollution in your area, you can do your best to avoid them or find ways to mitigate their negative effect.


When you're choosing a place to live, see if the residence is in a flight path or near a busy highway. During the day the sounds might not bother you, but at night they might prevent you from sleeping.

, Most urban communities have rules to prevent noise pollution from getting out of control. For example, there are laws dictating during which hours a construction site may actively use machinery, and when they need to stay quiet. As a community member, you can help enforce the laws if you know what they are.


Check with your state's department of energy and environmental affairs to find out which regulations are in effect in your area.You'll find information about how loud noise is allowed to get, and when machines are supposed to remain silent.
If you feel the regulations are being violated, don't hesitate to file a complaint. If it's affecting other members of your community, organize a group complaint, which will be even more effective.

, Another source of noise comes from community spaces like stadiums, concert venues and other outdoor areas with speaker systems. Even a neighborhood bar that holds concerts can produce enough noise to drive you crazy. If you live near a community space that seems to be making noise all night long, or is producing noise that seems louder than necessary, see if they're in violation of local laws and file a complaint if necessary.For example, if a new concert space opens up on your block and creates noise late into the night, you're entitled to finding out whether the place is operating according to local law. The people in charge of the space might not be aware of the laws, so don't just assume they know what they're doing. Find out more and see if you can make a difference.

, Car and motorcycle engines as well as lawnmowers and other motor-powered vehicles can really raise the noise level in any given area. If you live in the middle of the city, there won't be much you can do about it, but in a smaller community you may be able to have a say as to who gets to use motors in your area, and when.


Talk with your city council member to see what you can do to have noisy motors banned after a certain time at night.In smaller communities, you could also just get together with your neighbors and agree not to use lawnmowers and other noisy motors during certain hours, for the benefit of the whole neighborhood.

, If you live in an area with a dearth of big trees, planting more along city streets, and between residences and noisy highways, would be a good way to cut back on some of the noise pollution in your area.


See if your city has a tree-planting initiative underway. For example, Portland, Oregon's group Portland Loves Trees engages community members to plant more trees around the city. New York City's Million Trees Project has a similar goal.

Don't use your car horn unnecessarily.,
Keep your car in good repair.,
Keep your music down.,
Respect quiet hours at night.",How to Prevent Noise Pollution3," Don't be part of the problem by leaning on your horn every time someone looks at you wrong on the street. Use your horn only when absolutely necessary, as a way to let someone know that you're present or warn them when they're about to collide with something. It's good driving etiquette, and makes life more pleasant for city-dwellers.

, The sound of a car without a muffler chugging down the street is never welcome, so make sure you're not the one causing noise pollution in your neighborhood and spring to get your car fixed. Keeping your car in good, quiet working order will be appreciated by everyone who lives near you.


The same goes for your lawnmower and any other noisy equipment you might use outdoors.
To have an even greater impact on noise in your area, consider walking or biking instead of using a car whenever possible.

, It might sound beautiful to you, but respect the fact that others might not feel the same way. Your music shouldn't be noticeable outside your own home. If you know that the neighbors don't mind, feel free to keep your windows open and let them enjoy your musical taste, but don't just assume that everyone wants to hear your favorite opera as much as you do.


If you play a noisy instrument or are in a band, make sure to practice during reasonable hours.
If you're having a party and planning to play loud music, let your neighbors know beforehand so you can avoid conflict.

, Whether the rule is unspoken or prominently published, make sure you don't make noise after hours. Don't put your neighbors in the position of having to ask you to be quiet, since it's awkward and makes for unfriendly relations. Do your best to be a good neighbor so you can expect the same from those around you.


This is especially important if you live in an apartment building. Don't vacuum or do housework late at night, since they'll be able to hear you walking around.

In other parts of the world, it's 5 people to a car everyday. In America, guess how many? 1. One person gets their own car. If every person is driving to the same place, you can only imagine how much we are polluting.;
, Those are those decomposable bags that you probably see for sale in Walmart or Walgreens. They can be used over and over and reduce plastic and paper intake used for making those bags at grocery stores. With these bags being decomposable, they are easily recyclable. Feel free to throw them in the recycling bin only AFTER they can no longer hold groceries because there's a hole in the bottom!

, Getting a product's full use out of it will help reduce the need for more. If you continue to use plastic bags at a grocery store, use them as garbage bags! In the bathroom or kitchen sink, they are free with your grocery purchase.

Choose an air purifier.,
Install your air purifier.,
Maintain adequate ventilation.,
Save energy.",How to Avoid Pollution in Urban Areas1," Air purifiers are devices that remove pollutants from the air. They typically use a replaceable filter to catch contaminants in the air and trap them. There are four basic types of air purifier commonly available for purchase:



Charcoal filter air purifiers use a thick layer of carbon to force-filter pollutants from the air. Charcoal carbon filters are commonly used to purify water for public water systems as well, because they're cheap, long-lasting, and reasonably effective.

Electrostatic filter purifiers use static electricity to pull particles from the air in much the same way that a plastic pocket comb carrying a static charge attracts flakes of black pepper. Because these filters use an electric field to charge and attract pollutants, there's no need to pull the air through a thick filter, which makes them quieter and economical.

HEPA filter purifiers are a very popular type of filter with a reputation for being the most effective of all home filtration methods. HEPA stands for “high efficiency particulate air.” HEPA filters can only be certified as such if they're proven to filter out 99.7% or more of all airborne particulates larger than 0.3 micrometers across.

Ionization filter purifiers use a high-powered electric charge to ionize pollutants and compel them to stick to a surface rather than continue to float in the air. Ionization filters are at least somewhat effective, but their effectiveness compared to other types of filter has been called into question by reputable entities (such as Consumer Reports), and as such this guide doesn't recommend using one.;
, Expect to pay between $60 and $300 U.S. for a home purifier. Filters on these devices will need to be replaced occasionally, but the devices themselves should last for many years.


Be sure to read the instructions for your purifier and replace the filter according to the suggested timetable. A purifier with a used up filter won't be effective.

, Much of the pollution in your home is likely the result of less-than-optimal ventilation practices on your part. Some pollution from outside will get in no matter what you do (that's what the purifier is for). It's up to you to keep things from getting worse by properly ventilating your home.


Have filters installed. If your home has heating or air conditioning that depends on forcing air through an internal ventilation system, call your HVAC technician and speak to him or her about installing or updating air filters in that system. Updating old filters carries a fairly modest price tag, all things considered. If more work would have to be done to allow filters to be installed in the first place, consult with your technician and get a price estimate for the work.
Open windows. It might seem counterintuitive, but one of the best ways to minimize pollution at home is to allow air – even polluted air – to flow through the home, especially if you don't have a filtered internal ventilation system. Open windows whenever the weather permits and allow your house to “air out,” reducing dust and pet dander.
Clean your fireplace. If you have a fireplace or wood-burning stove, it requires regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance. A poorly maintained chimney or flue can drive harmful smoke back into your home. Cleaning a fireplace isn't too hard, but cleaning the chimney can be a pain. If you have the money, call a cleaning service and schedule a yearly appointment for them to take care of it for you.

, A lot of the pollution in any city is generated by the mass consumption of electric power. By doing your part to use less energy, you can help curb the problem for everyone in your city.


Plant trees near the windows of your house. If you plant deciduous trees, they'll provide thick, cooling shade in the summer, but let in plenty of light during the winter, both of which keep you from having to use as much electricity on air conditioning and lighting.
Be mindful of your appliance usage. Turn lights, electronics, and other things that consume electricity off as soon as you're done using them. For purifiers and other things that you might prefer to leave on at all times, try plugging them into a cheap outlet timer instead. Set the timer for 10 or 15-minute cycles. Your device will turn on for every other cycle, maintaining most of its effectiveness while cutting power usage in half.

, Consider your background and education, and the sort of things you enjoy doing. Choose a program that matches your particular skills and abilities.


Earthwatch organizes scientific expeditions to help scientists collect measurements and other vital data.United Planet has programs in Peru involving healthcare and childcare.
Organizations such as EarthWatch and GVI (Global Vision International) offer opportunities to connect with nature.
Many programs offer experience teaching English as a second language. Some programs require a college degree or teaching experience; others will allow any native speaker to teach.
In the aftermath of a natural disaster, volunteer organizations like the Red Cross and Relief International send workers to help rebuild communities.
Because of the nature of these assignments, the work can be extremely stressful and emotionally taxing.
WIDECAST has programs in Latin America involving environmental conservation, farming, and monitoring endangered sea turtles.

, Most short-term overseas volunteer programs charge a fee to cover administrative costs, food, lodging, and ground transportation. The costs of different programs can vary greatly. For example:The WIDECAST Latin America Program charges $315 for one week, or $430 for two weeks. This covers your in-country costs and training.
Global Volunteer Network has programs starting at $797 for two weeks, plus a $350 application fee. This covers Spanish lessons, internet access, airport pick-up, food, and lodging.
The Costa Rica projects at i-to-i will cost you $1,299 for two weeks. This covers food, lodging, airport shuttle, orientation, and training.

, Nearly all programs require you to pay for your own airfare. How much this costs depends on where you live, and where you are going. For example, airfare from the US to Australia will run about $1,500; airfare from the US to Costa Rica will cost $500-700., If you are applying to a program that allows you to bring your children, you'll need to arrange the trip to fit in with your kids' summer or winter breaks. A number of programs will allow you to bring your children for an additional fee.International Volunteer HQ allows children under 18 to volunteer when accompanied by their legal guardian. Children under 15 are allowed to join programs with in-home (non-communal) accommodations.

, If you are having trouble finding the right overseas volunteer program, sign up with a recruitment or placement agency. You tell them what kind of work you want to do, and where you want to go, and they will find a good fit for you.These agencies almost always charge a fee.
Because they are not directly affiliated with the organizations they work with, they may not know much about the work you'll be doing.

, Do you agree with their philosophies and overall objectives? How effective are their volunteer projects in making real changes?Ask to talk to other volunteers. Do they feel the project is making a difference? Does the organization treat its workers well?

Ride mass transit.,
Consider walking.,
Time your driving.,
Consolidate your trips.,
Wear an N95 mask.,
A non-disposable N95 respirator in addition to disposable N95 masks is another alternative.",How to Avoid Pollution in Urban Areas2," Mass transit systems not only help to reduce smog by cutting emissions per citizen, they can also provide a less smoggy ride for you than taking a car. Transit systems like subways, trams, and light rails are often separated from street traffic by being elevated or buried, which means you'll be breathing less car exhaust when you ride them.

, If you don't want to ride the train, walk or bike around the city. You'll be making a big positive impact by eliminating your transportation emissions, and staying in better shape while you do it.


If your city is especially polluted, don't walk or bike if you can help it. This seems counterintuitive, but it can be dangerous in a city with a serious smog problem. You'll breathe more heavily due to physical exertion, and take in more polluted air as a result.
If you must walk or bike in such a city, do your best to take side streets with less traffic, to avoid catching exhaust fumes from passing vehicles.

, If you need to use a car, don't drive during rush hour any more than you have to. You'll be surrounded by exhaust fumes for the entire trip otherwise.


If you can afford it, consider getting a hybrid electric vehicle to help reduce auto emissions in your city.

, The less often you leave the purified and well-ventilated air of your home, the less you'll have to breathe in the smog of the city at large.


Plan ahead for necessities. Plan weekly trips for things like grocery shopping and dropping off bill payments, instead of taking multiple shorter trips throughout the week. You'll save on transportation costs, too.
Head out. Plan weekend trips outside of the city rather than within it. The farther you get from the urban core, the less pollution there generally is. Develop a taste for day hikes or birdwatching so you have a good reason to get out of town for a day. If you're just not the outdoorsy type, look up tourist-y small towns past the suburban ring of your metro area and plan visits to go boutique shopping and sample the local flavor instead.

, If the smog in your city is just too much to handle, consider wearing a properly fitting N95 particulate filter. In extreme situations, a personal filter can make a world of difference.


For disposal masks, surgical masks are of minimal use to the wearer. They are designed to protect others in the environment from a wearer, not the wearer from the environment. A surgical mask's primary function is to stop liquids and dust particles from entering the user's respiratory tract. They're useful for preventing the spread of airborne disease (by blocking sneezes). Their material is not designed to filter down the correct micron particle-sized level and they do not seal around the face, leaving large air gaps through which the majority of inhaled air is drawn. Disposable N95 masks, ideally with exhale valves, however, protect the wearer appropriately and should be worn in lieu of surgical masks which have minimal benefit. Surgical masks do not filter at the level necessary to block small particulate matter of 2.5 microns, considered by the W.H.O as the primary element of urban pollution to guard against.

, If your situation is dire (for example, if you suspect you might be developing a chronic lung condition from your exposure to smog), and you can't afford to get out of the city, invest in a respirator instead. These devices are relatively bulky, but provide a choice of canister filters for various gases and other pollutants.


A non-disposable respirator generally looks like a slimmed-down gas mask without eye shields. Prepare to get stared at if you wear one.
There are a few different types of respirator available. The cheapest, mechanical respirators, are rated according to their effectiveness, with the most effective being ranked P100 in the United States.
Other types of respirators include chemical cartridge respirators and powered purification respirators. These tend to be more expensive, but offer other advantages such as better airflow and long-term usability.

Read the product label.,
Read the material safety data sheet.,
Search the list of hazardous wastes.",How to Dispose of Industrial Chemicals1," Some chemical products come with disposal instructions right on the label and following those instructions should be enough. Even for products without disposal instructions, you should still read the labels so you can be aware of the warnings and cautions concerning said products.Items such as batteries and light bulbs have to be recycled at special recycling centers.
Never mix cleaning products together. If you only have a small amount of cleaning product left in each bottle, it may be tempting to mix them into one bottle for disposal. Different chemicals can react with each other to form very hazardous fumes and noxious gases.;
, In addition to the product label, you want to read the MSDS for industrial chemicals. The MSDS gives you important information about the chemical: its toxicity, reactivity, and disposal considerations.Use the online MSDS database to look up the MSDS for the specific formulation of the chemical you wish to dispose., The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has many resources on determining if your waste is considered hazardous and what kind of special disposal is necessary. The EPA regulates hazardous waste using the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976.Determine if your waste is hazardous by referring to this EPA flow chart.
If your waste is classified as hazardous by the EPA, you will need to contact the EPA for proper disposal.
You can contact the EPA online or by looking up your local EPA office and contacting them directly by phone."

Apply for a long-term volunteer assignment.,
Start planning well in advance.,
Work with the United Nations.,
Join the Peace Corps.,
Sell unnecessary possessions.,
Find out if you need a visa.,
Simplify your budget.",How to Volunteer Overseas2," Long-term programs are typically one to two years in duration, and admission can be very selective. These positions usually come with a small living allowance, and often require a college degree.This type of project is typically on-going, so you might not see the end results by the time you leave.
Most programs require a college degree, professional experience, or specific skills.
Plan a “test run.” If you've never volunteered overseas before, you may want to do a short trip first and apply to a longer program for the following year.

, Give yourself enough time to raise the money you might need and deal with logistics. You'll want at least 2-3 months to make plans and get everything together.

, The UN has more than 4,000 volunteers at any given time, working in a range of job types all over the world. Workers are posted in mostly rural areas and on the outskirts of major cities. UN volunteer work falls into four main categories:Working with small governments that are short-staffed in certain vital departments.
Helping communities become self-reliant by improving infrastructure.
Supporting human rights and peace-building initiatives.
Humanitarian projects to provide relief and hasten community rehabilitation.

, For over 50 years, the Peace Corps has sent volunteers all over the world, to work with local community leaders on different types of projects. Their field projects are designed to fight HIV/AIDS in developing nations, fighting hunger in impoverished communities, preserving the environment, and providing improved access to the internet and technology.94% of Peace Corps openings involve 2 years of service, plus 3 months of training beforehand.
Volunteer positions are open to any US citizen 18 years of age or older, who can leave the country within 9-12 months of being accepted.
The Peace Corps lists all their available openings online, where you can search by country, job type, or skill set.
2-year volunteers receive free housing, a small monthly living stipend, and over $8,000 at the end of the project to help them readjust.
Some government issued student loans are eligible for deferment or forgiveness upon completion of a 2-year program.
The Peace Corps also covers your medical and dental expenses during the volunteer period.

, If you will be leaving for a longer period of time, you might want to get rid of unnecessary belongings. Place an ad on craigslist, or have a yard sale.


It costs money to store your belongings. Sell or give away any large items if you can, so you can rent a smaller, less expensive storage unit.
This will also give you more money for your trip.

, Most short-term volunteer programs do not require a visa, but some longer assignments will. It depends on which country you will be visiting. If you are paying for a short-term volunteer trip, the program facilitators will handle your visa paperwork.For example, Australia requires a visa for short-term volunteers.
Costa Rica, Peru, the UK, and South Africa do no require a visa for short-term volunteers.

, Go through your monthly bills, and see if there are any services you can cancel. You'll want as few bills as possible when you are living abroad.

Understand the environment you'll be working in.,
Purchase supplies.,
Check your passport.,
Exchange your money.,
Handle your banking arrangements.,
Check travel alerts.,
See your doctor.,
Get your shots.,
Focus on the people you'll be helping.",How to Volunteer Overseas3," Before committing to an overseas project, find out exactly what your living arrangements will be, and decide whether this will work for you. Will you be staying in communal barracks, with hot running water and basic home comforts? Or will you be living in a tent, without the modern conveniences you are accustomed to?


It's okay if you don't think you'd do well living in extremely rough conditions. Just keep looking until you find the right program, where you can be useful and thrive.

, Once you have been admitted to a program and know what your living conditions will be, purchase any supplies you may need.


You'll need clothing appropriate to the work and the weather
You may want to bring camping or survival products
If you will be working outdoors, stock up on insect repellant

, Be sure the expiration date is good for the entire length of time you'll be out of the country plus 6 months. If you don't have a passport, you'll need to get one.Apply early if you need to get a passport or have your old one renewed. It will take at least 6 weeks to get your passport, unless you pay a hefty fee to expedite handling times.

, Once you know your destination, you'll need some local currency for the trip. Your local bank can usually arrange to exchange your US dollars for foreign money.American Express travelers cheques are a good way to carry money while traveling. If they're lost or stolen, you can have them replaced.

, If you're planning to volunteer abroad, it's a good idea to notify your bank and your credit card companies – otherwise, they may stop payment on your cards when they see international charges.You'll also want extra cards, if possible, in case you lose one.

, Once you know where you'll be going, check online for travel advisories so you'll have a better idea of the area. The government issues warnings describing risks you may face.Plan ahead – many vaccines need to be administered weeks or even months ahead of time.

, You'll probably need to have a physical exam before you volunteer overseas. Most programs require a doctor's note saying you are fit to travel and work.

, You'll need inoculations to prevent against common diseases that you may encounter on your travels. The type of shots you need depend on which area of the world you will be visiting.Some countries won't let you enter without evidence of specific vaccines, such as yellow fever.

, To encourage humility while volunteering, think about the people you will work with and ask yourself:


What knowledge and skills do the people from this community possess that I do not?
What life experiences do they have which are different from mine?
What are some of the obstacles they have had to overcome in their lives?
What challenges do they face daily that I do not?
What are some of their personal and professional strengths?
What can I learn from them?

Use proper safety precautions.,
Dilute bleach and hydrogen peroxide to pour down the drain.,
Store solvents for special collection.,
Recycle automotive fluids.,
Drain all aerosol canisters.,
Return pool chemicals back to your local pool store.,
Submit industrial chemicals to a hazardous material collection system.",How to Dispose of Industrial Chemicals2," When dealing with any chemicals, you should always wear gloves, long-sleeved shirts, pants, goggles, and closed-toe shoes.You want to minimize skin exposure as much as possible. Chemicals often emit noxious fumes, so you want to work in a well-ventilated area.


Never breathe deeply and inhale chemical fumes, particularly if you are unsure of what the chemical is.
Read all safety information for a chemical before working with it or disposing of it.
If you get a chemical on your skin or in your eye, immediately rinse the affected area with water for at least 15 minutes before seeking medical attention.

, Make a very dilute solution of bleach or hydrogen peroxide by adding at least 10 times the amount of water. Let the dilute solution sit for at least an hour before disposal., Solvents such as paint and varnish must be disposed of at a special recycling center or collected by a hazardous waste company. Many home improvement stores have paint recycling centers as well.


Latex paints can be disposed of at home. Stir in an equal part of cat litter to match the amount of paint. Stir until the paint thickens and allow the mixture to sit for one hour. You can throw the hardened paint away in the garbage., Car-related fluids such as antifreeze, motor oil, and transmission fluid can be collected and recycled. None of these items can be thrown away or disposed of down the drain. Collect the fluid and bring it to a nearby recycling center.


Use a recycling locator to help you find a location near you., Do this by turning them upside down and spraying them into an absorbent material, like paper towels, rags, or a sponge. Once the can has lost all of its pressure, wrap it in several layers of newspaper and throw it out with regular household trash.Alternatively, you can dispose of partially filled cans by taking them to a Household Hazardous Waste collection center.

, Most pool stores will take pool chemicals and dispose of them properly. Alternatively, you can check with the community pool and see if they have any need of your unused chemicals.If you must dispose of them in the garbage, make sure the chemicals are dry, stored in their original containers and double-bagged to prevent contamination.

, If you are unsure of the proper method of disposal for a potentially dangerous product, like a car battery, seek out a hazardous material collection service nearby and see if they will take your waste. Most communities should have such a service.Laboratories have specific waste disposal departments that take care of this. Once you have a full container, schedule a pick-up for disposal.
Store the used chemical in a proper container for disposal. A sealed plastic container is generally sufficient."

Know the acids and bases that cannot be neutralized.,
Identify the strength of the acid or base.,
Neutralize strong acids with sodium hydroxide.,
Neutralize strong bases with hydrochloric acid.,
Check the pH again.,
Dilute by adding acid or base to water.,
Pour it down the drain.",How to Dispose of Industrial Chemicals3," There are some acids and bases that cannot be neutralized and disposed of down the sewer drain. Disposal of the following should be done through the proper hazardous waste collection channels:perchloric acid
concentrated nitric acid
fuming (concentrated), sulfuric acid
hydrofluoric acid
acids or bases with dyes or surfactants
acids of bases with heavy metals
organic acids and bases that remain toxic after neutralization

, Strong acids (pH < 2.0) and strong bases (pH > 12.0) must be neutralized before dilution and disposal down the drain.The strength of the acid or base can be determined using a pH meter or pH strips. Strong acids and bases must be neutralized to a pH range between 6.0 and 9.0.A pH meter directly measures the pH of the solution.
pH paper has a color indicator that tells you the strength of the solution.

, Work in a fume hood (or well-ventilated area) because this process emits noxious fumes. Keep the solution constantly stirring and slowly add sodium hydroxide. This reaction will release heat so it is important that the sodium hydroxide is added slowly. Keep adding sodium hydroxide until the acid is neutralized.Placing the container in a second container of ice will help avoid overheating and potential injury.

, The process of neutralizing a strong base is the same as neutralizing a strong acid except you use hydrochloric acid instead of sodium hydroxide. Slowly add the hydrochloric acid to the strong base while constantly stirring the solution.This reaction also releases heat, so add slowly and keep the container in a bucket of ice to avoid superheating the container.

, After neutralization, the pH should be in the range between 6.0 and 9.0. Use the pH meter or pH paper strips to ensure the proper neutralization of the acid or base. If the pH is not in the correct range, continue adding the neutralizing acid or base to the solution until the correct pH is reached.Acid-base indicator solutions can also be used to test the pH of the solutions. As the pH of the entire solution changes, the color of the indicator will change. If you have access to an indicator, it can make your neutralization process easier., To dilute the solution, always add the acid or the base directly to the water. Adding water to the acid or base can superheat the water and lead to explosions.Diluting the acid or base is an exothermic reaction, meaning it will give off heat. Place the container in an ice bucket to avoid superheating the container.You can calculate the amount of water needed to dilute the solution based on the strength of the acid or base.

, Once the solution has been neutralized and diluted, it can be poured directly down the drain. Keep the water running while you pour the solution down the drain to further dilute.If the waste contains a heavy metal such as copper, lead, zinc, cadmium, or mercury, you cannot dispose of it down the sink. It must be disposed of as hazardous waste by an environmental health and safety office."

Find out how big your carbon footprint is.,
Look for ways to make it smaller.,
Know that changing your lifestyle is just the first step.",How to Reduce Your Greenhouse Gas Emissions1," A person's ""carbon footprint"" is the amount of carbon he or she is responsible for releasing into the atmosphere as a result of his or her daily habits. The more fossil fuels you're responsible for burning, the bigger your footprint. For example, someone who bikes to work might have a smaller footprint than someone who drives each day.


To find out how big your footprint is, use a free carbon footprint calculator.Your driving habits, spending habits, diet, and a number of other factors are taken into account to calculate how much carbon you're responsible for releasing into the atmosphere.;
, Since you're concerned about reducing your greenhouse gas emissions, you'll want to find ways to shrink your footprint until it's as small as possible. Reflect on the areas that could use some improvement and strive to make long-term changes. Even small lifestyle changes can make a big difference.


For example, eating meat every day can lead to a larger carbon footprint, since the process of getting meat from the pasture to your table requires a lot of energy and fuel.Participating in Meatless Mondays or going meat-free for awhile will reduce your footprint.

, Individuals like you who want to pitch in to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions can make a big impact, but in order for global warming to cease to be a threat, it's important to speak up to make sure corporations get on board with curbing emissions, too. Research shows that just 90 companies are responsible for two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions.Look for ways you can help beyond changing your personal habits.


For example, you could write a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) telling them to limit carbon pollution from existing power plants.Next time you vote in an election, choose the candidate who's most committed to limiting your town's emissions and stopping global warming.

"
"
Use your car less often.,
Take the bus, subway or train.,
Try walking and biking more often.,
Keep your car in good condition.",How to Reduce Your Greenhouse Gas Emissions2," Car-related emissions are a major cause of global warming. The manufacturing of cars and roads for them to drive on, the production of fuel, and of course the burning of that fuel all play a part.While stopping driving altogether might not be practical, finding ways to cut back on how much you use your car is one of the most straightforward actions you can take to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions.


Instead of driving to the grocery store every day, make one trip a week and stock up on everything you need.
Carpool with other people to school or work.
Every time you need to go somewhere, consider if there's a way to get there without using your car.

, These vehicles still produce emissions, but since they carry so many people, they're much more efficient than individual cars. Get familiar with your city's bus, subway or train routes and commit to using only public transportation at least once a week. Work up to using it as much as possible. You might even come to like it better!


If your community doesn't have reliable public transportation, consider going to city council meetings to speak up about the problem.
If other people in your town share your concerns, you may be able to make a difference together.

, It feels good to use your own energy to propel you where you want to go, and you can rest easy knowing that your transportation is completely emission-free. Any time you need to go somewhere within a few miles of your house, consider walking or biking instead of taking another mode of transportation. Sure, it'll take you longer to get there, but you'll have more time to think and enjoy the world on the way.


Try walking to places that are within a five-minute drive of your home.
Use your city's bike lanes. If it doesn't have any, you can write letters to the editor, attend city council meetings and coordinate with your city's bicycle/pedestrian coordinator to improve bike safety., If you neglect your car's upkeep, it will end up producing more greenhouse gas emissions. Have it smog-tested once a year, and if it fails, be sure to make repairs promptly to fix the problem. Here are other ways you can keep your car in tip-top shape so it has a lower impact on the environment:


Fill up your gas tank in the early morning or late evening, when it's cool outside. This way less gas will evaporate in the heat of the day.
Use energy-conserving motor oil.
Don't idle in drive-thrus; park and walk in instead.
Make sure your car's tires are inflated to the recommended pressure.

"
"
Turn off your lights and appliances.,
Unplug appliances when you aren't using them.,
Use energy-saving large appliances.,
Examine your heating and cooling habits.,
Limit your use of hot water.",How to Reduce Your Greenhouse Gas Emissions3," The electricity that powers these items is generated by emissions-producing energy plants. Using your lights, appliances and anything else powered by electricity as infrequently as possible will reduce your carbon footprint.


Rely on natural light during the day; open up your blinds and let the sun shine in. That way you won't have to turn your lights on.
Turn off your TV when you're not using it, rather than keeping it on in the background.
Shut down your computer when you're finished with it.

, Even when they're switched off, appliances sap energy as long as they stay plugged in. Go around the house and unplug the appliances in your kitchen, bedroom, living room, and so on. Even a phone charger left plugged in can use energy.

, Large appliances are responsible for a big portion of a household's energy use. If you're using outdated appliances, you might want to replace them with energy-saving models. You'll save money and reduce your carbon footprint. See if you can replace the following appliances with a more efficient version:


Refrigerator
Oven and stovetop
Microwave
Dishwasher
Washer
Dryer
Air conditioner

, Heat and air conditioning units are another big household energy sink, so look for ways to cut back on how much you use them. In addition to getting energy-efficient heating and air conditioning systems, try the following:


Adjust your thermostat to 68 °F (20 °C) in the winter, and 78 °F (26 °C) in the summer.Let your body naturally acclimate to the weather, so you can go longer without heat in the winter and without air conditioning in the summer. Wear warm sweaters and slippers indoors in the winter, and use hand fans in the summer.
When you go out of town, turn off the heat or air conditioning so you aren't wasting energy while you're away.

, It takes a lot of energy to heat water for showers and baths. Take shorter showers and take baths less frequently, since baths typically use more water than showers.


You can also limit your hot water use by turning your water heater to 120 °F (49 °C), so the water never gets unnecessarily hot.
Use the cool setting on your washing machine; it's better for your clothes, anyway.

Eat less meat.,
Make food from scratch.,
Become a homesteader.,
Buy goods that were locally made.,
Choose items with less packaging.,
Reuse, recycle, and compost.",How to Reduce Your Greenhouse Gas Emissions4," If you can't completely become a vegetarian, try to eliminate meat for a few days a week, or at least a few meals a day. The meat industry uses a lot of energy to raise the animals, process the meat, and keep it from spoiling, all before it even makes it to your kitchen. Growing vegetables requires less energy.


Buy the meat you do eat from a local farm.
Consider raising chickens so you have access to your own meat and eggs!

, Instead of buying pre-packaged meals, which require a lot of energy to manufacture, make as much from scratch as possible. For example, if you want to have tomato sauce for dinner, make it from fresh tomatoes and garlic instead of buying a jar. It's better for the environment and healthier for your body, too.


You could even grow your own tomatoes and garlic if you get really into the idea of making things from scratch.

, The practice of mass-producing, packaging and shipping goods to make them available in stores is responsible for major industrial emissions, and making your own stuff allows you to avoid all that. You don't have to go all the way back to Little House on the Prairie, but consider making some of your household goods instead of buying them. For example,


Make your own soap
Make your own shampoo
Make your own toothpaste
Make your own deodorant
And if you're really ambitious, Sew your own clothes


, If something was made close to your home, that means no emissions were produced to transport it to a store near you. Buying food that was locally grown and other items that were made nearby is a great way to reduce your carbon footprint. Here are some ways to do it:


Shop for food at farmer's markets
Cut back on online shopping, since the shipping always requires multiple vehicles
Support local businesses

, The plastic, cardboard, and paper used in packaging is manufactured in great big emissions-spewing factories, so try to buy items with as little packaging as possible.


For example, if you need to buy some rice, buy it in bulk instead of getting several smaller boxes.
Bring a reusable shopping bag to the grocery store instead of taking everything home in bags.
Buy loose, fresh produce instead of canned or frozen.

, These are all great ways to cut back on the trash your household produces and reduce your carbon footprint. Once you get into the habit of using these three strategies, you won't want to go back to throwing everything away.


Anything made of glass can be reused over and over again. Beware reusing plastic too many times, since it can degrade over time and contaminate your food.
Follow your jurisdiction's recycling policies to recycle your glass, paper, plastic and other items.

Compost your food scraps and yard waste by placing them in a designated bin or pile, and mixing it every few weeks to help it degrade faster.

You can make a huge environmental difference by doing this. However, some supermarkets may not allow you to do this because of security concerns.;
, The pesticides that are on non-organic foods require energy to produce, and they are bad for you! Organic food is really good for you, and it tastes even better than food laced with chemicals.

, If possible, do this. Dryers account for almost 5% of energy use in the USA!

, That way, you don't heat up an entire tank of water (using lots of energy) for some hot water for washing your face!

, They have fewer insulation problems, so you don't need to use the Air Conditioner / Heater as much!

, As said above, then you don't need to use the AC or heater as much.

, Heaters are major energy users! They have a huge negative impact on the world!

, Even if an electronic device isn't being used (it is off), it still uses a small amount of energy. See warnings section below.

, Push mowers don't use any gasoline, and they make you stronger!

,, That means that they use minimal amounts of energy!

, That way there isn't any heat escaping.

, Trees take Carbon Dioxide (which is one of the causes of global warming) and turn it into Oxygen (which we breathe!)

, Compacting garbage, and making new items to replace that garbage, uses energy.

, Cars are the #1 reason global warming is a serious issue.

, See above reason.

, Hybrids can get up to 99.9 MPG! That doesn't just help the world... it helps your wallet too.

, Packaging requires energy to produce.

, Shipping goods use energy!

, Pumping water around is one of the primary energy users!

, The more water you use, the more has to be treated - an energy-intense process.

, That way your AC doesn't use more energy than needed.

, Ensure there aren't any leaks!

, Keep air conditioning at 80° in the summer, and heating at 60° in the winter. Use your clothing, diet, and exercise habits to adjust your body temperature before turning to the energy-intensive HVAC system.

,, Dishwashers use the same amount of water if they are filled with 1 dish or filled to the brim. Save water!

, This keeps your energy usage down.Do it yourself.

, Cars aren't as fuel efficient when their tires aren't full.

, These use much less energy.... don't break them while putting them in though!

, See The C Crane website about these lighting devices.

, This makes your computer use less energy.

, These may be solar powered and/or have a hand cranked generator. Some of these flashlights do not use any internal power cells, but use a ""Supercapacitor"" instead. Not only great for the environment but great for emergency use as well. Some models will even charge cell phones, providing power even when other power sources have failed during a long term disaster, such as a hurricane, earthquake, providing the cell phone towers are not damaged, destroyed.

, If you just sort your trash into recyclables every week, the rate at which the landfills grow will lessen.

, Any water that comes out of the house runs the sewage plant and then a lot of energy is used to treat it, even though it's not dirty at all!

Question car culture.,
Take the bus, subway or train.,
Try walking or biking.,
If you do drive, keep your car in good condition.",How to Take Action to Reduce Air Pollution1," Industrial manufacturing practices are the primary reason the earth's air is polluted, but car-related pollution is the next biggest culprit. The manufacturing of cars and roads, the production of fuel, and the emissions that result from burning that fuel all play a part.Since many cities are laid out in such a way that driving is almost a necessity, it can be hard to determine the best way to combat this problem. No matter where you live, you can take action by finding creative ways to be less dependent on cars.


It may not be practical to give up your car entirely, but you can still take action by reducing your use of your car. For example, instead of driving to the grocery store every other day, make one trip every week or week and a half, stocking up on everything you need all at once.







Carpooling with your neighbors or signing up for a car share program are also great ways to reduce your car use.





;
, If you live in New York City you're probably already used to taking mass transit wherever you go, but big cities aren't the only places that offer public transportation. Get familiar with your city or town's bus or train routes, and start replacing your car commute with a bus trip at least once a week. Work up to using public transportation as often as possible, only using your car when you can't figure out a good alternative.


Taking a bus or train to work, school or any other activity has a lot of advantages. Aside from doing your part to reduce air pollution, you'll have extra time to read, knit, do crosswords, or people watch. Taking public transportation is also safer than driving, and will probably help reduce your anxiety level since you won't have to deal with rush hour traffic.







, Even better than taking public transportation is using your own energy to propel you where you want to go. You can probably walk to locations that are within a five minute drive of your house - and if you're adventurous and have the time, you may want to walk even further. If you're lucky enough to live in a place with good bike routes, start using them. In places with heavy traffic, biking can be the fastest way to get around.

, Get your car tuned up frequently and make sure it passes your city's smog test with flying colors. There are a few other things you can do to help your car make as small a dent as possible:


Use an energy-conserving motor grade oil.Fill your gas tank in the early morning or late evening, when it's cool outside. This helps prevent as much gas from evaporating in the heat of the day.
Take care not to let gas spill when you fill your tank.
Instead of letting your car idle in long lines at fast food restaurants and bank drive-thrus, park your car and walk inside.

Inflate your car’s tires to the recommended pressure. This will produce the best performance for your car and reduces fuel usage.

Become a maker.,
Shop local.,
Go for less packaging.,
Reuse, recycle, and compost.,
Use environmentally safe paints and cleaning products whenever possible.",How to Take Action to Reduce Air Pollution2," Using raw ingredients to make as many things as possible, instead of buying them at the store, is a great way to help reduce air pollution. That's because the practice of mass-producing, packaging, and shipping goods to make them readily available to consumers is directly responsible for industrial emissions that pollute the air. Take a look around your house and figure out items you could make instead of buying. Here are a few ideas:


Food, of course! If you tend to buy a lot of pre-packaged food, then making your meals from scratch is a good place to start. Eliminating convenience foods and creating dishes with raw ingredients is healthier and better for the environment. For example, if you love spaghetti, make your sauce from raw tomatoes and garlic rather than buying a can of pre-made sauce. You can make your own pasta, too!






Did you know you can make your own household cleaners? Instead of buying dish soap, laundry detergent and bathtub cleaner, make your own using nontoxic ingredients. Store your concoctions in glass jars.






The same goes for homemade shampoo, toothpaste, deodorant and lip balm.






Clothing is a bit trickier to make on your own, but if you're feeling ambitious and want to give it a try, start with basics like shirts and pants.






If you're interested in becoming a full-time maker, look into the art of homesteading. Soon you'll be growing the tomatoes and garlic you need to make that sauce.







, When you do need to buy something instead of making it, try to buy items that are made and sold locally. You'll probably have better luck at locally-owned stores, rather than commercial stores, which tend to get their wares shipped in from all over the world, greatly contributing to air pollution. Here are some strategies for buying local:


Shop at farmer's markets. This is the best way to shop for food grown and sold locally.
Check the tags of clothing items. Try to buy items that were manufactured close to where you live. Though it can be quite expensive, consider buying items that were handmade by someone living close to you. If this isn't an option, getting secondhand clothes is another good way to cut down on consumption.
Don't buy stuff online. Getting a book or clothing item online is extremely easy on the consumer's end, but think about the boats, planes and trucks required to deliver that item to your door. It should be something you only do sparingly.

, The plastic, foil and cardboard used in packaging is manufactured using practices that negatively impact air quality. No matter what you're shopping for, try to choose items that have less packaging. For example, instead of choosing a box of individually-wrapped granola bars, try making your own at home or buying granola bars from a bakery where they don't come wrapped in foil. If that's not an option, go for the items that come in recyclable packaging.


Take your own cloth shopping bag to the store instead of choosing paper or plastic.
Shop in the bulk food section instead of buying individually packaged items.
Buy loose, fresh produce instead of canned or frozen produce.






Buy extra large containers of items you use often so you don't have to purchase many smaller containers.

, Managing your household waste effectively is another good way to reduce air pollution. Reusing, recycling and composting can have a big effect on your garbage output, which means less trash going into the landfills - big sources of air pollution.Try to buy items that come in glass containers so you can reuse them over and over again. Plastic is reusable, too, but be careful reusing it too often to store food, since chemicals can leach from the plastic into the food over time.






Recycle your plastic, paper, aluminum, and other recyclables according to your city's guidelines.







Make a compost pile in your yard, into which you can throw your vegetable peelings and other food scraps. After you've tended your pile for a few months, you'll have rick, black compost you can use to feed your garden.







, Such paints and cleaning products emit less smog-producing particles to the air and are better for your breathing health too.


Follow manufacturers’ recommendations to use and properly seal cleaners, paints, and other chemicals. Carefully following the instructions ensures that smog-forming chemicals can’t evaporate.

Don't use your lights and appliances as often.,
Rethink your heating and cooling habits.,
Don't take long hot showers or baths.",How to Take Action to Reduce Air Pollution3," You've heard it a million times: turn off the lights when you leave a room, and don't leave the TV on all day! These small actions are more important than ever when it comes to reducing air pollution, since the electricity that runs your lights and appliances is generated by emissions-producing coal or natural gas plants. Here are a few more ideas for cutting back on the energy your household uses on a daily basis:


Take advantage of natural light. Set up your work or study space near a window that gets bright light all day, so you won't have to switch the lights on.
Have one room in the house be the ""bright room"" at night, rather than lighting up the whole house all the time. Your family can gather in the brightest room to read, study, or watch a movie before bedtime, rather than spreading out.






Unplug your appliances when you aren't using them. That goes for big appliances as well as small ones - TVs, computers, toasters, coffee makers, etc. Even a phone charger left plugged in can sap energy all day long.






Replace outdated large appliances with models that are designed to conserve energy.
Buy your electricity from low or zero pollution facilities. Look into the options available in your area., Try to allow your body to acclimate to the changing seasons instead of using your heater and air conditioner to keep the temperature steady all year long. Blasting the heat and air is a major drain on energy, so break out your hand fans and warm sweaters to help you adjust to weather changes rather than relying on your thermostat.


When you're at work or away on a weekend trip, make sure to adjust your thermostat so that it's not pumping in cool or hot air the entire time you're away., Heating water requires a lot of energy, so being mindful of how much hot water you use is an important practice. You can start by taking shorter showers and skipping baths, since both require an abundance of hot water.


Turn your water heater to 120 °F (49 °C), so that the water never heats beyond that temperature.
Use the cool setting on your washing machine.

Educate yourself on air pollution.,
Plant trees.,
Join a group working to fight air pollution.",How to Take Action to Reduce Air Pollution4," Different regions have different air pollution issues. There may be a factory nearby that's polluting the air in your city, or perhaps the local landfill is the main culprit in your area. To understand how you can best take action to reduce air pollution in your area, do some research to find out what the major sources are.


Look online, read the newspaper, and ask around for information. If you're in school, your teachers might be able to point you in the right direction.






Start talking about air pollution with people in your life, instead of glossing over the problem. Discussing the issue could lead to bright ideas or courses of action you wouldn't have thought up on your own.







, Trees reduce air pollution, and planting them is one of the most concrete, satisfying actions you can take to help the air quality in your region. Trees produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide, which they turn into food. Find out what types of trees are best to plant in your area, and take action!


Many cities have programs geared toward planting trees, like New York's MillionTreesNYC.Find out if there's a similar program where you live.

, Individuals can take steps to reduce air pollution in their daily lives, but the ultimate solution will involve changing governmental policies regarding industrial emissions. If you're passionate about taking action to reduce air pollution, consider joining an organization whose goal is to do exactly that. You'll learn more about the education and experience you need to help bring about lasting change and reduce air pollution where you live.

Walk or ride your bike whenever possible.,
Use public transportation.,
Consolidate your trips.,
Carpool to school or work.,
Get regular maintenance on your vehicle.,
Drive safely.,
Consider purchasing a hybrid or electric car for your next vehicle.",How to Help Stop Pollution1," One of the best things you can do to help stop pollution is to stop using your car for short trips. If the weather is nice and you don’t have too far to go, consider walking or riding your bike. You will help reduce air pollution and you will get some exercise and fresh air in the process., Riding the bus, train, or subway is another great way to avoid using your personal vehicle and reduce carbon emissions. If you have access to good public transportation where you live, take advantage of it. Since you won’t have to worry about keeping your eyes on the road, you can take advantage of the time to read, catch up on news, or just relax.

, Making lots of little trips over the course of a few days contributes more pollution to the environment every time you hop in your car. Instead of running your errands over the course of a few days, try to consolidate them into one round trip. Consolidating your trips into one long trip will also save you money since starting your car when the engine is cold consumes 20% more fuel than driving your car., Long commutes to school or work are just part of life for many people. If walking and public transportation are not good options for you, consider joining a carpool to your school or place of work. By taking turns driving and riding with others, you will reduce carbon emission and you will also save on gas money each week.Carpooling is also a great way to develop friendships with your coworkers and reduce the stress of your commute., In addition to finding ways to use your car less, keeping your car in good condition can also help reduce carbon emissions. As an added bonus, keeping your car in good condition will also help avoid more major problems with your vehicle. Get regular maintenance on your car to keep it running well.Get an oil change every three months or 3,000 miles.
Keep tires inflated according to your vehicle’s recommendations.
Get your air, oil, and fuel filters changed according to your vehicle’s recommendations.

, Unsafe driving habits also contribute to pollution, so by becoming a safer driver you can help reduce air pollution. Safe driving habits can also save you money by reducing the amount of fuel that your car wastes. When you are behind the wheel, remember to be safe by:Applying gentle pressure to gas and accelerating slowly
Driving at or below the speed limit
Keeping your speed steady (Try using cruise control, if you have it.)
Giving yourself plenty of time to stop

, Electric cars run on electricity alone, so they are zero emission vehicles. Hybrid cars use a combination of electricity and fuel to run. While electric cars are the least polluting, both options will help stop pollution. Although they still use some gas to run, hybrid cars have much better fuel economy than regular cars and emit fewer greenhouse gases than traditional cars.Keep in mind that the purchase price of electric and hybrid cars is higher than most conventional cars.

Choose local food whenever possible.,
Reduce or eliminate your consumption of animal products from factory farms.,
Choose organically grown fruits and vegetables.,
Grow your own fruits and vegetables.",How to Help Stop Pollution2," Transporting food from across the country and around the world requires a considerable amount of fuel. This excessive fuel use contributes to air pollution. Instead of purchasing food that has traveled thousands of miles to get to your table, choose food that comes from nearby farms and that has been grown using sustainable methods. Before you buy, ask the farmer or grower about their techniques to learn about their efforts to stop pollution.Visit a local farm stand or farmers’ market to get fruits and vegetables straight from the people who grew them.
Shop at your neighborhood food cooperative to find locally grown and produced foods.
Check your neighborhood grocery store for locally grown produce and other local items.

, Factory farms are large efficiency-focused operations that produce animal products such as meat, milk, cheese, and eggs.Factory farms are huge contributors to pollution and some of them contribute as much air and water pollution as a small city.To help stop pollution, stop buying and eating animal products that come from factory farms.


If you don’t think that you can completely give up animal products, try to reduce your consumption to once or twice a week.
If you want to have an even bigger impact, consider going vegetarian or vegan.

, Organic fruits and vegetables are grown by farmers who use sustainable farming practices. For example, they avoid using chemical pesticides, which contribute to pollution of ground water. By choosing organic fruits and vegetables you will be contributing to farming practices that are better for the environment.Look for fruits, vegetables, and other products that are labeled as “organic” or “certified organic.”

, Starting a garden in your own backyard is another great way to help stop pollution. Plants and trees convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and act as a carbon sink, which means less pollution. In addition, the fruits and vegetables that you grow in your backyard will take the place of store bought items that may have had to travel many miles to end up on your plate.If you are new to gardening, start small. Plant a small container garden on your patio or plant a few tomato, lettuce, and cucumber plants in your backyard. You can increase the size of your garden over the years as you become more comfortable with gardening.

Turn off lights and electronics when you are not in the room.,
Look for small changes that can lead to big energy savings.,
Keep your thermostat set to 78℉ (25C) in warmer months and 68 (20C) in the colder months.,
Make sure your windows and air ducts are well-sealed.",How to Help Stop Pollution3," You can also unplug them for even more energy savings. Plugging electronics into a power strip is also a good strategy because you can easily turn off the power strip and turn off all of the electronics at the same time.

, There are lots of little things that you can do to make sure that you are conserving as much energy as possible. Keep these strategies in mind to start saving energy.


Keep the temperature on your water heater set to 120℉ (49C). Heating water accounts for between 14-25% of your home’s energy. Keeping the water heater set at 120℉ (49C) will help save some of that energy.Air dry clothes. You can reduce your carbon footprint by 2,400 pounds a year by hanging your clothes out to dry instead of using a dryer.Air or hand dry dishes. Make a dent in the 2.5% of your household energy that is expended by using a dishwasher. Open the dishwasher door instead of running the dry cycle on your dishwasher.
Choose energy efficient light bulbs. Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) can save up to 75% of the energy that goes toward lighting your home. These bulbs also produce less heat than normal light bulbs., By reducing the amount of work that your heating and air condition systems have to do year round, you can make a big difference in your energy use.


Consider turning your heater down to 55℉ (13C) at night during colder months and pile on the blankets to stay warm.
Consider using fans instead of an air conditioner to help control the temperature in your home. Fans use much less energy than air conditioners., Simple solutions like caulking around the frames of your windows and re-glazing the panes, or you may need to have them replaced. You can also use window treatments and coverings in the winter to reduce the amount of heat that escapes your home.If you decide to purchase new windows for your home, look for windows that have been designated as ENERGY STAR® windows. These windows have to meet certain requirements for energy savings."

Buy used items whenever possible.,
Buy reusable items.,
Choose items with minimal packaging.,
Recycle everything that you can.,
Purchase items made from recycled materials.",How to Help Stop Pollution4," By buying used products, you will help reduce the demand for new materials to be created. You will also save money. Check local thrift shops, used furniture and appliance stores, and local ads to find used items., Lots of waste is generated by disposable cups, plates, utensils and storage containers for food. Instead of contributing to the waste in landfills by using disposable dinnerware, primarily use reusable items., The packaging used to protect food requires new raw materials and energy to create. Buy foods that use minimal packaging, such as bulk items or unpackaged produce. If you must buy something that is packaged, try to choose items with the least amount of packaging possible.Avoid buying products packaged with styrofoam. Styrofoam is a common packaging material, but it contributes to much of the waste in landfills because it is difficult to recycle. Styrofoam production also contributes to pollution through the release of hydrocarbons., Almost everything that you buy can be recycled. Try to avoid products that do not have a recycle symbol on the package or that are made of mixed materials that may not be easy to recycle.Check to see if your waste management company offers recycling pick up services. If not, you can always take your sorted recyclables to a nearby recycling center.

, By purchasing items that have been made from recycled materials, you will be helping to reduce the amount of new materials that need to be produced.Look for items that include the terms “recycled content-product” or “post consumer content.”
Items made from recycled materials will also often provide a percentage to indicate how much of the product’s material came from recycled content. Look for items that have higher percentages than others.

Use fewer and environmentally friendly chemicals.,
Don't use pesticides and herbicides.,
Don't flush medication.,
Dispose of toxic waste properly.,
Conserve water.",How to Help Stop Pollution5," Chemicals we use to wash our homes, cars and even our bodies get washed down the drain and into the sewer system, but they often end up in the groundwater. These chemicals aren't good for the plants and animals that make up our ecosystems, and they aren't healthy for human consumption, either. Whenever possible, use natural, healthy alternatives to chemicals.For example, instead of using a heavy-duty cleaner to scrub your bathroom or kitchen, use a mixture of vinegar and water or a baking soda and salt paste. These natural household supplies get the job done just as well, and they won't pollute the water when you wash them down the drain.
Try making your own laundry detergent and dish soap. If you don't have the time, buy detergent made with all-natural ingredients.
When you can't find a good alternative to a toxic item, use the least amount you can get away with and still get the job done.

, These powerful chemicals are sprayed directly over the ground, and when it rains they seep deeper and get into the groundwater. You probably just want aphids to stop eating your tomatoes, but spraying the garden with pesticide will do a lot more than that when it gets into the groundwater that humans and other organisms need to survive.

, Large doses of medication are difficult for water sanitation systems to remove from the water supply, and they end up impacting everyone who drinks the water. Each medication on the market has specific instructions for how it should be disposed. If you need to throw medication away, find out the proper way to do it instead of resorting to flushing.


There are a few highly controlled medications that authorities recommend flushing in order to keep them out of the wrong hands. These are exceptions to the general rule that medications should not be flushed.

, Some substances should not be thrown out with the trash, because they'll seep into the ground and poison the groundwater. If you have a toxic chemical and you're not sure how to throw it away, contact your local sanitation department to find out where there's toxic waste disposal site. Take it there to make sure it gets handled properly.


The US Environmental Protection Agency has a list of different types of toxic waste here.
Keep in mind that items like CFLs, batteries, and other special products require special recycling. Some states even require these items to be recycled in order to prevent mercury from ending up in water and soil. Check with your waste management company to find out what options they offer for recycling these items., It's important to take good care of the water we do have and conserve it as much as possible. Wasting water uses up a valuable resource and has a big effect on the environment. It's easy to take measures in your daily life that help you use less water and preserve the health of your region's ecosystems. Here are a few ways to save water:


Fix water leaks promptly.
Use water-saving devices on your faucets and toilets, like a low-flow showerhead.
Don't wash dishes with the water constantly running.
Replace old toilets and appliances with newer models that use less water.
Don't water your lawn excessively, especially if you live in a dry area.

Learn about the major polluters in your area.,
Tell people about what you know.,
Write an article for your school or local newspaper.,
Protest local polluters.,
Join an environmental group.",How to Help Stop Pollution6," Go to your library, do internet research, and talk to people who can tell you about the major sources of pollution where you live. Learning as much as you can will help you have a better understanding about pollution.


While individuals can do their part to keep the air and water clean, corporations with environmentally damaging industrial practices are the main culprits. In order to protect the water and air where you live, it's important to find out what's putting them in danger.

, Even though a lot of people are concerned about stopping air pollution, many don't understand the severity of the problem or aren't sure what to do about it. Since you've done some research on pollution, use your knowledge to make a difference by talking about it with other people. The more people know about pollution, the more likely we will collectively find a way to stop it.


Just talking about pollution with other people can lead to interesting discussions. Be prepared with answers for people who don't think there's anything they can do to help stop it.
Pollution and the damage it causes is a very serious topic that some people may be averse to discussing. As someone who cares about this issue, be sensitive to others' perspectives and find ways to help them gain a deeper understanding of what's happening to the earth.

, Spreading the word by publishing information about how to stop pollution is a great way to help others become more aware of the problem. Pen an editorial that discusses both the problem and solutions that people can begin to implement in their daily lives starting right away.

, Is there a certain factory or industry in your area that's contributing to the pollution of your local environment? You can make a difference by being vocal about what's going on and joining up with others who want to keep your environment clean and safe. Do online research and find out more about the state of things in your particular region. Change starts at home, and becoming a local activist is the best way to make a difference.

, There might be an existing group working on stopping pollution in your area. If you can't find one, you and your friends might start a group that meets once a week or more often to discuss issues and brainstorm ideas for what you can do to help.Get others to join by spreading the word on Facebook, Twitter and by posting signs around your neighborhood.

, Tip them into a food processor or food blender. Process or blend the chickpeas to the consistency of big breadcrumbs. They should not be over-processed, which means avoid turning them into a paste. They need to be of a rougher texture to help keep the burger in shape and to give some appropriate ""crunch"" to the burger., This mixture now serves as the base from which the burgers are made., Place a silicone mat or a layer of parchment paper over the baking sheet. This will help prevent sticking on the sheet when the burgers are baked. If you're frying the burgers, still do this step, as it will help the refrigeration process., Add the mashed pumpkin and stir through gently. Finish by adding the herbs and egg white, mixing in by stirring., Use your hands when it begins to thicken, as this will make it easier. When it begins to stick together, the burger mix is ready for shaping., Using your hands and fingers, take a couple of tablespoons of the burger mix and shape into a burger round. Pat it down to flatten it evenly across the top and bottom. Place onto the baking sheet. Repeat until all burgers have been shaped. This should make about 6 burgers in total., Do not skip this step, as the chilling helps to keep the burgers in shape during cooking. Leave for one hour minimum (longer is fine too).

It is a good idea to cover the burgers with a layer of wax paper or food wrap to prevent spills or smells from harming the burgers as they chill. Remove any such cover before baking.

, Both methods are appropriate but produce a different texture. The fried burgers will be oilier and cook faster but both should be crunchy on the outside when done.

If frying, place a teaspoon or more of olive oil into the base of a frying pan. Heat until the oil is hot. Add the burgers. Cook on one side for a few minutes, then flip over and cook the other side.
If baking, place the burgers already on the baking sheet into an oven preheated to 180ºC/350ºF and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Test the burger is cooked before turning off the oven; if it needs a bit more, just return and bake in 5 minute increments, testing each time.

, Handle the burgers using tongs or a spatula, as they are still hot. Turn into burgers (see next), or serve as part of a main meal, as patties with a side dish or two., Place onto each individual plate the burger is to be served on.

When cutting the burger buns, be more generous with the base half than the top half, to ensure that the burger is stable and easy to handle.

Enjoy.",How to Make Broccoli and Cheese," Place the butter in a medium saucepan and set the saucepan on your stove over medium heat. Heat the butter until it melts.


Shortly after the butter melts, it should start looking foamy. Allow the butter to start foaming before continuing to the next step.
Margarine can be used instead of butter if necessary, but butter is strongly recommended since it will form a better base for the sauce.;
, Sprinkle the flour over the melted butter. Cook the flour and butter together, stirring constantly, for 30 to 60 seconds or until an evenly-blended paste forms.


Sifting the flour over the butter as evenly as possible will make it easier to combine.
The combined butter and flour forms a thickening base for your sauce. This thickening base is more accurately known as a “roux.”

, Sprinkle the roux with 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt. Pour in the milk, whisking constantly, and cook the mixture until it boils.


Note that this step only requires you to use half of the total amount of salt called for in this recipe.
You'll need to whisk the contents of the pan constantly to help break up the clumps of roux.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the sauce to simmer for 5 to 8 minutes.


Whisk the sauce periodically during this time. The roux should finish breaking down, causing the sauce to thicken.
When ready, the sauce should be evenly heated, smooth, and free of lumps.

, Add handfuls of shredded cheddar into the sauce, mixing with a wooden spoon after each addition. Continue until all of the cheese has been added and melted down.


You'll need to stir the sauce consistently during this step to blend the cheese into the milk base. The sauce is only complete once all the cheese is completely melted and the cheese sauce is completely smooth.

, Cover the saucepan and set it aside as you prepare the broccoli.


Keep the saucepan warm and stir the sauce occasionally to prevent a skin from forming on top.

, Fill a medium saucepan three-quarters deep with water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat.

, Add the remaining 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of salt to the boiling water, immediately followed by the broccoli florets.


Do not add the salt before the water reaches a boil. Doing so would increase the boiling point of the water, so it would take longer for the water to actually reach a rolling boil.
If you choose to work with fresh broccoli instead of frozen florets, you'll need two to three heads of broccoli to match the amount prepared in this recipe. Cut the broccoli into florets. Discard the stems or use them for another recipe.

, Boil the broccoli at medium-high heat until it becomes tender-crisp. This should take roughly 4 to 5 minutes.


You don't need to cover the saucepan or stir the broccoli during this step. Allow the florets to cook undisturbed until ready.

, Pour the contents of the pan through a colander. Drain the water and retain the broccoli.

, Dump the drained broccoli into a serving dish. Evenly pour the prepared cheese sauce on top.


You may need to quickly stir the sitting cheese sauce before pouring it over the broccoli.
If desired, you can toss the broccoli with the cheese sauce to distribute the sauce evenly throughout the dish. Doing so is not necessary, however, and may be omitted for the sake of presentation.

, Serve the broccoli and cheese immediately to enjoy the dish while it is still hot.

, Combine the broccoli and water into a large microwave-safe bowl. Cover the bowl with a microwave-safe lid.


If you choose to use fresh whole broccoli instead of frozen florets, you'll need two to three whole heads to match the amount called for in this recipe. Clean the broccoli and cut it into florets. Discard the stems or use them in another recipe.
Ideally, you should cover the dish with its own microwave-safe lid. If it doesn't have an appropriate lid, however, you can cover it with microwave-safe plastic wrap or a microwave-safe heavy plate (most stoneware and ceramic plates should work well).

, Place the dish in your microwave and cook the broccoli on full power for 3 to 4 minutes. The broccoli should be tender-crisp when done.


Microwave the broccoli in intervals to prevent overcooking it. Cook it for 2-1/2 minutes first, then check the dish and stir its contents. Continue cooking at 30-second to 60-second intervals until the broccoli is ready.

, Remove the lid and dump the contents of the dish into a colander. Drain the water and keep the florets. Set the broccoli aside as you prepare the cheese sauce.


Be careful when opening the dish since the built-up steam could be hot enough to cause burns.

, Cut the block of processed cheese into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) cubes.


If you do not have a brick of processed cheese, you can use sliced processed cheese instead. You'll need roughly 16 slices of processed cheese to equal the 8 oz (225 g) block. Tear the slices into small pieces before using them.

, Place the cubed cheese, milk, diced onion, and minced garlic in a microwave-safe dish. Toss to combine evenly.


You can skip the onion and garlic, if desired, to create an even simpler cheese sauce.
Loosely cover the dish with a lid, plastic wrap, or paper towel to prevent splatter.

, Place the dish in your microwave and heat the contents at full power for 3 minutes, or until the cheese completely melts down.


Stir the sauce after each minute to evenly distribute the heat.
Once ready, carefully remove the dish from the microwave.

, Place the broccoli in a serving dish, then pour the melted cheese sauce over it.


You can either leave the contents as they are or toss them together with a spoon until the cheese evenly coats the cooked florets.

, Serve the dish immediately so you can enjoy it while it's still hot.

Even when they’re turned off, electronic devices still consume trace amounts of power.When you leave the house for the day or an extended period of time, turn off and unplug your electronic devices and appliances.;
, A large portion of acid rain emissions can be attributed to power generation. This means anytime you use power that comes from gas or coal, you are unwittingly contributing to acid rain.Thankfully, you can mitigate this impact by using less power, which you can accomplish by:


Hanging clothes to dry instead of using the dryer.
Washing clothes and dishes by hand instead of in the washing machine or dish washer.
Reading a book instead of watching television or playing on the computer.
Cooking multiple meals or multiple batches of food at a time.

, When it’s time to replace older appliances—such as the refrigerator, washer, dryer, furnace, air conditioner, and dish washer—upgrade to energy-efficient ones. Energy-efficient appliances will mean more money in your pocket and less acid rain in the water. And don’t forget to replace burnt out incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent lights.Look for the Energy Star logo on products, which ensures that the product you’re buying is energy-efficient.Purchase new appliances based on your household needs. For instance, when it’s time to replace your furnace or air conditioner, buy one that’s been sized properly for the space you need to heat or cool.

, Moving away from gas appliances and machines is a very direct way that you can help reduce acid rain. Gas-powered devices you might find around the house or garage include:


Snow blowers
Lawn mowers
Chainsaws

, Reducing energy use can be accomplished by preventing heat and cold from escaping, and you can do this by adding extra insulation between walls, insulating the attic and basement or crawl space, and putting caulking or weather stripping around windows and doors., A programmable thermostat can save you tons of money and energy in the long run. Put it on a timer so that the heat or air-conditioning don’t run when nobody is home, and turn off when everyone is sleeping.


Set your thermostat to 68 F (20 C) in the winter and 72 F (22.2 C) in summer so that your furnace and air conditioner don’t have to work as hard., While windows are great for letting in light and fresh air, you shouldn’t open them when climate control is on. You can also use drapes and blinds to keep out extra heat from the sun on hot summer days and cold air from outside on cool winter nights.

, Trucks, planes, cars, trains, and boats that are powered by fossil fuels are a huge contributor to the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that cause acid deposition.By shopping locally at markets and stores that source their products nearby, you can reduce the transportation-related acid rain emissions being released into the atmosphere.

, Not only is it great to add plants and trees to the planet that will help absorb carbon dioxide, but growing your own food will also further reduce your reliance on the fossil fuels associated with food transportation.

, Not everyone can afford an electric car, but you can change your driving habits to use less fuel. Green driving habits include things like:


Keeping the air pressure in your tires at the proper level.
Braking and accelerating gradually.
Using the air-conditioning sparingly. Roll down the windows instead to conserve gas., A significant portion of fossil fuel consumption can be traced to the manufacturing of chemicals, rubber, and plastics.To reduce your reliance on plastics, don’t buy bottled water, invest in reusable shopping bags, purchase food items in bulk, opt for items that are packaged in glass instead of plastic, and support companies that limit their packaging.

, The majority of the world’s energy comes from fossil fuels—in the form of natural gas, coal, and oil—but there are companies out there that focus exclusively on providing customers with energy from renewable sources. Renewable energies include:Nuclear
Hydropower
Solar and wind
Geothermal

, While it may not be possible for you to switch to a green energy provider, you can still reduce your reliance on energy-related fossil fuels. There are small wind turbines that can be installed in a backyard that will generate electricity for personal use, or you can install solar panels on your roof.


If you set up a grid-tied energy production system, you can still use energy from your regular power supplier when necessary, but they may pay you for excess energy you put back into the system!

, This is a much pricier option, but if you can trade in your car for an electric, hybrid, or low-emission car, you can reduce your fossil fuel use and help reduce acid rain.Another option that is cheaper than buying a new car is converting your existing gas tank to propane, for while it is still a fossil fuel, it doesn’t emit the same acid-rain-causing pollutants.If it’s not feasible for you to buy a new car or convert yours to propane, you can still help by maintaining your car properly and making sure it’s functioning as it should, and not burning oil or releasing emissions it shouldn’t be.

, Regardless of what kind of car you drive, using less fuel and less energy (especially if your car is electric but your power comes from fossil fuels) is beneficial. There are plenty of public transit options available in many cities, including buses and trains. Or, consider starting a carpool group with people you work or travel with often., You can completely eliminate your need for transportation-related emissions by getting around on foot, a bike, rollerblades, or even a skateboard. Let your own body power your movements, and your health and the environment will appreciate the effort.

, Let your government know how you feel about acid rain, and tell them if you think they should be doing more. You can even petition industry leaders and business owners if you feel they could be doing a better job of cleaning up their acts. For industries that do contribute lots of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, explain to them and governments that regulate them that they can:Use chemical scrubbers to remove pollutants from their smokestacks.
Seek out alternative fuels.
Switch to green technologies that don’t require fossil fuels.

, Tell them why this issue is important to you and why it should be important to them by explaining what kinds of impacts acid rain can have on the environment and our future.


Ask family to adopt the same eco-friendly chore practices that you’ve taken on, such as reducing energy consumption, replacing lightbulbs with CFLs, and reducing the use of electronics and appliances.
When it comes to transportation, explain how their pocketbooks (and waistlines) can benefit from being more active and using the car less.

, Explain to anyone who’s willing to listen, including friends, coworkers, and schoolmates, that acid rain damages lakes, streams, soils, forests, and the plants and animals that live in those ecosystems. Tell them that acid deposition also causes the premature decay of buildings, homes, and works of art, and has a negative impact on human health and animal life.


Tell other people about the steps you’ve taken to reduce acid rain, and show them how easy it can be for them to adopt some of those same practices."

Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to heat fully.Make sure that you know how your oven indicates that it’s reached the proper temperature. It will usually beep and/or flash an indicator light.;
, For one large pizza, you’ll need 16 ounces (453 g) of pizza dough. Place it on a lightly floured surface, and use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a circle that is approximately 16- to 18-inches (41- to 46-cm) in diameter.You can make your own pizza dough from scratch or buy premade pizza dough from your local grocery store or pizzeria.
It helps to lightly dust the rolling pin with flour before rolling out the dough.

, After you’ve rolled out the pizza dough, place it on a pizza pan or stone to ready it for baking. The easiest way to transfer the dough to your baking surface is with a wooden pizza peel. Slide the peel under the dough and then shift it back and forth on the pan or stone to slide it off.If you don’t have a pizza peel, you may want to lay parchment down on the surface where you’re working before rolling out the dough. Roll the dough out on the floured parchment paper, and then you can just lift it by the edges of the paper and slide it onto your pan or stone.

, Once the dough is on your pan or stone, spread 1 tablespoons (15 ml) of olive oil across it. Next, sprinkle 2 cups (226 g) of shredded pepper jack cheese, 1 roasted poblano pepper that’s been diced, and ⅓ cup (15 g) of chopped cilantro over the dough, leaving a border around the edge to serve as the crust.You can add other toppings to the pizza if you like. Some options that work well with the avocado and other ingredients include cooked, diced chicken, grilled corn kernels, and diced red onion.

, After you’ve added the toppings to the pizza, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the pizza to bake until the cheese melts completely and the crust becomes golden brown, which should take approximately 18 to 20 minutes.http:

Make sure to keep an eye on the pizza toward the end of the baking time to ensure that the edges don’t burn.

, When the pizza is finished cooking, take it out of the oven. Immediately, spread slices from 2 avocadoes and ⅓ cup (35 g) of cotija cheese over the top of the pizza.Cotija is a hard Mexican cheese, which you can find in most grocery stores.
If you can’t find cotija,you can substitute feta cheese.

, After you’ve added the avocadoes and cotija cheese, squeeze a lime wedge over the top of the pizza to add the fresh juice. If you prefer a spicier pizza, drizzle some hot sauce over it as well.Both red pepper hot sauce and jalapeno pepper hot sauce work well on the pizza.

, Add ½ cup (116 g) mayonnaise, ½ cup (115 g) of sour cream, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of milk to a medium bowl. Whisk the ingredients together so they’re well-blended.For the creamiest sauce, it’s best use whole milk.

, After you’ve combined the mayo, sour cream, and milk, transfer the mixture to the bowl of a food processor. Add 1 green onion that’s been roughly chopped, 2 garlic cloves, ½ cup (23 g) of roughly chopped cilantro, 1 avocado with the pit and skin removed, the juice from half a lime, and salt and pepper to taste. Blend the ingredients until they’re thoroughly mixed.You may need to stop the food processor once or twice to scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure that the ingredients are fully mixed.

, When the sauce is thoroughly mixed, use a spoon or fork to drizzle it over the pizza. Next, use a knife or pizza cutter to cut the pizza into 8 slices and serve.You may find it easier to drizzle the avocado sauce evenly over the pizza if you put it in a squeeze bottle.

A power hand drill is one of the easiest ways to cut a hole into the coconut, but if you do not have one, you could also use a corkscrew, screwdriver, or metallic skewer, instead.
Worst case scenario, you can use a hammer and a nail. Pound the nail into the coconut using the hammer. Then, using the back end of the hammer to lift the nail back out, creating a hole.
Create your hole in one of the three ""eyes"" of the coconut. These spots are the thinnest spot on the outer shell and the easiest to drill through.
It may help to hold the coconut on a non-slip surface, like a cutting board or kitchen towel, to prevent it from slipping around as you attempt to drill through it.;
, Tip the coconut upside-down so that the liquid in the center drains out.


Coconut water can be used for cooking purposes or served with ice as a beverage, but if you have no plans for the coconut water, simply discard it by pouring the water down the drain.

, Place the coconut in a large plastic bag or wrap it securely in a kitchen towel. Strike the coconut through the bag or towel using a wooden rolling pin or hammer until it breaks in two.


For best results, place the coconut on a cement floor, sidewalk, or other equally hard surface. Do not use a kitchen counter since you may accidentally damage the counter as you strike the coconut.
Use as much force as possible to strike the coconut in the direct middle. Some will open quickly, while others may take more effort.
You could also open the coconut by striking its center on a sharp rock or by sawing it in half with a hand saw. If using a saw, saw down the center seam that passes in between the eyes of the coconut.

, Use a standard butter knife or small paring knife to cut the white meat away from the hard outer shell.Cut through the meat by making a cut from the inside all the way through to the shell. Use your fingers or the tip of the knife to pry the meat off the shell in chunks.
To make the process easier, cut the meat into v-shaped sections or cross-hatched sections, creating pieces inside the shell that can be readily removed.
You might be able to wedge a metal spoon or dull knife in between the meat and the shell without making any slices through the center of the meat. If you can, try lifting the meat away from the shell after wedging the utensil in the gap.

, Use a vegetable peeler to remove the thin layer of brown skin on the outside of the white coconut meat.


If you successfully removed all of the flesh from the shell, there will be a brown skin on the portion of the flesh that touched the shell. This part needs to be removed before you can prepare the coconut for flour or any other use.

, If the pieces of meat are too large to fit into your blender, cut them into smaller portions using the same butter knife or paring knife used to cut the meat from the outer shell.


If desired, you could use a food processor instead of a blender. Make sure that the food processor is large enough to hold both the coconut and the water you will be adding to it, however.

, Fill a tea kettle or saucepan with 1 quart (1 L) of water and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Pour this water into the blender.


The water should completely cover the coconut.
Strictly speaking, the water does not need to be boiling, but boiling water will soak into the coconut quicker than cool or room temperature water.
To accomplish the same level of absorption using cool or room temperature water, let the coconut meat soak in the water for 2 hours before pressing forward.

, Pulse or blend the water and coconut for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the pulp is fairly smooth.


The pulp will not be ""puree"" smooth, but there should be no large chunks of coconut remaining or any soupy areas. The water and coconut should be evenly blended and dispersed throughout.

, Wait another 3 to 5 minutes to allow the pulp time to cool to the touch.


If you do not give the pulp time to rest, you may burn your fingers when you try to strain it. Note, however, that this is not an issue if you used cool or room temperature water. In that instance, the pulp can be strained immediately.

, Pour the contents of the blender through a nut milk bag. Collect the milk in a bowl placed beneath the bag and save the pulp retained inside of the bag for your flour.


If you do not have a nut milk bag, you could use a cheesecloth. Arrange the cheesecloth into a mesh strainer and pour the contents of the blender through the cheesecloth and strainer. As before, collect the milk in a bowl placed beneath the bag and use the pulp for your flour.
You will not need the coconut milk any longer for this particular project. The coconut milk can be discarded, if desired, but you can also drink the milk or use it for cooking purposes as a substitution for dairy milk.

,


The oven needs to be set to a very low temperature. The objective is to dehydrate the coconut pulp without toasting or burning it. The only way to do this in your oven is to bake the coconut at as low a temperature as possible.
Do not use cooking spray. The surface of the cookie sheet needs to be dry.
Do not use aluminum foil. The delicate coconut taste can be affected by the metallic taste of foil.

, Spread the strained coconut pulp out over the parchment paper, forming it into a flat, even layer.


Use a fork to break up any large chunks of pulp. The layer of coconut should be as thin as possible.

, Cook the pulp until it feels completely dry to the touch.


After pulling it out of the oven, let it cool off for 1 or 2 minutes. Carefully touch it with your hands. If it feels perfectly dry, the coconut is ready. If you can still feel some moisture, you should put it back into the oven for a few more minutes.
Coconut can burn even at low temperatures, so you need to monitor the coconut closely as it dehydrates. Pull it out of the oven at the first sign of toasting or burning.

, Scrape all of the dry coconut into a food processor or blender.


Do not add any water or other ingredients. It is crucial that the coconut be completely dry as it goes into the food processor or blender.
Make sure that the food processor or blender is completely dry, as well. If you are using the same blender used during the coconut milk part of the process, you will need to wipe the bucket dry using paper towels before you can add the dry, dehydrated pulp back into it.

, Pulse or blend the coconut for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it appears finely ground.


You may need to use a dry spatula to stir the coconut flour so that all the pieces are exposed to the blades and thoroughly ground up. If you do this, however, pause the pulsing or blending process whenever you put the spatula into the machine.

,


When stored properly, coconut flour can last up to one year on the shelf.
That said, fresh coconut flour usually tastes better than old coconut flour.

Make different crystal types.",How to Make Baking Soda Crystals," To make baking soda crystals, you start by making a water solution that’s saturated with baking soda. The baking soda will dissolve better in warm water. Measure 2 cups (470 ml) of water into a kettle. Turn on the kettle to boil the water.

Be very careful when using appliances and electronics. Ask a parent, guardian, or adult to help you.;
, When the kettle boils, carefully pour the water into a large heat-proof bowl, glass, or jar. Be very careful not to spill the water, as it’s very hot and can burn your skin. You may want to ask an adult to pour the water for you., Sprinkle half the baking soda into the jar with the hot water. Stir the mixture to dissolve the baking soda in the water. Then, add the remaining baking soda 1 teaspoon (5 g) at a time, stirring each time to dissolve the baking soda.Continue adding baking soda until no more will dissolve in the water and a thin layer of powder forms on the bottom of the jar.
You may need to add slightly more or less baking soda than the ¼ cup (55 g) to completely saturate the water.

, When the water won’t absorb any more baking soda, set it aside to cool for about 20 minutes. Once the solution has cooled, divide it equally between two small jars or glasses.Leave the last bit of solution in the original jar, and throw out the undissolved baking soda that’s settled on the bottom.

, Select a flat surface where you can leave the jars undisturbed for about a week. Good places include a work table or counter. Place the jars on the table or counter about 6 inches (15 cm) apart from each other. Place a plate between the jars to catch any water that may drip.

The crystals will need several days to grow, and you don’t want to move them once they start growing. That’s why it’s important to find a place now where you can set up the experiment.

, To make colored baking soda crystals, you can add five to 10 drops of food coloring to each jar. Stir the solution to mix the color into it.You can make both jars the same color, or you can color each solution a different color.

If you make each jar a different color, half your crystals will be one color, and the other half will be another color.

, Baking soda crystals need a medium to form on, and string is great for this. Any type of fabric string will work, like string, twine, or yarn. Use scissors to cut a foot-long (30-cm) length of string.

Always be very careful when using scissors, and make sure you have adult supervision when cutting or using sharp tools.

, To keep the strings weighted in the baking soda solution, you can tie weights to each end of the string. Good weights include beads and paper clips.Run each end of the string through the hole in a bead or end of a paper clip, and tie a small knot in the string to secure it to the weight., Take one end of the string and gently drop the weight into one of the jars. Pick up the other end of the string and drop the weighted end into the other jar. The string running between the two jars should be loose and hanging down slightly, like a smile., The baking soda crystals will form as the solution saturates the string and the water evaporates. When the water does evaporate, it will leave behind the baking soda crystals. You can check on the experiment whenever you like, but don’t stir the water or touch the string.

The crystals will need about five to seven days to fully form., To find out how quickly the crystals are growing, check on the experiment at the same time every day. Each day, make a note of any changes that have happened since the day before. You can document the experiment by:

Taking notes about the length and thickness of the crystals
Noting the water level in the jars
Making drawings of the experiment
Taking pictures of the project

, When crystals have formed on the entire length of the string after about five days, you can remove the string of crystals. Use two hands to grab the string where it attaches to the jars. Carefully pull the string of crystals from the jars and lay it down on a clean plate. Leave the string to dry for several hours., Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits that often form inside of caves. You can watch how these formations are made by adding extra water to the string when you're creating your crystals:

Each day, remove a spoonful of baking soda solution from one of the jars
Drizzle a few drops of the solution on the center of the string to saturate it
As the water drips onto the plate below and evaporates, baking soda crystal deposits will form that dangle from the center of the string (stalactites) and grow up from the plate below (stalagmites)., Place a few drops of your colored baking soda solution into a clean egg shell half. Swirl the water around to coat the inside of the shell. Place the egg on a plate and set it aside for a day or two to allow the water to evaporate. Add a few more drops of water every day. As the water evaporates, the crystals will form inside the egg shell., You can also make other types of crystals using the same method as with baking soda crystals. Other crystal types you can make include sugar, salt, and Epsom salt crystals. To make these types of crystals:

Dissolve ⅔ cup of sugar, salt, or Epsom salts in a glass of hot waterDivide the solution between two clean jars
Cut a piece of string to a length of 1 foot (30 cm)
Place each end of the string in one of the jars
Leave the experiment for several days so the crystals can form

Decide if you are going to use water, milk, or heavy cream in your egg wash.,
Crack egg into a small bowl.

Whisk egg until well blended.,
Whisk in milk, water, or heavy cream.,
Use to brush on unbaked bread, pastry, or unbaked pie crust.,
Bake as usual.",How to Make an Egg Wash1," If you are not interested in achieving a particular look, you can use any of the three you have on hand. Keep in mind it is the yolk of the egg that determines the shade and the gloss. The other liquids (including the egg white) are used to thin the yolk so it won't dry out your pastry and cause it to crack in the oven, and also to help you control the shine and shade of brown of your finished pastry.Water will make a less shiny (more of a matte), golden brown glaze. Adding water will make your wash extra flexible, and is good for things like bread that will expand a lot as they bake.Milk will add more shine, but otherwise will have a very similar affect as water.Cream will give your pastry a shiny, rich brown finish. It doesn't add as much give, so try to use it only on things that won't expand very much as they bake, like pie crust.;
,, Make sure the yolk is broken up and thoroughly mixed with the white.









Don't beat the egg too vigorously--you don't want the eggs to to become foamy., Start with 1 teaspoon per egg used.









If you are glazing something that is going to expand quite a bit (like a pastry or loaf of bread that is going to rise significantly), mix in another 1-2 teaspoons of liquid. This will give your glaze a little more give and prevent cracking as the pastry expands.,









If you are glazing something in a pan, like pie or bread, try not to let the egg wash spill over or drip down between the crust and the pan. This could cause your pie or bread to stick to the pan and could damage your finished product when you de-pan it later., If you have leftover egg wash that is not contaminated with raw meat or fish, you can cover the bowl and store it to make breakfast the next day."

A few dashes of salt can also thin the yolk, though not as much as the addition of another liquid. Egg yolk with a little salt will give you a shiny, golden brown finish., Separate the white from the yolk. Gently whisk the white and glaze the pastry using only the egg white.

, This is a simple wash used to help one food adhere to another, like breadcrumbs on a chicken parmesan. In this instance, you would coat the chicken with flour, then dip it in the egg mixture, and finally cover the chicken with breadcrumbs.Use 1 whole egg and a dash of salt., If you only have something like liquid Egg Beaters on hand, it's fine to use that as an egg wash. Don't add anything to the mix, it will probably already be pretty thin. Just go ahead and brush it on your pastry., If you need a wash so your vegan pastry still gets that shiny, golden brown look, try soy milk or olive oil."

, This is so the dosa gets cooked evenly on all sides. Wait until the bottom starts browning and the corners start lifting up., Once the other side is cooked, remove the dosa from the tawa. Serve with any chutney or sambar.  Instant tomato chutney also goes well with this.

Figure out what you plan to make.,
Go to a free recipe website.,
Use the tool on the site to make a different amount of baked goods.,
Package the goods in a container that is stable enough to make it to school or the sale's location, but is something you won't miss in your kitchen too much.,
Label the treats.",How to Make Bake Sale Goodies," There are multiple possibilities to keep any classroom of hungry kids happy. Standards include Cream Cheese Brownie Cupcakes, Red Velvet Cupcakes, Boston Cream Cupcakes, Cookie Cupcakes, for birthdays or parties. Mummy Cupcakes, Black Bat Cupcakes, or Spider Cupcakes for Halloween, are just sample ideas and are all great choices.;
, There you can find a recipe that matches the amount of time you have, the ingredients you have, and more. Many recipes feature pictures, ratings, and comments. You can also use a trusted cookbook, but this will require a bit of math in the next step.

, The recipe is for 2 dozen but if you need 8 dozen, modify the recipe. If using a cookbook's recipe, you'll need to do the math by hand.

, A great idea is to use disposable baking tins and cover them with cling wrap.

, Label treats to ensure people know the ingredients prone to trigger allergies, especially if they include nuts or Accommodate Vegetarian Guests.

Measure the length and the depth of the baking pan.,
Cut four sheets of parchment paper from the roll.,
Trim each length of paper to the width of the baking pan.

,
Place two sheets of the parchment paper facing one direction of the baking pan.,
Fill as required by the recipe.

",How to Line a Square Baking Pan," Use a ruler or a tape measure.;
, The length of each sheet should reflect the length of the pan as measured, then add twice the depth as measured plus 4"" or 10 centimeter (3.9 in) extra to allow for overhang.

,, Place the other two sheets facing the other direction. Ultimately the baking pan ends up with two sheets on each side and four sheets on the base of the pan.

Unfold the trestle table legs.,
Cover with a sheet or large tablecloth.,
Find an old piece of furniture that has a basic square shape.,
Make a bake sale sign that stands over the top of the stand.,
Add shade.,
Ensure that the baked goods are properly covered and can be transported with ease.,
Arrange signage on the table as needed.,
Arrange the baked goods in logical order.,
Have a kid-friendly spot, if possible.,
Keep a place for items yet to be put out.",How to Make a Bake Sale Stand Stall," Depending on where the bake sale is being held, it will be much easier if the table is already on the premises. If it isn't, a table with folding legs is your best bet for transporting with ease, such as folding tables used for camping, or a card table. School desks, the teacher's desk, an outdoor table, or even a small dining table could all work as a basic stand for the stall.

If you need a longer section for the stand than the table provides, and you're using a card table or small tables, arrange them in a row to make a rectangular configuration. Push the tables together closely, to avoid large gaps. If you need a really long configuration to fill a classroom or similar, consider an L-shape or U-shape consisting of many little desks (and lots of covers; see next).;
, If the tablecloth won't reach completely, cover with two, overlapping the tablecloths neatly. Clean, old sheets are another excellent option.

Use tablecloth clips or binder clips if the stand is outdoors and it's windy. This will help to keep the cloth in place.

, If the place you're holding the bake sale already has trestles, use one of theirs. If not, you will need to either hire or buy one. As these can be quite pricey to buy new, hiring is a better option, or look for a used one through auction sites, well before the event., Check that they are firmly clicked in place. Some tables may have printed instructions on the underside of the tabletop, to help you work out how to put the legs in place properly., Alternatively, cover with large sheets of butcher paper or similar large white paper.

If using paper, tape it down. It's also a good idea to have spare sheets, in case it rips and needs replacing.
If outdoors, use tablecloth clips to keep a tablecloth or sheet in place.

, Some of the following options might work to repurpose as a bake sale stand:

The most useful furniture would be an old cabinet base or a buffet/sideboard. Consider painting it or covering it with lovely fabric.
A smaller bookcase could be turned on its side, with a wide piece of plywood balanced over the top of the tipped-over bookcase. Line the plywood with a thin blanket, then cover with a sheet or tablecloth.
Turn children's old furniture into a stand. Children's furniture that no longer has any use might be perfect for a bake sales stand, such as using a toy box, a child's bookshelf, storage holder furniture, etc. If the item comes with drawers, boxes, etc., you might be able to make use of these creatively, to hold produce, non-food items, etc. or they could hold your spare baked goods ready to put out when gaps appear.
Push two old bedside tables together, put a sheet of plywood over the top and cover with an old blanket. Then place a sheet or tablecloth over the top.

, This can be done in various ways, depending on your skills:

Find two pole-style pieces of wood of the same height, higher than an average height adult standing next to them. Affix each pole to a square wood base. Use support wood chocks to keep the poles sturdily in place (nail or glue into place from the base leaning up onto the pole). Measure the distance of the stand and use this to determine the length of your bake stand sign. Cut the sign from plywood/scrap wood or very strong cardboard to this length, and a width of your preference. Affix this to each pole, the poles' width apart being the same as the stand. Use nails or wood glue to affix. Paint ""Bake Sale"" or such on the sign. To use, place the completed sign standing behind the bake stall.
Use the same method for making the pole stands as in the previous suggestion. However, instead of adding a wooden sign, add a flag bunting/garland. The bunting can be sewn with the words ""Bake Sale"" quilted on, or marked on with fabric pen.

, If your bake sale stand is outdoors and it's sunny, use a large outdoor umbrella to cover the baked goods and stop them from melting. If possible, situate some of the stall under the shade of a tree, building or other object, to give your stall the most shade possible.

If it is likely to be windy, ensure that the stand is placed near a form of wind break, such as a wall, a fence, or even your car if need be. Flying cakes and cookies don't sell well and tend to upset those who made the effort to bake them.

, Place the baked goods on disposable plates, trays, or inside cake boxes. Always cover food with plastic food wrap, cellophane bags or other food-suitable coverings. This helps to keep the food fresh and safe from bugs, dust, sneezes, etc.

If selling a large amount of cakes, such as for a school or charity fundraiser, purchase bulk quantities of things such as cake boxes and cellophane bags. This will keep down the costs, and they can be distributed to parents or other bakers prior to the sale, with a request to place all items that they bake inside of these, with ingredients labels, to make things easier on those running the bake sale.

, You can either hang signs over the front of the table or place them on the table, showing prices and perhaps the name of your charity, fundraising group, etc. Always firmly tape any signs that have been attached to the tablecloth or paper, as they'll blow away or get knocked easily if left unattached.

Be aware that if there are lots of people coming to the bake sale, labels that are hanging from the front will be blocked by line-ups or milling customers; messages you want to get across need to be placed at eye level (on a wall, pole, backdrop, etc. behind you).

, Keep like with like, so that customers aren't forced to go back and forth across the stall to find what they like. Encourage browsing by category:

Keep large cakes together, and cupcakes together
Keep cookies and slices together
Keep buns and pastries together
Keep savory pies together; have sweet pies alongside;
Keep brownies, treats and candies together. (And so forth.)

, If your bake sale stand is a long, large one, it can be a good idea to make an area for treats that attract children at one end of the stand. This allows children to hang around that end of the stand without getting lost amid the adult customers. It also makes it easier to keep an eye out for the kids; give one salesperson the role of caring for that end of the stand., Be realistic about the space availability of your stand. If it is smaller than the amount of items you and others have baked, have a separate area behind the stand for keeping the items that you'll put out as space becomes available. This is especially important for school and charity fundraisers, where constant refreshing of the stand's display will keep customers interested and may even result in repeat customers, if they notice new food being placed out after purchase."

String together all the letters.",How to Make a Salt Dough Name Banner," You will need flour, water, and salt for the dough, as well as food coloring, paint, or natural coloring like cinnamon if you want the dough to be colored. You will also need a large mixing bowl and spoon, as well as any decorative add-ons like beads, glitter, or acrylic paint.;
, Mix together two cups of flour and one cup of salt, and then add 3/4 cup of lukewarm water.If you want to color the dough, add a few drops of food coloring or paint, or use a spice or other food item with a strong color like cinnamon, chocolate, or curry powder, ground coffee, or beetroot juice.
Add glitter for a little extra pizazz.

, Place it on a hard, flat, non-stick surface like a cutting board or silicon rolling sheet on your table. Knead the dough using the palm of your hand until it has a smooth, uniform consistency. As you're kneading, add flour if the dough is too sticky and water if it's too dry.

, For example, if your name is Ian, that's three letters, so divide the dough into three pieces.

, Use one piece of dough for each letter. To shape the dough, you can roll it out with a rolling pin and cut it into the appropriate letter. Or try rolling it into a snake and shaping the snake into the letter. This is particularly good for rounded letters like O, although it will work for any letter. If you want, you can then flatten the dough using your palm or a rolling pin. Try to make all the letters the same thickness so that they bake evenly.

, These holes should be about 1/8"" to 1/4"" in diameter so that they won't close up as the clay dries. Use a wooden chopstick, toothpick, skewer, or anything else that seem suitable to poke the holes. You can even insert a bead with a large hole into the dough and clean all the dough out of the center so that the bead rings the hole.

, Use beads and glitter to decorate the letters, or draw, trace, or press patterns into the dough for a more subtle look. Don't paint just yet, though - that will happen once the letters dry.

, Loosely cover them with tin foil if you want. Keep a close eye on the letters as they bake, and turn down the heat if they start to brown. Bake until they are dry all the way through; they should sound hollow when you tap them.


Once you remove the letters from the oven, let them dry completely before you proceed.

, Use acrylic paint for the best results, and paint them with whatever colors and designs strike your fancy. Add more beads, stickers, foam shapes, ribbon or bows, or anything else you like to finish off the letters.


Once again, allow the letters to dry thoroughly before proceeding.

, Use a long piece of twine or strong ribbon to do this. Pull the ribbon through each hole you poked in the top of each letter. Arrange the letters in the appropriate order on the string so that when you stretch the string out horizontally or hang it on the wall, the letters spell your name.


Tie knots on either side of each letter, or tie small loops around each hole the string runs through, in order to secure the letters on the string so that they don't slide left or right. Make sure to space the letters out appropriately before you do this.

Add the yeast mixture to the other ingredients and knead, rise, and bake as directed.;
, This fast method is suitable for yeast breads apart from those that will sit overnight or soured loaves. It can only be used with granulated freeze-dried yeast.

Place the granulated dried yeast into the flour with all other ingredients, including the liquid, at the same time.
Ensure that the temperature of the liquid is a little higher, as this will help to both dissolve the yeast and distribute it through the dough.

, This method is useful for giving the dough a stronger, more sour flavor. It works as follows:

Dissolve the yeast in a little warm water.
Add enough flour to it to make a sponge.
Leave the yeast sponge to prove over several hours. It can even be left overnight.
Add the other ingredients and knead the dough. Leave to rise as usual.

",How to Use Children's Literature and Cooking Activities to Teach Early Literacy Skills,"


The story could inspire the cooking activity. For instance, the poem ""Chicken Soup With Rice"" by Maurice Sendak is a great opportunity to make chicken soup with rice.
Or, the desired cooking activity could guide your story selection. For example, if you want to make bread, the book ""Bread, Bread, Bread"" by Ann Morris is a great introduction to bread around the world.
As always when selecting the book, be sure it is appropriate for your audience's development level. Be sure to read the book first so you are familiar with it, so you are confident.
Understand firmly the connection. For instance, in ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"" by Bill Martin, Jr. and John Archambault, the action centers around a coconut tree. It also focuses on the alphabet.
Create or research food activities that center around the literature. In the above example, consider: dissecting a coconut, coconut pudding, alphabet soup, sugar and coconut sprinkled alphabet cookies, and more.;
,


Be sure to know if there are any children with allergies, especially: peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, dairy, wheat, and shellfish.
Check for other medical concerns: diabetes, lactose intolerance, sensitivity to food dyes, obesity, and so on.
Check for cultural restrictions: Does any child keep kosher? Eat halal food only? Eat vegan?
Some foods should be prepared with care for young children. For instance, children under age one should not eat honey. Hot dogs should be sliced horizontally for young children to avoid choking.

, Depending on what you have available, you may need to modify your plans.


What kitchen cooking space do you have? Do you have an oven for making bread? Can a parent bring in an electric griddle for pancakes? Can you use a crock-pot for applesauce?
How long will the activity take? A 1-hour library story time will not have the time to make a cake, cool it, and frost it. But a full-day daycare program will.
How long will preparation and clean-up take? Be mindful of the time it takes to set up and clean up after the food is made.
How many adults will be available? Will you be doing this alone, or with another staff member or parent?
Do you have the ingredients? Some programs will have plenty of funds for cooking, while others may have nothing budgeted. (In which case, you may need to ask for donations).
Do you have parents willing to help out? Many people love to cook, and will gladly share their expertise with children. Parents can lend equipment like skillets, crock-pots, cookie cutters, bread makers, blenders, and the like. If you are especially lucky, perhaps the owner of a restaurant, bakery or farm can offer a field trip.
Make an ingredient list. You do not want to find yourself out of baking powder on the day of the activity. Have everything assembled in your cooking area before you begin the activity.

,


Keep it simple. If in doubt, choose the straightforward food activity over one that takes a lot of ingredients, time, or skill. Applesauce is often a better choice than apple pie, for instance. (Although both are good.)
Never do a recipe with a group of children you have not done yourself before! If in doubt, do a test batch yourself before attempting it with groups of children. Sometimes, directions from the internet, books, and magazines turn out to be faulty or badly written.
Safety issues are extremely important. Discuss this with children ahead of time. Cooking is a potentially hazardous activity, and must be treated as such. Some tasks are ""adults only"", such as using the oven or using a sharp knife. Some impulsive children may have great difficulty with this.
Understand developmentally appropriate tasks for children to do. It is no fun for children to cook if you do all the work! What a toddler can do will be less than a first grader. Also, some children may have difficulty with fine motor skills, or coordination, so be aware of these students.

, Younger kids can use pictures, while older children can sometimes read words. The children can read and follow the recipe by ""reading"" the picture cards. Children learn to grasp pre-literacy skills in this way.

, Cooking can be a very hazardous activity, and children need to know safety rules to reduce risk.


Children must wash their hands every time. No exceptions. Be sure that they also rinse completely, as they sometimes forget.
Children should not use sharp knives. However, you can allow then to use a relatively dull butter knife and see what amazing things there are that they can accomplish with them.
Some things are adult or teacher-only. This includes things like using the oven, using the cook stove, or any potentially dangerous activity (safety).

,, What do you think happened when...? (This encourages problem solving and critical thinking skills.)

, (cooperation and taking turns)

, Alternatively, divide the food. Many children can each knead a bit of dough, cut and decorate a few cookies, or create their own miniature pizzas.

Write letters to each other and practice writing the address on the envelopes before ""sending"" them. Make it even more fun by including other addresses: Grandma, their school, maybe even Santa!;
, Kids love talking about themselves. Teach them one piece (e.g. the state) at a time, and then ask them about it sporadically throughout the next couple of days. Allow them to proudly tell you, ""I live in _____!""

, Anything put to music becomes a fun activity for children of this age. If you have difficulty thinking up a melody, use the classic ""Jenny (867-5309)"" tune - with a little tweaking, it works for any number.

, Actually being able to dial the number themselves can be very exciting for them. If you're home with them, have them call and leave a message. This can become a very fun activity - punching in the correct numbers becomes a ""code"" to leave a funny message.

Notice where the hours hand is on this example.,
Notice where the minutes hand is on this example.,
Notice where the hours and minutes hands are on this example.",How to Tell Time," On this clock, you'll notice a lot of numbers and three arrows, also called hands.


One hand is very thin and moves very fast. It's called the seconds hand. Every time it moves, a second has gone by.
Another hand is thick and long like the seconds hand. It's called the minutes hand. Every time it moves one little tick, a minute has gone by. Every 60 times it moves a whole step, an hour has gone by.
The last hand is thick, too, but smaller than the minutes hand. It's called the hours hand. Every time it moves one big tick, an hour has gone by. Every 24 times it moves a whole step, a day has gone by.;
, Seconds, minutes, and hours are all measures of the same thing: time. They're not the same thing, but they measure the same thing.


Every 60 seconds counts as one minute. 60 seconds, or 1 minute, is the time it takes the seconds hand to move from the number 12 all the way back again to 12.
Every 60 minutes counts as one hour. 60 minutes, or 1 hour, is the time it takes the minutes hand to move from the number 12 all the way back again to 12.
Every 24 hours counts as one day. 24 hours, or one day, is the time it takes the hours hand to move from the number 12 all the way back again to 12, and then around one more time.

, You'll notice that there are a lot of numbers laid out around the clock. They are laid out in ascending order, which means they get bigger as they move around the circle of the clock. There are numbers going up from 1 all the way to 12.

, We call this direction ""clockwise."" It goes in the order of the numbers, like the clock was counting up from 1 to 12. The hands on the clock always travel this direction when they are working properly.

, This will tell us the hour of the day. The hours hand always points at the big numbers on the clock.

, When it's pointed between two numbers, the hour of the day is always the lower number.


So if the hours hand is pointed between 5 and 6 on the clock, it's 5-something, because 5 is the lower number.

, For example, if the small, thick hand is pointed directly at the number 9, it's exactly 9 o'clock.

, When the minutes hand hits 12, the next hour starts.

, This will tell us the minute of the day. Notice the little ticks in between the big numbers. These represent minutes, although each big number also one minute, as well as the hour. Tell how many minutes there are by counting each little tick as one minute, starting from the number 12.

, When the minutes hand is pointing at a big number on the clock, use multiples of five to tell how many minutes there are.


For example, if the minutes hand is pointing directly at 3, you multiply 3 by 5 in order to 15. ""15"" is how many minutes that have passed in the current hour.

, When the minutes hand is pointed in between a big number on the clock, find the nearest big number that it has passed, multiply that number by 5, and add that product to however many little ticks are in between. There are four small ticks in between each big number.


For example, if the minutes hand is pointed right in between the 2 and the 3, go first to the 2. Use the 2 to multiply 5, which gives us 10. Then, count out the number of ticks it takes to get from 10 to where the minutes hand is pointed: it takes two, meaning

, When the hours hand is pointed exactly at a big number on the clock, the minutes hand will always be pointed directly at 12.


This is because the hour changed, so the minutes hand is starting over again. If the hours hand is pointed directly at 5 and the minutes clock is pointed directly at 12, that means it's 5 o'clock exactly.

, The hours hand is pointed directly at the number 6, which means it's exactly 6 o'clock. If the hours hand is pointed exactly at 6, that means that the minutes hand must be pointed directly at 12.

, The minutes hand is 2 ticks beyond the 9. So how do we figure out how many minutes there are in this hour?


First, we multiply 9 by 5 to get 45. Then we add another 2 ticks to 45, giving us 47. We have 47 minutes in the hour.

, The hours hand is in between 11 and 12, while the minutes hand is 4 ticks beyond the 3. How do we figure out the time?


First, let's tell the hour of the day. Because the hours hand is between 11 and 12, we pick the lower number. This means it's 11-something o'clock. Let's do the minutes next. We need to multiply 3 by 5. This gives us 15. Now we need to add the 4 ticks to 15 which gives us 19. There are 19 minutes in the hour, and the hour is 11. That means the time is 11:19.

Get the right height.,
Think about how much space you'll need.,
Place it near the oven.,
Try it in a less-used space.,
Think about the surface.,
Don't forget storage.,
Try a movable cart.",How to Create a Baking Station in Your Kitchen1," For a baking station, having the work area below counter height can be helpful, as it can help you get the right leverage when rolling and cutting baked goods. If you can't have a lower work area, try adding a small, sturdy step stool to the area, so you can raise yourself higher.Generally, a good height is between 30 inches and 36 inches from the floor, though it may differ depending on how tall you are.;
, When you're thinking about a baking area, get out all your baking supplies. You can't design a space until you know exactly how much space you'll need to store everything. Having the visual can help you determine the size of your baking station., Because baked goods are cooked in the oven, it's best to put your baking station near the oven if possible. Locating it near the oven will make it easier to transfer the goods before and after they're baked, reducing the chance of mishap., Another option is to put your baking area out of the way, so that it doesn't create a mess in the main part of your kitchen. For instance, some people with a large pantry set up a baking area in there, so that it's out of the way., A flat, marble area makes an ideal place to roll pastry. Even if you don't have marble counter tops, consider adding a marble area for your baked goods. If that option is too expensive, consider adding other options, such as a mat designed for rolling out baked goods.Marble is a good choice because it is a hard surface, good for rolling. It's also very cleanable, and it stays cool, which is good for working with doughs., You obviously need counter space for a baking area, but storage area is just as important. You're going to need space to store away your baking tools. While some things, such as ingredient canisters, can stay on the counter, you don't want everything out on the counter. Dedicate some cabinet space to your baking station.

, One option to keep everything together where you need it is to use a small rolling cart with storage. You can move it easily around the kitchen, so you can have it wherever you need it. That way, you won't need to gather and move your supplies one by one.This type of cart can be tucked out of the way when you're not using it, making it convenient.

Discover letters in your surroundings wherever you go.",How to Teach Your Child to Recognize the Letters of the Alphabet," Reading readiness starts at home, so have a blast exploring stories with your little one. It’s also a great bonding experience for the whole family.


Use different voices for characters and animals, make your own sound effects, and make exaggerated expressions when you’re reading a story together.End the day by reading together. After bath time and getting PJs on, make it a habit let your child pick out a few books and snuggle on the couch together while you read. You can go back to favorites again and again and rotate in new stories.
Let your child make up their own stories to go along with pictures in a book they like. It doesn’t matter if it’s the real story, just let them be creative and use their imagination.;
, A designated corner with a bean bag chair or a child-sized table can become a special nook for relaxing and exploring.


Purchase children’s books and magazines and arrange them on a shelf or in bins.
If you are on a budget, use your public library or scour second-hand sales and thrift stores for inexpensive books. Baby shower gifts, swaps, and hand-me-downs from friends whose kids have grown out of books are also great.Provide writing tools like pencils, markers, crayons, and different types of paper for your child to experiment with. , Kids will be excited to play with letters in different textures and sizes.


Purchase sets of foam and magnetic letters, letter cards, and letter blocks and have them easily accessible for your child to touch, move around, sort, and arrange. Make letters yourself out of popsicle sticks, sandpaper, Styrofoam, or other craft supplies if you’re on a budget., Make fun activities where you point out individual letters and say the letter names part of your daily routine and play time with your child.


Toss two or three foam letters at a time into the tub with your child at bath time. While your child plays in the bath, call out each letter by name. For example, for the letter B say: ""The B is tickling your toes...Oh, the B is swimming around you...Give Mommy the B."" Do this activity, using different letters each time, until your child has learned all of the letters of the alphabet and can call them by name.
Make towers, houses, and other structures with alphabet blocks, pointing out the letters on the blocks and calling them by name. Arrange magnetic letters on the refrigerator or white board. Allow your child to experiment with them, putting them in alphabetical order, or sing the alphabet song together and point to each letter as you say its name. , Demonstrate first then help your child make their own letter creations.


Make letters out of clay, fabric, pipe cleaners, or yarn.Use shaving cream, salt, sugar, or finger paint to draw letters., Playing is one of the ways young children learn best, and it’s also great entertainment.


Draw parts of a letter one by one and let your child try to guess what letter you are making.Call out letter names and have your child try to make the shape with their body.Sing the traditional alphabet song together or look up alternate songs online.

,


Have your child put letter cards in alphabetical order or turn them upside down and say the names of the letters together as you turn each one over.Use letter cards for games like matching and memory., Use street signs, billboards, magazines, clothing, or anything with words on it.


Play a game of “I Spy” and find letters and objects that begin with letter sounds your child knows.Point out stop signs, exit signs, golden arches, and other familiar signs and talk about what they mean. Kids can learn to “read” the meanings of these objects before they can actually read the words. "

Add utensils.,
Have your mixing and measuring tools ready.,
Keep the baking pans in this area.,
Include a power strip.,
Have your appliances on hand.",How to Create a Baking Station in Your Kitchen2," If you're creating a baking area, you want to have utensils that are dedicated to baking that stay in this area. That way, you're not wasting time digging them out every time you want to bake. You'll need things like spoons for stirring, spatulas for removing cookies, and rolling pins for rolling out dough.Don't forget a few sharp knives, too, as well as extras like cookie and biscuit cutters.

, You'll also need items like mixing bowls, measuring cups, and measuring spoons. It can be handy to have some small bowls on hand to hold ingredients before you add them to the dough.

, While you may be tempted to keep all the pans in your kitchen in one place, consider keeping your main baking pans and pie pans in your baking area. That way, you can reach up or down and grab what you need. You should also have cooling racks in this area., Baking often requires the use of electric gadgets, gadgets that need to be plugged in. For instance, you may want to use a stand mixer or a food processor while baking. Adding a power strip will give you the extra plugs you'll need., Small appliances, such as hand mixers, are easy to put away. Large appliances, such as stand mixers and food processors, pose a bit more of a challenge, as they can be heavy and cumbersome to move. Some kitchens use sliding floors in cabinets, making it easy to slide them away when not in use. Others have lifts that extend from lower cabinets. Alternatively, you could use a pretty cloth cover or get a designer stand mixer and leave it on full display if you have the counter space."
"
Take stock of what you'll need.,
Get canisters to organize your common ingredients.,
Keep it organized.,
Make it an exclusive area for baking ingredients.,
Divide ingredients if necessary.",How to Create a Baking Station in Your Kitchen3," Make a list of your most-used recipes, and then think about the ingredients you need for those recipes. Get out your baking supplies, and check for what you already have. You probably already have flour, sugar, and vanilla, but you may not have ingredients like cornmeal, cornstarch, yeast, brown sugar, and corn syrup, which are common in some recipes., You've probably seen a line-up of canisters to hold common ingredients. You don't have to get a pretty matching set, but having a canister for each ingredient is important. You'll need one for flour, one for each type of sugar you use, and smaller containers for things like spices, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.Make sure each container is labeled so you don't have to open it to figure out what it is.

, If your baking station storage is a jumble of bottles and canisters, you'll never know what you have on hand and what you need to get. That's how you end up with several bags of brown sugar, for instance. Have a place and container for every ingredient you use, and organize them by how you use them., If you start adding in other items, such as random household items or other kitchen items, everything will be cluttered, and you won't be able to find what you need. Make sure your baking station is just for baking items, even if it's only a small area., That is, if you use certain items in both baking and cooking, consider having them in both areas. That holds true for ingredients like cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, but it's also true for items like stirring spoons and whisks."

Determine which case study type, design or style is most suitable to your intended audience.,
Determine the topic of your case study.,
Search for case studies that have been published on the same or similar subject matter.",How to Write a Case Study1," Corporations may choose illustrative case study method to show what has been done for a client; schools, educators and students may select cumulative or critical case study method and legal teams may demonstrate exploratory (investigative) case study method as a way to provide factual evidence.


Whatever case study method you're employing, your purpose is to thoroughly analyze a situation (or ""case"") which could reveal factors or information otherwise ignored or unknown. These can be written about companies, whole countries, or even individuals. What's more, these can be written on more abstract things, like programs or practices. Really, if you can dream it, you can write a case study about it.;
, Once you've picked your angle, you need to determine what your research will be about and where it will take place (your case site). What have you talked about in class? Have you caught yourself coming up with questions during your reading?


Start your research at the library and/or on the Internet to begin delving into a specific problem. Once you've narrowed down your search to a specific problem, find as much about it as you can from a variety of different sources. Look up information in books, journals, DVDs, websites, magazines, newspapers, etc. As you go through each one, take adequate notes so you can find the info later on!, Talk to your professors, go to the library, surf the web until your bum falls asleep. You don't want to replicate the research that has already been done.


Find out what has been written before, and read the important articles about your case's situation . When you do this, you may find there is an existing problem that needs solution, or you may find that you have to come up with an interesting idea that might or might not work in your case situation.
Review sample case studies that are similar in style and scope to get an idea of composition and format, too.

"
"
Select participants that you will interview for inclusion in your case study.,
Draft a list of interview questions and decide upon how you will conduct your study.,
Set up interviews with subject matter experts (account managers in a corporation, clients and customers using applicable tools and services, etc.).",How to Write a Case Study2," Experts in a particular field of study or customers that have implemented a tool or service that is the subject of the study will provide the best information.


Find knowledgeable people to interview. They don't necessarily have to be on your site, but they must be, actively or in the past, directly involved.
Determine whether you will interview an individual or group of individuals to serve as examples in your case study. It may be beneficial for participants to gather as a group and provide insight collectively. If the study focuses on personal subject matter or medical issues, it may be better to conduct personal interviews.
Gather as much information as possible about your subjects to ensure that you develop interviews and activities that will result in obtaining the most advantageous information to your study.

, This could be via in-person group interviews and activities, personal interviews, or phone interviews. Sometimes, email is an option.


When you are interviewing people, ask them questions that will help you understand their opinions. I.e., How do you feel about the situation? What can you tell me about how the site (or the situation) developed? What do you think should be different, if anything? You also need to ask questions that will give you facts that might not be available from an article--make your work different and purposeful.

,


Make sure all your informants are aware of what you're doing. They need to be fully informed (and signing waivers in certain cases) and your questions need to be appropriate and not controversial.

"
"
Conduct interviews.,
Collect and analyze all applicable data, including documents, archival records, observations and artifacts.,
Formulate the problem in one or two sentences.",How to Write a Case Study3," Ask the same or similar questions of all subjects involved to ensure that you get different perspectives on a similar subject or service.


When you ask a question that doesn't let someone answer with a ""yes"" or a ""no"" you usually get more information. What you are trying to do is get the person to tell you whatever it is that he or she knows and thinks --even though you don't always know just what that is going to be before you ask the question. Keep your questions open-ended.
Request data and materials from subjects as applicable to add credibility to your findings and future presentations of your case study. Clients can provide statistics about usage of a new tool or product and participants can provide photos and quotes that show evidence of findings that may support the case.

, Organize all of your data in the same place to ensure easy access to information and materials while writing the case study.


You can't include it all. So, you need to think about how to sort through it, take out the excess, and arrange it so that the situation at the case site will be understandable to your readers. Before you can do this, you have to put all the information together where you can see it and analyze what is going on.

, As you go through your data, think about how you can put what you've found into a thesis-like statement. What patterns have your subjects brought to light?


This will allow you to concentrate on what material is the most important. You're bound to receive information from participants that should be included, but solely on the periphery. Organize your material to mirror this.

"
"
Develop and write your case study using the data collected throughout the research, interviewing and analysis processes.,
Add references and appendices (if any).,
Make additions and deletions.,
Edit and proofread your work.",How to Write a Case Study4," Include at least four sections in your case study: an introduction, background information explaining why the case study was created, presentation of findings and a conclusion which clearly presents all of the data and references.


The introduction should very clearly set the stage. In a detective story, the crime happens right at the beginning and the detective has to put together the information to solve it for the rest of the story. In a case, you can start by raising a question. You could quote someone you interviewed.
Make sure to include background information on your study site, why your interviewees are a good sample, and what makes your problem pressing to give your audience a panoramic view of the issue. After you've clearly stated the problem at hand, of course.Include photos or a video if it would benefit your work to be persuasive and personalized.
After the reader has all the knowledge needed to understand the problem, present your data. Include customer quotes and data (percentages, awards and findings) if possible to add a personal touch and more credibility to the case presented. Describe for the reader what you learned in your interviews about the problem at this site, how it developed, what solutions have already been proposed and/or tried, and feelings and thoughts of those working or visiting there. You may have to do calculations or extra research yourself to back up any claims.
At the end of your analysis, you should offer possible solutions, but don't worry about solving the case itself. You may find referring to some interviewees' statements will do the alluding for you. Let the reader leave with a full grasp of the problem, but trying to come up with their own desire to change it.Feel free to leave the reader with a question, forcing them to think for themselves. If you have written a good case, they will have enough information to understand the situation and have a lively class discussion.

, Just like you would in any other paper, reference your sources. That's why you got credible ones in the first place. And if you have any information that relates to the study but would have interrupted the flow of the body, include it now.


You may have terms that would be hard for other cultures to understand. If this is the case, include it in the appendix or in a Note for the Instructor.

, As your work is forming, you'll notice that it may morph into an object you didn't otherwise expect. If it does so, make additions and deletions as needed. You may find that information you once thought pertinent is no longer. Or vice versa.


Go over your study section by section, but also as a whole. Each data point needs to fit into both it's place and the entirety of the work. If you can't find an appropriate place for something, stick it in the appendix.

, Now that your paper is formulated, look for minute revisions. As always, correct any grammar, spelling and punctuation errors, but also keep an eye out for flow and transition. Is everything placed and worded as efficiently as possible?


Have someone else proofread, too. Your mind may have become oblivious to the errors it has seen 100 times. Another set of eyes may also notice content that has been left open-ended or is otherwise confusing.

Write an opening sentence for your conclusion.,
Summarize your strongest points.,
Leave the reader with a lasting impression.,
Start your conclusion by reiterating your interest.,
Keep the body of your conclusion short and sweet.,
End your conclusion with salutations and contact information.",How to Write a Conclusion," Remember, you aren’t trying to include new evidence on your main idea. Avoid writing things like “In conclusion,” or “To conclude,” while these phrases work nicely in oral presentations, your reader can see that they are near the end of your paper and doesn't need you to tell them.


Try using a phrase that draws strength from your evidence and examples, like, “The evidence above shows that..” or “Ultimately..”
Restate your thesis, argument, or main idea. Remember, this is your last chance to reach your reader.Bring your essay full circle and hit your main point one last time.
Avoid restating your thesis word-for-word. Your reader may have already read your thesis more than once, and doesn’t need to see the exact same phrase another time. Reword your thesis in a new and creative way.

, Your conclusion isn’t meant to just be a condensed version of your paper, but you do want to drive your points home.Remember that your reader has already gotten this information, so you don’t need to bore them by repeating exactly what you wrote before in a shorter version. Instead try writing things like:


For the reasons mentioned, (your thesis).
Because of (evidence you mentioned earlier), it is clear that (your thesis).
As one can see, the above examples (list examples here) demonstrate that (your thesis).

, Take the time to ask the reader a provocative question that keeps your paper on their mind well after they have finished reading it. You have made your point, now you need to tell your reader why they should care about what you have expressed. You can achieve this in several ways:


Call from some kind of action. If you are writing a paper about how difficult it is to get into a four year university, suggest a way for the reader to fight for your cause.
End with a warning. If you are writing a paper about pollution, give an estimate on the effects of continued pollution in the coming years.
Evoke an image. If you are writing a literary paper about a novel you’ve been assigned for class, end your paper with a reference to a scene in the book that was significant and paint a picture with sensory details.
Universalize. Compare your argument or your main idea to something your reader can relate to. Strive to make a connection.
Suggest results. Express what changes would occur if your ideas were supported.
Include a quote. If you are writing a literary paper, choose a powerful quote from your text that supports your thesis. If your paper is not literary, choose a powerful quote from any source that you can relate to your topic.

, Your interest in the position that is available is essentially your thesis statement. Your cover letter is a tool for selling yourself, and your conclusion should leave your prospective employer with a sense that you are determined and professional. Say things like:


I look forward to speaking with you regarding a position at your company / (name of the company).
I am eager to talk with you about contributions I can make to your company.
I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and discuss how I can be a vital member of your team.

, Cover letters generally shouldn’t exceed one page in length so keep your conclusion short (2 or 3 sentences). Be direct with the little space you have and ask for an interview. Say things like:


If you would like to schedule an interview or otherwise discuss my interest in this position, please don’t hesitate to contact me at any time.
I will call you in a few days to discuss an interview.
If you have any questions regarding my application, please contact me at any time.

, Take the time to express how thankful you are for your prospective employer taking the time to read your cover letter. Say things like:


I look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Your consideration is greatly appreciated.

Write a title.,
Write a small abstract.,
Write your introduction.,
Write your method.,
Write your discussion.,
Always include a reference section.,
Include appendices.",How to Write a Psychology Lab Report," This title must concisely explain what the study is about. As a general rule, include the variables you were manipulating.;
, This should contain information about the aims of the study and why it was conducted, what was done and how, what you found and what the results showed (but don’t include variables here) and what conclusions can be drawn.


Remember not to include the abstract in your reports, but centre it and put it in italics, to set it apart from your introduction.

, Set the scene for your study and give your reader enough background and debate, so that they can fully understand why your current study needed to be conducted.


Discuss other studies in the area and what is already known, whilst explaining the rationale for the current study and how the previous research led you to this particular question.
Explain what you aimed to achieve with your study in a way which is logical from previous research findings. Don’t state your hypotheses, just explain what you expect to find or whether the study is exploratory.

, Your method should be subdivided into: design, participants, materials/ apparatus, procedure and results.



Design: The design needed to explain the experimental design of your study.

So, a within-participants design is when your participants are exposed to all of the experimental conditions.
A between-participants design is when your participants are divided into different groups to be exposed to the experimental conditions.
A mixed design uses both.
You should also state each independent variable and the different levels of that variable if there are any. Also state what was measured (i.e. your dependent variable(s)). A more experienced researcher can avoid using terms such as “independent variable” and “dependent variable.” Outlined controls used but remember not to mention your method of analysis yet.



Participants: In the participants section, state the number of participants who took part in the study. Numbers from one to nine should be written in words but any numbers above nine can be expressed in numerals. However, if you begin a sentence with a number, it should be expressed in words whatever the number.

Mention how many males and females took part and give the mean age(s) and age range of your participant group(s). If you did not collect this data you can say that age and gender was not noted.
If you have more than one experimental group, then you should say how many participants were in each condition.
Mention how the participants were recruited (e.g. opportunity sample) and how consent was given (e.g. they were told that by submitting a questionnaire it was a form of consent).



Materials: In the Materials section, describe all the equipment that was used in your study including stimuli. To write this concisely, tell the reader what they would need to replicate the experiment and nothing more. Questionnaires and other paper material should be appropriately referenced.

It should be written in full sentences, not bullet points.
Example materials would be computers and software, questionnaires, stimuli (e.g. if words/ images are used give a reference to the appendices where the reader can learn more about them), stopwatches, items/ furniture, coding/ response sheet and for observations you should clearly define your behaviours.
Don’t mention analysis here or state anything too obvious. For example, you don’t need to say participants used pens to complete a questionnaire.



Procedure: In the procedure section you should explain what was done, when and to whom. Examples are: where the study took place, whether it was conducted individually or in groups, what instructions were given to the participants, what the participants were asked to do (in chronological order), whether there was a time limit, whether there were any practice trials and whether the study was conducted in silence.

Results: In the results section, you can finally explain what was done with the data you collected and what the number you have calculated mean.

First describe your raw data, the data you originally tested.
Then give the reader a reference to the appendix where they can read more about it. Also include a means and standard deviation table for each group or condition.
Give these tables an appropriate and descriptive title.
Report the values consistently; most values are reported to two decimal places so make sure you stick to that throughout your report.
Report the types of analysis that was conducted (e.g. an independent t-test, a one- way ANOVA). You can also say if it was a one- tailed or two- tailed test.
Underneath these analyses, report the test statistic (e.g. t(17)- 3.90, p= 0.44) and whether the p value was significant or not. You should report exact values unless the result is .000, in which case you should write p<.001. p values have to be written to three decimal places whereas your other values should be written to two decimal places.
Remember, to report the results in full sentences.



, This section needs to discuss the findings of your study in relation to the studies mentioned in your introduction. Consider how your findings fill any gaps in our knowledge and what implications they have for real life.


Begin by briefly reminding the reader what the aim of the study was. Then provide a statement of the results in “real” terms, suitable for a layperson.
Discuss each of your findings in relation to the studies mentioned in your introduction. Do they agree with previous research or suggest something different?
Be careful when discussing non- significant results. If the p value was close to significance, then you can say it suggested a non- significant trend. But it is also sensible to reserve judgement and suggest future research that may clarify this issue.
Inconsistencies between your findings and previous research could be due to a number of factors, such as a different method of measurements, differences in personality of participants and differences in instructions. Think about factors that might have affected one group more than another which could have exaggerated or minimised differences between groups. 
Suggest ideas for how future research in your topic area might be conducted which may add to knowledge. Think about what your results mean for real-life and if they could be applied to everyday situations.
Provide a conclusion; it only needs to be a few sentences and should state simply what can be concluded from the results of your study. Do not include number/ values, tables/ figures and unnecessary criticism of your work. You do not need to say how non-significant results are due to a low number of participants.

, It is helpful to note your references as you go along writing your report. It should only include sources which you have directly consulted whilst writing your lab report and cited in the text of your report. If you have gained knowledge or ideas from a source, you need to mention acknowledge this in the text.

, Each appendices should be numbered and titled. You need to make sure appendices are attached in the order that they appear in the report. Examples include stimuli used, instructions given to participants, questionnaires, response sheets, raw SPSS data files and SPSS output used for statistical analysis.

Get a wireless remote presenter.,
Connect the clicker to your computer.,
Make sure the clicker works properly.",How to Set Up a Wireless Presentation1," This device, commonly called a clicker, resembles a simple mouse and has at least two buttons, forward and back, that move forward or backward in the presentation. Many clickers also have laser pointers that you can use to point out certain aspects of each slide, as well as other embellishments, and most are small enough to comfortably hold in one hand. Choose a clicker you like.


Using this clicker allows you to remove away from the computer, walk around the stage, and engage more closely with the audience, without giving up control of the computer.;
, Wireless presenters always come with a receiver, usually placed in a slot at the back of the clicker, or sometimes hidden behind the battery cover. Take off this receiver and connect it to an available USB port in your computer.


Put in any necessary batteries or other requirements for your clicker.
Once the receiver connects to your computer, it will automatically install the necessary driver. Wait until this process finishes before proceeding.

, It's always a good idea to test your technology well before your presentation so that you can solve any problems that arise without delaying or interrupting the presentation. To check that your clicker works, open any PowerPoint presentation and put it in presentation mode. Click all buttons on the clicker, especially the forward and back buttons, to make sure they work.


Check the user manual for the maximum distance covered by the wireless presenter. When giving the presentation, make sure you do not move beyond that distance.

Turn the WPG and Projector on.,
Connect your computer to the wireless network.,
Connect your computer to the WPG.,
Once the installation process is finished, run the WPG software you have installed.,
Make sure the connection is working.",How to Set Up a Wireless Presentation2," Since most wireless presenters can only move forward and back, they are not suitable for a presentation where the presenter needs to be close to the computer, for example to toggle between files such as the presentation file, a spreadsheet, and a video. In this case, you need a wireless device that will replace the video cable between the computer and projector. This device is called a Wireless Presentation Gateway, or WPG, and it connects to a computer through WiFi.

, You can do this through Wi-Fi Direct or any available Wi-Fi network.

, Then connect it to a projector using a video cable (VGA or HDMI).

,, Find all the necessary software on the installation cd supplied in the WPG box. Follow the installation instructions included here.

, Find the WPG on the list of available wireless network connections on your computer. Select this network and connect your computer to it.

, Let it finish the connection process so that your computer will be fully connected to the WPG.

, On your computer, start any PowerPoint presentation and put it on presentation mode. With some delays, you should be able to see it show up on the projector. Make sure you can switch between slides and screens on your computer. Open all files you'll need for your presentation, and make sure you can quickly switch back and forth between them.

, Then connect it to the network using LAN cable and to a projector using video cable (VGA or HDMI).

, Consult the network admin for this, if necessary.

, At this stage the WPG should display an address (in the form of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) through the projector.

, Turn on Wi-Fi on your computer and choose the available network. Connect to that network, not to the WPG.

, To do this, open a web browser on your computer, and type the address from above into the address bar. Press Enter to make the connection. Once connected, it may start installing the necessary driver and software. If this does not happen, install them using the installation cd supplied in the WPG box. Follow all installation instructions.

, Let it finish up the connection process with the WPG.

, On your computer, start any PowerPoint presentation and put it on presentation mode. With some delays, you should be able to see it through the projector. Try switching back and forth between slides and screens to make sure everything works properly.

Stand tall and confident.,
Arrange your notes and other materials.,
Make eye contact with your audience.,
Skip the usual introduction.,
Jump right in.",How to Start a Presentation1," Take a moment to do a quick posture check before you walk out in front of your audience. If you are slouching, you may seem like you lack confidence. Stand up as straight and tall as you can to ensure a confident posture. Keep standing tall as you walk out in front of your audience and begin your presentation., A well-organized podium will help you avoid any unnecessary fumbling as you speak. Before you start your presentation, you should take a moment to lay out your notes and any other materials that you will need. Before you begin your presentation, distribute any handouts that your audience will need., Making eye contact with your audience during a presentation makes you appear more authoritative and confident. Before you even begin your presentation, you should make eye contact with someone near the back of the room and hold it for a few seconds as you give your introduction. Then, continue to make eye contact with audience members as you present your material., One of the most boring ways to start a presentation is to tell the audience your name. If you want to make sure that they know your name, put it on the first slide of your visual aid or at the top of a handout that you distribute. Just don’t waste your precious opening by saying, “Good morning. My name is…”, It might seem normal to start your presentation with an icebreaker or with some information that does not have anything to do with your presentation. But starting this way will waste time and cause your audience to lose interest. To get your audience engaged, you need to give them what they came for right away. Start your presentation immediately to make sure that you don’t lose your audience’s attention."
"
Tell a story.,
Ask your audience a question.,
Say something shocking.,
Share a meaningful quote.,
Use a visual aid.",How to Start a Presentation2," Stories are one of the best ways to grab your audience’s attention because we all love a good story. Use a relevant story about your personal experience, an anecdote from your research, or an invented analogy to introduce your subject. Keep your story under 90 seconds and then continue with your presentation., Inviting your audience to participate in your presentation from the start will get them interested in your subject. Asking your audience a question is a great way to get to get them involved. You don’t even have to ask a question that they need to answer. You could ask a rhetorical question meant to stimulate their thought processes and prepare them for the rest of your presentation., Sharing a shocking statistic or fact will grab your audience’s attention and get them interested to hear more. By sharing something shocking with your audience, you will get them to care about your topic within the first 15 seconds of your presentation. Just make sure that you are honest. Don’t make up a statistic or bend the truth about something just to have something shocking to share., Kicking off your presentation by sharing a meaningful quote by a famous or respected person will also set your presentation up for success. A well-chosen quote can serve to grab your audience’s attention, build your credibility, and introduce your subject. Just make sure that the quote you choose is relevant to your topic. Don’t choose a quote just because you like it., Showing your audience an interesting image can also get your presentation off to a great start. Select an image that is relevant to your presentation or at least one that has some symbolic value for your topic. Remember that your goal with an image should not be to simply provide a background for your presentation, your images should also help your audience understand your topic. Open with an image that will engage your audience and help them understand the big picture of your topic.Instead of an image, you could use a prop or some other physical object to get your audience interested in your topic.
You might also consider using a video to start your presentation. Just make sure the video is not too long or you may not have enough time to present your material.

Leave hedges out of your presentation.,
Ask questions that matter.,
Lower your voice at the end of sentences.",How to Start a Presentation3," Hedging is when you second guess your authority by saying things like “I think,” “In my opinion,” “seems like” “kind of” and other wishy-washy statements. Hedging makes you seem less authoritative and less confident. Try to leave hedges out of your presentation, especially your opening. Instead, make bold authoritative statements in your introduction to show them that you are trustworthy., Asking questions that you are going to answer right after or that are not really worthy of debate will also lead your audience to believe that you lack authority. It’s okay to ask a meaningful question or two during the opening to your presentation, just don’t overdo it. Keep questions thoughtful and to a minimum., Raising your voice at the end of a question is similar to asking a question. This simple change in pitch may lead your audience to conclude that you are uncertain about the claims that you are making. Instead of raising your voice at the end of your sentences, lower it at the end of your sentences. Lower your voice at the end of a sentence makes you seem more authoritative and confident."

If you are in the front of the room and off to the side, you will be able to pan over and get audience questions at the end.;
, If the program is going to be miked, find the audio technician. He or she will probably be able to tell you if the presenter will be standing at the podium or walking around with a wireless microphone. If you are friendly and you have some cables and adapters, he or she will likely give you a direct feed from the audio board.

, If one goes bad, you'll have a backup.

, If you lose your external audio feed, you can unplug and use your built-in camcorder microphone.

, Ask the audio technician where all the speakers are located.

, If the presenter will be standing at the podium, you can attach your microphone to the existing podium mic with tape (with permission). If the presenter is moving around with a wireless microphone, you could mic one of the amplified speakers. Closer is better. Put it one inch away if you can.


Wired or wireless (requires batteries).
Dynamic or condenser (requires independent power source).
Omnidirectional or cardioid.

, If the audio technician can provide a direct feed from the board, ask for a ""mic level"" feed. Your camera probably has a microphone input. If there is a little switch next to that input that toggles between mic and line, you can then alternatively accept a ""line level"" feed. A line level is slightly amplified. If you send a line level into a jack that is only designed for microphone inputs, you will get lots of distorted sound.

,


Omnidirectional.
Uni-directional.
Cardioid.
Bi-directional.

, Ask the presenter if he or she would mind wearing an extra mic. Don't forget to retrieve it at the end of the presentation!

, Do this after listening to the quality of each source on your headphones. Be ready to switch to your secondary source if your primary source fails. Practice doing that.

Find transparencies.Transparencies are a plastic film that you'll need to find or purchase.,
Clean the printer.,
Load one transparency sheet in the printer.",How to Print Transparencies1," If you're printing for your school or office, they may have transparencies you can use for business or school purposes. However, if not, you'll need to purchase some from a office supply store, teacher supply store, or big box store.


Make sure you find the right kind for your printer. You shouldn't use laser paper in inkjet printers and vice versa.;
, Transparency packages come with a cleaning sheet to help remove stray ink from your printer before you print on the transparency. Because ink tends to smear on transparencies, it's important that you don't try to print on the transparency without cleaning the printer first.All you need to do is take the cleaning sheet out of its protective sleeve. Run it through the printer using your printer's feed button or the software. You shouldn't try to print anything on it.
You can save the sheet for later.

, With specialty paper, you need to be more careful with loading. In other words, you should only load it one sheet at a time. Otherwise, you risk jamming your printer or wasting expensive paper because it doesn't print correctly.In addition, be sure to print on the rough side of the transparency.
If you're not sure how to load your paper so it prints on the rough side, make a mark on a regular sheet of paper and note how you put it in your printer. Print on the page to see how you need to load the transparency so it prints on the correct side."

Examine the image.,
Change the paper type.,
Print the page.,
Use your transparencies cautiously.",How to Print Transparencies2," Before your print, think about the purpose of your image. For example, if you're using a transparency in an overhead projector, you pretty much have free reign in what you print. On the other hand, if you're using the transparency for something like screen printing, you need to make sure the image has a clear outline and it's in black and white, to make it easier to print to the screen., When you go to print, you need to change the type of paper you are printing on. Usually, you'll find it under the printing preferences. Look for something like ""paper quality"" or ""paper type."" Select ""transparencies"" under the type of paper.If your printer doesn't have a transparency setting, use the glossy paper setting.

, Once you have everything set up, you print the page as normal. If you're printing in black and white, you may want to set the printing to its darkest setting. That way, it will show the contrast better, whether you're using the transparency for an overhead projector or for screen printing.All you need to do to print is click ""File"" and ""Print."" Once under ""Print,"" you can change some settings. However, you may need to go into ""Printing Preferences"" to change some settings.

, While you can use these transparencies as you would any other transparency, you should realize that one you print at home won't be quite as durable as a professionally printed one. Be careful of your hand oils, and try not to get the transparency wet, as the ink may run.

"

Save your file.,
Take it to a copy shop.,
Print the file.",How to Print Transparencies3," Usually, you can print from a file at a copy shop. However, you do need to bring that file with you in some form. You can save the file to a jump drive, for example. Alternatively, some stores will let you print from cloud services.To save to a jump drive, insert the jump drive into a USB port on your computer. Find the drive under ""This PC."" Go the ""File"" menu in the document. When you save the file, save it to the jump drive folder.
To save to the cloud, just save it to the folder on your computer for the cloud service you use. Make sure you're connected to the internet so it uploads to the cloud.

, Most copy shops will print a transparency for you for a small fee. Having a copy shop do it can make the process easier. Plus, it saves you from buying a whole box of transparencies if you only need to print a couple., Many places have self-service areas where you can print.However, you may need to talk to someone to print to a transparency, as that is a specialized service, not standard printing. Generally, you pay per page you print.

Wear protective clothing.,

Gauge the effectiveness of your protest.",How to Protest," Protests can function as a way to spread awareness about an issue or put pressure on those in power to make a specific change. What do you hope to accomplish with your protest? Figure out who the audience of your protest will be and plan your strategy from there. You're more likely to get the outcome you want if you take time to set a goal for achieving it.


For example, let's say you want to stage a protest at a local factory farm as a way to spread awareness about how animals are treated there so people will stop buying their products. In this case your audience is the public.
You may have a more specific goal, like trying to prevent an ""adult"" business from moving into your neighborhood. In this case the aim of the protest might be to put pressure on the property owner to lease the building to a different business of which the community approves.
In some cases your goal might be quite large in scale, like if you're protesting a war or a governmental policy. In this case the protest can be used as a tool to show political leaders that their constituents want a change in policy.;
, Find a location that is practical, symbolic or convenient - or all three. The location you choose should be the one that helps you reach your target audience so that the protest is as effective as possible. This could be the sidewalk in front of a business, a public street corner, the courthouse, the capitol building, or a park that has historically been used for protests in your city. Just remember that in order for the protest to be legal, the site you choose must be public.

, Protest at a time when you'll be able to gather the largest crowd and have the greatest impact on your audience. For example, if you're protesting a certain company's business practices you'll want to stage the protest when the CEO is present, which will probably be during business hours. On the other hand, if the goal of your protest is to gather as many people as possible, you might want to protest on a weekend when more people will be available to come.

, Check with your city officials about whether you need to get a permit to protest in the location you choose. Each city has its own laws regarding how many people can protest and where they can gather. Do your homework and get the permits you need so that your protest won't get disbanded before it can gain any traction.


In some cases the permit will set limits on how many people can gather, how much noise you can make, and where protesters can move about. If you disagree with the terms, you can contact an attorney to help you try to get them altered.
Some cities don't issue protest permits. If you're expecting a large crowd to come to the protest, you should alert the police department anyway. If they know what to expect they can help with crowd control and there will be less chance of conflict occurring.

, What actions will best help you achieve your goal? It's important to have an agenda in mind for what will happen once everyone is gathered for the protest. Do some research on other effective protests and come up with a game plan that will help you target your goal. Here are a few ideas:Have community leaders introduce the protest and make speeches on the issue at hand.
Have an emcee who can lead protest chants and songs, and have bands play protest music.
Plan a march from one location to another. This is a classic form of protesting that helps bring widespread attention to a cause.
Implement performance art to help get your point across.Screen an informative video or documentary on the subject you're protesting.
Consider having a sit-in or sleep-in - occupying a space until your demands are met.

, Take this important step to make sure your protest gets as much attention as possible. The aim isn't just to encourage people to show up for the protest, but to capture that attention of the media, too. Pull out all the stops to spread the word starting a few weeks before the protest.


Post details about the protest on all your social media channels.
Make flyers about the protest and put them up around town. Target college campuses and other places where people likely to be interested in protesting your issue congregate.
Call local newspapers and radio stations and ask them to publish information about the protest and promote it on the air.

, Make posters, fliers, visual aids, or pamphlets to help spread your message and communicate your concerns to others. During the protest, you can give out information on what you're protesting to interested parties.


You might want to put the name of the group with which you're affiliated on your protest materials. That way people who are new to the issue will know who to contact to find out more.
Consider coming up with a catchy slogan for the materials, something people can easily memorize and communicate to others.

, You can keep yourself safer at a protest by dressing appropriately for the occasion. Dress for comfort - you might be standing or walking for several hours - and for safety, just in case you get jostled by the crowd or caught in the middle of an escalating conflict.


Wear comfortable tennis shoes.
Wear several layers of thick clothing so you have extra padding on your body.
If you plan to be on the front lines of a protest that could easily escalate into conflict, wear protective eyewear.

, Bring a backpack with a few supplies you might need. Bottled water and food are good to have on hand if the protest is going to last a long time. In addition to these staples, pack the following in your backpack:


A copy of the protest permit
Your identification card
A first aid kit
A bandana soaked in apple cider vinegar, stored in a plastic bag - this is said to help combat the debilitating effects of tear gas long enough for you to get to safety.

, No matter what you're protesting, there will be people who strongly disagree with your point of view. You may even encounter a separate group of protesters protesting the opposite side of the issue. At larger protests, police may be present to control the crowd and make sure things don't get too out of hand. With all these different forces butting heads, be prepared for unpredictable things to happen.


Do research on the group you're protesting with. If you weren't one of the organizers, you should know the history of the group before joining the protest. If the group has every used illegal tactics or caused violence at a protest, you might want to think twice before joining them.
Most protests don't end in violence, but it does happen sometimes. When people feel passionate about an issue, their behavior can be unpredictable. Stay alert and aware of your surroundings when you protest.

, Make sure you know your rights as a protester and are familiar with how to deal with police in case you get stopped by an officer. If you stick to the terms outlined in the protest permit, you shouldn't encounter problems, but you never know what could happen.


Do your best to follow the instructions given by both the protest organizers and the police.
If you believe your free speech rights are being threatened, speak to the protest organizer or call an attorney.
If a police officer asks if he or she can search you, you have the right to decline until a warrant is presented., A protest can be a very effective way to exercise free speech, make your voice heard and bring about change. However, being disrespectful to those against whom you're protesting can undermine your group's reputation and hurt the cause. Your arguments won't be taken as seriously if disrespectful actions are taken. Avoid the following (and encourage fellow protesters to do the same):


Yelling insults at people who disagree with you
Vandalizing public or private property
Spitting or throwing water
Resorting to violence of any kind

, If you're considering civil disobedience as part of your protest strategy, think carefully before taking action. Civil disobedience can be a courageous, nonviolent strategy for driving a point home, but it comes with serious consequences, like getting arrested. It's important to know what you're getting into before you choose to break the law in the name of your cause.

, When all is said and done, reflect back on the protest and decide what worked and what didn't. Think about whether you reached your goal, and whether a different approach would be more effective the next time around. No matter what, be proud that you stayed true to your beliefs and exercised your right to be heard. Even if your protest didn't bring about the change you want to see, speaking up about your cause is a step in the right direction.


It's unlikely that a single protest is going to change everything in one blow. You'll probably need to have follow-up protests. Consider approaching the issue from other angles as well. You could start a letter-writing campaign, lead a boycott, write a blog to voice your opinions, and take other actions to spread awareness and accomplish your goals. Don't give up!

Watch out for discussions, articles, and replies that assume unproven facts.,
Watch for high emotions.,
Watch for alarmist language.,
Beware the infection.,
Assess the spin.,
Do your own research.",How to Spot Spin Doctoring Online," Spin doctoring isn't necessarily undertaken with bad intent or competitiveness. Spin doctoring can also occur where a person believes in something uncritically and promotes it with evangelical fervor, even if they don't have all the facts right or present their case coherently; in such case, passion is driving the ""spin"". In fact, it's often a case of ""don't let the facts get in the way"" of the online discussion or rant.;
, These are bound to evolve over time in terms of complexity and approach but the basics can include:


Highly emotive pleas, clearly angry responses, yelling (CAPITALS), frightened insistence (such as with health scares), and use of lots of exclamation marks (!!!!!) as if the point won't be made without them.
Repeated assertions of the same ""facts"" without giving any back up or references to where they come from.
Increased incoherency. This can be either extremely fine but bamboozling language (think Enron's financial reports), or it can be statements or discussions that are so wound up in knots that they've forgotten what the original assumptions and points were.

, Look for references. Then check that those references are trusted references or bogus ones. If there are none, ask for them.


Cause and effect often get mixed up when you read online testimonials, especially in an area like health. For example, a person might say that their sibling ate oranges daily, died of cancer, and therefore oranges cause cancer. Be really careful when reading this kind of flippant talk.

, When somebody is feeling very excited, upset, or determined to convince others, their emotional state might be reflected in the presentation of their argument or discussion. For example, you may see them writing a lot in capitals, using ample exclamation marks, and using language that suggests conspiracy or huge leaps of the imagination. In this case, you'll definitely want all the facts before trusting what is being said.

, If the author of a document, forum post, or other online written explanation wants to drum up awareness through fear or alarm, the language will often come across as more pompous and ""expert-sounding"" than needed. For example, in the field of health, suddenly everyday language is peppered with scientific names for food, drugs, health reactions, etc. to make it all seem so much more alarming.

, Bad news is contagious, and online it spreads like wildfire because most times, it's a titillating read. Stopping to work out whether or not it's accurate, in context, or even true, would spoil the fun. But when it comes to spin that could potentially harm or upset you, it's not about fun. It's about getting to the real facts and not being overwhelmed or frightened by mistaken or purposefully filtered information.

, If you think it reads like spin, you're probably onto something. Go with your instinct and do some more exploring and probing before joining in.

, If you really want to know the veracity and the source material is scant in the original commentary, doing your own research will help you to cut through the spin. You can research online using reputable websites, visit the library and ask for the help of a librarian, research in books, or even phone up someone who has some expertise in the field and ask them questions.


If you research online, look for such sites as government agencies, libraries, peer-reviewed journals, academic sites, etc. From these sites, you can find links that they consider to be reputable and this will broaden your search. Just take care that the more you wander from the reputable source, the easier it is to wander back into unverifiable sources.

Being better informed will also help you formulate your presentation.;
, Not anything is going to be attaining by cram. You will be talented enough to imagine better and clearly if you are calm. Naturally, don't be overconfident about the circumstances, but do stay calm enough that you can think clearly.

, Prepare your presentation, class, or talk. The usual rules apply. Also, prepare your notes and any slides you will use.

, Remember that printed material handed out at the beginning of the presentation can compete with you for your audience's attention if you're not careful. (Slides should also be kept to a minimum number of words for this reason.) There are several ways to keep the attention focused on your presentation.


Hand out materials at or near the end of your presentation.
Keep printed materials brief enough to read inside of a few seconds.
Use the printed material simply to recap the presentation, so there is no need to read it during the presentation.
Give your audience time to read or work through the printed materials during the presentation, particularly if the presentation materials include worksheets or group activities, or if the presentation is structured as a class or workshop.

,,


Keep your audience in mind. What parts do they already understand? What parts will they need to remember after the presentation? What do you want them to look at or do with the presentation materials during the presentation.
Estimate the size of your audience. Will you print ten copies of your materials, or 100, or 1000? Will you give your presentation once or multiple times?
Make the page layout clear and readable. Leave space around the edges, choose compatible, readable typefaces, and make sure the size of the type will be readable when it is printed out.
Make sure that the type will contrast clearly with the background as it will be printed, especially if you are printing materials in color.
If you have a lot of printed material to distribute, consider making up a folder, booklet, or binder to go with it. Print and copy shops can bind and collate materials, too, and help direct you to economical binding options for print jobs on the scale you need.

, Ask someone else to give their opinion on the layout, content, and any other factors that matter to you and your audience.

, Many things are easier to see in a hard copy, so it's worth printing a rough draft or two before printing a larger batch.


Proofread the hard copy, or have someone else do so. This is also a chance to review and adjust the layout and design.

, If you have them professionally printed, work with the printers to provide a file in the correct format and to assign colors and other values that will print the way you intend.

, Typical per-copy printing costs are low compared to setup costs. You never know when an audience member will want a spare copy for a friend. Your audience, too, may be larger than you planned. It will be easiest if you have at least a few copies in reserve. You can recycle the leftovers, use them for a subsequent presentation, or use them to write your next presentation.

, If you will be adding materials that were printed separately to the presentation packet, make sure they get into all the packets, and make sure you have enough. Such materials might be things like your business card or standard sales brochure. If you're having the materials professionally printed, find out whether the printers can assemble them, too, and what they charge.


Make sure all your packets are consistent and complete. Don't waste valuable time with your audience handing out an insert to people who don't have it or explaining that you ran out of something.

, You want them to listen, recognize and like what you are saying. Come equipped, and be confident.

The court documents needed include the charging instrument (usually the indictment), judgment, and sentence/probation order.You will probably have to pay a fee to get certified copies of these documents. Call ahead and ask the clerk how much they cost.

, Some states might require that you get a letter of support from your most recent parole or probation officer. If the officer has retired or is no longer employed in the office, then you should call the probation/parole office and tell them that you are applying to have your civil rights restored. They should then provide you with the appropriate letter., Because of the complexity of this area of law, you should probably meet with a post-conviction attorney. Only a qualified lawyer can offer advice tailored to your individual circumstances.


You can find a lawyer by asking your criminal defense lawyer. He or she may also be able to handle your petition for restoration of civil rights.
If you need to find a new attorney, then you can visit your state’s bar association website, which should host a referral program. Call any attorney you are referred to and ask if you can set up a consultation.

, You should call the state Clemency Board or search online for an application. Some states have uploaded their applications. Florida’s application, for example, is available at https://www.fcor.state.fl.us/docs/clemency/ClemencyApplication.pdf. Virginia’s form is available for download at https://commonwealth.virginia.gov/media/3916/revised-more-serious-application-61915.pdf.


There may be a phone number for you to call to request an application.
Some states might automatically mail you a form. In Virginia, for example, non-violent offenders will be sent a letter once they have completed their sentence., Once you receive your application, you should look it over and see what information is required. Complete the application by either using a typewriter or printing neatly in black ink. Provide all necessary information, otherwise it might be sent back.Each state’s application is different, but you will probably be required to provide the following:your name when convicted and any aliases
your date of birth, driver’s license number, and Social Security Number
your contact information (address, phone number, and email address)
a list of your convictions, including the court, the date convicted, and the date sentenced
the date you completed your sentence
your attorney’s name, if you have one

, You should mail the application to the address provided. Be sure to send it certified mail, return receipt requested so that you will have proof that it was received.


There may or may not be a fee. In Nevada and Georgia, for example, there is no fee.If your state charges fees, then the fee should be listed on the application.
Keep a complete copy of the application and any supporting documentation for your files. In the event your application is lost, you can refer to your copy.

, You may have the option of including letters in support of your application. The letters can be from family members, employers, church leaders, or representatives of any organization you belong to.

You might also be able to submit a letter. In your letter, you should explain that you feel remorse for the crime you committed, taking full responsibility. Also express your desire to become a full member of society by participating in voting, jury service, and other activities., In some situations, you may be required to attend a hearing. Each state will have different criteria that determine whether you need to attend a hearing. Florida, for example, requires hearings for felons who committed more serious offenses.

To prepare for a hearing, you should review your application and all supporting materials.
You should also be prepared to explain why you think you deserve to have your civil rights restored. Think about why voting, jury service, or running for office is important to you. For example, you may not feel like a full citizen without the right to vote.
Be sure to dress appropriately for the hearing. The Clemency Board will want to see a conservative style of dress. Try to wear the most formal clothes that you own. For men, this means a suit with a dress shirt or tie. If you do not own a suit, then at a minimum wear dress pants or khakis with a dress shirt and tie.
Women should wear a suit as well, if they have one. Otherwise, wear dress pants or a skirt with a blouse. Women may also wear a conservative dress.

, If the state board agrees to restore your civil rights, then you should receive a certificate from the state to that effect.You should hold onto the certificate, because you may need it if you choose to seek restoration of your gun rights.


If you were denied, then you may have to wait a certain amount of time before applying again. Check with the state board for more information.

",How to Make Brown Rice Flour," All-natural types of rice are best, as these haven’t been treated with preservatives or any other substances that may change the behavior or the four when it’s used for cooking. To produce large quantities of flour, you’ll need to pick up a bag of rice that’s about one pound or bigger. If you only need to make a little bit, a smaller bag or canister should be enough. Do not cook the rice before processing it. It needs to be dry in order to grind properly.
Avoid rices with flavors or any other additives.;
, Pour in the rice and place the lid securely over the top of the blender. Only use 2-3 tablespoons at a time—if the blender is overcrowded, the blades may will have a difficult time grinding the rice grains.Most smaller blender will only be able to effectively manage about 1.5 cups of rice at a time.
Making your own brown rice flour at home can be time consuming, but it’s worth it when you consider how much you stand to save by skipping the grocery store.

, Starting on a low power setting, start and stop the blender a few times in quick succession. This will help reduce the grains to a smaller size without causing the blades to jam or overheat. In addition to a standard blender or food processor, you can also use a compact unit, such as a VitaMix or Magic Bullet. These single-use blenders are perfectly suited for processing small amounts of ingredients.
If all else fails, a coffee grinder will also get the job done., Once the grains have been broken down a bit, switch the blender to a higher power setting and continue blending in 10-20 second intervals. Be sure to pause every now and then to give the motor a chance to cool off.Rice flour needs to be very fine in order to produce the right effect in culinary recipes. By the time you're finished, the processed rice should contain no whole grains or coarse chunks.
When left to run continuously for too long, the blender can easily overheat. This can cause it to become a potential electrical hazard.

, Get out a large bowl and set it in front of you on the countertop. Remove the blender from its base and empty the contents into a manual sifter. You’ll use the sifter to extract usable flour little by little as you go.If you don’t own a sifter, a regular wire strainer will serve the same function.
Be careful while dumping out the flour. One wrong move and you could have a big mess on your hands!

, Position the sifter over the bowl and begin turning the crank slowly. The rotating action of the sifter will help separate the powdery rice flour from larger pieces that haven’t been blended as thoroughly. Keep sifting until all the flour is gone, then shake out whatever is left.To sift with a strainer, shake the flour gently with one hand while tapping the edge of the strainer with the other.
Shake the sifter periodically to dislodge flour that’s become stuck in the mesh.

, Whatever rice didn’t get ground small enough on its first trip through the blender can go back through. This time, blend the rice on a high speed to ensure that the flour achieves a fluffy, powdery texture.


Take advantage of free space in the blender by adding a little more rice each time.
Should you have trouble getting the rice down to a small enough size, experiment with multiple processing methods. For instance, move the rice from the blender to a coffee grinder.

, Keep repeating this process until all of the rice has been turned into to usable flour. Depending on the strength of your blender and the amount of rice you’re using, it may take 20-30 minutes to produce a cup of finely-ground brown rice flour.Make sure the rice has been processed thoroughly. If it’s too coarse, it may not produce the desired effect when it comes time to cook with it.
On average, 1.5-2 cups of rice will yield roughly 1 cup of rice flour.

, Choose a container with a lid that will form a tight seal, such as a piece of tupperware or a canning jar. This will keep unwanted moisture from getting into the flour, which can cause clumping and allow bacteria or mold to set up.Use a container or separate lid with a built-in pour spout to make it easier to measure out the flour for recipes.
Limit the number of times you transfer the rice flour to a different container to minimize the amount of air it receives.

, When kept covered and dry at room temperature, grain flours will stay fresh for weeks. They can last even longer in the refrigerator or freezer, where they’ll be protected from unnecessary exposure.For optimal flavor and texture, try to use your rice flour within 1-2 weeks.
Refrigerate the flour with a box of baking soda to prevent it from absorbing odors from other stored foods., Brown rice flour makes an excellent substitute for conventional wheat flour in all gluten-free dishes. Use homemade four to bake cookies, cakes or brownies, whip up a batch of rustic pancakes for breakfast or even bind fresh pasta or crabcakes. Rice contains less sugar than wheat, and is also packed with beneficial vitamins and nutrients.Look up new gluten-free recipes for ideas and inspiration on how to use a fresh batch of brown rice flour.Stir brown rice flour into soups, sauces and gravies to help thicken them.

Try sliced fruit shish-kabobs.,
Include dried fruit.,
Present colorful veggie trays.,
Make celery sticks fun.,
Beat the heat with frozen grapes.,
Make homemade applesauce.",How to Make Gluten‐Free Snacks for Kids1," Run shish-kabob sticks through fresh fruits to create a fun snack that older children can easily eat and carry around with them. Use smaller fruits such as berries, or slice larger fruits such as pineapples so they fit on the stick.Provided the child can eat dairy, you can add cheese to your fruit shish-kabobs as well. Use cookie cutters or bento cutters to slice the cheese into fun shapes like hearts and stars.
Keep in mind you'll want to save this snack for older kids, not toddlers, since the sticks are pointy.;
, Fresh fruit is always a healthy and naturally gluten-free snack, but dried fruit is equally tasty and not as messy to clean up. Dried fruit can be eaten as a snack on its own, or mixed into gluten-free trail mixes.The fiber in dried fruit is filling, but watch the portion sizes – just a few pieces of dried fruit typically is enough, but it can be hard to gauge since they're so much smaller than fresh fruit. A single serving is about what would fit in the palm of an adult hand.
You can buy pre-packaged dried fruit, but it may be cheaper to go to a specialty grocery or whole foods store that allows you to buy loose amounts of particular fruits by weight – especially if you want a variety of fruits to create your own mix.
You can make trail mixes sweet or savory, depending on the child's tastes and the kind of snacks you want. Shake the ingredients in a zippered bag with spices, or spread them on a bake tray and bake them for a few minutes at low heat to seal in the flavor.
Add nuts such as almonds for an added boost of protein.

, You can buy whole vegetables and cut them up yourself, or buy pre-cut vegetables or smaller sizes such as baby carrots. Use a variety of different vegetables and the kids will be attracted to the colorful presentation.You also can cut the vegetables into fun shapes. Look for bento box cutters (they look like cookie cutters, but they're smaller) in shops that sell cooking and food preparation supplies.
Add pieces of cheese as well, if the kids are able to eat dairy. Use a sectioned container, or get creative and use lettuce to section off a larger tray.

, If your kids turn up their noses at celery sticks, add peanut butter and raisins to create ""ants on a log."" While peanut butter and raisins are the traditional ingredients, you can get creative and substitute whatever your kids enjoy.You can use different types of raisins, or mix it up with dried berries such as dried blueberries or cranberries.
Almond butter or other spreads such as hummus can be used instead of peanut butter if the child has peanut allergies.

, Grapes can be a quick and inexpensive gluten-free snack for kids. They also freeze really well, and can be broken apart into individual servings and popped in the freezer for a cool treat during warmer months.Freezing grapes enhances the flavor as well as being slower to eat. To freeze them properly, remove them from their stems and rinse them well. From there you can portion them into small bags to freeze, or spread them out flat on a lined cookie sheet.
Other fruits are good frozen as well, such as blueberries, peaches, and strawberries.

, Applesauce is a naturally gluten-free snack, but buying pre-packaged individual servings can get expensive. If you have a crockpot and a little bit of time, you can make your own applesauce for a fraction of the cost of commercial brands.Search online for recipes and find one that suits your taste. The good part about making your own applesauce is that you can season it to taste, or add other fruits such as cranberries or strawberries.
You also have the ability to control the consistency, so you can have chunkier applesauce if that's what the kids like.
Keep in mind that the applesauce will become sweeter as it cools, so don't make it too sweet while cooking.
Use a mix of apples to create more complex flavors, or make different varieties with specific types of apples.

Top pancakes and crepes with Truvia.,
Add Truvia to plain or toasted bread.,
Sweeten plain cereals and oatmeal with Truvia.,
Put Truvia on halved grapefruit.,
Toss a fruit salad with Truvia.,
Drizzle Truvia on desserts for extra sweetness.",How to Sweeten Foods with Truvia Nectar1," Syrup, although delicious, is chock-full of sugar. This adds a significant amount of calories to pancakes. You can significantly decrease these calories for this meal by topping your pancakes with Truvia.This Truvia technique works especially well for banana and nut pancakes. These flavors work well with the flavor of Truvia.
You can add flavorings and other toppings to add to the complexity of this dish. For example, try sprinkling the top of your Truvia laden pancakes with cinnamon.;
, Bread dipped in honey has long been a popular treat. Especially when using a healthy kind of bread, like one made from whole wheat, this can be an excellent snack. Toasting your bread can add some crunchy contrast to the smoothness of Truvia Nectar.Take this recipe to the next level by adding peanut butter to the bread before the Truvia. You can even make a calorie-lite version of a peanut butter and honey sandwich by substituting honey for Truvia Nectar.

, This works great for both hot and cold cereal. If you want the sweetness of the Truvia to distribute through the milk, thoroughly stir it in before adding cereal to your bowl. Expect warm liquid to dissolve Truvia more easily than cold ones.

An equally tasty way of eating Truvia sweetened cereal is by sprinkling the top of your cereal with Truvia after adding it to your bowl.

, Grapefruit is a food with many potential health benefits, but for many people it’s unpleasant without sweetener.Cut grapefruit in half and then sprinkle the inside with Truvia. Then take a spoon (or grapefruit spoon, if you have one), and eat the grapefruit by spooning out the edible, fleshy parts between the white inner walls., This is an excellent technique if some of the fruit for your fruit salad is a little unripe or tart. Add your fruit (like strawberries, grapes, different kinds of melon, and so on) to a large bowl. Drizzle Truvia Nectar on the fruit, then mix it well with clean hands or a mixing spoon.

There are many other kinds of salad, fruit salad, or dessert salad that might benefit from a drizzling of Truvia. Some examples include ambrosia, glorified rice, and more.

, Some desserts, although already sweet, need a little extra something to complete the flavor profile. In these cases, instead of using sugary syrups, whipped cream, or other high calorie toppers, substitute a drizzling of Truvia Nectar.

Some desserts you may want to add Truvia Nectar to include things like pie, ice cream, cookies, brownies, cakes, and so on.

Stock up on veggie chips.,
Create healthy dips.,
Use rice cakes instead of bread.,
Experiment with popcorn.,
Make your own granola bars.",How to Make Gluten‐Free Snacks for Kids2," Veggie chips are a gluten-free crispy snack that works great with dips or on their own. If you buy pre-packaged commercial chips, check the bag to make sure they're gluten-free.You also can make your own veggie chips by baking kale or other vegetables. Season to taste and bake for a few minutes on low heat until they're crispy. There are plenty of recipes online for various baked vegetable snack chips.
Experiment with seasonings to create savory or even sweeter varieties. For example, you can make chips by baking thin slices of beets or sweet potatoes and dust them with cinnamon and nutmeg for a sweeter snack.
To make veggie chips, peel and cut up some veggies (carrots, beets, zucchini, yellow squash, sweet potatoes, etc.) into slices about 1/8” thick. Season the veggie slices with 1 tsp of herbs and salt. Then place them on a lightly greased baking pan in a single layer and bake for about 1 hours at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, flip the chips and bake for another 30 to 60 minutes, or until the slices are all crispy., Most dips are naturally gluten-free, but it can get more difficult if your kids have other dietary restrictions. Regardless, you can still often make healthier dips at home rather than buying commercially prepared dips.Hummus and nut butters are common gluten-free dips. If you buy pre-packaged varieties, check the labels to make sure they're gluten-free. You also can make your own at home fairly easily if you have a food processor. There are a number of relatively simple recipes online.
You also can dice whole fresh vegetables to make your own salsa at home. While many commercial salsas are too hot and spicy for young children, if you make your own you can control the flavor.
Dips can be sweet as well as salty. For example, you can make a decadent chocolate almond butter that both your and your kids will enjoy using for spreading on a rice cake or dipping fresh fruit., Rice cakes are a gluten-free alternative that you can use for full-size or finger sandwiches (look for the mini variety). They also can take the place of crackers or toast for a side at breakfast or an after-school snack.Spread hummus or a nut butter on toasted rice cakes, or put a slice of cheese on top of a rice cake along with a piece of fruit or vegetable.
For example, you might spread a thin layer of almond butter on toasted mini rice cakes, then add a thin slice of cheese cut out in the shape of a star with a half a strawberry on top.

, Commercial popcorn typically is considered junk food, but homemade popcorn can be a healthy snack if you prepare it properly and don't cover it in butter and salt.You can use store-bought popcorn or microwave popcorn if you want to save some time, but choose varieties that don't have any added salt or butter. You also may be able to find organic popcorn if you want.
Sprinkle on your own spices or use a gluten-free spice mix, and shake the popcorn in a sealed bag to distribute the spices. You can make this snack sweet or savory.
Mix in dried fruits or nuts to add variety. Spread them on a bake sheet and drizzle the entire mix with syrup or olive oil, then bake for a few minutes at a low heat to create a flavorful mix that can be eaten in clumps.

, You can make homemade gluten-free granola bars that are healthy and filling.While you can find gluten-free granola bars in most grocery stores, these may be more expensive than making them yourself, and may be packed with added sugar and preservatives.


Use oats, which are not related to grains such as wheat and barley, and are naturally gluten-free. Make sure you buy oats that are not processed in plants that also process other grains that contain gluten.They should be labeled as “gluten-free.”

Try gluten-free or grain-free flours.,
Use natural sweeteners.,
Work with baked fruits.,
Make your own candy.,
Whip up your own fruit sorbet.",How to Make Gluten‐Free Snacks for Kids3," Just because your kids are on a gluten-free diet doesn't mean they can never have cookies, cakes, or muffins. All your kids' favorite sweet treats can be made using alternative flours, such as almond flour.Keep in mind that gluten-free baked goods typically must be refrigerated soon after preparation, or they will become inedible.
You can find recipes online for gluten-free muffins, cakes, and cookies, or check out a gluten-free baking cookbook from your local library and try some out.
Adding citrus such as lemon and orange to gluten-free baked goods can help keep them moist., There's nothing about a gluten-free diet that means you can't include any sugar, but you may generally want to avoid refined sugar in kids' snacks and treats for other health reasons.Pure cane sugar is one alternative to refined sugar. Brown sugar also typically is more healthy than refined sugar and you typically don't need to use as much.
If you're including fruits in your baked goods or other sweet treats, you may not need to add any sugar as the fruits have their own natural sweetness.
Honey, maple syrup, and molasses also can be used to replace refined sugar. Check recipes carefully and pay attention to the substitution amounts. You'll want to use less honey or syrup than refined sugar, and you'll also want to reduce the total liquids in the recipe to keep it from getting too runny.
Generally, you want to use about half as much honey or syrup as the amount of sugar the recipe calls for. For each cup (240 milliliters) of honey or syrup you use, decrease other liquids by about a quarter of a cup (60 milliliters) total. Make sure you keep the proportions consistent., Baking fruits such as apples and pears can create a warm, sweet snack that's also healthy and nutritious. Use harder, denser fruits for baking, and glaze them with spices or stuff them with healthy nuts and other dried fruit.To bake apples or pears, you generally want to preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).
Coat your fruits with maple or agave syrup to create a candied coating, adding spices such as cinnamon to taste. Use water to thin the syrup to your desired consistency. You may want to play around with this until you get it right.
You also can find various recipes online or in cookbooks for baked-fruit snacks and desserts.

, In many cases, candy is a complicated and difficult thing to make at home. However, there are plenty of candy recipes that you can use to make simple sweet treats at home for a fraction of what you would pay for commercial gluten-free candies.Look for recipes that use chocolate and coconut and have few ingredients. Pay attention to prep time and make sure you have everything you'll need. Keep in mind that many candies and fudge recipes require a food thermometer because you have to maintain the correct temperature for the candy to come out right.
You can make gummy candies using gelatin and fruit juice (keep your fruit juice organic and without added sugar, or squeeze fruit yourself), and add spices as desired. Whisk your ingredients in a small saucepan over low heat until they are smooth and liquified. Then pour into the mold of your choice and let them set in the fridge. They should keep for a couple of weeks.To make cinnamon candies much like the ""red hots"" commonly given out as treats on Valentine's Day, use dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Use half the amount of hulled sunflower seeds as dried cranberries, with vanilla extract and cinnamon to taste. All you have to do is mix your ingredients in a food processor and process them until they are sticky and well-mixed, then shape them into balls or hearts and stick them in the fridge for a bit to firm them up., In warmer months, fruit sorbet is a healthy alternative to ice cream that also is naturally gluten-free. While you may find plenty of gourmet recipes that are more complicated, you can make plain sorbet quickly and easily with nothing more than a food processor and some zippered freezer bags.You can use canned or fresh fruit – peaches and apricots work well. If you use canned fruit, choose cans labelled with “canned in fruit juice” or “canned in water.” Avoid those that are canned in syrup.
Mix your fruit and some juice together in a freezer bag and freeze the whole thing for about six hours.
Once your fruit is frozen, puree it in a food processor until it's smooth, then freeze it for another hour.

In the place of sugar, simple syrup, flavored creamer, and other kinds of sweeteners, add Truvia Nectar.This sweetening technique works well for any hot beverage. You’ll find that warm and hot beverages easily dissolve Truvia.

, Smoothies can sometimes be unsatisfying without a little sweetener, especially when tart or unripe fruit has been added to them. Because Truvia has very concentrated sweetness, add it little by little to your drink and stir the beverage thoroughly until the desired level of sweetness is achieved.

You can also add Truvia directly to a blender when making smoothies. However, because of the strength of Truvia’s sweetness, only add a little. When finished blending, check its taste. If necessary, add a little more Truvia and lightly pulse the blender to mix it in.

, Health drinks can sometimes be quite unpalatable without sweetener. This can be a frequent problem for those on a juice diet, or those drinking a lot of vegetable and vegetable/fruit juice mixes. Add Truvia to these and mix the drink well with a spoon until the flavor is acceptable.

You may have mixed up a batch of lemonade, a sports drink, or some other kind of similar drink and found its sweetness wanting. In this case, save some calories using Truvia, not more powdered drink mix or sugar.

, Some of the healthiest kinds of yogurt, unfortunately, can be quite sour. If you’re trying to add more yogurt to your diet but dislike its sourness, use Truvia to tone this down and make this food more enjoyable. Remember that a little Truvia goes a long way."

Place the pot on the stove, and heat it on high until the water comes to a boil.You can use whatever type of potatoes you prefer for mashing. Russet and red potatoes are good options.
If you like, you can add a pinch or two of salt to the water before you bring the potatoes to a boil.

, Once the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the pot with a lid, and allow the potatoes to cook until they are tender, which should take 15 to 20 minutes.The larger that your potato cubes are, the longer that they will take to cook.

, After the potatoes are finished cooking, remove the pot from the burner. Pour the potatoes into a colander to drain all of the water from them.Shake the potatoes well while they’re in the colander to ensure that you remove all of the excess moisture.

, Place the cooked potatoes in a bowl, and add ½ cup (118 ml) of whole milk, 4 tablespoons (58 g) of unsalted butter, and 2 tablespoons (24 g) of sour cream.

, When the pie filling is carefully spread out in the baking dish, spoon the mashed potatoes over it. Spread it across the entire dish, so all of the filling is covered.If you want to give the pie a more decorative look, you can use a fork to score the mashed potatoes.

, Once the mashed potato layer is in place, top it with ⅔ cup (65 g) of shredded, sharp cheddar cheese. Make sure to spread the cheese in an even layer across the potatoes.Adding the cheese is an optional step. You can omit it if you prefer.

, When the shepherd’s pie is fully assembled, place it inside the preheated oven. Allow it to bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the potatoes become golden brown.If your baking dish isn’t very deep, you may want to place it on a cookie sheet before baking it it. Some of the pie’s gravy may bubble over.

, When the pie is finished baking, remove it from the oven. Let the pie sit for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting it and placing it in bowls to serve.Cover any leftover shepherd’s pie so it’s airtight and store it in the refrigerate. It should stay fresh for 3 to 4 days.

Pour 6 cups (720 g) of brown rice flour into a large bowl.,
Add 2 cups (384 g) of potato starch to the bowl.,
Pour 1 cup (120 g) of tapioca flour or starch.,
Add 2 tablespoons (24 g) of xanthan gum.,
Use a whisk to mix the flour.,
Sift your gluten-free flour again before using it.,
Store your all-purpose gluten-free flour in a tightly-sealed tin.",How to Make an All Purpose Gluten Free Flour1," Brown rice flour is a whole-grain flour, which is less processed than other types of flour.


You can find rice flour in the baking aisle of most health food stores or large supermarkets. If you are looking to save money, opt for white rice flour. You can find it for a low price at ethnic grocery stores.;
, Do not use potato flour. Potato starch thickens and adds moisture to baked goods.


You can substitute the potato starch with corn starch. The potato starch handles higher temperatures, so it is better for making baked goods, roux and breading. If you do substitute corn starch, you will need to add 1/3 cup (64 g) more of corn starch because it is lighter than the potato starch.

, This is also useful as a thickener in the recipe.

, This is a binding agent that is commonly used in gluten-free baking. You will not need to add the xanthan or guar gum to recipes, if it is in your all-purpose flour.

, Pour it into a sifter to mix it more fully and break up clumps. This gluten-free flour mixture makes a very large batch. It can be made using the same ratios of 6 to 2 to 1, but in smaller amounts, with just a dash of xanthan gum.

, The ingredients can settle, creating pockets of 1 ingredient or another.

, If you think you have made more than you think you can use, store the extra in a sealed container in the fridge. Bring it to room temperature before using.

You can purchase a pudding basin online or at most department stores or cook shops., The water in your deep pan should come halfway up the side of your pudding basin. This will ensure an even cook throughout your pudding., Put a lid on the pan and keep your pudding on the stovetop for 4-5 hours on low-medium heat. During this time, the pudding should solidify. Check back on the water level in the pan every hour and add more water if it's evaporated.

When adding new water, make sure to add hot water.

, Remove the lid and attach cling wrap to the top of your pudding basin. You can store your Christmas pudding for almost three months before it goes bad., When you're ready to serve your gluten-free pudding, you have two ways of reheating it. You can either put it back into your tin or deep pan and re-steam it for one to two hours. Alternatively, you can put it in your microwave for 3-5 minutes, or until it becomes soft.You can garnish your Christmas pudding with holly and serve it with cream or brandy butter.

Simmer them over low-medium heat for 15 minutes. Once you're done, set them aside and allow them to cool for at least 20 minutes., Preheat the oven so that when you start to bake your pudding, it will cook all the way through. Not preheating your oven often leads to an uneven cook, especially when baking Christmas pudding., Pulse at medium to high for 30 seconds or until the dates and orange form a paste. To get the consistency that's desirable, a food processor may be required. If your mixture is lumpy, continue to pulse on high until it doesn't have lumps., Add your two eggs and 60 milliliters (2  fl oz) (1/4 cup) olive oil with your other spices to your food processor or large bowl. Continue to combine the ingredients, mixing them together until they are completely incorporated with one another.Your batter should have a smooth and creamy consistency.

, Drain any orange juice that settles at the top of your mixture. The goal is to get your batter as creamy and smooth as possible. Excess water will make your cake more likely to fall apart when cooked., Put your paste into a large mixing bowl and your raisins and dried apricots to the mixture. Instead of raisins, you can also use sultanas or white raisins. Mix the batter together and prepare it for baking., Transfer your batter to 750 milliliters (25.4  fl oz) pudding molds using a spatula. Place the molds on the middle rack in your oven and continue to bake your pudding for 45 minutes. Check back on your Christmas pudding and make sure that it's cooking properly. The outside should have a brown and crispy crust that forms on the top., Allow your puddings to cool for at least 10 minutes before removing them from their molds. At this point, they should be solid enough so that you can remove them without them falling apart."

",How to Make Gluten‐Free Gravy," In order for the gravy to turn out the way it’s supposed to, you need to have a way of thickening it. For this purpose, any alternative to wheat-based starch will work just as well. Sweet rice flour, King Arthur gluten-free multi-purpose flour, or simple cornstarch are all good choices, and will result in a rich, smooth gravy with no noticeable differences in taste.Many gluten-free chefs praise the smooth texture of sweet rice flour for making gravies, soups and sauces. You can also use white rice flour if it’s what you have on hand.If you decide to use cornstarch, you can skip the roux-making phase altogether, as it will thicken the stock on its own.;
, Place about 2.5 tablespoons of unsalted butter in a small saucepan and begin heating it at a medium-high temperature. Coat the entire bottom of the saucepan to keep the flour from sticking later on. The butter will serve as one half of the base of the roux, which should be equal parts fat and starch in order to set up and flavor properly.Unsalted butter will have less of an influence on the saltiness of the gravy, giving you more control over how it’s seasoned.
Substitute olive oil if you have eaters that are dairy-free.

, Use a measuring cup to portion out roughly 2.5 tablespoons of sweet rice flour, gluten-free multi-purpose flour or cornstarch. Sprinkle the gluten-free flour into the melted butter, stirring as you go. When combined, the two ingredients will begin to form a thick paste.Stir in the flour as you pour, rather than dumping it all in at once.
Remember to keep the ratio of flour to butter equal.

, Stir the mixture constantly at a gentle speed to break up clumps and make sure the flour and butter are distributed evenly. Due to the characteristics of their grains, certain gluten-free flours will thicken differently, so don’t worry if your roux seems a little gummier than it should be. You’ll be able to thin the gravy out when it comes time to incorporate the stock.A perfect roux is smooth, creamy and all one color and consistency.Whisking the roux also helps expose it to air, which will prevent it from burning or becoming dense and gelatinous.

, Undercooked gluten-free flour can have a somewhat raw, starchy taste, interfering with the flavor of the gravy. To counteract this, heat the roux until it becomes a deep tan color. This will break down the starch a bit so that it’s not as noticeable in the finished gravy.Your roux doesn’t need to get too dark. You should end up with something resembling a blonde gravy that’s slightly lighter in color than the regular variety.Be careful not to overcook the roux. If it gets too brown, the gravy may have a burnt, unpleasant taste.

, If you’re short on time or making gravy from scratch before the meal, a package of store-bought stock will be perfectly fine. The stock will even out the consistency of the gravy and give it its salty, savory base flavor. Look for low- or no-sodium varieties so that you can season the gravy yourself to the desired saltiness once it’s ready.Check to make sure the store-bought stock you’re buying doesn’t contain traces of gluten.
You could also make your own homemade stock weeks or months in advance and freeze it until you need it to make gravy.

, For a more traditional approach, you can also collect the rendered fat and juices from the turkey you’ve roasted, if you prefer to fix your gravy the old fashioned way. Scoop up about a 1 ½ cups of dripping in a measuring cup, making sure you get some of the tasty fat that’s floating on top. With real turkey drippings, the gravy will have a more authentic, homespun flavor.Reusing the turkey drippings may make for deeper, more complex gravy, since you’ll also be able to taste hints of the herbs and spices used to season the turkey.
Be sure to taste the drippings to see how much salt you’ll need to add later.
Discard your drippings altogether if they’re burnt.

, Slowly pour about a cup of the stock or turkey drippings into the browned roux, whisking as you go. After smoothing out any clumps or inconsistent spots, pour in the rest of the stock or drippings and stir it all together. Adding the stock a little at a time will help you avoid lumpy gravy.2—2 ½ cups of stock or drippings will make enough gravy to feed most crowds.

, Your gravy now just needs to simmer for a few minutes. If it feels too thick, feel free to give it another splash of stock or drippings. Watch for the gravy to start bubbling in the center when it’s ready.The gravy just needs to cook long enough for all of its individual flavors to mingle.
It’s better to add the stock in increments so that you don’t accidentally make the gravy watery. If it gets too thin, there’s no good way to thicken it up without the risk of altering the flavor.

, Sample your gravy to test how salty it is. Throw in a little kosher salt as needed, then add coarse-ground black pepper, or a dash of parsley, thyme, sage or a couple whole bay leaves until you achieve the desired flavor. Stir thoroughly to fully incorporate the seasonings. Transfer the gravy to a separate dish and announce to your guests that dinner is served!The stock, drippings and butter all contain a little bit of salt, so you may not need to add much extra to get the gravy adequately seasoned.
Because of the way the starch ingredients react, gluten-free gravy may not reheat well. Make smaller batches so that you don’t end up having to throw too much away after the meal is over.,"

Use honey, nuts, and dried fruit to make a sweet gluten-free trail mix.,
Bake with gluten-free flour.,
Try coconut butter brittle.,
Read labels on prepackaged sweets.",How to Prepare Gluten‐Free Snacks1," You can find recipes online for gluten-free trail mixes. You can also take a basic recipe and substitute your favorite nuts and seeds to make a sweet snack all your own.For example, you can heat a teaspoon (about 4.9 milliliters) of butter and a quarter-cup of honey until melted, then add in your favorite nuts and seeds. Cook this for about eight minutes on the stove top until the nuts are golden. Then stir in raisins and spread the mix on a baking sheet to cool.
Some snack mixes are baked in the oven, while for others you simply shake the ingredients together in a closed container or zipped bag.
When toasting nuts, watch them very carefully, as they will burn quickly.
Once you've made a full batch, you can separate it out into single servings so it's easier to munch on or carry with you to work or school.;
, Most flour is wheat-based and contains gluten. However, you can find gluten-free flour in most large grocery stores or specialty health-food stores. Check in the refrigerated or freezer aisles.Avoid simply using a regular recipe and substituting gluten-free flour for refined flour. Your treats may be excessively dry and crumble apart. Instead, follow recipes that were created specifically for gluten-free flour, which will include other ingredients designed to keep your gluten-free cakes and cookies soft and moist.
Keep in mind that gluten-free flour is made without preservatives, which means it is perishable. Any cookies or cakes you make using gluten-free flour must be refrigerated.
Cookies and cakes made with gluten-free flour also tend to dry out more quickly, so make sure you store the uneaten portion in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

, When you hear the word ""brittle,"" you may think of the sticky candy made with chocolate, sugar, and butter. However, using coconut butter and coconut oil with coconut sugar makes a similar sweet snack that's gluten-free.To make your own coconut butter brittle, you'll need to melt a cup (about 236.5 milliliters) of coconut butter and a tablespoon (about 14.8 milliliters) of coconut oil in a double broiler.
Once the coconut butter and coconut oil have melted, add three tablespoons (about 44.3 milliliters) of coconut sugar. Make sure you mix in the sugar well until everything is blended together.
Transfer your mixture to a baking sheet and smooth it out. You can add nuts, seeds, or dried cranberries throughout the mixture to suit your taste.
When you're done, chill the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator for an hour, then take it out and break it into pieces.

, Many prepackaged candies and other sweets contain wheat, or use gluten as an emulsifier. If you want to buy prepackaged candies rather than making your own, check the ingredients to confirm the product is gluten-free, even if it doesn't seem like something that would normally include wheat products.For example, if you're baking gluten-free chocolate chip cookies, check your bag of chocolate chips. Many chocolate chips are not gluten-free.
Sticky gummy candy and hard candies such as candy canes also often contain gluten, which is used as an emulsifier.
If you're buying puddings or pie fillings, look for soy pudding or gluten-free powdered mixes to which you add water.
Keep in mind that many candy bars and chocolates contain wheat or wheat products.

Combine guacamole with homemade tortilla chips.,
Make your own hummus.,
Serve rice or pita chips instead of potato chips.,
Use a variety of nuts and dried fruits.,
Check labels on bottled sauces.",How to Prepare Gluten‐Free Snacks2," Prepackaged and processed snack foods such as chips and dips often contain gluten. You can make gluten-free tortilla chips at home and dip them into a homemade guacamole with peppers, garlic, and poblano for a spicy gluten-free alternative.You can buy pre-made guacamole at a restaurant or grocery store, or make your own using a fresh avocado and fresh ingredients such as bell peppers, chile or salsa, green onions, and cilantro.
Guacamole is a dip that is naturally gluten-free. However, check the ingredient listing on prepackaged guacamole carefully to make sure no gluten has been added.
To make your own tortilla chips, cut corn tortillas into wedges and toss them with two teaspoons of lime juice and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Spread them out on a baking sheet and bake them for 10 minutes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit (about 218 degrees Celsius), or until they are light brown and crisp. Turn them over about halfway through baking.

, If you have a food processor, you can make gluten-free hummus at home using garlic, garbanzo beans, olives, vinegar, olive oil, and other spices. Greek yogurt adds some tang to your mix.You can find several hummus recipes online that use different ingredients. With a food processor, it should only take a few minutes to whip your hummus into your desired consistency.
You also have the option of experimenting to find different flavors you like. Simply start with one can (8 ounces) of chickpeas or garbanzo beans, drained. Use two tablespoons (about 29.5 milliliters) of skim milk and one tablespoon (about 14.7 milliliters) each of cider vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil. Add herbs, spices, and other ingredients in teaspoon (about 4.9 milliliters) increments.

, Rice and pita chips are available in most grocery stores, and are a naturally gluten-free alternative to potato or corn chips. They also have less salt than other similar snacks.You also can use carrot or celery sticks for dipping instead of chips.
If you buy prepackaged chips, check the ingredient list carefully – even if you're buying rice or corn chips – to make sure no gluten has been added.

, Nuts and dried fruits are naturally gluten-free, and can be mixed together with spices to create a flavorful snack mix to satisfy your munchies while sticking to your gluten-free diet.Toss seeds and nuts with spices to create a savory or spicy snack. You can simply measure your spices into a container or freezer bag, then add the seeds and nuts you want in your mix. Close the container and shake until all the seeds and nuts are thoroughly coated.
An egg white or olive oil can help your herbs and spices stick to the seeds and nuts and coat them. Shake your seeds and nuts into the mix the same as you did with dry spices, then spread them out on a bake sheet and bake them for 10 to 20 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (about 148.8 degrees Celsius).
Look online for different snack mix combinations you can use, or experiment and create your own using your favorite nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and gluten-free cereals.
You also can add gluten-free cereals, such as rice cereal, to your snack mix. Consider adapting your mix for the season, such as adding pumpkin seeds to your mix during the fall., If you're planning to use bottled sauces or dips for your savory snacks, make sure they're gluten-free. Manufacturers of bottled sauces often use gluten as an emulsifier.Making dips and sauces yourself from whole foods is the best way to guarantee they are gluten-free. Most dips and sauces can be made relatively easily at home in only a few minutes.
Keep in mind that gluten-free dips and sauces may be more expensive than their wheat-based counterparts, and typically have a shorter shelf life.
Make sure you refrigerate gluten-free dips and sauces immediately after opening.

Make bruschetta with tomatoes and gluten-free bread.,
Try gluten-free onion rings.,
Serve prosciutto-wrapped shrimp.,
Add a mix of olives to a cocktail platter.",How to Prepare Gluten‐Free Snacks3," Bruschetta is an appetizer staple that can be made gluten-free by toasting gluten-free bread and topping it with warm roasted tomatoes, olive oil, and herbs and spices.To start, buy gluten-free French bread at your local grocery or health food store. One slice of French bread will make about four pieces of bruschetta.
Use fresh grape, pear, or cherry tomatoes in season. Warm them before adding them to toasted bread by putting them in a skillet over medium heat. This will bring out their flavor.
Brush the French bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar before toasting. Add garlic, basil, and cloves to the top of each slice after cutting into quarters.

, In most diners and restaurants, the batter for onion rings is made with wheat and contains gluten. However, you can create a gluten-free batter that enables you to continue to enjoy these pub-food favorites as an appetizer or side dish with steak or other grilled foods.The batter for gluten-free onion rings is made with gluten-free all-purpose flour, white rice flour, and club soda. The club soda makes this batter lighter than other fried batters.
You can use the same or similar batters for other fried treats such as cheese sticks or fried avocado spears or green beans.
Search online for batter recipes, but don't simply substitute gluten-free flour in another recipe that calls for regular all-purpose flour. The batter won't come out right and may not coat properly.
To make onion rings or other fried snacks at home, you'll need a four-quart (about 3.7-liter) Dutch oven or similar cookware so that you can fry them in canola oil. You'll also need a candy thermometer to confirm that you've heated the oil to the right temperature (385 degrees Fahrenheit or about 196 degrees Celsius).

, Shrimp is a common appetizer, and prosciutto-wrapped shrimp will be a hit at any dinner party. While it's usually not a problem, you want to make sure you check the prosciutto you buy to confirm that it's gluten-free.These shrimp make a light appetizer, and using fresh herbs and spices adds a lot of flavor. Simply prepare the shrimp according to your own recipe, then wrap them in prosciutto before broiling them.
If you don't want to risk the high sodium content of prosciutto, leave the wrapping off and serve shrimp coated with basil, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper, and lemon zest mixed in olive oil. Broil the shrimp two minutes on each side and serve them hot.
You can also grill shrimp with herbs and spices and serve them with your favorite gluten-free dipping sauce.
If you want to fry or bake your shrimp, consider using coconut (which is naturally gluten-free) or gluten-free panko-style bread crumbs to coat them.

, Olives make great gluten-free snacks or appetizers and are a welcome addition to any gluten-free cocktail platter or antipasto. Choose a variety of different olives and toss them in oil and spices before serving.Take about four cups (about 0.9 liters) of olives and toss them in two cups (about half a liter) of olive oil. You can add herbs and spices such as garlic, rosemary, lemon rind, parsley, and red pepper to the olive oil.
Shake or stir your olives well to make sure they're completely covered with the mixture, then place them in an airtight container and refrigerate them until you serve them.

Check packaging labels for the 4 main grains that contain gluten.,
Check the ingredients list for things that may contain gluten.,
Look for advisory labels.",How to Read a Label for Gluten," There are 8 food allergens that the FDA must identify on package labels. Wheat is included in the list, but the 3 other grains are not required to be labeled by the FDA.


Look for the word ""wheat"" in the ingredients list. You also may see ""contains wheat"" directly following the list.
Read the label carefully for rye. Rye contains gluten, an although it is not typically used as an ingredient in foods, it will be labeled in the ingredients list if it was used.
Check for barley. This grain is widely used in foods and will be listed in the ingredients. Be careful to look not only for the word barley, but barley malt or malt. These may be listed under ""flavoring.""
Look for oats as an ingredient. Although plain oats do not contain gluten and are safe to consume when on a gluten-free diet, they often are mixed with or contaminated by wheat.;
, Some labels will only list a certain ingredient without breaking it down. For example, a container of ice cream may list cookie dough as an ingredient, but may not be required to list the ingredients of the cookie dough, which may contain flour.

, These are labels that advise the consumer that the food may have been prepared near products containing gluten (or within the same processing plant). These labels are not required by the FDA and are placed on packaging by the manufacturer, so look closely at the entire label.

Maintain a good gluten free pantry.,
Substitute by weight.,
Think about flours in terms of their protein and starch content.,
Some suggested mixes for basic uses.,
Be prepared to try different things.",How to Pick the Right Gluten Free Flour Substitute for Your Conventional Recipe," There are no two ways about it, a gluten free pantry has more random stuff than a pantry with gluten one does. Until magical gluten-free wheat flour is invented, you'll be replacing one flour with two or more. Here's a short list of the things I keep on hand all the time.


White Rice Flour
Brown Rice Flour
Tapioca Starch
Potato Starch
Low Fat Soy Flour
Whey Protein Powder
Quinoa Flour
Albumen (dried egg white)
Guar Gum
Teff flour

, Different flours have different milled sizes and density, but baking is generally chemistry - which means it's the mass, not the volume that counts. A kitchen scale is a necessary tool. To determine the weight called for in your recipe, use this basic guide:


1 cup all purpose wheat flour = 4.5 ounces

, White rice flour is low in protein and high in starch, soy flour is high in protein and lower in starch. Albumen has no starch and is all protein. When you think about your resulting product, think about whether it should be strong and have lots of structure (high in protein) or tender and crumbling (higher starch, lower protein). Is it the base of a sauce? High starch. Is it coating on a fried good? A moderate mix of both. This will also make it easier to swap out one flour for another if you have or develop other food sensitivities.

,


Gravy thickening - potato starch. Has a neutral flavor and leaves minimal lumps
Cookies - equal parts by weight white rice, tapioca, and low fat soy flour (substitute teff for soy if you do not tolerate soy well).
Pie crust - 3 parts white rice flour, 2 parts tapioca and potato starch.
Cake - 1 part guar gum, 3 parts albumen, 5 parts white rice flour, and 12 parts potato starch.
Bread - 1 part whey powder, 2 parts soy flour and tapioca starch, 3 parts white rice flour

, Some cupcakes want a stronger flour. Some breads are better with weaker ones. Gluten free flour mixes are less robust and versatile than their wheat counterparts so even if you find something that's ""pretty good"" be prepared to try it over again with a different mix.

",How to Make Paleo Meatloaf," These ingredients will all be sautéed in the olive oil together, so you’ll need to first cut them into small pieces. Aim for pieces the size of your pinky fingernail. You’ll be using a sharp kitchen knife or chef’s knife for this step, so be careful not to cut your fingers.


If you prefer not to mince garlic, you could also use a garlic press to crush it into small pieces.;
, Pull out the 10-ounce package of frozen spinach to let it thaw. You can simply leave the spinach sitting on the counter in room-temperature air; it should take about 4–6 hours to thaw. If you’re short on time, you can submerge the packet in a bowl of warm water and let the heat from the water thaw the spinach.


Alternately, if you plan ahead the night before, you can take the frozen spinach from the freezer and put it in the fridge, where it will thaw overnight.

, Pour your 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a large frying pan, and let the oil heat up. Once it’s ready, combine all three sliced ingredients in the pan and let them cook in the oil. Use a wooden spoon to stir the onions, peppers, and garlic frequently, so that they do not stick to the bottom of the pan and burn. , Once the onions and red peppers have fully sautéed, you can add the minced garlic, package of spinach, and the spices (chili powder, salt, oregano, thyme, and cayenne powder) to the pan. Stir all of the ingredients well, giving them time to continue to sautée in the oil.Once all of the vegetables are well sautéed and have become tender, remove the pan from the heat. Set the vegetables aside for now.

, The ground beef (or turkey) should be thawed and room temperature. Place all 2 pounds into a large kitchen bowl, and knead it a few times with your hands to make sure it’s fully thawed and malleable.


If you didn’t give yourself sufficient time to plan ahead and find that the ground meat is still frozen, you can place the meat (still in an airtight container) in a large bowl of warm water to accelerate the thawing process.
Alternately, you can take the frozen or partially thawed ground meat, open it and set it on a plate, and thaw the meat in the microwave.

, Crack your 3 eggs into a small bowl and, using a kitchen whisk, mix the eggs for at least a full minute. When whisking the eggs, move the whisk in vigorous, circular strokes. Make sure to fully blend the egg yolks and the whites; the whisked eggs shouldn’t contain any thick lumps of yellow yolk.


When fully whisked, the eggs should be pale yellow and frothy.

, Once you have these three ingredients in the bowl, use your hands to mix the eggs and flour into the ground meat. Do this gently, but make sure that the eggs and flour are fully mixed in. When you’re finished mixing the eggs, flour, and ground meat together, there should not be a puddle of liquid egg in the bottom of the bowl, and the flour should be mixed evenly throughout.Be sure to wash your hands after this step, as they’ll be covered with raw beef and eggs.

, Once you’ve completed the previous step, retrieve the frying pan with vegetables and pour this mixture into the meat, egg, and flour mixture. You may need to scrape the frying pan with your wooden spoon if some of the sautéed vegetables are stuck to the pan. Then, using your hands, mix the veggies fully into the meat.Depending on how much time has passed since you took the frying pan off of the stove, the vegetables may still be hot after having been sautéed. If this is the case, after you pour the vegetables into the bowl with the meat, give them 5–10 minutes to cool off.

, You can plan ahead and do this in advance so that your oven is up to the necessary temperature by the time your meatloaf is ready to be baked. Set your oven precisely and let it reach 350°F before inserting the meatloaf.If you put the meatloaf in the oven before it’s fully heated, the meatloaf may come out undercooked.

, Still using your hands, press the meat and vegetable mixture into a loaf shape. You’ll need to compress the mixture and “pack” it together so that the loaf maintains its shape and coheres. Depending on the size of your meatloaf pan, the finished loaf will likely be about 10” long, 4” wide, and 3” high.

, Pick up the unbaked loaf and gently transfer it into your pan. The loaf should be a little smaller than the pan and fit comfortably inside, so that the meatloaf has room to expand as it cooks.If your pan is not coated with a nonstick surface, you may need to coat it with a nonstick spray so that the meatloaf doesn’t stick to the pan.


A meatloaf pan is typically made of stainless steel, has elevated ribs or bumps along the bottom, and has two handles on the sides.
If you need to purchase a pan for this recipe, check your local kitchen-supply store. Some larger supermarkets may also sell meatloaf pans.

, This will function something like a marinade, and allow the meatloaf to avoid the moisture and the flavor of the BBQ sauce while cooking in the oven. Make sure to coat the meatloaf evenly with sauce; you don’t want any uncovered patches on the side or top of the loaf.It’s alright to use a little over a half of a cup of BBQ sauce for this step; it won’t harm the meatloaf.

, Keep an eye on your meatloaf as it nears the 1-hour mark; if it’s not quite finished, you can leave it in the oven for 15 or 20 more minutes. The meatloaf should reach an internal temperature of 155°F; you can measure this by inserting a meat thermometer into the center of the loaf while it’s in the oven., Once the meatloaf has reached 155°F and is finished baking, remove the pan from the oven and set it on a heat-resistant surface, such as a countertop. Let the meatloaf cool for about 10 minutes, then serve the loaf and top each slice with more BBQ sauce or ketchup.

Chill or freeze the finished flour.",How to Make Quinoa Flour1," Meanwhile, grab a small, rimmed baking sheet and set it aside.You don't need to line the baking sheet with anything, but if you do choose to line it, use parchment paper. Cooking spray will negatively impact the toasting process, and aluminum foil could taint the flavor of the finished flour.;
, Load an electric seed grinder with just enough quinoa to fill the basin. If the appliance has a lid, lock the lid in place.


If you don't have an electric seed grinder, you could use a manual seed grinder, coffee grinder, or high-powered food processor.
Load the appliance up to two-thirds full with quinoa seeds. For smaller grinders, you may need to grind the quinoa in several batches to avoid over-filling the appliance. Over-filling the grinder will prevent it from processing the quinoa properly and may result in coarse flour.

, Pulse the grinder in short, on/off intervals. Continue for approximately 15 seconds, or until the appliance grinds the batch of seeds into an oven, fine powder.


When using a small grinder, carefully shake the appliance in between pulses to help shift and spread the seeds. When using a larger grinder or food processor, you may need to pause and stir the contents after several pulses to help redistribute the remaining seeds.
After grinding down the quinoa seeds, you've created quinoa flour that can technically be used as it is. Since raw quinoa flour has such a bitter taste, however, you should toast it before use to tone it down.

, Empty the contents of the grinder onto the baking sheet. Spread the flour out into an even layer.


Regardless of how much quinoa flour use plan to work with, the layer of flour should be no deeper than 1/4 inch (6 mm) on the baking sheet. Separate the flour onto separate baking sheets, if necessary., Place the pan of quinoa flour into your preheated oven. Heat treat the flour for at least two hours.


Toasting the quinoa flour for longer periods may further reduce the bitter flavor, but after two hours pass, you should check the flour every 15 minutes to verify that hasn't begun burning.
You do not need to turn or sift the flour as it toasts.
While the quinoa flour bakes, it will release a characteristic grassy scent. This scent should fade when the quinoa flour is ready to remove.

, Remove the finished quinoa flour from the oven. Set the baking sheet out at room temperature and allow the flour to completely cool.

, Place the finished quinoa flour into an airtight container or freezer-safe plastic bag. Store the flour in your refrigerator or freezer until you're ready to use it.


Quinoa can quickly become rancid, so if you don't plan on using it immediately, you need to store it in cool conditions. It should last in the refrigerator up to 6 months, but in your freezer, it should last for up to 1 year.

Cool completely.,
Place the quinoa into the grinder.,
Grind the quinoa into flour.,
Chill or freeze until use.",How to Make Quinoa Flour2," Set aside a rimmed baking sheet for later use.Lining the baking sheet is not strictly necessary, but if you'd prefer to do so, use parchment paper. Avoid aluminum foil, which may alter the taste of the quinoa, and cooking spray, which may disrupt the drying/roasting process.

, Pour the quinoa seeds into a medium glass or plastic mixing bowl. Cover the seeds with cold water., Using clean hands, briefly and gently rub the seeds together while keeping them submerged in the cold water.


Scrubbing the quinoa can help loosen some of the saponin clinging to the outer surface of the seeds.

, Pour the contents of the bowl through a fine mesh strainer or sieve, straining the soak water and retaining the seeds. Without emptying the strainer, rinse the quinoa seeds under cold, running water.


Since quinoa seeds are so small, you need to use a fine mesh strainer to avoid accidentally losing any seeds through the gaps.
Continue rinsing the quinoa under running water until the water draining from beneath the batch runs clear. Turn off the water and gently shake the strainer to rid the seeds of excess water.

, Spread the rinsed quinoa over your prepared baking sheet, keeping it in a thin, even layer.


The layer of quinoa seeds should be no greater than 1/4 inch (6 mm), but an even thinner layer would be ideal.

, Place the quinoa seeds in your preheated oven. Roast the seeds until they are completely dry.


In addition to feeling dry, the quinoa should turn slightly golden and become notably more fragrant.
Heat treating the seeds should remove even more saponin, which further reduces the bitter taste of the flour. Moreover, the heat also dries the seeds, which is important since grinding wet seeds will result in a paste instead of a dry, light flour.

, Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Set it aside at room temperature and wait at least 15 minutes, or until the seeds cool to room temperature.

, Pour a portion of the quinoa seeds into the bowl of an electric seed grinder. If the grinder has a lid, secure the lid into place.


Manual seed grinders and coffee grinders can also work well. In a pinch, you could also use a high-powered food processor, but it might be difficult to grind the quinoa past the ""coarse meal"" stage and into the ""fine flour"" stage.
Only fill the bowl of the grinder up to two-thirds full with quinoa, if not less. If you over-fill the grinder, the blades will have difficulty accessing all of the seeds, and you may not be able to grind the seeds down into a fine enough powder.

, Process the quinoa flour in short, on/off pulses. Continue for approximately 15 seconds, or until an evenly fine powder forms.


Periodically shake the appliance in between pulses to help shift any remaining seeds closer to the blades. If the appliance is too large to shift, use a spatula to stir the seeds closer to the blades.
If you were unable to process all of the seeds at once, empty the grinder when finished with the first batch and repeat the process with the remaining roasted quinoa. Continue until the entire portion of roasted quinoa has been turned into flour.

, Pour the quinoa flour into an airtight container or freezer-safe plastic bag. Store the flour in your refrigerator for up to 6 months or in your freezer for up to 1 year.


Quinoa flour can turn rancid at a rapid pace, but keeping it cold will slow the process down. While refrigeration should help, it's best to freeze the flour if you do not plan on using it soon.

If you are allergic to tapioca, use potato starch instead. Do not use potato flour; it's not the same thing.;
, The trouble with gluten-free flour is that it is gluten-free. This means that when you use it instead of regular flour in a recipe, you might get slightly different results. Adding xanthan gum is not completely necessary, but it will help bind your ingredients and give you better results., Do not skimp on the blending; if your flours are not well-blended, your baked goods will not turn out right. It will take 3 to 5 minutes of whisking., Depending on the recipe, you can use it as a direct substitute for regular flour. You may have to use a little more/less flour depending on the recipe however. It works great in just about any baked good, including breads, cakes, crepes, muffins, and even waffles."

Know that you can use single, non-gluten flours instead of blends when you are cooking.",How to Make Gluten Free Flour4," Combine the ingredients listen below, and use as a substitute for anything that calls for all-purpose flour.3 cups (450 grams) brown or white rice flour
1 cup (125 grams) potato starch
½ cup (65 grams) tapioca flour/starch

, If you need a simple flour, but can't use potato starch, you can use soy flour instead. Gather the ingredients listed below, mix them well, and use the flour in your recipes.½ cup (75 grams) brown rice flour
¼ cup (25 grams) soy flour

1 cup (100 grams) oat flour
1 cup (100 grams) coconut flour
1 cup (125 grams) tapioca flour/starch
¼ cup (30 grams) cornstarch
3½ teaspoons xanthan gum

1 cup (125 grams) dry milk powder
¼ to ½ cup (55 to 115 grams) granulated sugar
½ cup (65 grams) cornstarch
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
½ tsp salt

If you are using more flour, use more xanthan gum or guar gum.If you are making bars, cakes, cookies, muffins, or quick-breads, add ½ teaspoon of xanthan gum or guar gum.
If you are making yeast bread or baked items containing yeast, add 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum or guar gum.
If you are making pizza dough or pie crust, add ½ teaspoon of xanthan gum or guar gum.

, Just because a recipe, such as a sauce, calls for flour does not necessarily mean that you have to whip up a batch of blended flour. You can always substitute any of the flours below:Use arrowroot, amaranth, and tapioca flour to thicken roux, sauces, and pie filling.
Use chickpea flour, besan, and garbanzo bean flour to bind burgers and meatballs.
Substitute corn masa to make tortillas.
Try corn flour and millet flour when breading meat.

Choose another recipe until you find one that performs well on a large scale., Tiered round or square cakes are very common at weddings. If this is the case, you may need to order a set of round cake pans.

The number of guests you have at your wedding will determine the size of your cake pans; however, you may be able to find wedding cake pan sets in many shapes on websites like Amazon, eBay and Wilton.com.

, Find the number of servings your original recipe said it made. Adjust according to whether you believe this number was accurate when you made your test cake., Look inside your cake decorating book and see how many servings of cake each size of cake pan will produce. For example, look for a 6-inch, 10-inch and 12-inch round pan.

Do not count the top tier in your serving calculations for guests. This is traditionally stored in a freezer for the bride and groom until their first anniversary. Aim to go higher or add a larger bottom pan in order to account for this tier. However, you must include the top tier in your calculation for how many times you will need to multiply the recipe.

The list of gluten-free foods is comparatively short and straight-forward and includes: all fresh fruits and vegetables; all non-processed meats, fish and fowl; eggs, unprocessed dairy, such as fresh milk and 100 percent natural cheeses; and grains such as corn, rice, buckwheat, amaranth, quinoa and millet.
The list of products that contain gluten is long and varied and includes everything from breads and pastas to commercial soups, ice cream, sauce packets, pre-made gravies and sauces, spice blends and flavorings, condiments, canned and cured meats, and the fillers in vitamins, medications and supplements. Considering how common gluten is, focusing on the ""cannots"" can be depressing and overwhelming.

While there is no doubt that you will have to change your eating habits and remove some foods from your diet, in recent years several manufacturers have come up with gluten-free alternatives to many popular foods including bread, donuts and pancakes.
You can find gluten-free foods in health food stores, in the natural foods section of mainstream grocery stores, and even on the regular shelves. These items will have gluten-free prominently displayed on the package.
Due to the recent popularity of gluten-free diets, manufacturers of mainstream foods are also changing their package labeling to let consumers know which foods are gluten free. One example is General Mills' gluten free ad campaign.

,


These sites provide gluten-free recipes, lists of gluten-free products, gluten-free restaurants and other information to show you how to live with gluten intolerance.
Many of these sites also provide patient-to-patient forums where you can discuss your concerns, and share gluten-free tips with others.

,


Check the restaurant's website for gluten information or call the restaurant and ask the chef about his food preparation methods.
For example, a baked salmon entrée could appear gluten-free but if the chef uses a commercial spice blend, it could contain gluten.
If the restaurant does not provide gluten-free options, or if you are unable to determine how the food is prepared, do not eat at that restaurant.

,


Because gluten intolerance is not always visible, your loved ones might not understand why you have to change your diet.
Additionally, with the increasing popularity of gluten-free diets, it's easy for people to assume that you are simply following a trend.
The more they understand about your condition, the better they can help you live gluten-free such as providing alternative foods at gatherings or just supporting your need to provide your own food.

,


Because gluten appears in so many foods, it is almost impossible to completely avoid it. If you do ingest gluten, the only thing you can do is ride it out until the gluten leaves your system.
Having digestive remedies on hand will make the waiting period more bearable.

Testing for allergies includes a physical exam, a blood test and possibly a skin test, where the doctor pricks the skin with different allergens.

, Many stores and websites promote gluten-free diets by lumping these 3 problems together. Although they do share some similar symptoms, the problems and treatments are inherently different.


A gluten allergy is an inflammatory immune system response to eating, touching or smelling a gluten product. It is similar to nut, soy, milk and egg allergies. Reactions vary from small to severe. Food allergies are more common amongst children, and then often go away, while adult onset of a food allergy usually remains for the duration of life.
Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease caused by a protein found in gluten products. This protein triggers a response in the small intestine, causing fatigue, diarrhea and damage to the small intestine. This disease is most commonly treated with a gluten-free diet.
Gluten sensitivity or intolerance is a digestive system reaction to a gluten protein. It often triggers cramps, gas, bloating, diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting and weight loss. Usually these symptoms cause no permanent damage. A reduction in gluten in a diet can help or cure this condition.

, These may include rashes, hives, asthma or other respiratory troubles, hay fever, tissue swelling and eczema. Severe allergic reactions, called anaphylaxis, can become deadly if not treated immediately.

, This kit can buy you time to get to the hospital in the case of a life-threatening reaction.

, Share informational brochures with them and teach them which foods, like oats, are prone to cross-contamination.

, Avoid eating anything that lists wheat or gluten on the label. Things that contain wheat flour include instant coffee, sausages, ice cream, soy sauce, ketchup, mayonnaise, medicine, malt, beer, monosodium glutamate (MSG) and more.

, It is better to ask in the beginning, than to assume there is no gluten and have a reaction later on. Frequent restaurants that have gluten-free menus.

, Eat 5 to 9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Focus on consuming foods rich in riboflavin, iron, calcium, thiamin, niacin and folate.

, There are many good options available online and at bookstores. This can help you to avoid buying expensive gluten-free products in supermarkets.

, You can buy gluten-free flour that is a mixture of rice, almond and other nut flours. You can also make it yourself by finding a recipe and visiting natural food stores.

, There are celiac or gluten-free groups that meet in order to promote a gluten-free lifestyle. Research a celiac group in your area, where you can learn more tips on living without these products.

Consider cooking two separate meals, rather than just one giant non-gluten meal, if there are some traditional dishes that you feel your guests must have.",How to Have a Gluten Free Thanksgiving," This is the only surefire way to ensure that your Thanksgiving will be both gluten-free and filled with tasty menu items that you will enjoy. You will run the show, which means that you can filter what comes into the kitchen, and what makes it onto the dining room table.


If you will be a guest at someone else’s home for Thanksgiving, speak with the host about your gluten sensitivity ahead of time.
Offer to make some gluten-free side dishes yourself. Many times, the host is overwhelmed with planning the Thanksgiving menu and preparing all of the dishes for a crowd. Chances are that your offer to bring some gluten-free dishes will be welcomed.;
, Do this well in advance of the holiday so that you are not scrambling to pull it together at the last minute. Most grocery stores, even if they do not regularly carry gluten-free turkeys, are willing to take orders from customers with special needs. Many grocery stores now carry gluten-free foods, including turkeys, as a result of increased awareness about gluten sensitivities in recent years.


Make sure you read all of the ingredients on turkeys, as some brands include gluten products in the processing of the turkey. Be aware of hidden sources of gluten. If there are any ingredients on the list that you do not understand, do your research. Aside from reading labels, the only way to be sure that your turkey is 100% gluten-free is if it is labeled as such by the manufacturer.

, Vegetables are very versatile and their flavor can be enhanced with minimal ingredients. Research ways to modify traditional holiday vegetable dishes, such as a green bean casserole.


In place of the pre-packaged battered and fried onion slices that are normally added to this dish, opt for fresh onions sliced and lightly fried in olive oil without the flour coating. Or, if you really wish to maintain the authenticity of the original dish, substitute wheat flour for corn flour or any other flour that does not contain gluten. The flavor of vegetable dishes like this one will not be altered much, if at all, by a simple flour substitution.

, Once again, you may have to do some homework, but gluten-free brands do exist, and can be readily purchased at many main line grocery stores. In light of all of the attention given to Celiac disease and other gluten sensitivities, foods and ingredients that are gluten-free are now becoming easier to find. Awareness of these conditions makes items such as gluten-free flours, sauces, spices and pastas readily available on grocery store shelves.

, Many people mistakenly assume that stuffing is a big no-no for gluten sensitive individuals because it is composed almost entirely of wheat. But there are gluten-free packages of stuffing available in most health food stores. Some grocery stores may carry these as well, so be sure to ask even if you do not see these options on the shelves.

, Unfortunately, there are many brands of gravy mix and jarred gravy that contain a lot of gluten products. The basic component of gravy that serves as the thickening agent is the flour. Most brands use wheat flour to thicken the mix, however, you can use corn flour in its place. Corn flour is just as effective as wheat flour in terms of its cooking properties. If you don’t have time to prepare your gravy from scratch, check with your local health food store for gluten-free gravy mixes.

, Today there are many more individuals following a gluten-free diet than there was 10 years ago, so there is a good possibility that you will not be the only person avoiding gluten on Thanksgiving. Preparing two meals is a good way to offer both options to meet everyone’s needs for the holiday meal. This may require a lot of kitchen space, so be prepared to use every available inch. Also, this has the highest probability of cross contamination, so be sure to be very thorough when cooking.


Rather than having one large dish of traditional stuffing, you can offer a half dish of traditional and a half dish of gluten-free stuffing. Adjust the portion sizes of each according to the amount of people who will be eating the gluten-free version.

Learn what grains and other foods that are made into flours are generally gluten-free.,
Memorize a list of grains containing gluten.,
Remember which grain-based products often contain gluten.",How to Identify Gluten Free Grains1," A gluten-free diet does not have to mean a grain-free diet. Many grains are safe to eat provided they are not processed, preserved, or mixed with grains that contain gluten.


Unless there is a warning regarding wheat allergies or cross-contamination on the package, products containing amaranth, arrowroot, buckwheat, corn and cornmeal, flax, hominy, millet, quinoa, rice, sorghum, soy, tapioca, and teff are typically safe to eat.
Flour made of beans, corn, potato, rice, tapioca and soy are usually gluten-free. Just be sure to review the package prior to purchase to ensure that the product has not been cross-contaminated or processed with other grains.;
, Always avoid food and drinks that contain barley, rye, triticale, and wheat.


Other wheat products to avoid include bulgur, durum flour, farina, graham flour, kamut, semolina, and spelt.

, Many common grain-based products contain gluten unless specifically labeled “gluten-free.”


Unless you can be sure the product is gluten-free, avoid beer, crackers, cake, bread, pasta, cookies and other baked goods, seasoned snack foods, flavored rice or potato products, sauces, gravies, cereals, croutons, and candies – even if you do not expect the product to contain grains. Seasonings often contain gluten, so it’s not only the grains to watch out for.

"
"
Look for a “Gluten-Free” label.,
Read ingredient lists.,
Search for allergy warnings.",How to Identify Gluten Free Grains2," Most packages of food will have a label that identifies them as gluten-free if the manufacturer is certain that the item does not contain gluten.


When buying flour, pasta, crackers, breads, and other grain products, selecting only products that have a specific “gluten-free” label will ensure that you do not accidentally purchase a grain with gluten.

, If a grain product does not have a specific “gluten-free” label, you may still be able to safely consume it if you read the ingredient list carefully and find no evidence of gluten or gluten contamination.


Gluten is found in many grains and has multiple names. If a product contains any amount of a grain that contains gluten, do not buy or eat the product to be on the safe side.
Do not purchase products that contain ingredients such as enriched flour, self-rising flour, phosphated or bromated flour, white or plain flour, or malt, as these contain gluten unless specifically labeled otherwise.

, Some products may have a sentence near the ingredient list that names potential allergens, such as peanuts, eggs, or milk. Do not buy a product if it names wheat or gluten under the warning, even if a grain with gluten is not listed among the ingredients.


In some cases, a warning label may state that the food may have been processed in a facility that processes products with gluten. Gluten contamination may be enough to cause illness in the case of true gluten sensitivity or allergy and should be avoided.

",How to Make Zoodle Soup," This is the preferred tool for many people because it’s the fastest and easiest to operate. Unfortunately, it’s also the largest and most expensive. To use it, simply wash your zucchini and slice the ends off. Place the zucchini next to the blade and spin. The zucchini will be reduced to thin spiral slices in less than ten seconds. You can buy spiralizers in stores that sell cookware and small kitchen appliances. You can also order one online.
If you’re on a budget or have little kitchen space to spare, consider buying a handheld spiralizer. They are much cheaper, and while the quality of the zoodles won’t be as consistent, it will get the job done.;
, Julienne peelers are small and relatively cheap, but it will take a bit longer to get zucchini noodles when you use one. It will create thinner noodles than the spiralizer, so if you like very delicate noodles, you may prefer using this tool. Wash your zucchini and cut the ends off. Hold the vegetable against the blade and rotate it to create the zoodles.Operate with caution, since you can easily cut yourself with a julienne peeler if you aren’t paying attention.
You can buy one of these tools at any store that sells kitchen utensils.

, Mandolines slice zucchini quickly and easily, but they are fairly large. They’re also extremely sharp, so be careful and always use the safety guard or a cut-resistant glove. Slice the ends off of your rinsed zucchini and nestle the vegetable into the plastic holder. Push the plastic holder from one end of the mandolin to the other repeatedly. The sharp blade will do the rest of the work.You can buy mandolines at most stores that sell kitchen utensils.
Don't underestimate the sharpness of a mandoline! Use caution.

, Some grocery stores are starting to carry pre-packaged zoodles, especially health-oriented establishments like Whole Foods. While most people still tend to make zoodles themselves using one of their kitchen tools, pre-packaged zoodles may be a good option for you if you want to test out the taste before committing to buying an expensive tool.Check the noodle section for pre-packaged zoodles. In some cases, you may find them in the refrigerated section of the produce area.

, If you prefer noodles that are crisp, with an al dente texture, don’t cook your zoodles at all! Simply combine them with the warm ingredients (whatever broth or soup you intend to eat them with) and serve them immediately. The heat from the broth will quickly heat up the thin slices of zucchini and your zoodles will have a similar quality to al dente noodles.This is by far the easiest and most versatile way to make any kind of zoodle soup that you wish. Simply prepare the broth you want and ladle it over your zoodles.

, For those who prefer noodles that are softer than al dente, this technique is quick and easy. Place your zoodles in a microwave safe dish. Cook them for about one minute. If you’re cooking a big pile of zoodles, you may need to cook them for longer. Do so in 30 second increments so that the zoodles aren’t overcooked. Once heated, combine them with your broth or soup., If you don’t have a microwave or prefer to use your stovetop, sautéing your zoodles is a great option. Add one tablespoon of olive oil to a pan. Heat it up, add the zoodles and sauté them for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove them from heat, combine them with your broth and serve immediately.

, This will create the softest noodle. Bring a pot of water to boil, add the zoodles and let them boil in the water for about one minute. Remove them from heat and drain them with a colander, exactly as you would with traditional noodles. Combine them with the broth or soup of your choice and serve., Rinse off the three zucchini. Slice both ends off of each one. Use your spiralizer, julienne peeler or mandoline to reduce the zucchini to a pile of zoodles. Divide the zoodles into six bowls. Set these aside for now.If you prefer, you can remove the skin from the zucchini before creating the zoodles. However, most people leave the skin on.

, Add olive oil to a large pot and heat it up over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion and celery to the pot, as well as the minced garlic. Sauté them together for about five minutes, until they are tender and the onions appear to be slightly translucent., Pour the chicken broth into the pot and stir to incorporate the ingredients. Then add the sliced carrots and chicken. Stir again. Measure out and add the basil, oregano and thyme. Add salt and pepper to taste., Stir the mixture well to incorporate all ingredients. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer the soup at this heat for about 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender., Remove the soup from the heat once the vegetables are tender. Taste the broth and add more salt and pepper, if desired. Carefully ladle the soup mixture over each bowl of zoodles. Serve the soup immediately.,"

Memorize the different names for gluten.,
Buy flours specifically labeled as gluten-free.,
Consider purchasing flour from a specialty aisle or store only.",How to Know What Flour to Use for Gluten Free Baking2," Always avoid wheat flours or flours labeled as being derived from barley, rye, or triticale.


Other flours to avoid include those listed as bulgur, durum, farina, graham, kamut, semolina, and spelt flours.
Avoid flours that list ingredients likely to be contaminated with gluten unless the product is labeled as gluten-free. Frequently contaminated grain flours may include corn, soy, rice, potato, and beans unless otherwise stated.
Flours that include flax, millet, quinoa, sorghum, tapioca, teff, buckwheat, arrowroot, or amaranth as ingredients may also be contaminated.

, Most flour products that are truly gluten-free will be labeled as such.


Always check ingredient lists to verify that the flour could not be cross-contaminated or hiding a gluten-based ingredient if the label does not specify. Not all non-wheat flours will truly be gluten-free.

, If you really want to reduce the risk of purchasing baking flour that contains gluten, your best option is probably focusing your search efforts in a special gluten-free food aisle or specialty food store that focuses on providing reliable and safe gluten-free identification for its food products.


Letting the vendor do the work for you provides extra reassurance that you have selected a gluten-free flour.

Learn the variations in flour options.",How to Know What Flour to Use for Gluten Free Baking3," If you will be using gluten-free flour for a bake sale, cookie exchange, or gathering at your own home, you may wish to test the recipe with your selected flour in a small batch in advance. This will prevent the unpleasant surprise of hard cupcakes, dry cake, chewy bread, an over- or under-baked pie shell, and some of the other challenges certain gluten-free flours pose for certain recipes.

, Certain flours carry flavors and textures, baking times, colors, and characteristics that do not equate to traditional wheat flours.


Taste and test recipes with different gluten-free flours (such as potato or rice flour) and then compare them to the same recipe using another flour (such as soy or bean flour) to get a feel for the influence on the final product each flour has on particular types of baked goods.

Look for a gluten-free label.,
Check for an allergen listing.,
Read the ingredients list thoroughly.,
Avoid it if you’re unsure.",How to Choose Gluten‐Free Candy1," Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is a disorder that causes symptoms after ingesting gluten-containing food in people who do not have Celiac Disease or a wheat allergy.Even for those who do not have Celiac disease or NCGS, following a gluten-free diet is becoming more popular, which has inspired some food and beverage companies to put “gluten-free” on the packaging of their items. When a candy clearly states on its packaging that it is gluten-free, it is probably safe for you to consume. As long as a packaged product contains less than 20ppm of gluten, the FDA allows the company to use the “gluten-free” label.


To be safe, you should still read through the list of ingredients on the candy’s packaging for any red flags.
Keep in mind that an item labelled as “wheat-free” doesn’t always mean it is gluten-free.;
, This information is usually located near the ingredient listing. Avoid any product that states it “contains wheat” in the allergen listing. This is not a fool-proof method, unfortunately. Just because an item has no allergen listing on its package does not necessarily mean it’s gluten-free. However, a “contains wheat” label will tell you when you should avoid something.


Many gluten-sensitive people cannot eat barley and rye. However, these two items are not required to be listed as allergens.Skim through the list of ingredients for any sources of gluten., Becoming an excellent label reader is your first line of defense for avoiding gluten. The four major red flags to look for in the ingredients are wheat, barley, rye, triticale, and oats due to cross-contamination (unless they are labeled as gluten-free oats).Once those have been ruled out, you need to look a little deeper for hidden sources of wheat. “Caramel color” is sometimes made from barley or other grain products. “Dextrin” and “maltodextrin” may contain wheat. “Graham” is a wheat derivative, as well as “malt.” A listing of “starch” is safe to consume, but “wheat starch” is not.


Look for malted barley flour, malted milk or milkshakes, malt extract, malt syrup and malt flavoring in the ingredients. If any of these are found, avoid the item.Although less likely to be found in candy, it never hurts to confirm the following are not listed as ingredients – wheat flour, bulgur, couscous, dinkle, durum, einkorn, emmer, fu, graham, kamut, seitan, semolina, wheatberries and spelt., If you’re on a strict gluten-free diet and you cannot confirm the ingredients in a candy product, it is better and safer for you to avoid it. If a list of ingredients isn’t provided at all, definitely think twice about consuming it. Even a food item that you know never contains gluten may have had a recent recipe tweak. Inquire and if you can’t confirm, avoid the product.For more information on leading a gluten-free lifestyle, visit https://celiac.org.

Avoid cooking things that have to rise.,
Weigh your cassava flour.,
Use a 1:1 ratio as a replacement for wheat flour recipes.,
Start with recipes that you know.,
Purchase pure cassava flour without artificial additives.,
Adjust recipes that contain yeast.,
Understand that cassava flour is not tapioca flour.",How to Cook with Cassava Flour1," Cassava flour is denser and works great in products like cookies and brownies, but perform poorly in bread that has to rise significantly. Avoid using cassava flour in recipes that require your food to rise like cakes. Food created with cassava flour will typically be a bit denser than if you used an all-purpose flour or other flour that contains gluten.Cassava flour is great for recipes like tortillas, pita bread, cookies, and brownies.;
, While a measuring cup typically works in many cooking scenarios, cassava flour is denser than traditional wheat flour. For this reason, you'll want to measure your flour before you use it in a recipe using a digital scale. If you don't have a scale, the most accurate way to measure your flower is by fluffing it up and then scooping it using a measuring a spoon. This will prevent it from packing down. Once you're done measuring, level it off with a butter knife or other straight utensil., In many situations, cassava flour will work with a 1:1 ratio where you would usually use wheat flour.The only exception is when you are dealing with recipes that must rise or use yeast, as the flour is known to be denser and has issues rising.

Cassava flour does not have the same nutritional value as wheat, so if you do decide to use it, make sure you are supplementing your diet with other foods that contain vitamins and nutrients., To become acclimated with how to properly use cassava flour, you should begin working it into the recipes that you are already used to making. Take note on how using the cassava flour changes the consistency and taste of your food. Determine if you like using the flour before incorporating it into more complex recipes.

Once you feel comfortable using cassava flour, start to experiment with other recipes.
Cassava flour will impart a subtle earthy, and nutty flavor to whatever you're cooking. Take this into consideration when creating dishes., Look for products that say 100 percent Yuca (cassava) on the label. Avoid products that use artificial ingredients or fillers because these brands of flour aren't as healthy as pure cassava flour. Pure cassava flour will have one ingredient: Yuca.Sometimes cassava flour will be called manioc flour.A popular cassava flour is Otto's Naturals., If you are making a recipe that calls for yeast, you can use Xanthan Gum as a replacement. Xanthan Gum helps bind the cassava flour together. If you're not vegan, adding an extra egg to a recipe may also help bind foods that call for yeast.For most recipes, add 1/2 tsp (2.46 ml) xanthan gum for each cup of flour that you're using., While tapioca and cassava flour and made from the same root, they differ in use significantly. Tapioca flour is traditionally used as a thickening agent and works well in things like pudding or sauces while cassava flour can be used as a replacement for all purpose or gluten free flours. Do not get the two confused when buying your cassava flour.Tapioca is the extracted starch of the cassava root, while cassava flour is made by grinding and peeling the whole root."

Look for candy that is known to be safe and gluten-free.,
Choose a basic lollipop.,
Select pure dark chocolate.,
Go with hard candy mints.",How to Choose Gluten‐Free Candy2," Not all candies come with convenient packaging, especially in specialty candy shops or at events. However, there are some candies that are typically considered safe to consume. Keep in mind that there is still a chance these items may contain gluten. However, they are widely known to almost always be gluten-free.For additional helpful tips, visit the Celiac Disease Foundation's website at https://celiac.org/live-gluten-free/glutenfreediet/food-options/.

, As long as the lollipop doesn’t have any special fillings, it should be safe for consumption. If it does contain a filling, like bubblegum, avoid it – some bubblegums are known to contain gluten. Plain, regular lollipops are typically gluten-free and probably safe to consume., Dark chocolate is generally always gluten-free because it mostly contains only fats and sugar. Look for dark chocolate with the highest cocoa percentage, since these are considered to be safer. Do not choose dark chocolate candy that has any kind of flavorings or additives. The safest option is pure dark chocolate.


Fruits, nuts and a variety of spices are the most common additives to look out for., Plain hard candy mints, such as most peppermints and spearmints, are usually gluten-free and safe to consume. This does not include mint-flavored candies, however. To be safe, any kind of mint outside of plain hard candy mints should probably be avoided."

Instead of getting a grain or corn based tortilla, consider making your tortillas using cassava flour., Sweet baking recipes like brownies or cookies work well with cassava flour. If you are vegan or vegetarian and don't eat eggs, you can replace them with something like a pumpkin puree or applesauce to bind your brownies together.Create the brownies as you naturally would, and add more flour for denser, richer brownies., Cassava flour lends itself well to making pancake batter. Cassava will usually absorb more liquid than traditional flour, so keep this in mind when making your recipe. For this reason, you'll most likely have to add extra milk or eggs to the recipe that you are making., You can replace the yeast or egg that is found in traditional pizza crust with 2 tbsp baking powder. To compensate for how much liquid cassava flour can absorb, make sure to match each cup of cassava flour with a half a cup of warm water.You can also combine cassava flour with other flours like coconut flour to help it bind together."

Spread on rustic bread or toss it onto freshly cooked pasta — the residual heat from the noodles won't affect the properties of raw garlic.


This recipe is very easy to adjust by taste as you go. Start with one clove of garlic for a large bowl of pesto and increase if desired. Two cloves may overpower other flavors.;
, Another Mediterranean sauce that understand the value of garlic, aioli can add flavor to sandwiches, chicken salad, and many other dishes.

Crush the garlic to a smooth paste with a pestle.
Pour olive oil drop by drop into the garlic paste as you continue grinding it with a smooth motion.
Keep this up for at least twenty minutes, as the garlic slowly absorbs oil. The finished aioli should be so thick you can turn the mortar upside-down.

, Every Mexican dish needs salsa, every salsa needs spice, and garlic is a great way to fill that need. Try these recipes for jalapeño salsa, chipotle salsa, or cooked salsa (with raw garlic added after cooking).


If avocados are in season, make guacamole. If your usual recipe doesn't use garlic, try adding one clove. Any more and you may need to reduce the amount of onion or peppers to compensate.

, A basic vinaigrette is the easiest salad dressing you can make. One or two cloves of garlic, very finely minced, makes an excellent addition to a small bottle of the dressing. You can also use it in more complex variations, such as this tart recipe:Chop one large garlic clove and two or three leaves fresh basil
Whisk together 3 tbsp (45 mL) olive oil and 1 tbsp (15 mL) raspberry vinegar
Stir in garlic and basil along with 2 tsp (10 mL) brown sugar, ½ tsp (2.5 mL) Dijon mustard.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.

, Better hold your next meeting over the phone — this will leave its mark on your breath. Mince the garlic extra fine, mash it into a pat of butter, and spread it on toast for an eye-opening breakfast.

Make gazpacho.",How to Eat Raw Garlic2," Mashed potatoes can hide anything, right? Well, raw garlic might test its limits. If you're eating raw garlic purely for health benefits, mince it as finely as you can and stir it into your potatoes once they've cooled down a little. You'll still taste it, but the cream and starch should help spare your sinuses.

, This may sound like a strange combination, but the goal is to hide the garlic, not to create a new favorite snack. Ohio State researches discovered that raw apple can break down the compounds that cause garlic breath.Place thinly sliced garlic between two slices of apple and you may manage to hide the flavor as well as the evidence.


The compounds that cause garlic breath are part of the same group of compounds that are often credited with health benefits. The exact link is unclear, but it is possible this method could undermine your goals.
Parsley, spinach, and mint had the same effect in this study, making them good choices for a post-garlic breath freshener.

, This garlic isn't exactly raw; the pickling process does reduce the amount of beneficial compounds, but not as much as prolonged cooking does.Pickled garlic is less intense than raw garlic, so you can add several cloves to sautéed vegetables, salad dressings, and other recipes without overpowering other flavors.The easiest way to peel large numbers of garlic cloves for canning is to blanch them. Keep them in the water for less than five minutes to minimize the effect on nutrition., This chilled soup is a blend of several raw vegetables, usually with tomatoes and stale bread as the base. Although the linked recipe blanches the garlic for three minutes, this is probably not long enough to break down the raw nutrients.If you'd like to keep it 100% raw, simply blend raw garlic along with the rest of the vegetables.

Read the assets. Assets include cash, investments, property and other things owned by the company that have value. The assets are listed in order of liquidity. The most liquid assets, such as cash, are presented first.
Review the liabilities. Liabilities are debts or obligations that the company owes to others. These include rent, payroll, taxes, loan payments and money owed to other vendors or contractors.
Notice the difference between current liabilities and long term liabilities. Current liabilities are things that will be paid off within a year. Long term liabilities will take more than a year.

, This will show you how much money the company earned over the specified period of time. Any money that was spent in earning that income will also be reflected.


Read the top line, which should say ""sales"" or ""gross revenue."" This reflects the amount of money the company made by providing its products or services, before any expenses are deducted.
Review the operating expenses. These include the costs of doing business, such as salaries and advertising.
Notice the depreciation line. This reflects the cost of an asset over the amount of time it can be used by the company.
Check the operating profit, which is the amount of money the company made after the operating expenses are deducted.
Look at the amount of interest that was earned and paid. These amounts added (interest income) and subtracted (interest paid) from the operating profit total.
Check the amount of income tax that was subtracted.
Read the last line of the income statement. This reflects the net profit or loss.

, This will tell you how much cash the company has available. It will also track the money coming in and out of the company during the specified time.


Read about the operating activities first. This section analyzes how the company's cash was used in order to reach its net profit or loss.
Check the investment activities. This part of the cash flow statement shows any income from investments or assets that were sold.
Look at the financing activities. This tracks what the company did to pay back or acquire things such as bank loans.

, Accounting professionals will often provide a paragraph that provides an overview of the financial report.

, There are usually back-up or supporting documents available, such as receipts and invoices, that help explain transactions.

Protest safely!",How to Plan a Demonstration," It’s much easier to organize a demonstration for a cause many people believe in and understand. For example, “the government is bad” is too vague, but “the state government has cut funding for education” is specific enough to attract supporters., Most demonstrations are going to be too big to organize on your own. Talk to people who believe in your cause and ask them to form an organizing committee with you.


Look for committee members at other demonstrations, online groups dedicated to your cause, and among your social circle.
Ask potential committee members if they have experience organizing demonstrations. It’s not a requirement, but previous experience will definitely help!
Try to organize a diverse committee. This will help your event be inclusive and aware of issues you might not consider, such as disability access., Picketing is a group of people holding signs and marching in front of a specific location while chanting loudly. This is good for smaller, local protests focused against something very specific, like a business accused of mistreating workers.

, Vigils consist of people standing quietly at a specific location, often at night while holding candles. This kind of event is good for large or small groups, and is especially useful for larger, symbolic causes, like ending community violence.

, Sit-ins involve a group of people walking into a space and refusing to leave until their demands are met. Sit-ins are more controversial, and are best for smaller groups with very specific demands, like the resignation of a public official.

, Marches are organized groups of people disrupting traffic by walking a planned route through a city. Marches are best for very large groups, and work well for general, nationwide causes, like a disputed election., Daytime weekend events in the spring and summer months are best for gathering the largest groups, but if your cause is tied to a specific event like an election, time it as closely to the event as possible. Locations should be in easy-to-find places and in an area with high traffic, like an urban park, the main street of town, or the front gates of a university., Protests can’t happen without money, so start planning right away for expenses! Be flexible with your budget--if your event grows unexpectedly, so will your costs.


Permits may cost money in some areas. Check ahead of time to be sure.
Megaphones and sound systems will be needed at even small protests.
Supplies for signs and banners can add up quickly.
Large events will require food, water, and public facilities.
If you are supporting a controversial cause or live in an area with significant unrest, a legal defense or medical expenses fund may be a good idea., Most jurisdictions require you to obtain a permit before holding a protest--check with your city government for local requirements. You might also have to get permission from additional authorities, such as the police, university administration, or the parks department., A powerful public speaker can energize your protest and win bystanders over to your cause. A speaker doesn’t have to be somebody famous.Try asking leaders of local activist groups, university professors, union leaders, and even members of the organizing committee., Your friends probably have similar beliefs--talk to them about your protest! Get your friends and family involved first, but respect their wishes if they choose not to join in., Don’t just focus your publicity on worldwide social media platforms. Make sure people in the immediate area know what’s going on! Put up flyers at the protest location, ask local businesses to put a flyer in their window, and post to neighborhood-specific online groups., Set up a public page and link it across multiple social media platforms to reach the largest possible audience.


Be clear and concise! Your page should have an easy-to-find FAQ with basic information like time and location.
Update your page regularly, especially if the date or location changes!
Assign someone to moderate the page, especially if your cause is controversial., Having the local news at your protest will attract attention and interest, and will spread your cause further! Call or email your local newspaper or station--they are interested in local events and will want to know about your protest. Be sure to tell them the time, date, location, and cause., The event will be much easier to set up if everybody has an assigned task. Important jobs for a demonstration can be helping people find the location, updating the event page during the protest, coordinating food and water deliveries, setting up a sign-making party, and picking up litter after the demonstration ends., Be sure your protest site is visible to oncoming traffic, is on level ground, and is accessible for ambulances and fire trucks. If your protest is controversial or there has been unrest in your area, check to be sure your supporters are safe from physical attack by making sure they have an escape route and are clearly visible to the public., This is a great opportunity to have fun with your supporters. You can organize a casual get-together with everyone to make signs, or encourage them to make signs on their own and post them to the event page.


Gather your supplies--you’ll need cardboard, markers or paint, wooden stakes, and cloth for banners.
Plan your slogans before you make the sign.
Use contrasting colors for high visibility, such as black on white or red on yellow.
Make your signs as clear as possible. People who don't know anything about your cause should be able to learn something from your signs.
Be clever. Witty signs have gone viral online, spreading the cause worldwide!, On the morning of the event, check to make sure everything is in order. Make sure the organizing committee and speakers are accounted for, supplies have been delivered and set up, and all your permits are complete and ready to be presented., Make sure your supporters are safe from attack, arrest, and accidents, then take a moment to reflect on the event. You’ve made a difference in your community and brought people together for a common cause. That’s something to be proud of!

Familiarize yourself with potential publications.,
Choose the publication that best suits your research paper.,
Prepare your manuscript.,
Ask a colleague and/or professor to review your research paper.,
Revise your paper.,
Submit your article.,
Keep trying.",How to Publish a Research Paper," It is important to be aware of the research already published and the current questions and studies in your field. Pay special attention to how other research papers are written: the format, the type of articles (quantitative studies versus qualitative ones, primary research, review of existing papers), the writing style, the subject matter, and the vocabulary.


Read academic journals related to your field of study.
Search online for published research papers, conference papers, and journal articles.
Ask a colleague or professor for a suggested reading list.;
, Each publication has its own audience and tone of writing. Decide if your research paper would fit better in a journal that is highly technical and meant only for other scholars or a journal that is more general in nature that would appeal to a broader audience. Know your audience and write accordingly.

, Format your research paper so it fits the guidelines for that publication. Most journals provide a document called ""Instruction to Authors"" or ""Author's Guide"" that offers specific instructions about layout, type font, and length. This guide will also tell you how to submit your paper and will provide details of the review process.

, They should edit your paper for grammar, spelling errors, typos, clarity, and conciseness. At this time, they should also verify your content. Research papers need to present an issue that is significant and relevant. They should be clearly written, easy to follow, and appropriate for the intended audience. Have two or three people review your paper, more if possible.

, It is likely you will go through three or four drafts before final submission of your research paper. Make a special effort to make your paper clear, engaging, and easy to follow. This will greatly increase your chances of being published.

, Go back to the Author's Guide to review submission requirements. Once you are satisfied that your paper meets all of the guidelines, submit the paper through the appropriate channels. Some journals allow online submission, while others prefer a hard copy., Sometimes journals will ask you to revise your paper and resubmit. Study their critiques carefully and make the necessary changes. Do not get over-attached to your original submission. Instead, remain flexible and rework the paper in light of the feedback you received. Use all of your skills as a researcher and a writer to create a superior paper. Even if you are ultimately rejected by your ""target"" publication, continue to re-write your research paper and submit it to other publications.

Decide what type of protest you want to do.,
Research your local laws.,
Get a permit to protest if needed.,
Prepare for the worst to happen.,
Recruit speakers to motivate the crowd.,
Advertise your protest.",How to Peacefully Protest1," There are many forms of peaceful protest that can express dissatisfaction without resorting to violence, anger, or rioting. Your location, time, and permits may depend on the type of protest that you choose.Picketing is a type of rally where people hold up signs and chant slogans to express their complaints. In some cases, you may not need permits to picket.
Marching moves the rally through the streets. This allows you to get more visibility, but it requires more permits and organization.
A vigil is a quiet form of protest in which people gather silently at night to hold candles. They are often done to memorialize a tragedy.
A sit-in is a rally where people occupy a space or area. They may refuse to move until their demands are met or acknowledged.;
, In the United States, the government cannot deny you the right to protest, but they can set rules for how you do it. Check with your local city council or police to learn if you need permits to protest in your town. Ask them what laws or regulations there are surrounding protests.Generally, you can protest on the sidewalk without a permit as long as you are not blocking the way.
If you are planning to march, you will need to get permits to close the streets.
You may be required to get permission if you plan to use loud speakers.
If you are protesting on private property, you will need to get written permission from the property owner to protest.

, Permits are typically granted by the police or city council a few weeks before the protest. You will need to tell them the time, date, and location of the protest. Keep in mind that the government cannot deny you a permit based on what you're protesting.When you apply for a permit, you may be granted a police presence at the assembly to help keep the peace.
If your permit is denied, you may be able to appeal the decision. You can offer to change your route, time, or location., Many forms of civil disobedience, such as blocking traffic, are illegal. You can be fined or arrested for these acts. Even at a legal rally, there is always a risk that participants might be arrested. Understand these risks, and prepare yourself ahead of time just in case.Get legal representation ahead of the protest. If you are arrested, ask to call your lawyer immediately.
You may want to save money in advance to pay for bail or fines. Ask a partner, friend, or family member to pay your bail if necessary.
Do not plan to resist arrest., Speakers can help spread the cause by talking about the movement that you have started. They should also motivate the crowd to keep protesting. Short, brief, and proactive speeches are best.You should approve all speakers before the event. Remind them that this is a peaceful protest. They should not incite violence or encourage people to break the law.

, Once you have gotten all of the right permits, you can start advertising your protest. Make sure to specify that this will be a peaceful protest. Use bright colors and large fonts to catch people's eye. To advertise, you can:Post flyers in local coffee shops, university campuses, libraries, and other public venues.
Make an event page on a social media website and share it with your friends.
Inform the local news channel about the location of the protest.
Make an announcement at a society meeting, church, charity event, or other public gathering.

, If that list is short, do some research online to find out if others are talking about the problem in your area. Try to get a group of 3-10 people together to think about the solution.

, Don't worry if it doesn't seem like you alone can make it happen, that's what organizing is for. Write down ""the solution.""

, Now, how do you get to that solution? What actions are needed? Who has the power to decide to make your solution real? If this person is not likely to be influenced by you, who can influence them that you can influence? Be as concrete as possible, and target your actions (i.e. meeting, rally, letter writing campaign, voter turnout, etc.) to the person you feel will be influenced by you. Write down ""your target"" and ""your action plan.""

, Be strategic by going for the easiest supporters first. People are more likely to join you if they have personal contact with you. Spread your idea through any/all of the following avenues:


As a group identify who else you know who might be interested and what groups your group has access to that might support you
Talk to people on the street and collect contact information from supporters
Post your idea on forums online and set up a website/blog where people can join you
Use local media (don't forget about community television, radio, and papers which are great for launching an idea you can't get in the mainstream media).

, Start with easy things that a lot of people will do, and gradually invite them to become more involved until a few will want to be leaders with you and your initial group.

, Find out what new legislation is being proposed.

, Review candidates' positions and then support the ones that support your cause.


Alternately, Ignore voting and elections entirely and instead work on creating the change yourself through Direct Action (Actions that directly achieve the goals of a movement instead of requesting assistance from the Government).

, People want to feel good that they are making a difference, and sometimes the problem is so big it could take years to solve. If so, try to identify mini-victories along the way that can be celebrated.

, Take time to re-examine your plan to see if it's really accomplishing what you hoped to accomplish. Make changes if necessary.

, Even though this idea might have started with you, remember that you don't have all the answers and the best way to make change is to delegate and share decisions to build a healthy, long-lasting movement. The more democratic a movement it is the healthier it will be. Many grassroots organizations employ Consensus or Direct Democracy for this reason.

Work with the police to ensure that no violence occurs.,
Request a legal observer.,
Rope off the area where the crowd will protest.,
Designate marshals to help control the crowd.",How to Peacefully Protest2," A healthy, mutually respectful relationship with the police is a good way to ensure that neither side will become aggressive during the protest. Visit the police station before your protest to talk to a representative about how to keep the protest peaceful.A police presence is not a bad thing. If there are people who oppose your cause, the police can protect the protestors. They can also help keep the protest organized.
If you are planning on having a police presence, tell your volunteers in advance. Remind them that the police are there to protect them, not to harm or arrest them.

, A legal observer is a lawyer that will observe the protest to make sure that it follows the law. They can help keep protestors in line by discouraging illegal activity. If protestors are arrested, they will work with the police on their behalf. If the police overstep their boundaries, the legal observer will record the details of the event to file a complaint later.You can hire legal observers from a local law firm. Civil rights organizations may also have legal staff that can be loaned out to the protest.
A legal observer will not protect protestors if they break the law. They are there to make sure that no laws are broken, either by the police or by the protestors.

, It is a good idea to keep the crowd contained. Not only can this prevent the protest from spreading out uncontrollably, but it will also help your crowd look larger and more organized in photographs. This will help you advertise your cause in later protests., A large group of core volunteers will need to help manage the protest. These volunteers should be responsible for controlling the crowd, handing out flyers, and enforcing the rules.If some protesters start to heckle people or vandalize, the marshals can talk them down before the violence spreads.
If the police are acting aggressively towards peaceful protestors, the marshals can talk to the police to help negotiate a peaceful resolution.
If the protest will be moving, the marshals can help keep the crowd in line so that it does not spread out beyond its designated boundary.

Wear clearly identifiable clothing to associate yourself with the cause.,
Create signs that explain your cause.,
Hand out flyers to advertise your cause.,
Interact with police in a calm and respectful manner.,
Protect yourself in case something goes wrong.",How to Peacefully Protest3," Many different types of people can join a protest. There may be police, medics, and counter-protestors at the event as well as advocates for your cause. To associate yourself with the peaceful protest, wear bright, identifiable clothing that has the logo, slogans, or colors of the cause you are working with.For example, if you are at a protest for LGBT rights, you may want to wear rainbow clothing, as this is an identifiable sign of the cause.
If counter-protestors start causing problems, this clothing can identify you as part of the peaceful crowd.

, A good protest will gain visibility for a cause by catching the eyes of people passing by. Picket signs are a great way to show why you’re protesting without confronting people.Make short but catchy slogans for your signs, such as “Stopping pollution is the only solution” or “If you can read this, thank a teacher.”
Avoid slogans that bully, insult, or dehumanize other people. For example, if you are protesting a local law, you should avoid calling your political representatives names like “idiots.” Instead, criticize the law itself.

, Instead of yelling at or assaulting spectators, you should make sure that they understand your cause. Flyers should contain information on where the person can learn more about the cause. List a website, email, or charity that the person can contact.

You may want to collect emails at the protest so that you can contact people afterwards to continue the good work. Spectators can give their email address to learn more.
Informative flyers should contain bullet points with the most important facts and persuasive statistics.
You may want to include information on how someone can become involved in the cause. For example, you might include the mailing address for your political representatives or the date for your next action meeting.

, If you are arrested at the protest, you should not resist, even if you believe that you are being unfairly treated. Instead, cooperate with the police to ensure that you are not charged for other crimes.Ask if you are being arrested. If they say yes, do not resist. Instead, ask to speak to your lawyer or the legal observer.
Be honest about your identity. Hand over your ID when requested. You do not have to answer any other questions.
If you believe that the police are unfairly arresting someone, remember that interfering with the arrest is a crime. Instead, document the arrest by filming it or writing down the officer’s badge number and name.

, Protests can be unpredictable. Even if you are peaceful yourself, some disruptions can still occur. In that case, make sure that you are prepared to get yourself out of the situation safely.It is best to have a buddy or group of friends with you at the protest. If something happens, help each other get out of the situation safely.
Bring any essential medications, even if you do not think you will need to take them during the protest. This includes inhalers and epipens.
Take some extra cash in case you need to get a taxi or use a payphone to call for help.

Use a Venn diagram to show relationships.,
Make a ""universe."",
Pick two classifications.,
Add information to your classifications.,
Establish what overlaps.,
Redraw your circles.,
Fill in each circle.,
Fill in the overlapped section.,
Add a third classification.",How to Make a Venn Diagram1," A Venn diagram shows where ideas or things intersect. They usually consist of two or three overlapping circles.Venn diagrams use sets of things. ""Sets"" is a mathematical term that means a collection. In math, sets are denoted by curlicue brackets, such as in the following example: ""birds: {parrots, parakeets, finches, doves, cardinals}"";
, A universe is in the context of Venn diagrams means what you're dealing with at the moment, not the whole universe. For instance, you could say your universe is ""Foods."" Write that at the top of the page. You can also create a rectangle around your Venn diagram marked ""Foods."", ""Classifications"" just means how you are organizing things. For instance, you could have the two classifications ""Foods Eaten in the Morning"" and ""Foods Eaten at Night."", Draw a circle for each classification. Once you've done that, start filling up the circles with items. For instance, in ""Foods Eaten in the Morning,"" you could have eggs, bacon, pancakes, strawberries, tomatoes, spinach, yogurt, leftover pizza, sausage, and waffles. For ""Foods Eaten at Night,"" you may come up with leftover pizza, ramen noodles, strawberries, tomatoes, spinach, ice cream, lasagna, chicken tenders, and sushi., You may notice that certain items are in both lists. In the example, strawberries, tomatoes, spinach, and leftover pizza are in both categories. This overlap is called a ""union"" in mathematical terms and is sometimes represented by this symbol: ""∪"" You'd show a union of sets in mathematical terms this way: ""Foods Eaten in the Morning ∪ Foods Eaten at Night: {strawberries, tomatoes, spinach, and leftover pizza}"", Go back to your circles. Redraw the circles, but this time, overlap the middle part of one side. Label one circle as ""Foods Eaten in the Morning"" and the other one ""Foods Eaten at Night."", Don't add the overlapping words yet. In ""Foods Eaten in the Morning,"" write ""eggs, bacon, pancakes, yogurt, sausage, and waffles."" In ""Foods Eaten at Night,"" add ""ramen noodles, ice cream, lasagna, chicken tenders, and sushi."" Keep these words out of the overlapping section., In the overlapping section, write the words they have in common. In the example, write ""strawberries, tomatoes, spinach, and leftover pizza."" That shows that the two circles have those in common., If you want, you can add another classification, such as ""Foods Eaten Midday."" In this case, all three circles overlap, creating shared spaces between each set of two circles, as well as a shared space in the middle between all three circles. Save the center for what all three classifications have in common."

Decide what you want to learn from administering your questionnaire.Ask yourself what data you require and how you will use it.,
Plan questions that will help you get the information you need.,
Use closed-ended questions to gather specific answers.,
Use open-ended questions to solicit feedback.,
Ask questions in such a way as to avoid confusion and bias.,
Think about how you will deliver your questionnaire.,
Design your questionnaire according to your delivery method.,
Consider the order of your questions.,
Decide if you will offer incentives for completing the questionnaire.,
Test your questionnaire before you begin surveying people.,
Review your data to understand what your questionnaire was really asking.,
Further revise your questions.,
Review your open-ended questions.,
Decide how you will respond to missing data.,
Review what sort of feedback you are receiving.",How to Make a Questionnaire," This will help you come up with useful questions, as well as the order in which you will ask them. Ideally, the questionnaire will be short, so decide which of your goals are essential and which might be unnecessary. , Begin with a broad span of questions, then narrow them down until each one relates to your goals in some way. Keep questions and answers simple, using as few words as possible. You may want to rely on open-ended questions, closed-ended questions, or a mix of the two.

, Closed-ended questions have a specific range of options respondents can choose from. These questions may be yes-or-no questions, true-or-false questions, or questions that ask the respondent to agree or disagree with a statement. Closed-ended questions may look like open-ended questions, but will have only a few options respondents can use to answer. Closed-ended questions might look like these:


""Have you shopped here before?""
""If so, how often do you shop here?"" (This question would have a few explicit answers from which respondents could choose--""once a week"" to ""once a month,"" for instance)
""How satisfied were you with your experience today?"" (Likewise, this question would have limited responses--""very satisfied"" to ""very dissatisfied"")
""Would you recommend this store to a friend?""

, Open-ended questions solicit answers that you may not anticipate, and do not have a specific range of answers to choose from. Open-ended questions are a chance for respondents to communicate their specific experience or expectations. Such questions might look like these:


""How will you use your purchase?""
""Where else do you normally shop?""
""Who referred you to this store?""
Open-ended questions are good for clarifying a previous answer--""Why do you feel this way?""

, Avoid leading questions especially; Leading questions indicate that the asker is looking for a certain answer and will limit what answers your responders are comfortable supplying. Either tailor possible answers or change the wording of your question so as to avoid leading your respondents to answer in a particular way.


You may consider asking the same question in different ways, which may reduce overall respondent bias and give you a better chance of finding the person's true opinion on a given topic.Questions should be worded so as to maximize clarity. Confused respondents will skew your data, so questions should be as understandable as possible. Avoid double negatives, unnecessary clauses, or unclear subject-object relationships.

, There are many options open to you. You may use an online service to design your questionnaire. You can then send links to your questionnaire over e-mail. You may use a phone or mail campaign to cold-call respondents. Or you can execute a campaign in-person, using professionals or volunteers to lead surveys.

, There are advantages and disadvantages to each method, and each method has limits on what you can do. Ask yourself which delivery method best suits the subject matter of your questionnaire, as well as the data you want to receive. For instance:


Surveys delivered on the computer, by phone, and by mail can reach a broad range of people, whereas surveys administered in-person are time-intensive and limits who can participate (which may be useful).
Surveys delivered on the computer, in person, and by mail can utilize pictures, whereas phone interviews cannot.
Respondents may be too shy to answer certain questions in person or by phone. Decide if you want to give clarifications to your questions if the respondent doesn't understand something; only interviews given by a live person can deliver clarifications.
A computer survey will require the respondent to have access to a computer. If your questionnaire concerns private issues, a computer survey may work best. , The form of your questionnaire matters just as much as its content. You should aim to order questions so that they follow each other logically or mark clear shifts from section to section. Other kinds of questions may impact how a respondent fills out the questionnaire.


You may want to order the questions so that if a person says yes or no to a certain question, they bypass any questions that don't apply to them. This will help keep the questionnaire focused and take less time to complete.
""Qualifiers"" are questions that screen certain respondents out, preventing them from completing other questions. Position these at the beginning of your questionnaire.
If demographics are of major concern, ask demographic questions up front.
Save personal or complicated questions for the end of the questionnaire. Respondents will not feel as overwhelmed by these questions and may be more likely to be open and honest.

, It's often easier to attract respondents if you offer something in return for their time. Online, mail, or phone questionnaires could offer a coupon after questionnaire completion. In-person questionnaires could offer merchandise in exchange for participation. Questionnaires are also a good way to attract attention to mailing lists or membership offers, which may otherwise go unnoticed by respondents.

, Friends, employees and family members can be good testers. You may have them try your questionnaire while it's still in development, or you may have them test a finished draft.


Ask your testers for feedback. They may alert you to sections that confused them or felt out of place. User impressions about the questionnaire are just as important as the actual questionnaire.
After you test, do some number crunching to ensure you are collecting the data you need. If you are not getting the information you want, adjust the questionnaire. You may need to reword some things, add introductions, or rearrange, add, or delete questions so your questionnaire leads you toward your goals.

, Remember that a questionnaire is often part of a larger campaign. They can be altered and reused multiple times in order to target different demographics, ask different questions, or better align with your goals. After reviewing your results, you may find that, though your questions make sense, they aren't quite the right ones you need to achieve your goals.


For instance, you may find that a question such as ""How often do you shop here?"" limits your demographic to those who shop at a brick-and-mortar store. If you want to see how people purchase a specific product, you may want to broaden your question to include online shopping.
Your implementation method may also be limiting your data. For instance, surveys administered online may be answered largely by respondents with higher-than-average computer knowledge.

, Some of your questions may work during testing, but may not work as well out in the field. Your questions must make sense to the specific demographic you are targeting. Ask yourself if your respondents are truly understanding what is being asked, or if your survey is so standard that respondents are not responding thoughtfully.


For instance, a question such as, ""Why do you shop here?"" may be too broad a question, which could mislead your respondents. If you want to know if the store's decor has an impact on shopping habits, you could instead ask respondents to describe how they feel about the store's decor, branding, etc.

, See if your open-ended questions are working the way you need them to work. They may be too open, in which case respondents may ramble. They may not be open enough, in which case the data you received won't be as valuable. Ask yourself what role your open-ended questions are playing in your questionnaire and tailor them as needed.


As above, broad questions such as, ""How do you feel while shopping here?"" may not give your respondents enough direction. You could instead ask, ""Would you recommend this store to your friends? Why or why not?""

, Not all respondents will answer all questions, which may or may not be a problem for you. Ask yourself which questions are being skipped or answered incompletely, if at all. This may be due to the order of the questions, the wording of the questions, or the subject matter of the questions. If missing data is important, consider rewording skipped questions to make them more or less specific.

, See if you have unusual trends in your data and decide if this reflects reality or if this is due to a flaw in your questionnaire. For instance, your closed-question answers will limit the sort of information your respondents can give you. Your answers may be so limited as to make strong opinions look the same as weak opinions, or may not provide for a full range of reasonable answers.


For instance, if you are asking respondents to rate an experience, you should provide them with the option to respond with ""very dissatisfied"" as well as ""very satisfied,"" and many options in between.

Begin preparing your financial report by balancing your company's financial holdings.,
Create a statement of the company's income.,
Calculate shareholders' equity or earnings per share (EPS).,
Finish the report with an accounting of the amount of cash the company has brought in or spent.",How to Prepare a Financial Report,"


The balance sheets in a financial report provide an overview of what the company currently owns (assets), the amount of debt owed (liabilities) and the profits it has made that will be paid out to shareholders (equity).
Use your company's preferred financial report template to organize the information. On this component of your financial report, you can place the assets on the left side of the page or on the top of the page. Present liabilities and shareholders' ownership in the company on the right side or the bottom of the page.;
, The statement of comprehensive income, also known as the profit and loss statement, shows how much money your company has earned and the amount of money it has lost during a year.


The top line of this statement shows total sales or gross revenue. The lines that follow deduct the gross discounts and returns of products, cost to sale products, operating expenses (including salaries and marketing expenses), and depreciation of items used to produce products such as tools and machinery.
After the operations and sales deductions, add income from interest earned on funds. If your company is paying interest on a loan, deduct that amount. Next, deduct income tax.
The remaining amount is your bottom line or the actual profits and losses during the specific earnings period.

, This section of your financial report is the statement of changes in equity.


To determine the EPS, divide total net income from the income statement by the number of shares currently owned by investors.

, This information is known as cash flow statements.


Create this section of the report by analyzing the figures noted in the assets, liabilities, equity, and income portions of the report.
When evaluating the circulation of cash in your company include an analysis of all operating, investing and financing activities.

Deal with the issues after the Review.",How to Make the ITIL Process Review," Inputs for the Review might be the trigger document, such as a Higher Management Order, Terms of Reference Review Exercise (for example, after identified inconsistencies, management proposes an Asset Management Review exercise) and current process documentation. On the average, the time of the Review is one to two months, and performed by two reviewers. The Review resource consumption can vary depending on enterprise size and process complexity. Reviewers can be internal resources (managers, analysts etc); however, using external resources for the Review can be beneficial, because it brings unprejudiced view on the process. In order to identify the outputs, objectives and scope of the Review the “Work package IT Process Review” document can be created. This document might include the following paragraphs:



“Assignment” paragraph that describes the objective, rationale, theme, key resources, main stakeholders of the Review.

“Timeline” of the Review (start date and draft finalization, final review report date, final presentation deadlines).

“Scope” can be depicted from several perspectives: organizational, geographical, review depth and extend (covering only some of process activities or deliverables), other special perspectives related to the particular process; e.g. for Asset Management, it can be the types of IT assets.

“Reporting” describes what, when and whom to report the review status. Usually, the reviewer has to report to the management or interested staff, e.g. process owner, project manager of capability development project) regarding the status of the Review on weekly or daily basis. The report can have the following structure:

Activities done on this week;
Activities planned for next week;
Issues impede the Review (e.g. resistance to provide or no permission to access needed information).



“Evidences”. It is also useful to point the place where all files related to the Review have to be stored.

“Main activities” of the Review has to described and later included into Review Plan.

“Issue management and Escalation” paragraph has to guide how to maintain the issue log and how to escalate the issues encountered during the Review (e.g. lack of or insufficient collaboration, lack of time, etc)

“Products” will show the list of intermediate/supporting results (Findings, Product Lifecycle, Management reference processes), end results (Review Report, Review Summary or Process Improvement Strategy) and needed approvals of the resulted documents.;
, Every time, it is useful to have a Review Plan in order to control the pace of the Review. The basic Plan can have the following activities:

, The most common stakeholders of any process are (from most important for the Review):


Process owner;
Business users / External users (e.g. for Asset Management: Finance and Audit dept. representatives);
Other business supporting teams (e.g. for Asset Management: Logistics, Custodians etc);
Team Leader (Process Manager);
IT functions (for example, for Asset Management: Project Managers, Contract Holders, On-Site Support, Service Desk, Technology Management, end users and Change Management, Configuration Management Team, Change Management, Request Management, Security teams);
Process Team members (Process administrators/analysts);
Representatives from IT Governance and Controls Teams;
Representatives from other teams involved into the process;
Subject matter experts (particularly former managers).

, Reviewer has to identify key business requirements of the process, that can be provided by business process teams used the IT process (e.g. Finance dept for Asset Management process), driven from legislation, business policy etc.

, Start to create the level 1 and 2 process flowchart based on current situation (including inputs/outputs and stakeholders of the process) and create product workflow (e.g. asset life cycle that shows the owners of the asset for Asset Management process) in order to keep the real picture of the process and to use them as a references.

, Process controls can be taken from the Controls Framework (e.g. derived from ISO/IEC 27002 or COBIT) and embedded into the process/product workflow (e.g. asset lifecycle with “ownership” controls for Asset Management process).

, The Findings can be identified by:


Comparing actual process activities to the process documentation;
Interviewing and analyzing the actual activities performed within the process.
Analyzing process data quality (e.g. for Asset and Configuration Management process: CMDB).

Common Findings are:

Process model/procedure and work instructions are available but incomplete, not reflecting process requirements and actual activities of the process.
Roles and responsibilities across the lifecycle are not clearly defined. Also responsibilities across teams are not clearly defined and agreed.
Ownership is not assured across the lifecycle in terms of formal owner and/or physical ownership.
Missing controls and labor intensive solutions and manual controls (excel sheets) not guaranteed to be up to date, consistent and complete.





Analysis of process documentation. One of the crucial steps of the Review is analysis of documentation related to the process that includes:

Policy Framework;
Controls Framework;
Model/Procedures;
Work instructions;
KPIs, reports and logs;
Job Aids, Forms and Templates;
And so forth.



, While identifying findings, reviewer interviews stakeholders trying to cover all of them. In order to perform interview successfully, prepare questions prior to the interview organizing questions, by process activities, tasks or findings. Do not forget to make MoMs (Minute of Meetings), especially when it is agreed to provide the information needed for Review. All findings can be confirmed or refined by stakeholders during the interview.

, Process metrics are needed to show the current state of the process and can be requested from the process team (e.g. for Asset Management process: number of assets, , number of changes per period, purchases by period, number of assets per location, type or movements).

, Each Finding can have possible solutions that can be provided by the reviewer, main of them are:


Review, update and agree process model/procedure and work instructions, Define and agree roles and responsibilities.
Document and embed all required work instructions.
Define and embed missing controls. Ensure ownership across the lifecycle by defining and embedding more strict controls.
Review and clean up registers, journals and databases to reflect current status of the enterprise.
Automation of the processes.
Delegate administrative tasks between teams based on updated instructions.
Formalize existing activities and integration with other processes.

, Outputs of the process Review are:

, All process errors and inconsistencies identified during the Review have to be kept in special file named as Findings Log (for convenience, it is better to use Excel sheet). Possible structure of the file with columns as follows:




Id – Unique identification of the finding;
Short – Short title of the finding that has to clearly state the problem. E.g. for Asset Management: The process for disposing an asset is not defined;
Description – Full description of the finding including evidences and related facts;
Process Step – E.g. for Asset Management: Order an Asset, Receive an Asset etc.;
Stakeholders – Stakeholders who are involved into the finding;
Document – Related process documentation;
Impact – Impact that can negatively affect the company: Critical, Major, Average, Minor
Impact Clarification – This column has to prove the impact status;
Follow up – Steps that are needed to eliminate the findings. E.g. establish the process, update Process Model or update Work Instruction.
Link to Evidences – All Findings have to be supported by appropriate relevant documented evidences. E.g. process documentation, different databases (for Asset Management, it is Asset Register), filled forms, email correspondence or training register.



, The essential output of the review is Process Review Report document with the purpose to report of IT Process Review conducted on in some IT organizational structure. The final document has to be reviewed and approved by Team Lead (manager), Process Owner and Process Owner’s Line Manager. Since the document is read by management, it has to be short (20-25 pages) and meaningful as much as possible. The Review Document usually has following structure:




Executive summary. Short description of the purpose of the document, key findings and key recommendations. As the main part of document, it has to be concise (1-2 pages) and comprehensive.


Introduction has to include:

The purpose and scope (with “out of scope”) of the Review.
Intended audience (e.g. leadership teams, business teams)
Timelines
Key activities conducted for the Review.


Process stakeholders and contacts
Some statistical information about a process including the source of information.
Listing of key requirements for the process
One page report about physical verification if it is conducted, e.g. for Asset and Configuration Management, it can be audit, physical review or inventory.
The controls applied to the process:

Control Description
Control appliance state (e.g. for Asset Management, IT asset ownership flow with ownership controls can be provided


High level view (Findings can be grouped into 7-10 high-level Findings) on Findings including:



Title and short description
Impact
Impact description
Possible solutions


Relation between findings and review scope in a form of table with scope list as rows and Findings as columns with colored intersections - dark color for close relation, light color for weak one. This can help to view the “weak” places of the process.
Proposed steps to mitigate the risks and resolve findings
Annexes

Process documentation
List of Findings (usually hyperlink to the excel findings).





, While not a mandatory output of the Review, this may be the Review Summary with the following contents:


Purpose and Scope
Some numbers
Key requirements
Physical verification overview
Controls
High-level view of findings
Relation between Findings and Review Scope
Further steps to do.

, Another output for of the Review can be the Process Improvement Strategy Presentation made for management and business processes users. This document may include:


Main identified problems and possible solutions;
Current process vs. improved process (describing changes in process flow needed the improvement);
High-level plan to implement the improvements.

, After the Process Review Report is agreed by the organization's Leadership Team usually, all identified issues are added as risks into organization's Risk Mitigation Plan. Track them until they are fully eliminated.

Make sure you know what these items are so you can prepare and plan for them.Items may include: your name, your grade level, your teacher’s name, acknowledgements, etc.
You may also be required to display items beside, but not on, the board, such as lab notes, equipment, examples or prototypes, etc.
Also make sure you’re aware of any items that are not allowed on your display board.;
, Before you can create your project board, you need to decide what items you’re going to display on it, and how you’re going to display those items. This part of your plan will depend on the type of project you're working on. One way to develop a detailed plan is to create a storyboard. A storyboard is a graphical representation of what your board may look like, or how it will be organized, drawn on paper.Review your whole project and determine what the major sections or parts were. These sections may end up being what you want to display on your board.
When creating your storyboard, plan out what font sizes you want to use for each item. This will help make the creation and printing of each section quicker and easier.
Many science fairs suggest that topics should be listed as follows on display boards:Left Panel — Question or Problem; Purpose; Hypothesis; Variables; Materials; Procedures.
Middle Panel — Title and Sub-title (if you have one); Project Data; Graphs; Charts; Tables; Diagrams; Photos; Illustrations.
Right Panel — Analysis; Results; Discussion; Conclusion; Recommendations; Future Studies; References.



, Large amounts of text should be broken up with sub-headings in order to make reading the material easier. Ideally, a viewer should be able to glance at the headings and sub-headings on your display board and know exactly what your project was about, without having to read all the detail. Take these headings and sub-headings into account when planning what material you need for your board.Use at least a 16 pt font size for the main text on your display board. You want people to be able to read your board from at least a few feet away.
Headings and sub-headings should be printed in larger font than the main text, and it is also helpful to use bolding, underlining, or colours to make them stand out.
It’s also helpful to write items in lists or point form so they can be skimmed. Make these concise.

, A buddy board is a small board that sits in front of, or beside, your main display board. It can be useful for displaying a summary of the project, or a photo showing project results. The buddy board should be 9” tall by 12” wide (which would fit one letter-sized piece of paper with space left around the edges).You can make your own buddy board using foam boards cut down to the proper size (with an x-acto knife). You can use another small piece of foam to make a stand. Attach the stand to the board using tape.

, The title needs to do two important things: attract attention and explain what the project was about. Be creative, and take your time. Write down a list of possible titles and play with the wording until you feel you have the perfect title. You might want to use a thesaurus to come up with catchy or descriptive words that work well for your project. However, you should look up any words you find in a dictionary to find the precise meaning, because thesauruses group very loose synonyms together.While it may not be possible to have a really short title, try to keep the title as short as you can. You want viewers to be able to read the title at a glance, while also drawing their interest.
Examples of some good project titles are:

Can your timber take the pressure?
Staying Power - Lipstick or Gloss
Bacterial content of milk
Testing the 5 senses using fruit



, Words are great, but pictures say much more. Include as many pictures, graphs, tables, charts, diagrams, etc., as possible. Keep your backgrounds (i.e., whatever is behind your graphics and text) simple and subtle. Reading text that is on top of a colourful or complex background can be difficult and distracting.Try to print as many of your graphics in colour as possible, especially graphs and charts where the colour distinguishes between different items or variables.
If you don't have access to a colour printer, you can use markers or crayons to add color to things like graphs and charts.

, Each visual item (graph, chart, table, diagram, picture, etc.) should have its own number (or letter), plus a descriptive caption. When the main text refers to a specific visual item, that number or letter should be used. The caption should accurately and quickly describe what is contained in the visual item, and can be printed in slightly smaller font (less than 16 pt)., Your main text and captions should include the technical or scientific names, terms and jargon for the discipline your project is based on. If necessary, you can also include a glossary of terms on your display board or in your project report.Using the proper terms is especially important if your project is being displayed in a science fair or event that is being judged by professionals.
If your project is really complex, you can also include a ‘layman’s summary’ as part of your display which sums up your project in language anyone can understand. This is particularly useful if your display board is also being viewed by fellow students, parents, or non-professionals.

, It can be tempting to get really creative and eccentric when creating a project display board, but try to avoid the temptation! A good project display board is one that is uncluttered, has easy-to-read and clear material, contains graphics that effectively explain your project, and colours that don’t overwhelm the viewer.Search the web for example display boards to get an idea of what works well, and what doesn’t.
Ask your teacher for advice on what to do and not to do, and for examples of project boards that previously received awesome grades.

, Display boards come in a standard size of 36” tall and 48” wide. You can buy or make larger (or smaller) boards, but make sure the size is not only appropriate for your display, but also allowed by the event (if such rules exist). These display boards have three panels - the middle panel which is half the width of the whole board, and the two outside panels that are a quarter of the width each. The two outside panels can fold over the middle panel to close the board for transport. And the outside panels can be used to stand the whole display board upright on a table.You can find display boards at online retailers like Amazon.com or at your local school supply store.
Bigger is not better. Boards that are really tall or really wide may be difficult to read and/or contain too much information., Unless your project board is for an art project, or is it a requirement of the assignment, all your materials should be developed (and then printed) from a computer. You should avoid creating the materials by hand, as it doesn’t look as professional. You should already know what materials you require for your display board based on your overall plan and storyboard.You can create your materials in a variety of software on the computer, including word processing, spreadsheet, or presentation software. You can also consider using more specialized software like Adobe Photoshop or iPhoto if you’re familiar with the software.
If you don't have access to a computer at home, you can usually use one at school or at public libraries.
When creating each section of material, use the Page Setup of the software to display the page in the same orientation as it’ll be on your project board. You can choose between horizontal (landscape) or vertical (portrait).
Try to fit one page on your screen at a time to enter and size the material, so you can see how the overall section will appear when it’s on your board.
Use san-serif fonts like Arial, Verdana, etc. Or simple serif fonts like Times New Roman, Georgia, etc. Avoid script fonts, or fancy fonts that are hard to read.

, Once all your material is created and designed on your computer, you can print each item. Ideally the material should be printed on a colour printer, but if you do not have access to one, make sure your material is designed in gray tones so you know exactly how it will appear when printed. If necessary, you can save all your material onto a USB thumb drive and take it to school or a printing/stationery store to be printed.If you have the ability, consider printing your material on thicker paper or paper that isn’t plain white. Keep in mind that standard printer paper is quite thin, and if you’re using glue to attach the items to your display board, the glue may show through this type of paper.
Try not to use bright coloured paper for printing. Or, if you do, make sure the font colour can be properly seen on top of the colour. Black font on a dark coloured background, or white font on a light coloured background, can be very difficult to read.Use the computer spellcheck on your material and manually check your spelling and grammar to make sure there are no mistakes before printing your material.If you’re printing photos on photo paper, consider using matte photo paper instead of glossy. The glossy photo paper can cause a glare to appear on your photos, which can be distracting., At this point you know what information you’re going to put on your display board, but you still need to figure out how to lay it all out. Lay your display board flat on a table and place your material around on the board in different layouts until you find one you like. Don’t start attaching your material to the display board until you’re certain you have the right layout.The layout, in general, should read almost like a newspaper article - top to bottom and left to right.
The title of your project should stand out on the board so it can be read from a distance. Avoid spelling the title vertically, as vertical letters are harder to read at a glance., If possible, consider getting coloured paper (like construction paper) to create a border around some or all of each section of material you’re placing on your display board. You’ll want to choose a consistent colour (or a set of two complementary colours), and it should be colours that go well with the colour of the board itself (e.g., don’t use black paper for borders if your display board is black.)Be careful with your colour choices. Really bold colours, especially more than one of them together, can be distracting and hard to look at.
Use a colour wheel to pick the colours you want to use. You can find many colour wheels online.

, This may seem like a rather obvious step, but cutting paper using scissors, even if you’ve drawn a line in advance, can still not turn out straight. Ideally, cut all your materials using a paper cutter or trimmer.Your school will probably have a paper cutter available somewhere that you can borrow. Ask your teacher.
Printing and stationery stores sometimes have paper cutters and trimmers available for use.
If you know someone who does a lot of scrapbooking, they may have a paper trimmer you can borrow.

, Glue sticks are the best adhesive to use for a project display board. But you can also use double sided tape. Regular craft glue is not recommended as it can show through the paper and be lumpy, causing your display to look unprofessional. If you want to use the photos on your display board again, you could consider using adhesive velcro dots instead of glue.You can also use rubber cement. A parent or older person will probably have to purchase it for you, though.

, When displaying your board on a table or desk, make sure the room’s lighting doesn’t cast a shadow across your board. Adjust the placement of the panels (and the title board - if you have one) until your whole board is brightly lit. Also make sure to keep the side panels tilted outwards, not at 90 degree angles to the middle panel. You want to make sure the viewers can see all three panels without having to twist their heads in awkward positions."

Brainstorm an idea/identify a problem/question.,

Brush across information you have access to.,
Clearly define your project.",How to Get Started With a Research Project1," No matter how much guidance the assignment provides, an integral part of nearly any research project is allowing each researcher to come up with his or her own idea. You need to identify a problem in your chosen field that needs to be solved or to answer a question that has not yet been answered. At this stage, a pen and paper are your best friends. Without worrying about structure or format, start writing down ideas – anything you're interested in, really, as long as it falls within the bounds of the project guidelines. At this stage its worth remembering that the more interest you have in a given topic, the easier it will be to push through any obstacles that may crop up when trying to complete the project.


Don't hesitate while writing down ideas. You'll end up with some mental noise on the paper – silly or nonsensical phrases that your brain just pushes out. That's fine. Think of it as sweeping the cobwebs out of your attic. After a minute or two, better ideas will begin to form (and you might have a nice little laugh at your own expense in the meantime).;
, If you just can't seem to brainstorm anything very interesting, and you've been given a vague and unhelpful prompt, your next best bet is to review a textbook or lecture notes. Skim over them and look for subjects you found interesting. You can even flip open a textbook to the index, pick an interesting-sounding term or name, and go from there. Another extremely useful tool is journals. These are periodicals collecting research in a specific field. So if for example you were looking for a topic in radiology, you may want to look at a few issues of Radiology- the journal of the American College of Radiology.

, If you are doing this in partial fulfillment of a university course or honours degree programme, it's worth checking out what research topics were covered by other students over previous years. Sometimes you may be lucky enough to find a ready made suggestions at the end of the project which the author has made in their recommendations for further research. You may also be able to change the topic slightly to come up with a new project. This has the advantage of providing a ready-made, tried and tested, robust methodology for your project.

Some instructors will even provide samples of previously successful topics if you ask for them. Just be careful that you don't end up stuck with an idea you want to do, but are afraid to do because you know someone else did it before.

, If you have at least a little direction based on the project guidelines, take that basic direction and start turning it over and over in your mind. Write down everything you come up with on paper, even if it doesn't seem viable. Start with obvious approaches, and then try to think about other questions that are indirectly related to the main thrust of your guidelines. Keep adding items until you can't think of any more.


For example, if your research topic is “urban poverty,” you could look at that topic across ethnic or sexual lines, but you could also look into corporate wages, minimum wage laws, the cost of medical benefits, the loss of unskilled jobs in the urban core, and on and on. You could also try comparing and contrasting urban poverty with suburban or rural poverty, and examine things that might be different about both areas, such as diet and exercise levels, or air pollution.

, You can combine a few or several different parameters to create concrete questions that will give your research some direction. Continuing with the previous example, you might look at the dietary habits of the rural poor with the urban poor, cross-checking against the habits of well-to-do people to get an idea of whether diet is influenced more by money or environment, and to what extent., A good research project should collect information for the purpose of answering (or at least attempting to answer) a question. As you review and interconnect topics, you'll think of questions that don't seem to have clear answers yet. These questions are your research topics.

, Now that you have a handful of concrete research ideas that interest you, take your favorite and do a little preliminary research. If you're finding information you might be able to use, stick with that topic; if there seems to be no useful research at all, you'll either have to perform original research or change topics. Don't be afraid to take a gamble if there is research but it seems a bit thin – often, those are the areas where more attention is sorely needed, and your paper will draw some attention in the right direction, if nothing else.


Don't limit yourself to libraries and online databases. Think in terms of outside resources as well: primary sources, government agencies, even educational TV programs. If you want to know about differences in animal population between public land and an Indian reservation, call the reservation and see if you can speak to their department of fish and wildlife.
If you're planning to go ahead with original research, that's great – but those techniques aren't covered in this article. Instead, speak with qualified advisors and work with them to set up a thorough, controlled, repeatable process for gathering information.

, Now that you've narrowed the field and chosen a research question to pursue, it's time to get a bit more formal. Write down your research question, and then briefly note the steps you plan to take to get it answered. Finally, at the bottom of the page, write down each possible answer to the topic question. There are usually three potential answers: it's one way, it's the other way, or it doesn't seem to make any difference.


If your plan comes down to “researching the topic,” and there aren't any more specific things you can say about it, write down the types of sources you plan to use instead: books (library or private?), magazines (which ones?), interviews, and so on. Your preliminary research should have given you a solid idea of where to begin.

,How to List References1,
"
Choose an online panel.,
Select your products.,
Write and submit your review.,
Be active on social media.,
Review products you already own.,
Work to grow your following.,
Find your niche of products that you'd like to review.,
Be original.,
Search for manufacturers.,
Shorten your list of manufacturers.,
Gather contact information.,
Make contact with the company.,
Wait for a response.",How to Get Free Products to Review," One of the best ways to begin testing and reviewing products is by joining various online panels that specialize in this kind of activity. Sometimes these panels pay you for participating, but you almost always get to keep the sample products. Join one or join several!Try signing up for Influenster, Smiley360, Opinion Outpost, I-Say Panel, or Global Test Market.
Each online panel specializes in different kinds of products and offers different reward options, so look into a few to figure out which one is right for you.
For example, Global Test Market and I-Say Panel both specialize mainly in household goods, while Smiley360 has a variety of categories like beauty, home, fitness, etc.;
, Once you have chosen your online review panel, decide which products you wish to review for them. Most of the online panel platforms allow you to choose the products you are most interested in from some available options.Try to consider which items will be the most popular (making your review more valuable), but also choose things that you will genuinely be interested in. You will probably write a better review if you enjoy what you are doing.
Some sites will send you a sample or trial size of the product, while others will send you a full-sized version of the product.

, The online panel platform will ask you to review the product and send them your thoughts. You should be sure to write your review in a way that is thorough and thoughtful, addressing any potential concerns other consumers may have.Try to include things like how the product works, what the packaging is like, how efficient the product is, whether or not you were pleased with the outcome, etc.
The more thorough your review, the more products (and the higher quality) the panel will send to you.
Sometimes these panels will also ask you to participate in community discussion posts.
But remember that you can also use the information for your own blog or other social media product reviews if you wish.

, One of the first things you need to do in order to get companies to send you free products to review is to create an online following. If you aren’t active on social media platforms, you won’t have an audience to watch or read your reviews. This means you won’t be as valuable to companies who want to encourage reviews of their products.Use Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, a personal blog, or any other social media platform available to create an online name for yourself.
Try to post stimulating content that others will be interested in and want to follow.

, If you want to get into the game of reviewing products online, the first step is to create some reviews that will entice companies to send you their products. The easiest way to do this is to do reviews of products you already own.Review as many products as you can to create a good base of material moving forward.
Truthfully discuss the pros and cons of each product so that you can provide valuable information for other potential customers. This will attract a wider audience for you.

, Once you have started posting, try to spread the word about your online reviews. Promote your reviews through various venues. Try to get more followers on social media platforms.


Leave comprehensive product reviews on popular consumer sites like Amazon.
Use hashtags for companies on products you review online. Link directly to the company or product websites.

, Choose something that interests you and that you would like to spend some time investigating and playing around with the products. Even if you don’t get to keep the products in the end, it is still a good practice to choose something you’ll enjoy doing.For example, you might choose to review smartphone cases.

, Try to choose a product that doesn’t already have a lot of people reviewing them online. Spend some time browsing the internet to see what kinds of reviews people are already doing.It will be harder to get companies to agree to send you their products if a lot of other (possibly more experienced) people are already doing similar work.
Try reviewing a product that has just been released.
You might also consider reviewing a product that is somewhat hard to get – like a product that can only be ordered from overseas. This type of product would be a good choice because customers might be hesitant to order something that takes a long time in delivery, or costs a lot in delivery fees – especially if they are unsure of the product quality and function.

, Find companies that produce the product you’re interested in reviewing. Make a list of manufacturers that you find and keep notes about any information you find relevant to that company. Do they have a lot of Amazon product reviews? Do they have a professional looking website?Try searching on sites like Amazon for lists of companies that produce the particular product you are interested in. Find companies that manufacture and sell smartphone cases, if that is what you’ve chosen to review.

, Now that you've found some companies that sell cases for smartphones, try to shorten your list to only include smaller companies. You can get an idea about how large the company might be by looking at their website. Most small time case makers will have a mediocre website that looks a little less professional or is a bit harder to navigate. As a first time reviewer, these kinds of companies may be your best bet.Avoid name brand companies that you already recognize – at least until you’ve established yourself a bit more in the field of reviewing.

, Get each of these companies' contact information so that you can get in touch with them. You should be able to find most of this information directly on the company’s website.You’ll need either their email address or their phone number, maybe both.

, First, you’ll need to email each of these companies asking if it would be possible to review some of their products on your blog or YouTube channel. Make sure to include all of the relevant information in your first email so you seem professional and prepared.Provide them with information about your channel like how many views it has, how many subscribers you have, how long you've had the channel, the daily average views you receive, what kind of channel it is, and what kind of feedback you get in the comments of your videos.

, Now that you've sent out those emails, just wait a few days. It usually takes 3-5 business days to hear back from a company in a situation like this. If you don’t hear back within a week, feel free to send a follow-up email asking for an update on your previous request.Be sure to send a thank you reply for sending you the product. This shows them that you are courteous and professional, which will reflect well on their impression of you.

Know what is possible.,
Contact the DMV.,
Submit a DMV information request form.,
Find a private investigation service online.,
Avoid online scams.,
Report car accidents and crimes to the police.",How to Find a Vehicle's Registered Owner Using a License Plate Number1," In order to prevent stalkers or angry drivers from showing up in person, federal and state governments heavily regulate who has access to this information. The Drivers Privacy Protection Act is especially strict, and individual state laws may make this task even harder. Here are some common scenarios:


If you were affected by a hit-and-run accident, some states will give you the name and address. Others will only provide this information to the police.
If you are filing an insurance claim due to a car accident, the information will typically be sent directly to the insurance company, not to you yourself.
In many states or situations, only the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) will be released, and even then not always to your personally. Your insurance company can still use this number to file a claim on your behalf.;
, The nearest Department of Motor Vehicles can begin processing your request, and answer your questions about the legality and logistics of your situation. Contact a DMV within your state, or the state that issued the license plate you are tracking, since state laws may restrict your access or require additional information from you.

, Each state has a different form and different laws, which is why contacting the DMV in person or over the phone is recommended. However, if you search online for ""record information request"" and the name of your state, you might locate the correct form. Fill this out and follow the included instructions to mail it to a DMV office in your state.

, You can find state-licensed investigators online who offer license plate look-up services. Search for the name of the state that issued the license plate and ""private investigator license plate look-up."" These services typically cost approximately $40 per license plate, require you to submit a legally acceptable reason for investigating, and can take one or two business days to deliver the results. If the service does not match this description, look below for tips on avoiding scams.

, There are many online services that request information from court records, department of motor vehicles' records, and other databases to find information on a given license plate number. However, most of these use misleading payment schemes, deliver out-of-date information, or fail to deliver the information at all. If possible, look up the website on a scam review site. You should also check for the following signs of a reputable service:


The company name, address, and phone numbers should all be listed on the website.
The service you are paying for should be clearly described. ""Access to databases"" may just mean a link to other websites. Subscription services are highly likely to be scams.
A delayed processing time before you can get the information. Don't believe promises of ""instant"" results; even if delivered, these are typically out-of-date., If you witnessed a car flee the scene of an accident or a crime, report the incident and license plate number to the police. While you will not necessarily be given access to the driver's personal information, the investigation may provide evidence for insurance claims and legal disputes.

Start with the basics.,
Move outward.,
Gather unusual sources.,
Review and trim.",How to Get Started With a Research Project2," That means just going out and researching. If you spend time creating a close outline of your presentation paper, you're most likely wasting that time, as the research you gather might not fit neatly into every slot. Instead, start with your school's library (or the local public library). Spend time collecting stacks of books and skimming them for valuable information until you've exhausted those resources. Keep an open notebook or a portable device with a notepad on hand, and copy down everything you might use verbatim.


It's generally considered more convincing to source one item from three different authors who all agree on it than it is to rely too heavily on one book. Go for quantity at least as much as quality. Be sure to check citations, end notes, and bibliographies to get more potential sources (and see whether or not all your authors are just quoting the same, older author).
Writing down your sources and any other relevant details (such as context) around your pieces of information right now will save you lots of trouble in the future.

, Once you have good information from your local resources, use whatever tools you have access to to gather more from online databases such as JSTOR. If you're a college student, chances are you've got free access to many of these resources through your school; if not, you might have to pay to subscribe to some of them. This is also the time to do general online research, at sites with reputable information such as government agencies or respected nonprofit organizations.


Use many different queries to get the database results you want. If one phrasing or particular set of words doesn't yield useful results, try rephrasing it or using synonymous terms. Online academic databases tend to be dumber than the sum of their parts, so you'll have to use tangentially related terms and inventive language to get all the results you want.

, By now, you should have more information written down (and properly sourced) than you can possibly use in one paper. This is the time to get creative and really breathe life into your project. Visit museums and historical societies for records that can't be reviewed anywhere else. Speak to respected professors for academic information you can use as a primary source; call and speak to leaders and professionals in fields related to your topic.


If it's sensible, consider heading out into the field and speaking to ordinary people for their opinions. This isn't always appropriate (or welcomed) in a research project, but in some cases, it can provide you with some excellent perspective for your research.
Review cultural artifacts as well. In many areas of study, there's useful information on attitudes, hopes, and/or concerns of people in a particular time and place contained within the art, music, and writing they produced. One has only to look at the woodblock prints of the later German Expressionists, for example, to understand that they lived in a world they felt was often dark, grotesque, and hopeless. Song lyrics and poetry can likewise express strong popular attitudes.

, By this point, you should have a lot of research on hand, well-cataloged and at least somewhat sorted. Review all of it through the lens of your research question, looking for answers or partial answers to it. Read between the lines, as well – use context, source age, and other background information to inform your quest for understanding. With any luck, you should have more than enough to suggest and support one answer over the others. Go through all your sources one more time and set aside any that won't be directly useful to your project. From here, all that's left is to put your information into a sensible format, apply your own interpretation to it, and prepare it for presentation.

Keep in mind three important yardsticks at all times.,
Understand these yardsticks.,
Distinguish between a topic/field of research and theme/thesis statement.,
Do preliminary reading and research.,
Read for usefulness at this stage, not depth.,
Narrow your topic down!,
Start off the working bibliography.,
Once your topic has been selected and you have read some general works on the subject, the process of breaking the theme/thesis statement into several subdivisions and headings begins.",How to Find a Topic for Your Research Paper," There are three yardsticks you can remind yourself of when it comes to selecting a proper subject for your research. These are largely:


Being able to handle it;
Being eager and excited to do it; and
It must satisfy your supervisor.;
, In deciding ""whether you can handle the subject"", there are certain considerations you have to take into account:


1. First of all, any topic among the ones available/suggested/chosen requires a certain prior knowledge. For instance, you might make up your mind to undertake the Freudian explanation of the motivations of a particular character in a particular novel. Here, you are bound to have a wide understanding of Sigmund Freud’s theory of psychoanalysis, to say the least. That is to say, your extent of your previous knowledge regarding the topic will have a great deal to do with your potential to handle it within a limited time. Another consideration to bear in mind is the availability of the source material related to your subject. If you don’t succeed in finding the sources needed for a given topic, chances are that there is little sense in tackling it.
2. The second yardstick is ""whether you are excited"" enough to research your topic. You will research best and write best those papers that are interesting and exciting for you. Then all the steps in the procedure will be performed with zeal and enjoyment. Students fatigue fastest when they are bored or dislike the subject matter, causing them to work most slowly and reluctantly. You don’t want to be bored or mired in something you dislike.
3. The third and last yardstick is ""whether your topic will gratify your instructor"". Most supervisors will keep in mind, when judging a topic submitted for approval, your ability to do a paper, based on your background and the source material availability. But the instructor has more than this in mind. He or she wants to be certain that the topic proposed is worthy of a research paper. He or she takes into account the level of the scholarship expected from you, the areas of profitable study that exist, and the purposes for assigning a research paper.

, The ""topic"" is the field in which your research and writing will be done. It is the framework of what you are researching. It is “the big picture”; the "" theme "" is the central statement you will make about the topic. It is, the theme, a hypothesis—a tentative statement—to be established or refuted by the research. It is “the small picture”.

, The preliminary reading of sources has three goals:


To select the topic you will develop thoroughly;
To locate as many sources as possible; and
To verify that your research can be performed.

, Up to this phase, you are not supposed to read every single source carefully and take complete notes. Read here and there in each source material, keeping in mind that you are searching for a topic that can be researched.


For example: In preparing for a paper in Media Studies, preliminary reading will help you to to gain an idea about the different theories and approaches via which media texts, for instance, are analysed. Besides, it will help you to understand the most debatable controversies and problems being raised in this realm.


A sensible way to proceed is to read general academic articles, essays and papers on the subject. Now, you are beginning to see daylight and get down to topics you can handle.

, Break it down, so that you can arrive at a thesis statement. Let’s illustrate this. There are a lot of topics, fields, or frameworks to work on (Literature, Gender Studies, Cultural Studies, Media & Communication Studies, etc.). Let’s take the example of Media Studies. “Media studies” is the big picture. It’s very hard to cover every single detail in Media Studies. That said, you have to narrow that topic down—to break it down until you put your finger on a very specific subject through which you shall build your thesis statement up.


For instance, you have made up your mind to research the “effects of T.V.” Your theme is not specific yet. You are bound to keep narrowing it down. You might come to this summary: “The negative effects of sexual imagery of soap operas on Moroccan adolescents”. You should not be satisfied with this, as it is not a well-stated thesis statement. Why? For two reasons: (i) everyone can research this statement and may well reach the same findings. (ii) Though you’ve arrived at this specific statement, you have not taken a stand yet. You need to take it a step further and take a stand regarding your statement. It might sound something like: “The negative effects of sexual imagery of soap operas run on 2M (Moroccan channel) are an outcome of the Eurocentric perception the West holds to spoil the value system of Moroccan adolescents”. See how specific that has become now? Can you see “the small picture” within “the big picture” now?

, The working bibliography is your own list of works that you think might contain information you will need for your paper. It derives from your reading. On account of it being a tentative bibliography, 3-x-5 Bibliography Cards (also called index cards) should be used. For every book, article, website, etc. encountered, make out a card with the author’s full name, the title of the work, and the place and date of publication. It is important to make a card for every source consulted, even if the source finally is not used in the paper. The working bibliography shows all useful sources consulted whether or not specific material is taken from them. If the working bibliography is kept faithfully, there will be no last minute rushing about to relocate sources.  

, Whenever you encounter a source with material on one of the subdivisions or headings you made, make out a 5-x-8 note card with the subject heading, a number that will relate this note card with its index card of the source, the page number, and the quotation, in case you quote directly from the source.

Brainstorm general topics that genuinely interest you.,
Do preliminary research to pick a topic.,
Start broad and narrow your focus.,
Consult with a relevant scholar.,
Formulate a research question.,
Make sure that your question is answerable.,
Make sure that your question is manageable.,
Make sure that your question is worth answering.,
Review the guidelines.,
Create a research plan.,
Build a research outline.,
Consult with your advisor.",How to Establish a Research Topic," Whether you’re responding to a given assignment prompt or choosing your own direction for original research within a field, your experience will be more meaningful if you pick a subject that you care about. Write down all the possibilities that occur to you so that you have a generous list of options to start from.One way to ensure you have a topic that’s of interest to you to pick a subject to which you have a personal connection. For instance, if your sister has Crohn's Disease, you may be interested in investigating it. Or, if you went on an exchange program to Croatia, you might be keen to know more about its history or culture.
Another way to trim down your possibilities is to see if there any patterns that emerge from the longer list. For example, if you wrote down “Gertrude Stein” and “Djuna Barnes,” you could focus on lesbian expat authors.;
, Select your top choices from the list you created to pursue further. Take time to do some background reading on each in general reference texts like encyclopedias and to do keyword searches in a library database to see what textual and online sources are available in relation to each potential topic. Then, select one to focus on that you find the most interesting and that has sufficient resources to investigate.You want to choose a topic that has some, but not too much information available on it. If there are some substantive related resources out there, you know you’re on the right track; if there are pages and pages of relevant search results, you can tell that plenty of people have already gone down that road or that the topic is likely too big to cover and you will need to narrow it further.

, Once you have a general topic that interests you, begin by reading widely about it. Write down the ideas, information, and sources that interest you the most. Then, review your notes to start refining your topic into a precise, narrow research focus.For instance, if you are interested in the mapping of the human genome, read about the general history of the scientific advances that have allowed us to map DNA and see if there’s a particular subtopic that catches your eye. Instead of trying to cover the entire subject, limit your scope to focus on the discovery of a gene related to a specific trait or disease or on a particular application, like the regulation of gene therapy for unborn fetuses.

, It’s good to vet your ideas with an established academic or other professional related to the field in which you’ll be conducting your research. If you’re having trouble deciding among topics or narrowing your scope, seek advice and suggestions from your professor, advisor, or another knowledgeable professional.


When you meet with or email them, explain the research that you’ve already conducted to show them that you’ve done your homework. Then, ask something like, “I’m most interested in looking into coming of age rituals in contemporary indigenous cultures, and I was wondering if you think that’s a good topic to pursue and if you had any suggestions for specific case studies or other resources related to it.”
Remember: they may be able to point you in a more specific direction based on your general interests, but don’t expect them to do the whole selection process for you.
If you’re doing independent research to earn a degree (rather than to fulfill the requirements of a particular class), you should also ask them about the potential marketability of your subject since your topic will be setting the direction for your future career.

, Your research should be seeking to answer a particular question; ideally, one that has not been asked before or one that has not yet been satisfactorily answered. Once you have a specific topic, the next step is to refine it into a focused research question.


After you conduct your preliminary research, think about the gaps that you noticed in the information available on the subject that you’ve been investigating. Devise a question that could address that missing information.
One concrete way to do this is to explore the relationship between two ideas, concepts, phenomena, or events that came up in your research but whose relationship has not been fully investigated. For example, “how did political radicals influence popular representations of sexuality in the 1920s United States?”Another concrete way to formulate your question is to consider how an existing methodology or concept applies to a new, specific context or case study. For instance, you could think of how Sigmund Freud’s idea of the “appendage” applies to a specific virtual reality game.

, Now that you have a focused research inquiry, it’s time to test its feasibility. If you cannot address your question with existing research or conduct the research necessary to address it, then you need to pick another topic.For example, if your question requires conducting a study that’s not feasible given your timeframe or the resources available to you, then you need to find a way to revise your question so that you can answer it.
Sometimes if your topic is too new, there won’t be a substantial enough body of research available for you to do a comprehensive analysis of it. In that case, you may need to revise or broaden your question so that you can actually answer it., It should be narrow enough that you can answer it within the space that you have but not so narrow that you can’t fulfill the page or research requirements.If your question is not narrow enough, refine your focus further by limiting your topic according to a given historical era, theoretical approach, geographical region, demographic or culture, industry or field. For example, if you’re interested in refugees, you might limit your scope by honing in on a particular event (World War II) and/or time period (the 1940s), a specific location (England) and/or population (Jewish people from Austria)., You want to settle on a question that matters, one that has real stakes in that it has some direct, real-life application and/or makes an original contribution to your field. If you find yourself asking “so what?” about the possible answers to your question, then it’s time to revise your topic., Now that you’ve settled on a question, it’s time to check that your research topic meets with all the requirements that you’re trying to address, whether they’re for a class assignment, thesis, or grant. Be sure that your question fits with the guidelines for your research project’s topic, methods, and scope.You might have a brilliant research question, but, if it’s about genetic disorders and the grant you’re applying for only funds research on communicable diseases, you’ll need to go back to the drawing board.
Also be sure to take the required length of the project into consideration. For instance, if your question is too narrow or specific, you might not be able to hit the 250-page requirement for a doctoral thesis.

, Now that you have an idea of what you’ll be addressing, you need to figure out how you’ll be addressing it. Take time to detail a strategy for how and when you’ll do the necessary research.Start by listing the various research methods that you’ll use, such as a literature review, interviews, and qualitative analysis. Then, create a timeline for when you’ll be doing each kind of research, being sure to leave enough time for yourself to complete the writing.

, Especially with complex research, it’s useful to construct a tentative outline that can help focus your efforts. Start by listing the topics and concepts that you will need to cover in order to answer your research question in a thorough way. Once you have your list, group together related topics and organize those groups into a logical order.You can order topics chronologically (for instance, if you’re studying a historical event). Most often, you’ll order them according to the progression of your argument, with one idea building on the last.
Remember that in order to answer your question, you will need to contextualize it. The first part of your outline should address the necessary background information, studies, and/or debates that informed your question. For instance, if you’re analyzing the role of female elected officials from Sweden in the 1970s, you’d want to cover a history of women in the country’s government, investigate public understandings of gender at that cultural moment, and review any existing studies of the topic.
Your research may change the structure or content of your outline, but it’s still useful to have a well-developed starting point.

, Now that you have a solid question, plan, and outline, take it to the person overseeing your research to make sure that they approve of your research topic and approach. Since they are the person who will be guiding and evaluating your research, it’s always best to get their approval, feedback, and suggestions before embarking on any project.

Re-read your paper or paper outline.,
Summarize your main arguments.,
Avoid introducing any new ideas.,
Keep it brief.",How to Write a Concluding Paragraph for a Persuasive Essay1," Organize your thoughts before writing your concluding paragraph by re-reading the rest of the paper, or the outline you made before writing it (if you made one). Isolate the key arguments made within the body of your writing, as well as the hypothesis proposed in the introductory paragraph. If it helps, print out a copy of the body of the paper and highlight the main points to be summarized.;
, Your concluding paragraph should repeat the main points that you made within your paper. Briefly summarize the key arguments that make up the body of your essay in a clear and concise manner. Make sure to include important keywords from each point in your conclusion.For instance - ""Overall, it seems clear that today's children prefer individual activities to team-based sports.

, When concluding any kind of essay, avoid introducing an idea that isn't already in the body of the paper. If you feel the need to add something new to the conclusion, consider editing the body of your paper to include that information. For example, avoid adding a point about how fashion magazines provide unrealistic portrayals of the male body if your paper has focused solely on how these magazines affect women., In an academic paper, your concluding paragraph should only be about 5 sentences long. Be efficient in your writing and communicate what you need to say as briefly as possible. To stay within this sentence range, try:Using the first sentence to restate the hypothesis in your introduction, in different wording
Writing the next 2-3 sentence to summarize the key arguments made in your paper
Having the last 1-2 sentences be a grand statement of conclusion, saying what your final findings are

Review and edit each question for grammar and spelling errors.,
Add an introductory note to the questionnaire.",How to Frame a Questionnaire for Data Collection," In order to get usable data from a questionnaire, the research must first be clear about the information that he seeks to gain. Based upon the research question, determine the variables of the study and define the exact information needed to answer the research question.;
, Breakdown the research question and variables into several short lose ended questions. Put them down on a paper for easy reference. Since this would be the first draft, create as many valid questions as you can.

, Once you are done with the 1st draft, read each of the question carefully and group them based upon similarity of ideas. Remove duplicates. In case of two similar questions, choose the one that conveys the message better to the target audience.

, Based upon the groups, order the questions in a logical flow. Ideally start the questionnaire with easy to answer questions and slowly proceed to the tougher ones.

, In case, the respondents speak a foreign language, it is better to get the questionnaire translated in the local language. You may choose to have 2 sets of questionnaires – one in English and other in the local Language, or incorporate both in the same questionnaire. This decision will depend upon the comfort level f your target respondents.

, Ensure that each question clearly conveys the idea and does

not leave a gap for different interpretations. Especially in case of translated questionnaires., This will make the respondents more comfortable and give an idea about what they can expect in the questionnaire.

Conduct a general search.,
Locate people using online people finders.,
Access online historical archives and census data.",How to Find Information on People1," Search engines, such as Google or Bing, are easy to use and free. Start with a simple search that includes the person's name plus the city and/or state where you last knew he or she lived.


Keep your search simple. Put quotation marks around the name you are searching. This tells the search engine to only find pages that contain that exact name.
Focus first on gathering all the free information that you can. Bookmark or save a list of the websites that require payment to pursue later.;
, You can look-up a home address or telephone number for free on Whitepages.com. If you are willing to pay a fee, websites such as Intelius.com or Spokeo.com provide access to a wider variety of sources and documents than traditional search engines or social networks. You will need to know the person's full first and last name, as well as current or previous state or city of residence.
Intelius and Spokeo provide some information for free, such as name, address, home phone number, age, and relatives.

, This may be helpful if you are trying to find family members, living or deceased. The U.S.GenWeb Census Project provides free United States census data for many states up to 1940. Most census records are grouped by state, so it is helpful to know the state in which the person was born, died, or lives.
Contact a state or local historical association in which your target lived, especially if he or she died prior to the 1940s. Many historical documents, public records, and newspapers have not been digitized, and are only accessible as paper documents or on microfilm. "

Restate the topic.You should briefly restate the topic as well as explaining why it is important.Do not spend a great amount of time or space restating your topic.,
Restate your thesis.Aside from the topic, you should also restate or rephrase your thesis statement.A thesis is a narrowed, focused view on the topic at hand.,
Briefly summarize your main points.,
Add the points up.,
Make a call to action when appropriate.,
Stick with a basic synthesis of information.The most basic conclusion is the summary closing, which is very similar to the paper's introduction.,

Close with logic.,
Pose a question.,
Make a suggestion.,
Avoid saying ""in conclusion"" or similar sayings.,
Do not wait until the conclusion to state your thesis.,
Leave out new information.A new idea, new subtopic, or new evidence is too significant to save until the conclusion.,
Avoid changing the tone of the paper.,
Make no apologies.",How to Write a Conclusion for a Research Paper,"
A good research paper will make the importance of your topic apparent, so you do not need to write an elaborate defense of your topic in the conclusion.
Usually a single sentence is all you need to restate your topic.
An example would be if you were writing a paper on the epidemiology of an infectious disease, you might say something like ""Tuberculosis is a widespread infectious disease that affects millions of people worldwide every year."" Yet another example from the humanities would be a paper about the Italian Renaissance: ""The Italian Renaissance was an explosion of art and ideas centered around artists, writers, and thinkers in Florence."",
This statement should be rephrased from the thesis you included in your introduction. It should not be identical or too similar to the sentence you originally used.
Try re-wording your thesis statement in a way that complements your summary of the topic of your paper in your first sentence of your conclusion.
An example of a good thesis statement, going back to the paper on tuberculosis, would be ""Tuberculosis is a widespread disease that affects millions of people worldwide every year. Due to the alarming rate of the spread of tuberculosis, particularly in poor countries, medical professionals are implementing new strategies for the diagnosis, treatment, and containment of this disease."", Essentially, you need to remind your reader what you told them in the body of the paper.A good way to go about this is to re-read the topic sentence of each major paragraph or section in the body of your paper.
Find a way to briefly restate each point mentioned in each topic sentence in your conclusion. Do not repeat any of the supporting details used within your body paragraphs.
Under most circumstances, you should avoid writing new information in your conclusion. This is especially true if the information is vital to the argument or research presented in your paper.
For example, in the TB paper you could summarize the information. ""Tuberculosis is a widespread disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Due to the alarming rate of the spread of tuberculosis, particularly in poor countries, medical professionals are implementing new strategies for the diagnosis, treatment, and containment of this disease. In developing countries, such as those in Africa and Southeast Asia, the rate of TB infections is soaring. Crowded conditions, poor sanitation, and lack of access to medical care are all compounding factors in the spread of the disease. Medical experts, such as those from the World Health Organization are now starting campaigns to go into communities in developing countries and provide diagnostic testing and treatments. However, the treatments for TB are very harsh and have many side effects. This leads to patient non-compliance and spread of multi-drug resistant strains of the disease."", If your paper proceeds in an inductive manner and you have not fully explained the significance of your points yet, you need to do so in your conclusion.Note that this is not needed for all research papers.
If you already fully explained what the points in your paper mean or why they are significant, you do not need to go into them in much detail in your conclusion. Simply restating your thesis or the significance of your topic should suffice.
It is always best practice to address important issues and fully explain your points in the body of your paper. The point of a conclusion to a research paper is to summarize your argument for the reader and, perhaps, to call the reader to action if needed.

, If and when needed, you can state to your readers that there is a need for further research on your paper's topic.


Note that a call for action is not essential to all conclusions. A research paper on literary criticism, for instance, is less likely to need a call for action than a paper on the effect that television has on toddlers and young children.
A paper that is more likely to call readers to action is one that addresses a public or scientific need. Let's go back to our example on tuberculosis. This is a very serious disease that is spreading quickly and with antibiotic resistant forms.
A call to action in this research paper would be a follow-up statement that might be along the lines of ""Despite new efforts to diagnose and contain the disease, more research is needed to develop new antibiotics that will treat the most resistant strains of tuberculosis and ease the side effects of current treatments."".,


Since this sort of conclusion is so basic, it is vital that you aim to synthesize the information rather than merely summarizing it.
Instead of merely repeating things you already said, rephrase your thesis and supporting points in a way that ties them all together.
By doing so, you make your research paper seem like a ""complete thought"" rather than a collection of random and vaguely related ideas.

, There are several ways to do this.


Ask a question in your introduction. In your conclusion, restate the question and provide a direct answer.
Write an anecdote or story in your introduction but do not share the ending. Instead, write the conclusion to the anecdote in the conclusion of your paper.
For example, if you wanted to get more creative and put a more humanistic spin on a paper on tuberculosis you might start your introduction with a story about a person with the disease, and refer to that story in your conclusion. For example, you could say something like this before you re-state your thesis in your conclusion: ""Patient X was unable to complete the treatment for tuberculosis due to severe side effects and unfortunately succumbed to the disease.""
Use the same concepts and images introduced in your introduction in your conclusion. The images may or may not appear at other points throughout the research paper.

, If your research paper presented multiple sides of an issue, use your conclusion to state a logical opinion formed by your evidence.


Include enough information about your topic to back the statement up but do not get too carried away with excess detail.
If your research did not provide you with a clear-cut answer to a question posed in your thesis, do not be afraid to indicate as much.
Restate your initial hypothesis and indicate whether you still believe it or if the research you performed has begun swaying your opinion.
Indicate that an answer may still exist and that further research could shed more light on the topic at hand.

, Instead of handing the reader the conclusion, you are asking the reader to form his or her own conclusion.


This may not be appropriate for all types of research papers. Most research papers, such as one on effective treatment for diseases, will have the information to make the case for a particular argument already in the paper.
A good example of a paper that might ask a question of the reader in the ending is one about a social issue, such as poverty or government policy.
Ask a question that will directly get at the heart or purpose of the paper. This question is often the same question, or some version of it, that you may have started out with when you began your research.
Make sure that the question can be answered by the evidence presented in your paper.
If desired, you can briefly summarize the answer after stating the question. You could also leave the question hanging for the reader to answer, though.

, If you are including a call to action in your conclusion, you could provide your reader with a recommendation on how to proceed with further research.


Even without a call to action, you can still make a recommendation to your reader.
For instance, if you are writing about a topic like third-world poverty, you can various ways for the reader to assist in the problem without necessarily calling for more research.
Another example would be, in a paper about treatment for drug resistant tuberculosis, you could suggest making a donation to the World Health Organization or research foundations which are developing new treatments for the disease.

, This includes ""in summary"" or ""in closing.""


These sayings usually sound stiff, unnatural, or trite when used in writing.
Moreover, using a phrase like ""in conclusion"" to begin your conclusion is a little too straight-forward and tends to lead to a weak conclusion. A strong conclusion can stand on its own without being labelled as such.

, While it may be tempting to save your thesis in order to create a dramatic end to your paper, doing so will create a paper that seems less cohesive and more unorganized.


Always state the main argument or thesis in the introduction. A research paper is an analytical discussion of an academic topic, not a mystery novel.
A good, effective research paper will allow your reader to follow your main argument from start to finish.
This is why it is best practice to start your paper with an introduction that states your main argument, and to end the paper with a conclusion that re-states your thesis for re-iteration.

,


All significant information should be introduced in the body of the paper.
Supporting evidence expands the topic of your paper by making it appear more detailed. A conclusion should narrow the topic to a more general point.
A conclusion should only summarize what you have already stated in the body of your paper.
You may make a suggestion for further research or a call to action, but you should not bring in any new evidence or facts in the conclusion.

, The tone of your research paper should be consistent the entire way through.


Most often, a shift in tone occurs when a research paper with an academic tone is give an emotional or sentimental conclusion.
Even if the topic of the paper is of personal significance for you, you should not indicate as much in your paper.
If you want to give your paper a more humanistic slant, you could start and end your paper with a story or anecdote that would give your topic more personal meaning to the reader.
This tone should be consistent throughout the paper, however.

, Do not make statements that downplay your authority or discoveries.


Apologetic statements include phrases like ""I may not be an expert"" or ""This is only my opinion.""
Statements like this can usually be avoided by refraining from writing in the first-person.
Avoid any statements in the first-person. First person is generally considered to be very informal and does not fit with the formal tone of a research paper.

Add a title under your header.,
List your references with their information.,
List the rest of your references by following the format detailed above.",How to List References5," You should only list references if the company or program you are applying to specifically asks for them. References are people that a company you are applying to will contact to find out about your work ethic, personality, etc. You should choose people that you know will give you a positive review, such as professors who taught classes you did well in, or bosses who thought you were an excellent worker.

, Only do this if the company you are applying to specifically asks that you provide references. If you are applying for housing (such as when you wish to rent an apartment), you will most likely have to provide references with your housing application.


You should not mention references unless you are asked to do so by the company or program you are applying to.

, Write your name in a bold, clear font. Beneath your name, write your address, phone number, and primary email (these things should be written in a smaller font than your name.) If you choose, you can format your header so that your contact information is aligned in the opposite corner.


To separate the content of your list from your header, you can add a line below your name.

, The title should be the same size and font as your name. The title should be clear and to the point. For example, your page could be titled, “Professional References” or “References of (Your Name.”

, There is not a specific order in which you list your references--you could choose to alphabetize their names, or list them in order of how well each person knows you.


Format your list so that the reference’s name is in bold print. Below their names, write their relationship to you (ie. Boss) and the company or program that you both worked for.
Below the company name, write the company’s address. If your reference no longer works for that company, do not list the company address.
List your reference’s chosen form of contact information below the address. This is where you write their phone numbers, emails, etc.

, If you are listing many references that fall under specific categories (such as professors vs. people you know from work) you could choose to separate these groups by a line. This is optional.

Try parallel sentences.,
Use strong, simple language.,
Avoid being obvious.",How to Write a Concluding Paragraph for a Persuasive Essay2," When summarizing parts of your research or arguments, use parallel sentences. This writing technique uses patterns of similar words to organize thoughts or ideas and show the reader that they are similar, or equal in value. In a concluding paragraph, parallel sentences can help organize information in a way that allows you to avoid writing too much.E.g. ""Regular exercise reduces stress, improves your sleep, and promotes weight loss.""

, Your concluding paragraph should drive your point home in a straightforward, assertive way. Avoid too much detail in your writing (such as lengthy adjectives or descriptions), as it can be distracting. Choose the simplest manner to say what you want to communicate.For instance, instead of writing, ""the traditional American Dream is not dead and gone"", write, ""the American Dream is not dead"".

, A well-written paper does not need to use phrases like ""to conclude"" or ""to summarize"" in its conclusion. Restate your ideas in a different way, in a paragraph that can stand alone as a summary of your research. Your reader, having read the rest of your paper, will understand on their own that you are summing up the contents of your essay and presenting your conclusion."
"
Use the ""Panning to the Horizon"" technique.,
Put out a call to action.,
Present an ideal picture.",How to Write a Concluding Paragraph for a Persuasive Essay3," In addition to summarizing the main points of your paper, your conclusion should point towards how your findings will be relevant in the future. You can achieve this by refocusing the topic within a larger context, and inviting the reader to reflect on how it will play out within a bigger picture. Use a thought-provoking question to communicate that the issue deserves further thought, which will assert the importance of your research.E.g. ""What will happen to small businesses as different industries continue to go digital?""

, Establish the importance of your essay's conclusion by challenging your reader to do something about it. Turning your final findings into a real life challenge will emphasize the relevance of the topic and your hypothesis. It will also engage your reader in a memorable way.For example, ""Being environmentally responsible is a necessary step for all people, in order to save the parts of nature that we have left.""

, If your essay has presented a hypothesis about how something is bad, create a picture of how things could be better. The optimistic focus will not only re-frame your arguments in a more positive way, but improve your reader's relation to the text. The possible solutions to the issue your have arguments have established gives merit to your thesis without undermining the structure of your paper or altering the arguments you made.E.g. ""If this competitive nature of school work were replaced with a more community-based learning approach, we might see happier, healthier children.""

Find civil and criminal records online.",How to Find Information on People3," Public records are created and maintained by government agencies. While the definition of public records varies by state to state, they are directed by law to be made available to the public, often upon formal request. See if your state or county has a searchable online public records database. In Google or Bing, type the state or county plus “public records”. Next, search for specific public records (birth, death, marriage, divorce, etc.) within state or county webpages.

, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides links to state and county agencies that maintain vital records (births, deaths, divorces, marriages).Go to the CDC.gov website and search for ""where to write for vital records"".

, The National Archives provide resources for obtaining military personnel or medical records.They provide a searchable database for records and documents in their collection from before World War I.


Military service records can only be requested by a veteran or their next-of-kin.
Casualty lists and records of medals, awards, and decorations up to the Vietnam War are also available on the webpage for the National Archives., Civil and criminal cases are handled at the county, state, and federal levels, so you will need to determine the relevant jurisdiction(s) when searching for case data. Civil cases refer to acts of negligence or disputes between organizations or individuals, while criminal cases are those that cause harm or violate privacy and safety. Search the county clerk’s office for criminal or civil court records. The county clerk maintains records for civil, small claims, and even criminal cases decided at the district or county level. In a search engine, type the county’s name and “criminal records” or “civil court records”. If known, you can also enter the appellate’s or defendant’s name or the case number.
Track down inmate records through the state Department of Corrections (DOC). In a search engine, type the name of the state and “department of corrections”. In general, you should be able to find information such as an inmate’s DOC number, location of incarceration, and dates of incarceration.

Hire and retain a private investigator.,
Choose a licensed private investigator.,
Draft a contract.",How to Find Information on People4," Private investigators (PIs) can be hired to find and analyze information regarding legal, personal, and financial matters. They offer services such as background checks, investigating suspected marital infidelities, conducting employment screenings, verifying a person's identity, finding missing people, and recovering stolen property.In most states, licensed PIs have passed pass the private investigator examination, be at least 25 years of age, and completed 3 years of professional experience.They must also pass a criminal history and background check administered by the Department of Justice and FBI, and be licensed by the Department of Consumer Affairs.

, Be smart about who you hire. You can search for PI agencies in your area online or in the phone book. If you do not have prior experience with a particular agency, contact a consumer assistance group (e.g. Better Business Bureau). Ask about any complaints and/or the nature of complaints filed against an agency. You can also search online reviews from sites such as AngiesList.com.


Compare prices and services offered by different companies.
Interview a potential investigator. Ask them to show you their state-issued PI ID card. Record their name, license number, and expiration date.Validate their business or individual license by following-up with your state's Department of Consumer Affairs.

, Once you select a PI, it is important to obtain a written contract This should include agreement on what services will be offered, a list of fees and payment obligations, and length of time service will be retained. The contract should also stipulate that the client will have access to evidence (recordings, videotapes, etc.) collected during the investigation. Finally, the PI is obligated to provide a final case report that includes results of the investigation, and cost and time spent on separate aspects of the case (e.g. surveillance, additional investigators, special equipment, stand-by time, etc.).


Read the contract carefully and do not hesitate to ask questions.
Stipulate a deadline by which all work will be completed.
Request an itemized estimate of services to be offered as part of the contract, and have the company provide an official invoice and receipt.
Keep a copy of the contract, invoices, and receipts in a single folder.

At a minimum, you should know the due date, the assignment length, the formatting requirements, and the opening prompt.If you write down the details yourself make sure to keep this piece of paper in a safe location as you will need to consult it throughout the writing process.;
, Cause and effect papers do not always cover both of these elements. Find out if your essay is supposed to focus on causes, effects, or a bit of both. You will also want to determine if you are supposed to explore an assigned topic or come up with one yourself.For example, you may be asked to write about the causes of the American Revolution, which means that you will discuss taxation protests and other contributing factors. Or, you may be asked to write about the effects of the American Revolution, which means that you will discuss nation-building and other long and short-term effects. A combined cause and effect essay would combine both of these angles.

, If you need to choose your own topic it is a good idea to start by brainstorming. Write down any and all topics that jump to mind. Pick the top five that interest you the most. Consider how much information you can reasonably fit into your paper’s required page length. Try breaking a potential topic into multiple parts and choosing one.Consider writing about moments that are close to your own experience, such as events that have impacted your life. For example, you could discuss a war period that you lived through. Or, you could take on a controversial topic, such as the proven effects of eating fast food on a regular basis. Taking a historical angle and looking into events like the American Revolution is another possible approach.
Be flexible in adjusting your topic breadth or depth as you work on your paper. At any point in the process you may need to add or delete particular discussions to fit the requirements. For example, if you are writing about the actions of George Washington during the American Revolution, you may need to narrow your focus and only discuss one particular choice that he made.

, If your teacher assigned articles or books to coincide with this essay assignment it is a good idea to start reading those as soon as you can. They may help you to narrow down a topic or they make help you to understand the topic that you’ve been assigned. You can also use your text notes as evidence when you actually start writing too.

, Look at sources (books, articles, etc.) that explore your topic from a variety of perspectives. Cast a wide net initially by reading everything that you can. Narrow down your search as you find useful information. Make sure to take careful notes while you research so that you can cite properly later and avoid plagiarism.If you are covering a recent topic, such as the effects of fast food production, you may be able to use first-hand accounts, also known as primary sources, in your work.

, At any stage in the process if you have questions you should email your teacher (if possible) or talk with them after class. It is a good idea to write down your questions beforehand too. You can also talk with students who’ve worked with this teacher before to see if they can clarify the assignment for you.A good question might be, “Is there a minimum source number for this assignment?” Just make sure that the question that you ask is not already answered in the assignment sheet.

, After you’ve looked over your notes you will want to come up with a thesis statement, or argument, to guide your paper. This is what you will try to prove throughout your essay. Your thesis should be debatable and should be supported by the facts that you uncovered during your research.A thesis statement can be a single sentence or multiple sentences, depending on what you need to cover. It cannot be a quote, a basic statement of fact, or a question.
As you are trying to craft your thesis statement it is helpful to consider what your evidence indicates about your topic. What causes and/or effects are clearly illustrated by your sources? For example, if a number of your sources discuss stock market issues as a cause of the Great Depression, then you may argue that, “Stock market instabilities, in part, led to the Great Depression.”

, Identify at least three broad themes or ideas that can support your main thesis. These themes will become separate body sections of your paper. You will then place smaller or more detailed ideas or concepts under these larger ‘umbrella’ ideas. In the end, every piece of the organization should contribute toward proving your thesis in some way.Be pretty flexible with your initial outline as you will find areas that you will need to expand or cut when you actually start writing.
It may seem easier at first but you never have to limit yourself to the five-paragraph essay format, unless your teacher expressly requests that you do so. Otherwise, feel free to add additional paragraphs, up until the page limit, to create a stronger argument., Your introduction is the first paragraph of your essay and it has a great deal of work to do. It must grab the reader’s attention. It needs to introduce the reader to the general topic. And, it must present the thesis statement to the reader, usually in the final sentence or two. For a cause and effect essay you will want to make clear whether or not you plan to cover both of these areas or just one.You can get a reader interested in your subject by opening with a vivid quote, exciting source, or quick anecdote. Just keep it brief. Your intro should only be a fairly short paragraph in comparison to the body ones.

, This is where you flesh out your outline. Each paragraph should cover one particular element of your argument. In the cause portions of your essay you will need to explain the event in question and make initial connections to the effect portion that is coming up. In the effect portion you will need to explain to the reader how you get from point A (cause) to point B (effect).


Don’t forget to add at least a paragraph explaining to the reader why these connections are important to them on an individual or group level. You could use this as an opportunity to make an educated statement about what the long and short term implications of this cause/effect cycle will be. Basically, why should we care?, As you move through your body paragraphs, make sure that you emphasize that the cause that you are discussing occurred before the effect. And, as you are writing about an effect, make sure that you can prove it occurred after that particular cause. You want to avoid a situation where your causes and effects are so intertwined that they are without a causal relationship.For example, if you argue that the Great Depression caused a rise in unemployment you will need to have statistics to support this perspective. After all, unemployment existed before and after the event in question, so the causal relationship is what must be clarified.

, You must convince your readers that you are aware of alternative arguments or approaches. Don’t overreach or over-promise as you describe the cause and effect relationship. Instead, use your evidence to show that, while other causes or effects may exist, the most important causal relationships are the ones that are found within your paper.

For instance, if you are writing about the causes of the Great Depression you will want to discuss the stock market but also the income gap. Or, if you choose to focus solely on the Great Depression/stock market relationship then somewhere in your paper you’ll want to acknowledge the other possible causes while stating that you’ve chosen this particular focus.

, Use your concluding paragraph to sum up your thesis and major supporting points. However, do so very briefly as this paragraph should be roughly the same length as the introduction. You might also give some indication as to how your findings could change in the future if conditions or interpretations alter in some way., Throughout your body paragraphs you will want to develop and present natural pairings of detailed evidence and broad summary or interpretive remarks. Without the details your paper will be too vague. Without the interpretive comments your reader will just see a list of facts lacking analysis.

, When you’ve finished your first draft of your paper, step away from it for at least a little while. Waiting to revise for a day or two is ideal, although that may not be possible under a deadline. Getting your mind away from your essay is beneficial in that it allows you to come back at it with a fresh perspective. You’ll see errors and areas for expansion that you never would have considered before.This is another reason why it is best to not procrastinate when writing an essay of this type. You will need ample time to complete the process in a patient way in order to create your best possible work.

, As soon as you know that you’ll need to write an essay it is a good idea to approach a friend or classmate and ask them to spend a bit of time looking over your rough draft. Before you hand over your draft it is a good idea to let you reader know if there are any particular ‘trouble areas’ that you would like them to focus on.You might say, “Please focus on the word choice as that is a weakness of mine.”

, Once you’ve given your paper some down time and had another person look it over you will then need to start the personal revision process. Find a quiet place where you can sit down and closely read over your essay word-by-word. Look for both macro (large, major) and micro (smaller, details) issues and make these changes.Some people find it helpful to print out your paper at this point and make your revisions on a hard copy. This can also protect you in the event that you experience any computer troubles.

, When you are writing a ‘split’ topic essay, such as a compare/contrast or cause/effect, it is particularly important to make your transitions clear and obvious to the reader. This will signal to your reader that you are switching from one area to another. Good transition words include, “therefore,” “consequently,” “thus,” and many others."

Use the Oxford or serial comma.,
Consider your use of the ‘em dash’.,
Remember to spell out state and country names.,
Spell out numbers that are less than 100.",How to Write a Chicago Style Essay1," That is, when writing a list of items, include a comma before the “and,”like in this sentence:


“I like strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries.”;
, An em dash symbolizes a change of thought in a sentence or adds extra information to the sentence. When writing a Chicago style paper, do not use a space before or after you use an em dash.For example: “We enjoyed the Fourth of July celebration—all the fireworks were splendid.” The em dash is that long dash in the middle. Microsoft Word generally corrects a double hyphen (--) to an em dash.

, Spell out ‘United States’ unless you are using it as an adjective (for example, U.S. politics). Spell out state names when they follow a city: “We went to Okemah, Oklahoma.”


If you do use an abbreviation for the state, use the standard two-letter postal code.

, While Chicago style is generally not a stickler on this rule, you should try to remember to do this. At the very least, spell out numbers less than 10.


You should also spell out fractions, measurements, and ages.

Practice to identify and avoid common errors.",How to Write a CCOT Essay," This will provide you with important basic information you will need to write your CCOT essay, such as the date range and area(s) of the world that your essay should take into consideration. The prompt will also suggest whether you will be analyzing the continuities and changes over time for a place, theme, or specific topic.For example, a prompt might ask you to “Evaluate the extent of continuity and change in the lives of European immigrants in the United States between 1876 and 1918."";
, A thesis statement is the basic summation of your essay’s argument. For a CCOT essay, it must refer to both a continuity and change. Starting by writing out your thesis (one sentence is usually fine) will make it easier to focus on your argument as you right, and not get sidetracked


A thesis might look something like “While the United States maintained its position as a manufacturing superpower in the first five decades after WWII, over time its focus shifted from the production of traditional goods to the creation of innovative electronics.”
Your thesis must specifically mention the time period.Be as direct as possible about the continuity and change over time.

, Unlike the DBQ (Document-Based Question) on the AP exam, you won’t be provided any sources to draw on when writing the CCOT essay. This means that you’ll have to rely on your own knowledge of world history.Jot down the basic facts you know about the topic, as well as any key details that stick out in your mind. Build your essay around these concrete details.
For example, if your topic asks you to consider the development of manufacturing in the United States after WWII, start by writing down what you know about industries during that time period. If you know particular details about developments in the auto industry, you might work with those above all.

, Since the CCOT essay stresses development, it should clearly identify what changes happened when. Think of your essay as telling a story about history, and ask yourself: when was the climax during this time period?For instance, if you are writing about changes and continuities in manufacturing after WWII, you might argue that the Vietnam War and the fuel crisis of the 1970s decisively changed the shape of American industries.

Create a timeline of events to sort out your historical information in order and help identify the turning point.

, One of the quirks of the CCOT essay is that though it asks you to focus on a particular location and time, it also requires you to think about what was going on in the rest of the world at the time. You shouldn’t go into great detail about other locations and topics, but you’ll want to indicate something about how other world events contributed to your topic. Go ahead and start thinking about this as you plan your essay.Continuing with the manufacturing example, your might keep in mind that the fuel crisis of the 1970s led to a rise in imported, fuel-efficient cars, which impacted the auto industry in the United States.

, An introductory paragraph often isn’t necessary for the AP exam (ask your teachers about their preferences if you are writing for class). Often, you can begin the essay with your thesis statement right off the bat. If you do have an introductory paragraph, make sure that your thesis statement is the last sentence in the paragraph., There are lots of potential ways you can organize your essay, and there’s no one right or wrong method. However, discussing the changes before the continuities can help your argument come across more clearly. This is the most common way to organize a CCOT essay, and getting the pattern down through practice will give you one less thing to worry about when you actually sit down to take the exam.Create an outline to serve as the framework for your essay.
For example, you might have a first paragraph that establishes your thesis and the conditions at the start of the time period. This could be followed by two paragraphs on changes that occurred over time. Finally, the essay could close with a paragraph on what stayed the same.

, Though CCOT essay prompts usually ask you to think about broad time periods, you’ll nevertheless want yours to be as specific as possible, and rich in details. As a rule of thumb, try to include 2-3 specific examples in each paragraph.Be selective and organize your thoughts. Don’t just dump out everything you know about a subject.
Stay in the place and time relevant to the prompt. If a prompt asks you to think about the development of manufacturing in the United States, your evidence shouldn’t be based on examples from manufacturing in China.
On the other hand, don’t forget to explain the global significance of your topic. For instance, at some point in your essay, you might note that changes in manufacturing in the United States led to an increasing rise in imported home goods manufactured in China.

, Your essay should clearly state what changed about the topic. To go beyond the basics and write a really good CCOT essay, however, you’ll have to explain the causes of the change(s). This shows your teacher or the exam reader that you know how to analyze a historical situation, not just describe it.If you get stuck, go back to the notes/ideas you had about the turning point, since this can show you exactly what changed, when, and why.

, There are two components to how the CCOT essay is scored on the exam, the Basic Core and the Expanded Core. You can earn up to 7 points for the Basic Core of the CCOT essay, broken down in this way:1 point for having an acceptable thesis
Up to 2 points for addressing all parts of the question
Up to 2 points for effectively using appropriate historical evidence
1 point for explaining the changes in terms of world history and global contexts
1 point for analyzing the process of continuity and change over time

, The Expanded Core offers up to 2 additional points for the CCOT essay. You can earn these points by going above and beyond in writing your essay and analyzing your topic.For example, including several relevant examples of changes and continuities will help you earn points in the Expanded Core.
You cannot earn points in the Expanded Core unless your essay already covers all aspects of the Basic Core.

, Writing lots of CCOT essays ahead of time is a sure-fire way to improve your skills. If you’re taking a class, you’ll have opportunities to do this. Reviewing your writing and getting feedback from your teacher will also help you learn about things you can easily do to write a more successful CCOT essay. For instance:Don’t use evidence from the wrong time period. Using the example of Captain Cook won’t help you if the essay asks you to examine continuities and changes in work exploration between 1400 and 1700.
Avoid vagueness of dates. Don’t write an essay that discusses “exploration before the eighteenth century.” Instead, tell your readers that your essay will discuss changes and continuities from 1492 (Columbus’ first voyage) to Hudson’s voyage of 1609-1611.
Don’t just dump as many facts as possible into your essay. Organize and analyze all information you include, making sure it is relevant.

, Pay particular attention to topics you know a lot about or feel passionate towards. If you are trying to fake it, someone who is genuinely enthusiastic about the topic will beat you. Consider the deadlines for the contests - if you find one due in a few days, don't bother. Don't forget to account for delays in the mail service, if applicable.

, You must consider your audience - if you are writing for the National Rifle Association, for example, you don't want to write about how great gun control is - but you must also submit some new and stimulating ideas.

, University libraries have lots of helpful material. Contacting professionals in the field will pad up your bibliography nicely.

, It is absolutely critical that you conform to any style requirements of the contest. Be conscious of formatting, word count, and citation styles.

, If you must send the essay by mail, think about how long it will take to get to the judges. Send it express if you must. If you can e-mail it, use a standard format like PDF. Don't assume the judges use Word or WordPerfect.

, In the meantime you can start on other contests.

, If includes a certain prompt, such as a question(s) you need to answer, then consider how it's affected you in your life. For example - if the prompt is to write about a good deed that has changed you, flip through old photo albums, scrapbooks, and anything related to your past that could help you think of a good deed you once did that impacted your life. Avoid cliches and try to come up with something that's unique to you and doesn't apply to many people. Also, avoid controversial topics that may affect how judges view your essay.;
, When writing an essay that isn't fact-based, incorporating words to entail things from your life is key. Judges, published authors, and anyone very involved in the writing field will most likely pay more attention to entries that display that the author has a very broad vocabulary.

, Remember to use the majority of your detail on the most significant aspects of your essay. Don't describe a barely-relevant character in heavy detail, for example. If you're just mentioning them to help the reader understand something, then the reader won't care about anything else about the character. However, let's say you're writing an essay on a bullying experience. Describing the bully in heavy detail will help the reader visualize the bully much better for the remainder of the essay.

, You want your voice to come through in the essay without sacrificing professionalism, which can be difficult. Watch out for slang words and casual expressions, as well as common cliches (as mentioned above).

, There's nothing more that judges hate than flawed grammar. Writing your heart out means nothing if you don't know how to structure a sentence properly or don't know grammatical rules. Many people prefer having others read their essay for them so a second set of eyes can point out mistakes that the author accidentally breezed by.

, If you've truly written to the best of your ability, take pride in the effort you put into it and hope for the best!

Take care when using.",How to Use Idioms in IELTS Essay Writing," Idioms are a style of artistic expression characteristic of a particular individual, school, period, or medium. They convey that the current situation has a resemblance with the past history. They are the best tools to make the writing more enjoyable and impressive.;
, For example: ""White Elephant"". It means ""an unprofitable investment"". This idiom is used frequently to refer non-responsive government institutions.

Insert an in-text citation.,
Write the author’s name and book title as the first information in your footnote.,
Add the publishing information.,
Add the page numbers to your footnote.,
Know that articles follow the same format as books.,
Cite an interview in your in-text citations.",How to Write a Chicago Style Essay2," When you reference information from another author or source, you are supposed to tell the reader where you found that information. To do this, you can provide an in-text citation, meaning in the midst of your paper, and a reference sheet at the end of your paper.The in-text citation for a Chicago style paper is a footnote. A footnote is a number inserted at the end of a sentence that corresponds to a citation found at the bottom of that page in your essay.

, For an in-text citation, click at the end of the sentence you are citing, putting the typing bar there. Click “References” on the ribbon bar in Microsoft Word, and hit “Insert Footnote.” That will insert a superscript number that corresponds with a number at the bottom of the page.


Doing this also re-numbers the footnotes as you add new ones, so you don’t have to number the footnotes manually.

, Put the author’s first and last name in the footnote, followed by a comma and the title of the book in italics. For example:


“Georgina Victoire, Robin’s Eggs”

, After the book title, type an open parenthesis, and the place of publication, followed by a colon. Follow that with the publisher’s name, a comma, and the year of publication. Close the parenthesis. For example:


“Georgina Victoire, Robin’s Eggs (Atlanta, Georgia: Peaches and Cream Publishing, 1982)”

, Finally, add a comma and the page number you found the information on. Finish your footnote with a period and remember to leave a line space between each footnote.


“Georgina Victoire, Robin’s Eggs (Atlanta, Georgia: Peaches and Cream Publishing, 1982), 84.”

, An in-text citation of an article would look very similar. It would look like this:


Author, Article Title, Journal’s Title, Volume Number, a comma, and “no.” plus the issue number.
For example: “Livia Hodges, ‘The Joy of Plants,’ Biology for Geeks 25, no. 3 (2001): 27.

, For an interview you perform, you only cite the source in-text. Use the person’s name you are interviewing as the author’s name, just as with other citations: “Brett, John,” Follow it with the person’s occupation in parenthesis, if relevant. Add a comma, followed by reference to yourself and the date:


“Brett, John, (lawyer), in discussion with the author, June 19, 2002.”

"
"
Keep the spacing in mind when creating your reference sheet.,
Keep in mind that the punctuation is slightly different between a footnote and an entry in your reference sheet.,
Cite a journal article on your reference sheet.,
Include the URL or DOI if you access the article online.",How to Write a Chicago Style Essay3," When writing your works cited page, use a line break between each reference but don’t double-space the references. Alphabetize your references by last name on the reference page.Also, leave two lines after the title of the section (either “Bibliography” or “References”).

, You will basically be using the same information for the reference page, minus the page number. However, the punctuation is a little different, and you begin with the last name of the author. For example:


“Victoire, Georgina. Robin’s Eggs. Atlanta, Georgia: Peaches and Cream Publishing, 1982.” As you can see, on the reference page, you use a period after the author, the title, and the date, and you remove the parenthesis. You don’t use the page number here because you are not citing a specific piece of information; you are referencing the book as a whole.

, You will use a similar style as a book with a journal article, beginning with the author’s name. However, instead of a book title, you follow the author’s name with the journal article title in quotation marks with a comma inside the quotation marks. Next, provide the journal’s title, volume number, a comma, and “no.” plus the issue number. Provide the year of publication in parenthesis, followed by a colon and the page numbers the article appears on in the journal. End with a period.For example: “Hodges, Livia. ‘The Joy of Plants,’ Biology for Geeks 25, no. 3 (2001): 24-68.”

, Use the DOI, or digital object finder, if you can find it. The DOI number is a digital reference number for journal articles, much as an ISBN works for books. Adding the date that you access the article is optional. For example:


“Hodges, Livia. ‘The Joy of Plants,’ Biology for Geeks 25, no. 3 (2001): 24-68. Accessed July 14, 2008. www.biology4geeks.com.”

Use subheadings.,
Consider where you would like your title to be.",How to Write a Chicago Style Essay4," Use a legible font in size 10 or 12 point. Double space the paper unless you are writing block quotations. Set your margins to at least an inch all around, though they can be up to 1 ½ inches.Number pages beginning with the first page of text.

, You can format your subheads how you wish, but be consistent. You can use the Chicago style for headings, but it is not necessary. The Chicago style has five levels of subheadings:


Level 1: The subheadings should be in bold or italics, centered, with title-case capitalization (remember to capitalize important words).
Level 2: Regular type, centered, title-case capitalization.
Level 3: Bold or italics, justified left, title-case capitalization.
Level 4: Roman type, justified left, sentence-case capitalization (capitalize the first word and after colons).
Level 5: Bold or italic, part of the paragraph, sentence-case capitalization, and end punctuation.

, You can either create a title page or place a title on the first text page. Either way, the title should be centered.


On the title page, include other biographical information below the title, such as the author and date.

"
Always start the essay off by introducing the text or else the reader doesn't know what you're talking about.,
Form your response to your essay, in the form of an answer to a question, at first.,
Introduce the step as shown in step 1.,
Talk about the text roughly.",How to Structure Paragraphs in an Essay2," You can also add in the question (shown in the next step) and add in which thing that thing came from.

, When you have an essay, it should usually come in with a question or you have to make up your own. The first sentence of the introduction should be rephrasing the question. So, for example, if the question was: How does Puck dominate the mood of the play; for your first sentence, write: Puck is a main-protagonist in the play who dominates the mood of the play by etc.

, It is significant that you introduce the text, author, the date, and what the text is about etc. It is also important that you spell everything correctly including the dates it was written in etc. If you write ‘William Shakespear’ wrote the play instead of ‘William Shakespeare’, you might get deducted with marks because if you can’t spell anything, which means you didn't even have a thorough understanding of the text.

, It is absolutely not a good idea to talk about the text thoroughly or else the reader would either know too much of it so the reader won’t continue reading or it might be too boring. Always tell everything that needs to be told. You don’t have to add in every single thing such as the characters, instead, use the whole ‘group’ word but it is best when there are a few characters.

"
"
Always start with a topic sentence in the body paragraph.,
Discuss or explain the topic in more detail.,
Give some ‘real’ evidence from the text to support your paragraph that you just wrote.,
Conclude your paragraph - you write a sentence which links back to what you have argued about in the original question.",How to Structure Paragraphs in an Essay3," It indicates to the reader which argument you will be using in that paragraph to develop your thesis statement. You write what you are talking about and link back to the question. For example: ‘In ‘Sameness’ there was no such thing as ‘fun’ or wonderful experiences. This also made Jonas wanting to leave the community’. The two sentences before were referring to the question: ‘Discuss why Jonas wanted to leave the Community’. See how you write the question again and the topic sentence?


A topic sentence doesn’t have to be just one sentence. Try not to pass over three sentences.
It is best to write about three ‘body’ paragraphs for beginners.

, This means that you write ‘why’ or ‘how’ it happened etc. You tell the readers in depth (depending on time limit) why did this or that happen. You give evidence as to why you said it by explaining the situations. For example: ‘His strongest feeling was for color. He was so enthusiastic about color that he even asked his friend Asher to see whether or not Asher could see it’ – wonderful experience was color. That gives a recap on what you just said in the topic sentence. It is usually good to only write two paragraphs relating to the topic sentence depending on the time limit. So, for example, you write about the wonderful memories the Give gave him and color.

, You discuss and analyze what you have just said. This can be proved by simply using a quote or a scene from the text. It’s best if you don’t use the word ‘quote’. This gives the reader an understanding of how the things you written were ‘real’ because you supported it. It is best to provide two quotes or scene in each paragraph, three or four if you have a high level. You might even have to memorize them.


For example: ‘Snowflakes. They fall, down from the sky, and they’re very beautiful’. The sentence before explains how he wants the weather to change in ‘Sameness’ and how much he loves snowflakes.

, Just like what you did in the introduction and the topic sentence. You should usually start with the word ‘therefore’ but not ‘hence’ as ‘hence’ usually only refers to one object or thing. So you tell the reader ’that’s why’ something happened.


For example: ‘Therefore, color, fun, wonderful experience, weather etc. are a necessary part of life in Jonas’ opinion. All these factors contribute to making him wanting to leave the community’.

"
"
Use the ‘T.S.S.S’ method.,
Use the ‘I.M.A’ method.,
Use the ‘T.E.F.A.E.C’ method.",How to Structure Paragraphs in an Essay4," This is where you write the topic sentence, the supporting sentence, another supporting sentence with evidence and then another supporting sentence. Finish it off linking back to the question. , Start off with the topic sentence which Introduces concepts and other necessary information. Then you provide more specific information. Finnish it off by making an argument based on the info you have presented to the reader. Then conclude it.

, You begin with a topic sentence which is the statement of the main idea of the paragraph. Then add in the explanation of supporting evidence. Then further evidence is needed. Next, write the application of ideas to a scenario or through the use of an example. Then you evaluate what you said and conclude it that brings the paragraph to a close.

"
"
Conclude your essay.,
Make your closing sentence in your essay last in your readers mind.",How to Structure Paragraphs in an Essay5," You summarise everything you write in three sentences or so. You should always link back to the question and ensure that there is no new information.


You shouldn't start it off with ‘In Conclusion’ as the reader should be able to tell what you write that you’re completing your essay.

, Your last sentence in the conclusion should be the most memorable. Make it sound developed and decent. You explain what happens if that or thing was not there or anything you want.


It is sometimes not good to tell your feelings or opinion unless it is the type that you have to write about.

They should have an understanding of the types of sentence (declarative, imperative, interrogative, exclamatory), active and passive voice, and the ability to correctly match subjects and verbs.

, Once students have mastered the ability to write complete sentences, they then need to learn how to string those sentences together into a paragraph. Students need to learn how to follow one sentence with another, and then another that expands upon the idea presented in the first sentence, and how to arrange sentences so that preceding sentences lead to the idea presented in the final sentence.

, Once students can write coherent paragraphs, they are ready to learn how to connect paragraphs together so that each paragraph introduces the next one, with each paragraph making a stronger statement than the one preceding it. Transition sentences can be placed in the last sentence of the leading paragraph, the first sentence of the following paragraph, or both.


Gradually encourage students to connect two, three, four, and five paragraphs together to build a coherent essay. As students get more familiar with the format, help them learn how to write an introduction, present background information, present information that confirms their beliefs, present information that refutes their beliefs, and then a summary conclusion.

, This can begin with showing students how to observe and write about something in front of them and then compare their written observations with the observations of their fellow students and with professional writers observing the same thing.

, Show the difference between writing facts and writing opinions. Students should learn when it is and isn't appropriate to include their opinions in what they write and how to express those opinions in a polite and professional manner.

, Students need to learn how to select materials to write about, how to read for information and how to analyze it, how to take notes, and then to organize those notes into an outline.


While outlines can be done in the head, students should first learn to do outlines on paper, so they can check the development of their essays against their original plans. They should also learn how to first modify the outline and then the essay itself as they acquire new information that requires them to revise their essays.

Determine what to write about.,
Determine a reason for writing.,
Know the deadline.,
Know the audience for the essay.,
Understand the purpose of the essay.",How to Teach Essay Writing3," This is the subject of the essay. For younger children, determining a subject is enough, while for older children and college students, the subject should be refined into a thesis statement.

, Student should be able to define the idea behind why they are writing their essays, whether they are prompted by something they read or motivated by something that happened.

, Essays, and most other writing assignments, are usually expected to be written within a specific period of time. Understanding how much time is available is the first step in planning how best to use that time.

, Students should understand who will read what they write and how to target their message to that audience. Students should develop an awareness of their audience's present knowledge of the topic, the audience's opinions, and how to inform and persuade that audience.

, Students need to understand whether the essay is to present information about a single subject, present information about a related group of subjects, or make a persuasive argument.

Plan.,
Get those ideas in order.,
Develop your thesis statement.,
Write the essay.,
Write a conclusion.",How to Write a Classification Essay," As with any writing, spend time up front brainstorming ideas and outlining your ideas. In a classification essay, you must take a group of people, things or ideas and logically divide them up. You often think of this in terms of types or categories. Therefore, by way of an example, look at all the teachers in colleges. You could divide them in to different kinds according to their teaching styles. For example, three types might be ""the Hippie"" with a laid-back, anything-goes approach, ""the Snape"" with an overly strict and oppressive style, and ""the Mother Goose"" with a nurturing and parental approach to teaching.

Imagine you want to classify hockey fans. How many types of fans are there at a hockey game? How could they be divided?;
, After that, you can easily create an outline that develops supporting ideas and examples for the classifications you have developed., The thesis is in the first paragraph of an essay and gives the reader an idea of what your essay will be about. It is important that the thesis describes the essay as a classification and that it identifies the key idea. For example, the teachers in a college program could be divided into three main teaching styles: The Snape, the Hippie and the Mother Goose. Words that denote classification are:

divide
separate
classify
sort.

, It is important to make sure the classifications are logical and use a similar basis for classification. Clear examples and details must be given in the body paragraphs to clearly illustrate to the reader what each classification is. For example, you may write this:

""The Snape is a dreaded type of teacher that exists in many classrooms. They derive pleasure in asking questions to the unprepared, giving brutally difficult tests and tormenting the students in general. All students know the type described here. The agony of sitting in the Snape type's class is even worse when they take a disliking to you and watch your every move. The goal, of course, is to catch you doing something undesirable and single you out in front of everyone. Luckily for us, these types are quite rare in our school.""

, Be sure to summarize your key points from your body paragraphs and to end with a strong memorable statement. That is it; you have written a classification essay."

Take pride in your work.",How to Survive the Dissertation Process," Although you won’t begin actively researching or writing a dissertation until you reach the final part of your doctoral program – usually after several years of graduate-level coursework and exams – you should start thinking about potential projects well in advance. Your first few years of graduate school are crucial because they will introduce you to the important scholarship in your field. As you work to master this material, you might as well consider what you might be able to add to it. Keep a running list of your ideas. Ask yourself:


What areas of your field need further exploration? Is some of the existing scholarship lacking in nuance?
Could you apply an existing scholarly model to new situations or difference evidence?
What existing scholarly arguments might be effectively challenged, given appropriate evidence?
Are there important scholarly debates in your field that you might be able to address, using a different focus?;
, Even within the same field, different departments approach the dissertation project in a variety of ways. You need to know what a satisfactory dissertation looks like in your field, from your university, written with the support of your department – and ideally, your particular advisor and committee members. Doing some basic research will help you feel more confident and make the process seem a little less shrouded in mystery. You will be more likely to choose a project that will enable you to fulfill your department’s expectations.


Ask questions. Your advisor or Director of Graduate Studies should be able to give you some information about departmental standards for the dissertation and answer any general questions you have.
Examine completed dissertations from your department. Many universities put doctoral dissertations online or shelve them at the library. Look at a few recent ones. How long are they, on average? What kind of research do they contain? How are they typically organized?

, Be open-minded and receptive to their suggestions.


Remember that people who have been through the dissertation process already may be in a better position than you are to recognize the potential problems with some of your ideas. If they advise you that a particular idea is overly ambitious or that you will be unlikely to find evidence to answer a certain research question, listen to them and take their input seriously.

, You want to choose a project that can be completed in a reasonable amount of time, given the resources you are likely to have.Unfortunately, this sometimes means that you’ll have to set aside some of your most exciting and ambitious ideas. Remember: if you cannot complete your dissertation within the time constraints, then it won’t matter how brilliant or revolutionary your ideas were.


Consider department and university timelines. Most programs limit the number of years you can spend on your dissertation. Know your time constraints, and factor them into the process of choosing a project.
In many fields, you will have to factor in your funding possibilities. How much travel, archival research, and/or laboratory work will your project require? How will you fund that work? How much money, realistically, will you be able to pull together? The answers to these questions will help you determine how realistic a given idea might be.

, Once you’ve solicited advice, considered practical issues, and narrowed down your options, think about which potential projects fascinate you the most. The dissertation process is a long one. You will be living and breathing this project for a long time. Make it something that excites you.

, Once you’ve tentatively chosen a project, you need to read whatever scholarly material already exists on your topic (and even on subjects closely related to your topic). Do exhaustive searches in whatever databases your field typically uses. There is nothing worse than realizing, halfway through your dissertation research, that someone else has already published something that answers your question, or that someone else has already attempted to do so and determined that the evidence does not exist.

, Once you’ve chosen a project and done the necessary background reading, it can be hard to figure out where to start.You haven’t yet undertaken the research necessary to formulate a solid argument, so, for the time being, think of your project as a scholarly question you want to answer. Later, when you think you have the answer, it can become your thesis – the original argument that your dissertation will make.


In general, “how” and “why” questions work best for dissertations, as they will yield richer, more complex answers.

, Once you know where you’ll need to go and what kind of work you’ll need to do, start applying for all available funding – from your department, from your university, and from external organizations.Academic funding moves slowly: you might, for example, apply for a grant in October, receive notice that you’ve won the award (or not) in March, and get to use the money at some point beginning in June. If you don’t cast a wide net and get an early start, you could add years to your dissertation timeline.

, Your advisor will be the person who guides your research, supports you emotionally and mentally through the development of your project, and ultimately signs off on your work. You should select someone whose work you respect, who is relatively easy to get along with, and who communicates effectively.


You should try to find an advisor who is happy to offer guidance but still allows your work to be your work.Someone who is overly rigid may not be easy to work with during revisions or if your work goes in a new direction.

, In general, you want people with whom you’ve already worked closely and whose specific fields of expertise vary. Different perspectives are valuable.Be aware that, depending on your institution, you may not be able to select your committee members. It is common to form your own committee in the US, but in other parts of the world, the dissertation advisor often puts together a committee for the student.

, It’s important to come up with a system that works for you early in the dissertation process – this way, you’ll stay organized and able to keep track of what will quickly become a huge amount of material. Your advisor, committee members, and fellow graduate students are good sources of advice about which kinds of systems work best for your kind of project.


Electronic note-taking systems like Zotero, EndNote, and OneNote are life-savers for many graduate students. They will allow you to keep bibliographic references and research notes organized and coded, and they make searching for specific information much easier. Unless you very strongly prefer paper and pencil, one of these programs will be beneficial. Experiment to see which you like best.

, Using the proper formatting for writing, references, works cited, and footnotes from the start of your project will make your final stages much easier; do not wait until the end and go back to re-format everything.


The appropriate style will vary from field to field; the most common styles are APA, MLA, Chicago, and Turabian.
In addition to the “parent style” of your discipline, your institution may have specific formatting guidelines for your dissertation (such as end notes instead of footnotes). Some even provide templates to use while composing the dissertation. Check with your advisor or the Director of Graduate Studies before you begin writing to find out information about formatting.

, Perhaps your preliminary laboratory test results don’t show what you think they will, or the archive you visit doesn’t have the evidence you think it has. Maybe, after extensive research, you realize that you’re asking an unanswerable question. This is not necessarily a crisis. Most graduate students have to adjust their dissertation plans in some way.


It is quite common from the final dissertation to differ significantly from the prospectus/proposal. As you research, the direction of your work may necessarily shift or change.

, Make sure that you contact your advisor and other committee members with updates on your work and any questions that arise.This will prevent unpleasant surprises down the road – if, for example, a committee member does not like a new direction that your project is taking, it’s better to know that early than to find out when you submit your manuscript.

, Try to think about one chapter (and even one sub-division of one chapter) at a time.

, Even before your research is complete, you can start outlining and writing small parts of your dissertation. Do it! A year in the future, when all you’re doing, it seems, is writing, you will be very, very glad that you did.


Don’t assume that you need to start with your first planned chapter and move straight through the projected manuscript. If your first solid research yields something that speaks to your third chapter, start there! Move back and forth between chapters if that’s what works best.

, Be flexible and realistic when necessary, but try to meet major deadlines. Many people find a reverse calendar quite helpful for dissertation writing.

, Write for an hour or two as soon as you get up. Are you a night owl? Promise yourself you’ll spend two hours writing during that window. Whatever your most productive time of day is, use it for your most difficult work.

, Having a space that is limited to productive work can help you focus and be in “work mode.”

, Don’t wait until you have a completed draft to solicit feedback. At the very least, send chapter drafts to your advisor as you finish them. Even better, share chapters-in-progress with other grad students or trusted mentors in your field.


Many departments offer writing workshops for graduate students. If yours does, take advantage of it! This is a great way to get feedback on your work during its earlier stages.

, Ideally, you’ll want to aim to take one day a week completely off from your dissertation work. You’ll have time to recharge, and you’ll return to your work with more energy and a fresh perspective. So get together with friends or family, go to the movies, take a yoga class, bake something delicious – whatever makes you feel rested and happy.


Consider building larger breaks into the process. If you wait until your dissertation is complete to celebrate your work and take a break, you’ll have a long, grim road ahead of you. Take a three-day weekend when you finish a chapter draft! Celebrate the end of a long, difficult research trip with a week of relaxation! This time off might feel lazy or frivolous, but it’s not – it’s necessary for your well-being.

, Doctoral candidates are notoriously unhealthy. They suffer from anxiety, stress, and depression; they eat poorly, skip exercising, and don’t get enough sleep. But you will be stronger and more productive if you take care of yourself, so don’t fall into this trap!


Eat well. Get enough protein, fiber, and vitamins, and drink plenty of water. Avoid sugary junk, fried foods, and excessive amounts of alcohol – all of these things will make you feel worse.
Maintain an exercise routine. You may think you don’t have time, but if you make it a priority, you can carve out thirty minutes a day for some kind of exercise – running, biking, even just walking.
Get enough sleep.Don’t be a martyr to the dissertation cause: you can get it done without staying up all night. Get your eight hours, and you’ll feel much better.

, While you are still working on your dissertation is the time to become active in your field. Talk to your advisor about the potential of publishing parts of your research prior to finishing the dissertation. Attend and present at conferences. Deliver presentations or poster sessions about your research. Discuss your work with other people in the field and ask for advice.Dress and act like a professional, not like an undergraduate student, while you are at conferences.
The prospect of becoming a professional academic can help you stay motivated in the final stages of your dissertation work.

, Once the end of your dissertation is in sight, you’ll need to know what your department and your university require in order to award you the degree. Do you need to schedule a defense of your dissertation? Who needs to approve your work? What paperwork will you need to turn in? Once you know the answers to these questions, you’ll be able to plan the final stages of your doctoral program.

, Meet with each committee member. Let him or her know that you are approaching completion, and ask what they’d like from you. How far in advance of the defense do they need to see a manuscript? Do they foresee any problems passing you?


This process will be much easier if, as suggested above, you kept in contact with your committee members throughout the dissertation process. Ideally, this will be a formality: there shouldn’t be any surprises.

, If you will have to defend your dissertation to your committee members, practice explaining your argument succinctly and, especially, describing the value of your work. This will come in handy at your defense, but it will also serve you well afterward, at conferences or in job interviews.


Practice answering, especially, the “so what?” question.Imagine a committee member says to you, “So, you’ve demonstrated that . So what?” How would you answer? Know why your work matters in your field.

, Dissertations are long, and you’ll likely be exhausted by the time you get to the home stretch. Have several people read your draft before you hand it to your committee members. This will eliminate unnecessary mistakes and identify unclear passages that need work.

, As you complete your writing, you may start to worry about what your committee will think of your work. Keep in mind that no one knows your material as well as you do. Have faith in yourself. You are now the one and only expert on this small aspect of your field.

, As you finish your dissertation, you may feel especially anxious – worried about your defense, concerned about your work’s value, stressed out about finishing graduate school and moving on to a new phase of your life. These feelings are normal, but don’t let them get out of control. Talk to a trusted friend, and practice the healthy habits described above.

, Whether you have a formal defense or not, completing your dissertation is a massive, once-in-a-lifetime accomplishment. Enjoy it. Be proud of yourself. Share the moment with friends and family. Celebrate a job well done – you are now a Dr.!

Check that you followed your instructor's guidelines.",How to Stretch out an Essay," Print out a copy of your essay and read through it. As you go, make notes in the margins. Ask questions regarding your essay's content. Challenge some of the assertions and arguments you have made. This will help you figure out where you need to expand.


Pause after each paragraph and ask yourself what else you could say. What facts are missing? What perspectives are you overlooking?
For example, an essay arguing about something like global warming could always use more facts. You could write things in the margins like, ""What are some specific predictions scientists have made? What specific proposals have been put in place to limit corporate pollution?"";
, Complexity is important in any essay. As you comb through your draft, look for examples of black and white thinking. At what points are you presenting a binary perspective instead of seeing the gray areas? This is especially important if you're writing an argumentative essay or a persuasive essay. It's important you thoroughly understand the other side's point of view.


For example, say you're writing an essay about the merits of vaccinations, arguing against recent anti-vaccination campaigns. Your central argument should be more than just, ""Vaccines are good."" In what ways can this be demonstrated?
You could talk about how vaccines prevent diseases, the lack of evidence of their poor health effects, and show how infectious diseases have been historically wiped out by vaccines.
Look at what you're saying about the other side as well. Do not simply say, ""Anti-vaccination campaigns are bad."" Try to understand where the other side is coming from, and why people may be fearful of vaccines. Try to debunk common misconceptions, while exploring why greater public education is necessary to help people understand the benefits of vaccinations.

, This is especially helpful if you're writing a literary essay. Pulling a quotation out of a work of literature can help you better prove your point. As you read through your essay, pay attention to areas that may be confusing without quotations to help ground the reader.For example, you may be writing about the theme of suicide in Shakespeare's Hamlet. You have written something like, ""It's the uncertainty of death, and not a love of life, that ultimately pushes Hamlet away from suicide.""
The above sentiment may need some context for readers to understand. You could quote a portion of Hamlet's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" soliloquy after this sentence. From there, you could analyze the words and show how they prove your point.
Make sure not to overdo it on quotes. Do not quote the entire soliloquy, for example. Instead, choose a few lines that speak to your point. Over quoting may make it look like you're trying to stretch the essay out without actually expanding on your ideas. Quote a few sentences over an entire paragraph.

, Context may be important to an essay. Your reader may need to know a little history to understand the point you are making. As you work on your literary essay, look for places where you can add context to help the reader better understand.


For example, say you're comparing recent congressional decisions to the New Deal politics of FDR's administration. Your argument is something like, ""We need more New Deal politics in modern America."" Do not assume your readers have an advanced understanding of the New Deal.
Spend some time explaining what the New Deal was, and list its benefits. You should also explain the historical context of the New Deal. What did the US economy look like before the New Deal? What did it look like after? How does the New Deal continue to influence US politics?

, You may not have all the answers you need right away. As you find places where you essay needs to be expanded, you may find you need to return to basic research. If you find you need additional facts, quotes, or historical context, hit up your school's library or research online. Additional information could help substantially stretch an essay.


Go through your notes again. You may have jotted something down in the margins in regards to what portions of the essay need more work.

, As you begin to add content, take it one paragraph at a time. Interrogate every paragraph as you go, and add the new information you gathered as needed.


Each paragraph should support your central idea. Read each paragraph carefully and ask yourself, ""What is this paragraph doing for my essay? What argument am I making here, and how is it relevant?""
From there, see how you can make the paragraph more substantial. Could you use more facts? Do you need more historical context? Is your thinking too black and white?
Avoid rambling, however. Stick to one idea per paragraph. If you find yourself introducing a new idea or topic, start a new paragraph. For example, returning to the New Deal essay, you've just listed the benefits of the New Deal. You begin talking about the US before and after the New Deal. This is a different subject. Begin a new paragraph.

, While you do not want to needlessly expand sentences, an essay can sound more eloquent with longer, more complex prose. Evaluate each sentence in a paragraph. Is this sentence interesting enough? Is it clear enough? Short sentences may need expansion to better express your ideas and improve your prose overall.For example, you see the sentence, ""Hamlet is a very sad character, and this is why he contemplates suicide."" This does not tell the reader all that much, and the sentence is a bit plain. You could break this up into a couple of more dynamic, specific sentences.
Instead, you could write something like, ""Hamlet is reeling from the death of his father, and feels betrayed and disgusted by his mother's quick decision to remarry his uncle. This rattles his idea of safety and comfort, and the internal dilemma that follows is what forces Hamlet to consider taking his own life.""

, Return to your research as you write. You may have found some background information you did not know. See if this information fits anywhere in your essay.


If you're writing an English essay, the author's background can help give context to the work. For example, say you're writing an essay on Virginia Woolf's ""The Death of a Moth."" Is there anything in Woolf's background that could help give context to the essay.
You can add information here about Woolf's struggles with suicidal thoughts. The idea of the moth struggling for life can serve as a contrast to Woolf's occasional desires to end her life.

, Once you've gone through and expanded, see if your introduction and conclusion need to be tweaked. You may need to add new information as the argument you're making may have shifted slightly. As the conclusion is a reiteration of your main ideas, you may have to summarize some new ideas and information in your conclusion.


For example, in your current essay, your introduction begins, ""Hamlet is a play about emotional difficulties."" Find a way to make that crisper and more attention-grabbing. For example, ""Hamlet is a play that primarily focuses on the emotional landscape of the titular character's mind, allowing Shakespeare to explore themes of death, grief, loss, and suicide.""
In your introduction, refer to the new evidence you have added throughout. For example, ""The moment in the 'To Be or Not to Be' soliloquy, in which Hamlet ponders what dreams may come after death, speaks to the plays central theme of uncertainty, not enlightenment or love of life, preventing suicide.""

, After you expand your essay, careful proofreading is important. You want to make sure your essay is free of grammatical errors before turning it in for a grade.Try to give yourself some distance from your essay. You may not recognize your own errors when you're reading the works in your head rather than what's on the page. If you have time, set the essay aside for a day and then come back to it.
Change the look of the document, as this can also help you proofread more effectively. Changing the font, or printing out the document, may help you better catch errors.
Find a place to work that's quiet and free of distractions.
Ask a friend or family member to look over your essay to help you catch typos.

, In addition to basic proofreading, you should give another read through for content. If the essay has changed greatly in the expansion process, you will want to make sure your content is still solid.Does the structure work? Does your information flow in a logical manner? Are there transitions between ideas?
Make sure your writing style is consistent and appropriate for the assignment. If you're writing an analytical essay, your writing should be free of personal pronouns.
Is everything in your essay clear? Do you explain any words or ideas that may be unfamiliar to your reader? Are your ideas supported by facts and evidence?

, Lastly, check your assignment sheet one more time. In addition to meeting page length requirements, make sure your essay meets your instructor's standards.


Many instructors have requirements for font size and type. Make sure you're using the proper font. Your instructor may ask for specific margin lengths as well.
If a works cited page was required, make sure you list all your sources properly and are following the right citation guidelines. Do not follow MLA guidelines if your instructor wants APA guidelines.
If you're required to include something like a title page, make sure you do.

Include supporting body paragraphs.,
End with the moral of the narrative.,

Start with an anecdote.",How to Start a Personal Narrative," A personal narrative should focus on something that was pivotal or meaningful in your life. Ask yourself, “What events in my life stand out the most for me? What events taught me something or made me realize something life changing?” Choose an event that feels full of meaning and significance to you personally. These events usually make the best story ideas for a personal narrative.For example, you may choose a meaningful event like the death of your mother at a young age or the first time you won a competition at school.;
, A good personal essay will have an underlying moral or lesson, where the speaker undergoes a realization or change. Think of an experience where you learned a valuable lesson that you carried with you moving forward. Or an experience where you made a moral decision that shifted you in some way.For example, you may pick an experience where you lost an important match, only to learn the value of failing and do better. Or you may choose an experience where you made a moral decision to help someone, which then lead to positive outcomes for you and the person.

, You can also go for a story idea that centers on a theme. You can then use your personal story to explore the theme in detail and from your perspective. Try to choose a theme that feels particular to you and your point of view.For example, you may choose a theme like love and use it to explore your experience of love growing up in a family with two fathers. Or you may choose a theme like freedom and use to to explore your struggles with freedom as a refugee.

, Most personal narratives use a first person narrator, the “I.” Using the first person will make it easier for you to write the essay from your perspective and your personal experiences. Tell the personal narrative in your voice using “I” so the reader gets a sense of your point of view.You can decide to write the personal narrative in the past tense or in the present tense based on your preference. If you are writing the personal essay for school, the guidelines may prefer the past tense.

, Even though your essay is personal, it should still have a thesis statement. Your thesis statement should appear after the hook, in the first paragraph of your essay. The thesis statement in a narrative essay can explore the events of the story in a brief way. Or it can tell the reader about the moral or lesson learned through the personal experience. You can also present the main theme in the essay in the thesis statement.For example, if you are writing an essay about your personal experience as a refugee, you may have a thesis statement that presents the theme of freedom. You may write, “My journey is just one of many. We all came to a new country carrying nothing more than hope and memories of the past.”

, Your personal essay should include a body section where you present supporting evidence for your thesis statement. The supporting evidence can be in the form of the events of the story you are telling. Do this chronologically so it is easy for the reader to follow. Or use terms to frame time, such as “now,” “later,” or “then” if you decide to jump around in time when telling the story.For example, you may have three supporting body paragraphs where you tell your personal narrative based on the theme of your essay. You may start with your experience of “freedom” in your home country in the first paragraph, followed by your experience of the same theme in your new country in the second paragraph.

, Most personal narratives end with a moral or lesson stated in the concluding paragraph. This paragraph should include a reflection on how the personal experience shifted or changed you in the present. Consider why the personal event is significant and meaningful to you.For example, you may end the essay by stating the lesson or moral you learned from the personal experience. Or you may note how the experience has positively affected your life now.

, To help you get started on your personal narrative, structure out your essay so you have a plan when you begin writing. Always begin your essay with a hook, or an opening that draws the reader in. The hook should be short, clear, and easy to read. It should give the reader a sense of what to expect from your essay.The hook is usually not longer than one to two sentences. It starts your introductory paragraph.

, One way you can open the personal narrative is to start right in scene, with the “I” in action. Set the scene with specific details and strong imagery. Describe the setting and have the “I” do things in the setting to create an engaging opening scene.For example, you may with, “I huddled under my Disney Princess bed cover as my father banged on my bedroom door. As I listened to his muffled screams, I wondered if it was possible to simply disappear, away from my lonely home life and my failing high school grades.”

, You can also start with a question to the reader to get them thinking. Choose a question that focuses on the theme of your personal narrative. Address the reader directly in the question. Keep the question short and clear so the reader can follow along.For example, you may start with a question like, “Have you ever wondered how it might feel to leave your home forever?” or “Have you ever felt like a stranger in your own country?”

, Choose an interesting fact that connects back to your personal experiences. Or use a funny statement that relates to the theme of your essay. Starting with an interesting fact or statement can draw your reader in and get them thinking right away.For example, you may start with an interesting fact about lawnmowers if your personal narrative is about how mowing lawns as a kid taught you the value of hard work. Or you may choose a funny statement about winning and losing if your personal essay is about learning how to accept failure.

, Another option is to begin with a short anecdote that connects to the larger story. An anecdote is often one to three sentences long and explores a lesson or moral. It should raise questions in your reader’s mind and introduce key ideas in the essay.For example, if you are writing about learning how to accept failure, you may start with an anecdote about your father telling you not to lose a softball game as a kid. Or if you are writing about your personal experiences as a refugee, you may use an anecdote on a moment of acceptance you experienced in your new country.

Flavor the meat.,
Stuff the meat into casings.,
Dry for additional time.,
Dry at a lower temperature for 17 more days.,
Preheat a smokehouse to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius).,
Smoke the meat for 10 hours.Place the capicola inside the smoker and completely open the dampers or vents.,
Smoke the meat for an additional 15 to 20 hours.,
Remove the pork and dip it into boiling water.,
Dry for 20 days before using.",How to Make Capicola," Remove any excess fat from the surface, and shave away meat from the muscle bundle to round it off.

Note that if you use a pork shoulder cut of meat, the muscle bundle you are trying to obtain is the portion that would like just to the side of the shoulder blade.
If using pork butt, opt for Berkshire rather than Heritage since the latter has more fat and less muscle fiber content. If you cannot find Berkshire, however, commodity pork will also work.
You can save the trimmings to make sausage, if desired, or you could discard them.;
, Wrap the pork in wax paper and place it in a cool sanitary area, like a meat locker or refrigerator. Allow it to reach an internal temperature of 36 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius).

Note that you should check the temperature of the meat using a meat thermometer. Avoid guessing; for health reasons, you should make sure that the meat completely cools to this temperature.

, Place the salt, sugar, pepper, cure #2, garlic powder, juniper berries, and mace in a spice mill. Grind them down until thoroughly pulverized into a powder.

Note that cure #2 is the same thing as Prague powder #2. It contains 6.25 percent sodium nitrite, 1 percent sodium nitrate, and 92.75 percent salt. In general, cure #2 breaks down at a slower pace, which makes it safer to use for meats that have a prolonged curing time, like capicola.Overall, this powdered cure blend you create must contain a minimum of 4.5 percent salt based on the weight of the meat before you cure it. This is the only way that the Trichinella sp. bacteria will be destroyed.

, Divide your spice-cure mixture in half. Thoroughly rub one half of this mixture over all sides of the pork.

Save the rest of the spice-cure mixture in an airtight container until ready to use.

, Place the meat in a single layer inside a non-reactive container. Place this container in a sanitized cooler or refrigerator set to a temperature of 36 to 38 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 3 degrees Celsius). Let it remain there for 9 days.

If curing more than one capicola, lay the cuts of meat in a single layer. Do not stack them.
Use a plastic or glass container. Do not use a container made from reactive material, like metal.
Cover the meat with plastic wrap as it chills to prevent air from getting in and to prevent it from drying out.

, Remove the plastic wrap after the original 9-day period passes. Rub all the sides of the meat with the remaining spice-cure mixture, then turn the meat in the cure lying at the bottom of the container to re-coat., Place the meat back in the container and stick the container back into your refrigerator or cooler, still set to a temperature between 36 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 3 degrees Celsius).

Keep the pork covered with plastic wrap during this time.

, After the meat has chilled for a full 18 days, remove it from the cooler and rinse off any spice-cure mixture still on it using cool running water.

Pat the meat dry with clean paper towels before proceeding.

, Place the cut of pork on a sanitized rack in a cool, dry place. Allow the capicola to dry there for 3 hours., Turn the casings inside-out and soak them in a solution made from water and citrus for 2 hours.

The water-citrus solution can be made by squeezing the juice of two oranges and two lemons into 1 L (1 qt) of cold water. Let the juiced peels sit in the water, as well.
Soaking the casings in this manner removes any odor and also strips away any cholesterol in the casings.
Let the casings air dry for another 1 hour after you soak them.

, The flavoring blend can be prepared to your liking, but it should contain eight parts powdered glucose, four parts corn syrup solids, and one part spice mix. Mix these ingredients together in a small bowl until evenly distributed.

For spice mix options, try:

Crushed black pepper
Half cayenne pepper and half fancy paprika
Half black pepper, finely ground, and half ground fennel seeds
Half ground black pepper and half fancy paprika



, Rub your flavoring blend over all sides of the pork. Let sit for 10 minutes at room temperature, allowing the flavors to seep into the meat., Working carefully, stretch the prepared casings over the meat, covering the meat with these casings completely.

Note that if you did not use prepared pork casings, you could use beef bungs or collagen casing.
If you notice any air pockets after you stuff the casings, use a clean pin to prick these pockets and deflate them.

, Place the pork in a dry location with an ambient temperature of 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 26 degrees Celsius). Let it remain there for 12 hours if using beef bung or pork casings, or 6 hours if using collagen casings.

If you plan on smoking the meat, you can skip over these additional air drying steps and jump directly to the smoking section. Capicola does not need to be smoked, however, and can be used after thoroughly air drying it post-casing.

, Transfer the capicola to an area with an air temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius). Hold it there for 17 more days.

Note that the relative humidity of this last area should be between 70 and 80 percent.

, A traditional smokehouse works best, but if you do not have access to one, you could use a grill. Charcoal grills work better for smoking meat than gas grills do.

In particular, consider using a kettle-style grill or a ceramic Japanese-style grill that looks like an outdoor oven. Other great options include a water smoker or large pit smoker with a chimney and separate fire box., Monitor the temperature, keeping it at 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) for the full 10 hours.

Leaving the dampers open at the beginning can help dry out the casings. You can, however, close the dampers until they are only a quarter of the way open once the casings feel dry. Doing so will apply a light amount of smoke to the meat.

, After the 10 hours pass, close the dampers so that they are only one quarter of the way open, if you have not done so already. Smoke the capicola for another 15 to 20 hours at 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius)., Ready a large pot of boiling water immediately before the capicola is ready to come out of the smoker. As soon as you remove the meat, dip it into the hot water for a few moments.

This process causes the casings to shrink and cling to the meat.

, Transfer the capicola to a dry room with a relative humidity between 65 and 75 percent and a temperature between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 and 24 degrees Celsius). Keep it there for at least 20 days.

Once the capicola has finished drying, the process is complete. As long as proper procedures were followed, this deli meat should be ready to shave into slices and enjoy.

Avoid clichés and overused quotations.,
Use a surprising comment.,
Research the quote’s context.,
Know your audience.,
Hook your reader.,
Ensure that the quotation contributes to your essay.,
Introduce the quotation appropriately.,
Punctuate the quote appropriately.,
Attribute the quote correctly.,
Be true to the meaning and context of the quote.,
Use a fragment of a long quote.,
Introduce the quotation.,
Provide context for the quotation.,
Connect the quotation to your thesis.",How to Start an Essay With a Quote," Using a quotation that is very famous in the same way that everyone uses that quotation will bore your reader.It could also make you seem lazy or as though you haven't considered your audience.;
, Finding a quote that is surprising in some way. Consider one of the following approaches:


Quote a person saying something that someone would not expect them to say.
Quote someone who is not universally famous.
Use a well-known quote but contradict it.

, Knowing the context in which the quotation was originally used is important to using it accurately. It will also help you determine whether the quote is an appropriate means of introducing your essay.

, The effectiveness of the quotation you use will be determined by the audience of your paper.


Determine whether the audience will be familiar with the person who you are quoting. If it is someone obscure or you think they will not be familiar, consider providing additional (brief) details.
Do not use a quote that could be offensive to the audience unless you plan to contradict the quotation.
Strike a balance between assuming your audience knows everything and assuming they know nothing. You should be clear and informative but not insulting to the intelligence of your reader.

, Think of a quotation as a “hook” that will engage your reader and make her want to read more of your paper. The well-executed quotation is one way to draw your reader in to your essay., A snappy quotation that doesn't help to set up your topic, or that is unrelated to the rest of your essay, will distract from the essay's focus., Quotes should not stand alone in your paper. Your words should introduce the quotation, usually coming before the quote (though after may be okay). Several options for introducing the quotation are available to you:


Use the quote as a sentence predicate. The subject of the sentence will be the person who said the quote, and the verb will most likely be a synonym of “said.” For example, ""Jane Smith said, 'blah blah blah.'""
Preview the content of the quote. Use your own (grammatically correct) sentence to preview or paraphrase what the quote will say, then insert a colon or comma, then the (grammatically correct) sentence-length quotation. For example: ""Once Jane Smith said something completely awesome: 'the awesome thing she said.'""
Begin with the quote. If you begin with the quote, be sure to place a comma after the quote and then provide a verb and attribute the quotation to the source. For example: ""'Blah blah blah,' said Jane Smith.""

, Quotations should always appear with quotation marks around them. Failing to use quotation marks may result in plagiarism.The quote only needs to be capitalized if it begins the sentence or if the first word of the quote is a proper noun, like the name of a person or a place.
In American usage, end punctuation should be placed inside the quotation marks. For example, “this is the quote.”
Paraphrased material (someone else’s idea put into your own words) need not have quotation marks around it, but should be attributed to the original speaker.
If you introduce the quote with the speaker’s name and a verb, provide a comma before the beginning of the quotation. For example: ""Jane Smith said, 'blah blah blah.'""

, This may seem obvious, but be sure the person who you’re quoting actually said the quote. Not all sources of information are legitimate, so looking at an academic source rather than an internet source may be more accurate. Starting your paper with a glaring mistake will set a bad precedent for the rest of your ideas.


Be particularly aware of quotations found on social media such as Pinterest, or on quote aggregators such as Brainyquote. These sources are notorious for mis-attributing and even making up famous quotes.

, This is tied to academic honesty. Do not manipulate a quotation to fit your purposes by leaving out words or misleading the audience about the context of the quotation., If the quotation is long, or you only need part of it to make your point, you can leave sections out by using an ellipses (…).You may also need to substitute a word (like a name rather than a pronoun) for clarity. If you need to substitute a word, place square brackets around the word to indicate that you made a change. For example: ""Jane Smith said, 'blah blah.'""
Be sure to keep the original intent of the quotation when making changes. Changes should be made only to preserve clarity or to change length, not to manipulate the content of the quotation.

, The quotation needs to be introduced in your own words. This can come either before or after the quote itself. You should identify the speaker of the quotation.

, Particularly if your quote is the first sentence in your paper, be sure to provide 2-3 sentences of explanation and context. There should be a clear sense of why you are choosing to use the quotation and why it is important to the rest of your paper.

, You should provide an explicit connection between the quotation and your thesis, or the central argument of your paper.Be sure that the quotation you use supports your thesis.
Be sure that using the quotation enhances, rather than distracting from, your argument."

Show, rather than tell.",How to Start a Descriptive Essay," One possible topic for a descriptive essay is a person that you feel strongly about, such as a mentor, a friend, a parent, or a role model. The person may be someone very close to you who knew you during a formative period in your life, such as your mother. Or the person could be someone you do not know well who has qualities you admire or wish to emulate, such as your favorite basketball player.If you are writing the descriptive essay for a college application, you may choose a person who is a role model or a mentor to you. Describing this person in the essay will give you the chance to discuss why this person is important to you and the lessons you have learn from this person.;
, Another possible topic option for a descriptive essay is an object that has meaning or significance to you. The object could be from childhood or adolescence. It could be your favorite object as a kid or the object you hated the most. Maybe the object has sentimental value or holds deep meaning for you.For example, you may choose your favorite childhood toy as the topic for the essay. You could then describe the toy and what it meant to you growing up.

, Identify a place that is important to you and describe it in your essay. The place could be your hometown, your bedroom, or your favorite spot at school. You could also choose the ideal place, or where you would go if you could go anywhere in the world.For example, you may choose the most beautiful place you have ever been to. You can then describe the experience of the place and how it made you feel.

, Choose a significant event in your life and use it as the topic of your essay. The event could have happened recently or very far back in the past. Pick an event that taught you something or shifted your world view.For example, you may choose the first time you got your period or the first time you visited a relative in the hospital.

, One option for outlining a descriptive essay is to use a chronological pattern, where you move in the order of time. The writing will move from scene to scene, describing events or moments as they happened. This is a good outlining option if you are writing about an event or memory in your descriptive essay. The outline will look like:Paragraph 1: Introduction
Paragraph 2: Scene 1
Paragraph 3: Scene 2
Paragraph 4: Scene 3
Paragraph 5: Conclusion
You can use five paragraphs for this outline or have more than one paragraph for each scene.

, A spatial pattern follows the order of space, where you break the essay down by location. The writing will move like a film camera, providing details in each location. This is a good option if you are writing about a place in your descriptive essay. The outline will look like:Paragraph 1: Introduction
Paragraph 2: Location 1
Paragraph 3: Location 2
Paragraph 4: Location 3
Paragraph 5: Conclusion

, A climatic pattern follows the order of importance, where items are organized from less important to more important. This will allow you to save the most important point or climatic moment for the end of the essay. You can use this outline for most topics, from a person to an object to a place or an event. The outline will look like:Paragraph 1: Introduction
Paragraph 2: Least important point or detail
Paragraph 3: Second least important point or detail
Paragraph 4: Key point or detail
Paragraph 5: Conclusion

, No matter what outline or pattern you choose for the descriptive essay, you should still have a thesis statement. The thesis statement should appear in the introduction and the conclusion of the essay. A strong thesis statement will state the key idea or theme in your essay. It will serve as a guide or map for the rest of the essay.For example, if you are writing about a person who is your role model in the essay, your thesis statement may be, “Based on her actions that day in my 6th grade classroom, she taught me how to rise above negativity and be confident in my abilities as an artist.”

, Draw your reader in by starting with a first line that will grab the reader’s attention right away. The first line could start in scene with a strong description of an event, place, object, or person. You could also describe the first time you experienced an event, place, object, or person. Take the reader straight into the experience so they feel immersed and engaged.For example, you may describe the first time you held an important object, “The first time I held the All American Girl doll in my hands, with its porcelain skin and glassy blue eyes, I swore to protect it with my life.”

, Situate the reader by providing brief background on the topic. Give the reader just enough information to understand the significance of the object, place, event, or memory you are writing about in the essay. The context should ground the reader in the essay.For example, you may briefly explain why the object was so significant to you based on your experience or knowledge at the time. You may write, “Up to this point, I had never owned a doll before and while other little girls waved around their dolls in the playground, I had to wait until my fifth birthday to get my own.”

, A key element of a good descriptive essay is a lot of details that focus on the five senses: smell, taste, touch, sight, and sound. Put a lot of sensory details into your opening paragraph. Describe how a scene sounds or tastes. Discuss how an object feels or smells. Explore how a place sounds and looks.For example, rather than write “The doll was pretty,” you may write with sensory detail. “The doll felt soft and cold in my hands. It smelled like flowers and baby powder. It sounded hollow when I pressed it to my chest.”

, To write a good opening for your essay, focus on showing your reader a scene, rather than telling them the scene. Avoid reporting on the events as they happened or just the action of a scene. Instead, use sensory detail and vivid descriptions to place the reader in a place, an event, a moment, or a memory.For example, you may describe how it feels to be in your childhood home by writing, “The best memories in my childhood home appear on the walls, dents, scratches, and markings made by my siblings and I when we wrestled or ran around inside.”
If you are writing about a person, use examples of their behavior to show the reader their character, rather than simply tell the reader what to think.
For example, you may write, “Mrs. Sands showed me compassion by always taking the time to work with me after class. I would sit on the small wooden chair by her desk, pencil in hand, while she explained how to conjugate a verb. ‘To be,’ she said, her voice patient but firm.”

Essay prompts can seem overwhelming at first, especially if they incorporate a lot of information, but knowing what you're looking for can help you decipher them.


Most prompts begin with some contextual information about the topic of the essay. While this can seem superfluous, read it carefully; it may give you a clue about how your teacher wants you to frame the topic of the essay.
The ""task"" of the essay prompt will usually be worded with active verbs such as summarize, describe, compare, contrast, analyze and/or argue. These verbs will help you know what type of essay the prompt is asking for.Sometimes the prompt will offer a list of questions or suggestions for further thought. Read this section attentively: sometimes these questions or suggestions may just be a way to prompt your own thinking, but other times it may be required to address them all in your essay.
Many prompts will conclude with a list of formatting requirements: common requirements include ""12-pt font,"" ""double-spaced,"" and ""1-inch margins,"" but your prompt may also ask for others. Make sure you adhere to all of these requirements in your final draft! Failure to do so may cost you points on the essay.;
, Knowing exactly what your teacher expects from you is the first step to starting your essay successfully. You should read the prompt as soon as possible after it is given to you.Read any questions or prompts several times. You may want to re-write the prompt in your own words to be sure that you understand it. Paraphrasing can help you remember and interpret information more effectively.If you have a choice between several essay prompts, choose the one that you feel the most comfortable with or the one that you think you can write about in the most detail.
Ask questions if you are confused or unsure about the teacher’s expectations.

, Find out if there is a grading rubric for the essay and ask to see it ahead of time so that you can see how your work will be evaluated. This can help you know where to focus most of your time.

, If your essay assignment is open-ended and you have to completely choose your own topic, come up with several ideas and then choose the one that you think will make the best essay: it may not be the first idea that pops into your mind.


A good essay topic is broad enough that you will have plenty to say, but not so broad that you can't say anything of substance. An essay about ""the impact of Shakespeare"" is too broad; you could write a dozen books about that topic. An essay about ""the impact of Shakespeare on common English phrases"" is narrower, but still offers you plenty to think about.

, Is it to persuade your reader of something? Is it to convey an experience? Is it to present a critical analysis of a text or image? Knowing your goal will help you decide how to navigate your ideas.

, The best way to start an essay is to get your ideas out in a non-essay format to begin with. Prewriting can take many different forms, and you may want to experiment to find one that helps you the most.


Freewriting, a process in which you just write what you are thinking about without worrying about grammar or punctuation or even your central argument, may be a good way to start generating ideas. It could also help you “find” your thesis.A simple list may be all you need. Write a list of the subtopics or specifics you want to include in the essay.
A mind map may be a helpful prewriting guide for visual learners. The center of the mind map contains your main argument, or thesis, and other ideas branch off in all directions., As you write, think about what you might need if you were reading the essay. If it's a history essay, what context would you need about your topic? If it's a narrative essay, what information would you need to feel as though you had experienced the event?, One of the biggest causes of writer's block is striving for perfection before you've written a word. Don't censor yourself as you prewrite. Try to avoid negative thoughts such as ""This doesn't make any sense"" or ""I can't express what I want to say."" Just write everything down!, If you have used one of the prewriting methods listed above, reorganize the content and add detail by creating an outline. A traditional outline is a great format for getting out ideas in detail and organizing your entire essay.Begin each section of your outline with the main point. Indicate each section with a roman numeral (For example, I. Puppies are cute.)
Provide at least two sub-points for your main point. Indicate each sub-point with a capital letter (For example, A. Puppies look cute, B. Puppies act cute.)
Provide at least two details for each sub-point. Indicate your details with a number (For example, A- 1. Puppies have sweet faces, 2. Puppies are small, and little things are usually cute. B- 1. Puppies play and roll around all the time, making people laugh, 2. Puppies are very affectionate and lick their owners to show love.)
Each level of detail should be indented further to the right than the level before.

, Be sure that the organization makes sense, and re-organize or switch sections around if you need to. Be sure that each section has a similar amount of detail, and add detail to any sections that need to be developed.

, Your thesis will vary based on whether your paper is analytic, argumentative, or expository. Thinking about the verbs used in the prompt and the goal of your essay will help you decide what direction it needs to take.An argumentative thesis will indicate a position (side of the argument) as well as introduce the topic.
An expository thesis will introduce what is going to be explained in the paper.
An analytical thesis will introduce the topic and contextualize the reason for the analysis.

, Your thesis statement should provide an answer to the question ""So what?"" Ask yourself how your argument or analysis contributes to your reader's understanding.

, Developing your thesis statement is an important part of writing your paper. If you try to write it before you’ve done any thinking or research about your topic, you’re unlikely to be successful.


Refer back to your prewriting and try to find relationships between the ideas there.
Think about your essay assignment and what you most want to say: the thesis statement will likely be somewhere in between those two things.

, If you are having trouble with this step, or if you feel like the pressure to have a perfect thesis statement is interfering with getting started, try using a “working” thesis statement. This will enable you to move on without getting too stuck, knowing that you’re going to go back and change the thesis.

, Remember that you can always revise or change the language later, so don’t spend too much time worrying about the exact wording.


Your thesis should answer the question posed by the essay prompt (if there was a prompt).
A thesis statement is usually the last sentence of your introduction, but it may occasionally be the very first sentence of your paper.
Do not write your thesis statement as a question.

, An example of a typical three-prong thesis might be ""Puppies are good for your health because they are cute, affectionate, and inexpensive."" The trouble with thesis statements such as these is that they can severely restrict your essay development. You may feel the need to use only one paragraph to discuss each prong rather than developing your ideas as much as necessary.

, If you find yourself getting stuck by the introduction and it is preventing you from writing the rest of your paper, skip it for now. Just write your thesis statement at the top of your paper and start on your body paragraphs.


You may find it easier to write your introduction after you finish your essay, after you know what you end up saying with your essay.
It is more important to get into a groove with your writing than to write each part in the order that it comes in the essay.

, An introduction should introduce your topic, state your argument, and provide your reader with the context of your essay. If sentences in your introduction do not help with any of those goals, they are likely unnecessary., A hook, often the very first sentence in your paper, is a sentence or two that “hooks” or grabs the interest of your audience. Commonly used hooks may be good for novice writers, but some college professors think that certain hooks are overused. A few ideas for hooks follow.


A statistic (particularly one that seems surprising to the reader) can be a good way to start certain types of papers. Be sure the statistic is from a reliable source, like one from your school’s library database.
A personal story or anecdote told in detail can draw the reader in. It should, however, be relevant to the topic, and you will need to explicitly connect it to your thesis statement. This may not be appropriate in a formal essay.
A quotation from a famous person can be a good lead-in. However, since this is one method that has been overused, try putting a twist on this method by using a surprising quote, contradicting the quote, or using it in a new context. You will also need to connect this to your thesis clearly.
Illuminating a paradox or puzzling scenario could draw your reader in by making them question something that is usually taken for granted.Try to avoid introductions that start by giving a dictionary definition of a word and explaining it or by asking a question.
Avoid over-used and essentially empty phrases like “from the beginning of time” or “throughout the history of mankind.”

, You will need to write a few sentences that explain the context of your hook and transition into the thesis of your paper. If your hook is long, as with a detailed personal anecdote, this may be a phrase like “this experience has led me to believe that…” If your hook is shorter, like a statistic, you will likely need to write 3-4 sentences explaining your statistic and leading up to your thesis statement.

, If you wait until the last minute to begin your essay, you will likely feel more stress and the pressure to write in a short amount of time might cause you to become stuck. You also want to give yourself time to revise, so getting started early will help with the entire process.

, The best way to write is to write. Just start putting words on the page, and give yourself a writing goal for your work time.


Giving yourself a time goal (like 2 hours of writing) is often more helpful than a product goal (like 2 pages or 400 words).
Many people use the “Pomodoro technique” to write, which is to focus with no distractions for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break. , Sometimes trying to get one sentence or section “perfect” can prevent you from continuing to write.


If you find yourself getting stuck on a particular sentence, write a “placeholder” sentence and move on. A placeholder sentence may look like this: You may want to mark any placeholder sentences with brackets or by highlighting it in the word processing program (or on paper if you’re writing a draft by hand).

, When you have finished your first draft, go back to any areas or sentences that you skipped and try to write them now. It will be easier to revise your essay if these sections have already been filled in.

You can use a fork or spoon if you don’t have a whisk in your kitchen., Pour warm water into a separate cup or bowl, then add a couple teaspoons (about 9.86 ml) of warm water and mix again with a fork or whisk. Continue adding water, mixing every time to incorporate the water in the mixture., Continue the process of adding water and mixing until the cornmeal mixture becomes a firm but soft dough that is difficult to stir., Once you’ve formed a dough, you will knead it and form it into dumplings before cooking. Begin by cleaning off a countertop or cutting board, then lightly sprinkling it with some of the all-purpose flour so that the dough doesn’t stick to the surface.

, Take the dough out of the bowl and gently form it into a ball with your hands. Then knead it on the countertop or cutting board you prepared with a moderate amount of force for 2-3 minutes.Kneading the dough will help the dumpling to stay together and not fall apart when cooked.
To knead the dough, push the dough down with your hands to flatten it. Then fold the dough in half and push down again. Keep turning and folding the dough, pressing down with a moderate amount of force., After you finish kneading your dough, pinch off a piece of dough, about 1/8 of the total dough ball. Then roll the piece of dough until it becomes roughly the size and shape of a cigar.If you want smaller dumplings, take a smaller piece of dough off of the dough ball. Remember that the dumplings will expand when cooked.
Forming the dough in this cigar-like shape will make dumplings that are somewhat flat and oval shaped, and are often found in Dominican, Jamaican and some Southern cooking. If you want to make dumplings into a round shape like a meatball, don’t form them into the cigar shape. Instead, roll them into a ball.

, After you form the cigar-shaped piece of dough, place it on a clean surface and gently press it with your hands to slightly flatten it, starting from the center and working outward.


You don’t want to completely flatten the dumpling into a pancake. Instead, press on it gently until it has an equal thickness of about ½ inch (1.27 ml).

, Now that you have made the dumplings, it’s time to boil and cook them. If you are adding the dumplings to a soup or stew, prepare the broth of the stew and bring it to a boil.If you are preparing the dumplings on their own as a side dish, place 8 cups of water and a dash of salt in a medium sized pot on the stove over medium heat. Bring the pot of water to a boil.
When making a stew with dumplings, try to make adding the dumplings as the last step. If you cook the dumplings for too long they may get too soft or break apart.

, After your water or stew has reached a boil, drop in your dumplings one at a time. Try to space them out so that they don’t stick together when cooking., Cook the dumplings in the boiling water or stew for 15 minutes. You will see the dumplings expand and get bigger. When they are done, they should float to the top of the boiling water or stew.You don’t need to stir the dumplings while they are cooking.

, Once the dumplings have finished cooking, remove them using a slotted spoon. If the dumplings are cooking as part of a soup or stew, turn off the heat of the stew when it has finished cooking.


Use a slotted spoon instead of draining them through a colander, as the dumplings are somewhat fragile and can break if dumped into a colander.

, If you are making the dumplings as a side dish, serve immediately while the dumplings are still warm. You may wish to add some butter or olive oil as well as ground black pepper to make the dumplings even more delicious!"

Form the paste into balls about the size of ping-pong balls.,
Drop the balls into the pot.,
Consume your akara hot or at room temperature.",How to Make Akara," Wash them. Soak overnight covered in plenty of water. Use a large mixing bowl. The beans will expand and take in water as they soak. Make sure you have at least two inches of water over the top of the beans.;
, This takes effort but is important for the texture. To peel the beans by hand, begin by draining the beans after they have finished soaking. Reserve the water you used to soak the beans in another bowl. Rub the beans vigorously between your hands in small batches. The bean skins should come off. Run water over the beans to wash the skins off if necessary. Drop the beans back into the water and the skins should float to the surface. Individually pick out any beans with the skins still on and peel them., Begin by dropping a handful of the soaked beans into the blender. Next, pour water into the blender until it is at twice the level of the beans. Press the “Pulse” button on your blender for 1 second, then let go. Repeat 4 more times and pour the beans into a large bowl with the water. Repeat this process for the rest of the beans, then drain the beans with a colander. The bits of skin should drain with the water. If they do not, submerge the beans in water again and any leftover skins should float to the surface. You can also pick the leftover skins off with your fingers., Drain the beans with a colander and place a small quantity of beans into the mortar. Use a mortar with coarse sides. Stir the beans with the pestle and the skin should slough off the beans. Place the peeled beans into a separate bowl. Repeat this process until you have peeled all of the beans. Submerge the beans in water again and any leftover skins should float to the surface. You can also pick these skins off with your fingers.You can make the akara immediately after peeling the beans, or you can peel the beans in advance and store them in the refrigerator or freezer., You can use a mortar and pestle, blender, or food processor for this step. Grind in batches if your blender, food processor, or mortar is too small to fit all of the beans at once. Add small amounts of water during the grinding process to make sure that the paste sticks together. When you’re done, the paste should have a thick, smooth consistency.Taste the batter once you have finished to make sure the blend of seasonings is to your liking. Add more salt and pepper if necessary, or a few pinches of cayenne pepper if you prefer spicier akara.You can leave the batter overnight if you want to make it lighter and more frothy. This step is optional, however., To determine when the oil is ready, drop a small amount of batter into the pot. If it turns black instantly, the oil is too hot. If it sinks to the bottom of the pot with no reaction, the oil is too cool. If it sizzles but maintains its color, the oil is at an appropriate temperature.You can also use a digital thermometer for this step. If the thermometer reads 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190.5 Celsius), the oil is ready.

, Use an ice cream scoop and your hands for this step. Make the balls in groups of however many your pot will hold at once. This way you can make them in batches., Fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes total. Flip the balls halfway through. Once they are done, remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon. Put them on a paper towel-lined plate to dry., Serve with hot sauce or salsa, as well as your favorite bread.

Bring a saucepan of water to boil.,
Add salt and olive oil.,
Add the Israeli couscous and simmer.,
Drain well.,
Season with butter and Parmesan cheese.",How to Cook Israeli Couscous1," Fill a small saucepan with roughly 6 cups (1.5 L) of water and bring it to a boil over high heat.


Note that the saucepan should be about 2/3 full. Add more or less water as needed to get this amount.
As with most boxed pasta, this is more water than the couscous will actually absorb. Using this much ensures even boiling, though.;
, Sprinkle the salt into the water and drizzle in the oil. Let it the water simmer for another minute or so afterward.


You can add the oil and salt before you boil the water, but adding it after the water has already reached a boil will speed the process up because standard water boils faster than salt water.
Don't be afraid to add lots of salt. Only a small amount of the salt will actually be absorbed by the couscous. You need to add the salt to the couscous now, though, so that it can seep into the couscous as it cooks and flavor it from the inside out.
The oil helps prevent the couscous from sticking together.

, After adding the couscous, reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the saucepan. Let it simmer for about 8 minutes.The couscous should be “al dente.” In other words, it should be mostly tender, with just a little firmness when you bite into it.
Note that the overall cooking time can vary by brand. Follow the package instructions to determine the proper amount of time.

, Pour the contents of the saucepan through a fine mesh colander. Gently shake the colander back and forth to shake the excess water off the cooked couscous.


Alternatively, you could also drain the Israeli couscous using nothing more than the saucepan and the lid. Position the lid so that it is only slightly askew on top of the saucepan. There should be a gap smaller than the average pearl of couscous in between the pan and the lid. Pour the water out into the sink through this gap. Wear oven mitts to protect yourself from the steam.

, If you want to liven the dish up, add a few dollops of butter and a generous helping of Parmesan cheese. Note, however, that couscous can be served without either.

For best results, use a 2 quart (2 L) skillet. You could also use a saucepan instead of a skillet, if it proves more convenient.

, Add the chopped onion to the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until tender.


The onion should also show signs of caramelizing, but do not let it blacken or begin to burn. The fragrance of the onion should also become more potent.

, Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant.


The garlic cooks a little more quickly than the onion, so you should add it after the onion has already cooked for a little while, first.

, Cook the contents of the skillet for 4 minutes, or until lightly browned.


Stir the couscous continuously to prevent it from burning.Toasting the couscous beforehand enhances the flavor, and it also allows the couscous to cook more evenly.

, Stir gently to distribute the salt and cover.


The salt must be added now. By adding the salt alongside the water, you make it possible for the couscous to absorb the salt as it absorbs the water, thereby flavoring each pearl inside and out.
If you want to make the couscous more flavorful, use broth or stock instead. Chicken stock and vegetable broth are both good options.

, When done, the liquid should be completely absorbed.


Stir the couscous gently, pulling it up from the center to the sides of the pan. If liquid seeps down into the center of the pan, you need to cook the couscous a little longer to absorb the remaining liquid.
Note that the overall cooking time can vary by brand. Follow the package instructions to determine the proper amount of time.

, Toss the pepper, parsley, chives, and oregano into the cooked couscous and stir well to distribute throughout.


You can mix up the herbs to your liking. For instance, you can add rosemary, thyme, or cilantro. You could also add the zest of a lemon.

Consider the types of meats and veggies used.,
Check which spices are being used.,
Pay attention and ask around.",How to Identify the Ethnic Origins of Cuisine," The title that a dish is given can be the most important identifier for the geographical location of that food. Because many regions and societies are separated by language, the ability to identify what region that cuisine originated from can be your best bet at finding its birth place. After writing down the title of the dish, you should find out what language it is so you can at least find the continent where it started.;
, Methods and processes of cooking food are deeply rooted in the history of a people. The resources of the area, along with the technological advancements of a culture are mirrored in the way that they prepare their food. By looking at the style of cooking your food is prepared, you will be given clues to the region and people that first ate that food.

, The meats and vegetables that are used are representative of the agriculture of the ethnic group you are uncovering. Because trade and environmental factors allowed separate continents to have access to similar ingredients, paying attention to what ingredients are paired with will give you more information on that culture.

, Some historians believe that spices were the first forms of currency. Because of its value, the use and access to spices have become global. However, as tradition has it, spices speak loudly about their origins and the people that introduced them into the culinary arena. Finding out what spices are indigenous to an area is helpful. Although other cultures might make use of that spice, the people localized around where it is indigenous often make use of that spice in many of their dishes.

, Doing research for yourself is the best way to be confident in your knowledge of cuisine. However, there is nothing wrong with taking a chance and throwing some questions at your chef. More often than not, they will be more than happy to share what knowledge they have with an inquisitive diner. It is also good to pay attention to what people of other ethnicity eat on a daily basis. Tradition is a large part of culture and traditions don't always fade quickly. Look around and observe what your neighbor's continually have on their menu.

",How to Make Breakfast Strata," Stratas can be flavored in any number of ways, depending on what ingredients you have on hand.


They can be meatless, or contain sausage, bacon, chicken or ham.
They can also be flavored to resemble different cultural flavors. Try adding salsa for a Mexican-flavored strata, or ginger and leeks for an Asian inspired strata.
If you can’t come up with a flavor combination on your own, think about what you like on your pizza; pizza topping combinations can easily be translated into a breakfast strata recipe.;
, Stratas can be made from any non-sweet bread, provided it has been dried out. Dried breads work better in bread puddings, because they absorb the custard more easily.

, Deeper pans will create a creamier strata, while a more shallow pan will result in a crispier texture.

,, The vegetables can be raw or cooked. .

,,,, Choose a cheese that complements the rest of the ingredients, like cheddar mixed with ham.

, Beat this well to combine.

,, The strata can also be assembled the night before and refrigerated until morning. The longer the strata is left assembled but uncooked, the more the bread will absorb the custard.

, The cooking time will be dictated by how deep a pan you are using; shallower pans cook faster than deeper ones.

Learn how trees affect your home.,
Find out about local ordinances regarding tree protection.,
Get involved when you see a tree coming down.,
Do what you can to save the tree.,
Participate in planting days.",How to Save Trees1," Aside from desert regions, most areas benefit from having plenty of large, shady trees in every neighborhood. They improve air quality, reduce erosion and absorb noise. Big trees protect cities from getting too hot by cooling the environment through shade and evaporation.Without trees, urban areas experience what's called a heat island effect, with streets and buildings retaining heat and forcing people to use extra power to cool their homes. No matter where you live, you can start helping your town right away by saving trees.


As a general rule, large, mature trees (like oak or maple) provide more benefits than small, young trees. That's why it's important to save as many older trees as possible.Learning about proper tree maintenance will help you become a better advocate for trees. There's a right way and a wrong way to prune trees and take care of them over the years, and if you know the difference you can educate people around you.;
, Every town and city has laws dictating which tree species need to be protected and when and how it's OK to cut down trees. In some areas, trees that are delicate, rare or extremely beneficial are protected by law. Knowing the laws in your area will help you be a better advocate for the trees there.Check https://www.municode.com/library to see which local municipal codes apply to the trees in your area.
Get in touch with the city department in charge of tree removal. The department is usually called urban or community forestry. See if they have information on policies they use to determine which trees to cut down., As you become more aware of the specific trees that are beneficial in your area, start noticing when you see them being pruned or cut down. Whether the tree in question is on public or private property, there may be something you can do to save it. Pay special attention to the large, shady trees in your area, since they provide the most benefits and should be preserved if at all possible.


When you see a tree getting cut down, the first thing to do is talk to the person removing the tree and find out why they are removing it. Sometimes trees are damaged or diseased, so they legitimately need to be cut down. In other cases they get cut down simply for aesthetic reasons.
Do research to find out if the tree is being cut down legally. Some species are protected even if they're on private property. If you're concerned that the tree should be preserved, it's time to take action.

, Speak up to save the tree, rather than just letting it get cut down. Get together with other people who care about saving trees in your area and make it clear that you object to cutting down healthy trees. Even if there's no law against cutting down the tree, if enough people think trees are important and need to be protected, you might be able to create change. Even if it's too late for this particular tree, you'll set a precedent for next time. Here are a few things you can do:


Write a letter of objection to your city forester or city council member.
Start a petition to change policies or protect certain trees. Rally neighbors to get involved in saving the neighborhood trees.
Get the media involved by sending a letter to the editor or contacting a local TV station.

, As important as it is to protect mature trees, it's also essential to think ahead and plant new trees that will eventually get tall enough to contribute to the canopy, clean the air and help keep temperatures cool. Many towns and cities have organizations like Portland, Oregon's Friends of Treesworking to plant trees in areas that have too few. If your town or city doesn't have a similar organization, why not start one yourself? Tree by tree, you can make a difference.


The type of tree you plant matters. Talk with an arborist about which species are native to your area and will eventually get big enough to clean the air and water. Small, ornamental trees won't contribute much.
Buying trees can get expensive. See if there's a nursery nearby that shares your views on trees and could give your group a discount on baby trees.

Stop using paper towels, napkins and tissues.,
Buy recycled toilet paper.,
Buy a reusable coffee mug.,
Choose the paperless options for bills.,
Buy sustainable sourced wood products.,
Eat less beef.",How to Save Trees2," Reducing your use of paper products in order to save trees can seem abstract, since millions of new trees must be planted each year to sustain the paper industry. But it's important to start seeing the connection between the trees you love and the products you use. If you're passionate about saving trees, you may want to look for ways to use fewer paper products in your daily life.Use cloth towels instead of paper towels. It's a simple change that can reduce a lot of unnecessary waste.
Use cloth napkins instead of paper napkins. They're more elegant, anyway.
Use handkerchiefs instead of tissues. It might take some getting used to, but handkerchiefs are actually softer on your skin than tissues, so you might like them better.
Use reusable containers instead of paper lunch bags.
If you must use a paper product, always buy the recycled version. At least you'll know it's not made from virgin pulp.

, Going completely toilet paper free is not in the cards for most people, since it would require a significant lifestyle change. However, just making the choice to buy recycled toilet paper, even though it costs a few cents more, can make a difference. Here are a few other things you can do to cut back on toilet paper use:


Use only as much as you need, rather than using whirls of toilet paper each time you use the bathroom.
If you're really hardcore, consider using a bidet or washing rather than using toilet paper.
Some people have even made the switch to using cloth toilet paper., If you're a daily coffee drinker, and every morning you buy your latte in a disposable cardboard cup (usually with a disposable cardboard sleeve) there's a more tree-friendly system you can start using. Get a plastic or ceramic reusable coffee container and start bringing it with you each morning. As a bonus, most coffee shops offer a slight discount when you bring in your own container.

, This simple switch will make your life less cluttered and reduce the number of dead trees on your conscience. If you still get paper bills sent to your house, go online and make the switch to the paperless option. You can opt to receive notifications that a bill is due via email, rather than having to check the mail.

, If you're in the market for new furniture or building materials, think twice before buying lumber at your local big box home improvement store. Take the time to track down wood products that have the Forest Stewardship Alliance seal, which indicates that they were sourced in a sustainable way with minimal impact on the forest.If you're buying furniture, another option is to buy antique furniture instead of brand new wooden furniture. Antique furniture is often made with strong, durable wood that will last many years, so it's a good investment.

, The production of meat in general requires tons of resources. Factory farms need space, water and food for animals they raise for food. Beef products are particularly hard on trees, since Amazonian rain forests are being cut down to make way for cattle ranches.Avoid ordering beef in restaurants if you don't know where it came from. When you do eat beef, buy it from a local farmer or a source you know and trust.

Most forests are destroyed to provide space for agriculture or developments, to provide wood for paper products, or by forest fires that have increased in severity since the advent of global warming.
Saving forests must be a global effort, but there are things you can do to contribute, even if you live nowhere near a rain forest., Showing those in your life that you care about trees is a good way to help other people start taking action, too. Many people simply don't realize how important old growth forests are to the health of the planet, including its human population. The more people who understand and care, the more likely destructive practices will be brought to a halt.Spread the word on social media. When you see a story related to the state of the earth's forest, share what you think about it and encourage others to comment.
Show that standing up for trees is something you believe in. Since saving trees will require a change in lifestyle, some people oppose the idea. By making it clear that saving trees is something you believe is valuable, you'll be acting as a role model to others.

, There are many nonprofits dedicated to saving forests across the world, and they are all in need of donations. Find one you trust and consider making a donation.


For example, Greenpeace is working to stop deforestation. It has projects around the world aimed at saving forests that are under threat.The Rain forest Action Network aims to educate people and help everyone find a way to play a part in saving forests., Changing your consumption habits and helping local trees are both admirable ways to make a difference, but if saving trees and forests is something you're passionate about, you might be looking for a way to do more. Volunteering or working with a nonprofit working on this vital issue is a hands-on way to take action.


You can start by looking at http://arbordaynow.volunteermatch.org/ to find a group in your area where you can volunteer your time. Volunteering with a local group geared toward saving trees is a good way to get familiar with the issues surrounding deforestation.The desire to save trees has inspired heartfelt activism around the world for decades. Look into groups using creative ways to save trees and protest the destruction of forests, like by tree-sitting and blocking logging equipment. Learn as much as you can about what has been done to save trees, and decide how you can contribute."

Turn off appliances when you are not using them.,
Lower the thermostat by a few degrees in winter.,
Make sure that the house is fully insulated.,
Use windows to regulate the temperature.,
Install ceiling fans instead of air conditioning units to keep rooms comfortable in warm weather.

,
Fill the gaps.,
Switch to compound fluorescent light bulbs.,
Turn off the lights.,
Buy rechargeable batteries for devices used frequently.

",How to Save the Environment at Home1," Up to 30% of power used by TV is used while they are turned off, so buy power strips and just flip the switch on the power strip, because they use far less energy while turned off.;
, An extra layer or blanket will not only keep you cozy but will help to reduce your electricity bill significantly.

, Insulation keeps the heat and cool on the correct side of your living space. Consider not only the ceiling but also the walls and under the floors.

,


Keep windows and doors closed properly to avoid the loss of heat in winter.
Open the windows in summer. The cross breeze will often keep you cool and flushes out stale air (indoor air is often more highly polluted than the air outside). Importantly, the use of fresh air to cycle through your home saves the cost of running an air conditioner.

,, Gaps reduce energy efficiency in a home. By caulking gaps around windows and doors, you increase the ability of your house to retain heat and cool at the right times of year, allowing your heating and cooling systems to work less.

, They last longer and consume one-quarter of the energy. Lately, LED lamps have started to pick up the pace too -- they are up to ten times as effective as fluorescent, and totally blow incandescent bulbs off the charts.

, Always turn off the lights when you are not using them. Rooms that are lit with nobody in them are wasteful.

Avoid palm oil and the products that contain it.,
Avoid wood products made from threatened rainforest woods.,
Avoid paper products (or buy recycled).,
Refuse Brazilian beef.,
Buy sustainable coffee.",How to Save the Rain Forest1," Palm oil is the most commonly used vegetable oil in the world, and over half of the packaged products in most supermarkets contain it. Unfortunately, expanding palm oil plantations have led to widespread rainforest deforestation. The exponential use of cheap palm oil has also endangered many species of animals, and many palm oil companies are guilty of human rights exploitation .Begin to avoid palm oil by avoiding processed foods. Consume mostly fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains.
Read labels and avoid products that contain palm oil.
Learn the sneaky names for palm oil. These include (but are not limited to): Vegetable Oil, Palm Kernel, Palm Kernel Oil, Palm Fruit Oil, Palmitate, Palmolein, Glyceryl, Palmate, Palmitic Acid, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Stearate, Stearic Acid, and Sodium Kernelate.;
, Despite the delicate state of the world’s rainforests, trees are still harvested to build guitars, furniture, and other products. Avoid products made of Mahogany, Rosewood, Ebony, and other tropical hardwoods. Instead opt for products made from White Ash, Black Cherry, or Maple woods., Paper products contribute directly to rainforest deforestation. Products like toilet paper, paper towels, coffee filters, notebooks, printer paper, and others are created from rainforest trees. Do your part by using reusable materials whenever possible (such as reusable coffee filters or coffee mugs). When you must use paper products, select products made from 100% recycled materials., 60-70% of the deforestation in Brazil has been the result of cattle farming, and this number is rapidly growing. You can help save the rainforest by avoiding this product. If you choose to eat beef, select grass fed options local to your region, and say no to Brazilian-raised beef.Fast food chains use the majority of this beef. You can begin avoiding Brazilian beef by saying no to fast food burgers.

, Consumption of coffee can have a negative effect on the world’s rainforests. Coffee farms, like palm oil plantations, have also led to deforestation, and have also been known for their poor working conditions and human rights violations. You can work to lessen the ongoing damage to our rainforests by selecting coffee that is sustainably farmed. Look for a “Rainforest Alliance” label to show that this coffee was produced under sustainable conditions."

Recycle, recycle, recycle.,
Avoid rinsing before using the dishwasher.,
Use cold water for the washer, and only wash clothes when you have a full load.,
Air dry your dishes.,
Avoid Creating Trash.,
Update your refrigerator.",How to Save the Environment at Home2," Some cities already require people to sort their trash into paper, metals, glass, and organic waste. Even if your city doesn't, you can launch a growing trend. Set up four separate waste baskets, and make sure the contents end up in the appropriate recycle bins.

, If you skip rinsing your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, you can save gallons of water. You can also save time -The time it takes for the water to heat up, and the energy it consumes.

, Instead of using hot water all the time, use cold water. In fact, use cold water at any available opportunity. It saves a ton of energy.

, Stop the dishwasher before the dryer cycle commences. Leave the door slightly ajar (or more open if you have the space) and let the dishes air-dry. The drying cycle of the dishwasher consumes a lot of energy.

, Avoid disposable products, such as plates, cups, napkins and cutlery. Use reusable towels and dishwashing cloths in place of paper towels and disposable dish sponges.

, Fridges are the most energy intensive appliance in a house. This means that a poorly maintained and energy inefficient fridge is costing you money, let alone adding its burden to the atmosphere. Recent fridges use 40% less energy than fridges of 10 years ago. If you do decide to upgrade the fridge, make sure that you buy for its excellent energy rating, longevity and durability and that you have the old fridge recycled.

Prefer showers over baths.,
Use soaps and detergents that contain no phosphates.,
Install low-flush toilets in your home.,
For those who menstruate out there, consider using cloth (as in, reusable) tampons and pads, or using a menstrual cup.",How to Save the Environment at Home3," Showers use less water. Don't forget to install an efficient showerhead.

, Use a mixture of water and vinegar to clean your windows. Wash clothes in cold water to avoid consuming energy to heat the water. On sunny days, use a clothes line instead of a clothes dryer. Your clothes will smell fresher and the sun's rays ensure that germs are successfully sizzled.

, These use 1.6 gallons (6.1 L) per flush, instead of 3.5 gallons (13.2 L), cutting water consumption by more than half.

, It will reduce the amount of pads and tampons people use and send down the road to be piled in a landfill.

Use recycled paper in your home office and printer.,
Turn off the computer every day.",How to Save the Environment at Home4," Double side your printing and give scrap paper to the kids or turn it into note paper for the phone table.

, Even if it feels like it is not making much of a difference, it is. You also reduce any risks of overheating or short-circuiting by turning computers off overnight.

Leave the car at home.,
Buy a fuel-efficient car if you are changing cars.,
If you're really serious about going all-out green, consider living without a car -- not only it's green, but could also save you a lot of money!

,
Keep your bike well maintained.,
Dispose of workshop items with care.",How to Save the Environment at Home5," Let the car contribute less to the atmosphere by resting at home whenever possible. Walk to your local stores, take public transport to work and cycle to your friends' houses for dinner. Join a carpool and ferry others to work rather than driving in alone. You'll make new friends and you'll all share the costs.

, Choose a compact car over an SUV. SUVs burn almost twice the amount of gas as a station wagon and yet can still carry around the same amount of passengers.

,, Take away at least one excuse that you cannot use your bike because it is in bad shape. Keep it in shape and then use it to keep yourself in shape.

, Old paints, oils, pesticides etc. should not be tipped down the drain - the residues end up in our waterways. Dispose of these items through municipal disposal schemes or use the landfill option if there is no other choice.

Plant native species.,
Plant trees.,
Reduce the lawn.,
Compost.",How to Save the Environment at Home6," They need less watering, are hardier (hence, less products needed to protect them) and they attract the local wildlife. Besides, they are used to the local weather conditions.

, Trees absorb carbon dioxide and provide shade. Also, it reduces the soil and air temperature. They provide homes for wildlife and some trees can provide you with a bountiful harvest. What more incentive do you need?!

, Either reduce your lawn size or remove it altogether. Lawns are costly to maintain, the chemicals used on lawns are dangerous to our health and to that of the surrounding wildlife and lawnmowers emit high levels of pollution. Replace lawns with shrubs, ornamental garden structures, pavers for entertainment areas, native grasses and ground creepers etc. In addition, what's better than being able to step outside and pick a few strawberries or an ear of corn? Increase your own resilience by converting wasted lawn space into a vegetable garden. Consider using drip-irrigation systems or constructing or purchasing a rain barrel (it saves you having to pay to pump water back into the ground).

, Compost the kitchen scraps and create beautiful garden matter to encourage better plant growth. Make sure the heap is warm and well-turned. Read a few books about composting. It's rare to find someone highly skilled in the area! Remember, soil is a living thing, it should not be powdery and dead. Life comes from the soil, and therefore the soil should be kept alive. Avoid highly invasive tilling if at all possible, but be sure to keep the soil aerated.

Eat less meat.,
Reduce the amount of petroleum you use.,
Don’t use pesticides on your garden.,
Eat organic food.",How to Save the Rain Forest2," For every quarter pound hamburger that is found in fast food restaurants, approximately 55 square feet of rainforest land is destroyed. That's about the size of a small kitchen! Deforested rainforest land is being turned into grazing pasture for cows. You can help to save the rainforest by choosing to eat less meat.Start by having one meat-free day each week, then expand to two days.
You can make a dent by simply cutting the amount of meat you consume in half.
You can make a huge contribution by choosing to live a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle.

, Oil companies, with the intention of extracting oil from this land, have purchased nearly 70% of the Peruvian Amazon. When you purchase oil and other petroleum products, you support these companies and further the demand for such oil. You can help save the rainforest by reducing your use of oil.Purchase a hybrid or electric car.
Ride your bike instead of driving.
Turn down the temperature in your house by 1 degree.
Avoid Styrofoam, ballpoint pens, and bubble gum.

, When you use pesticides you support multinational pesticide manufacturers, who contribute to rainforest degradation. Furthermore, any use of pesticides contributes to the downfalls and destruction of non-GMO crops worldwide. , The use of pesticides and GMOs in the rainforest have led to significant damage to the delicate ecosystems. When you consume only certified organic fruit, vegetables, and other products, you help save the rainforest by supporting sustainable farming practices."
"
Donate money to rainforest organizations.,
Participate in ecotourism.,
Volunteer.",How to Save the Rain Forest3," There are numerous passionate and legitimate organizations working worldwide to effect positive change in the rainforest. You can lend a hand by donating a bit of money to an organization of your choosing. Nation of Change, Rainforest Foundation US, and World Land Trust are just a few.If you don’t have a lot of money lying around, you can organize a lemonade stand, bake sale, or a talent show to help raise money for a funding organization.

, The International Ecotourism Society has defined ecotourism as ""responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the welfare of local people."" Whereas ""regular"" tourism tends to cause damage, ecotourism is an educational experience that works to teach individuals, protect lands, and provide monetary to support conservation efforts. Ecotourism provides funding to organizations working to help the rainforest to heal., Whether you choose to do trail maintenance in Costa Rica or rebuild indigenous rainforest communities in Canada, you can volunteer to save the rainforest. Through a number of organizations, you put your blood, sweat, and tears (plus some of your money) into important conservation efforts. Organizations such as United Planet, Environmental Quest, Goabroad.com, and others can help you select the volunteer opportunity that is right for you."
"
Teach others about the environment.,
Restore ecosystems.,
Encourage sustainable living.,
Establish parks.,
Support companies that minimize damage.",How to Save the Rain Forest4," If you want to help save the rainforest, there are five steps you can take, represented by the acronym “TREES.” “T” stands for “teach others.” Education and awareness are the most powerful tools for change. You can take steps towards saving the rainforest by teaching those around you how important it is to do so!, The “R” in the acronym stands for “restore ecosystems.” Despite the devastation already experienced by many of the world’s rainforests, these lush ecosystems are still capable of healing. In order for the rainforest to be “saved,” efforts must be made to replant lost trees, and help these delicate ecosystems recuperate.One way that you can contribute aid to the restoration of the rainforest is through ecotourism.

, The first “E” stands for “encourage sustainable living.” No amount of restoration can help the rainforests if the practices of using rainforest resources don’t change. In order to save the rainforest, farmers, companies, and individuals need to learn and embody sustainable practices.You can help support these efforts by donating to a rainforest organization, or by participating in ecotourism.

, The second “E” stands for “establish parks.” National Parks are protected lands that cannot be changed, developed, or otherwise used for commercial purposes. Expanding areas of protected National Park land is one of the most important efforts toward saving the rainforest. You can sign numerous petitions through Rainforest Rescue to help establish and preserve rainforest National Parks., Finally, the “S” stands for “support companies that minimize damage.” This means purchasing products from companies that use sustainable practices and who work to support the rainforest. Some of these companies include Artisana Foods, Newman’s Own Organics, Rainforest Foods Company, and Amazon Herb Company."

Take shorter showers.,
Turn the lights off.,
Ride your bike or walk instead of driving (or being driven).,
Eat less meat.",How to Save the Environment (for Teens)1," Yes, everyone wants to look (and smell) his/her best for that special someone or secret crush, but how many rinses and repeats do you really need? A dripping faucet can waste 3,000 gallons a year, about the same amount you can save by halving your daily shower time.That's no drop in the bucket!


It can seem like water is cheap and abundant, but access to clean water is an issue for billions of people around the world. Increasing demand for water also affects rivers and lakes (and what lives there) by reducing levels, changing water flow with dams and reservoirs, and introducing chemicals and waste products.;
, You might not pay the electric bill, but you know that the lamp (or TV, stereo, or laptop) costs money to operate. That money pays for the power plants that produce that electricity and usually release pollutants into the environment in the process.


Ask your family to set the furnace temperature lower and the air conditioner higher. Sweaters, open windows and fans will work just fine most days.
Unplug appliances that are not being regularly used. Many electronic devices still draw power even when turned off, sometime known as “vampire” energy drain.
Many states now allow residents to choose their energy supplier. Talk to your family about choosing a supplier that produces electricity with less pollution, via solar, wind, and other options.

, Yes, every teen looks forward to a driver’s license and a first car, but automobiles are one of the primary causes of air pollution. When pedal power won’t cut it, take the bus or carpool. It might not seem as cool as driving yourself, but it is much more fuel efficient.

, The animals that gave their all to become your hamburger or chicken quesadilla require significantly more space, energy, and five times more water than the stars of a meatless dish.You don’t necessarily have to become vegetarian just for this reason, but eating less meat will probably do your body good while it helps the planet anyway.

Use the plastic bag for garbage.,
Take a plastic shopping bag with you when you walk your dog.,
Store power strips and extension cords.,
Preserve paint brushes.,
Collect dirty laundry.,
Gather weeds and garden debris.,
Wrap glasses and other fragile objects when you are moving.,
Return them to the store.,
Pack plastic shopping bags when you are moving or traveling.",How to Reuse Shopping Bags1," While it might be too small to line your main garbage can, you can use plastic shopping bags for small wastebaskets in your bathroom or your office.


Keep a plastic shopping bag close when you are cooking or cleaning. In the kitchen, you can use it to collect scraps of food and wrappers while you are cooking. Use a plastic bag to dispose of rags, wipes and dust while you clean.;
, When your dog poops, place the bag over your hand like a glove and pick up the waste. You can then tie the bag and dispose of it.


Use a plastic bag in the same way to remove poop from cat litter if you do not want to change the entire litter box.

, These electric items can be difficult to manage.


Put the extension cord or power strip inside a plastic shopping bag and wrap the bag securely around it so that the cord or strip is completely covered. This will keep any part of it from dangling out of the bag, which could cause an electrical hazard.

, When you paint around the house or stain furniture, preserve your brush for the next day by letting it dry on a plastic shopping bag.

,


Take a plastic bag with you in your diaper bag or purse if you have children and run the risk of having soiled clothing.
Pack a couple of plastic shopping bags with your luggage when you travel so you can keep your dirty clothing separate from your clean clothing.

, If you have not weeded the garden for a while, a plastic bag can do a good job of collecting weeds and other trash from the lawn.

, If you run out of bubble wrap, plastic shopping bags make great packing material.

, You can use your plastic shopping bags on another trip. Some stores also collect your used bags for recycling.

, Load them up with clothing, books, magazines, videos and other items for car trips. This works especially well with plastic bags that have handles.

You may have to enter a location for best results.
From the chapter page, you can click on the name of the chapter nearest you to go to the local chapter's website.;
, You can join Sierra Club directly through your local chapter, or through the national website. If you join at the national level, you will automatically be enrolled as a member with the chapter nearest you.There typically isn't any difference between joining locally or joining nationally. However, the new member welcome package may differ somewhat.
Keep in mind that since Sierra Club engages in political activities including legislative advocacy and lobbying, your donation is not tax-deductible. This is the same whether you join through a local chapter or the national organization.
Regular membership if you join through a local chapter requires a minimum donation of $39. There are different membership levels available if you want to contribute more.

, Each chapter has a list of events posted on its website, so you may be able to find something in which you'd like to participate. Events include nature hikes and backpacking outings, as well as activist and social events.If you see an event in which you're interested, you can click on the name of the event to view details or find out who you need to contact to participate.
Many local chapters have regular meetings, which you can attend to meet other members and find out about events or activities in your area where you can volunteer.

, From your local chapter's website, look for a contact page or information about local groups. There should be information on one of those pages about how to call or email to get more involved.When you email, introduce yourself and say that you are interested in volunteering with the group. List your background or credentials, if relevant. Keep your initial email brief.
For example, you might write ""Hello Mr. Green, My name is Sally Strider. I found your email on the website for our state's chapter of Sierra Club. I just became a member and was interested in volunteering to help the organization. I recently completed by bachelor's degree in Environmental Sciences. If I can assist on upcoming projects, please let me know!""

, As with most things, you will get as much out of your membership with Sierra Club as you put into it. Bookmark the website of your local chapter and check the calendar regularly.If you want to actively support Sierra Club and make a difference, try to attend as many meetings and events as possible. Even general chapter meetings give you a chance to meet others in the organization, and retreats or day hikes allow you to learn more about the wild places around you.
If you have an idea for a project that would be good for the chapter to undertake, do a little research on it and speak up at a chapter meeting. For example, if you know of a nearby stream that has become clogged with garbage, you might organize a clean-up.

Buy eco-friendly products.,
Carry a tote bag and reusable water bottle.,
Donate old clothes, toys, electronics, etc.,
Get creative before throwing things out.,
Recycle everything you can.",How to Save the Environment (for Teens)2," Seek out products that do not test on animals and do not contain chemicals that require big CAUTION or WARNING notices on the label. There are increasing numbers of products called “natural” or “organic” available, but it never hurts to look at the labels.


Choose products without excess packaging. It was annoying enough when you had to wait for your Dad to dig out your new action figure from that plastic blister packaging; think about the excessive waste such over-packaging creates.
Buy local products when available. Maybe your area has a little candle-making factory or engraver where you can pick up a nice Mother’s Day gift. Not only will you be helping your local economy, you will be saving the energy usage and pollution required to ship goods long distances.

, They don’t take up much space but can prevent a lot of waste. Ever notice how plastic bags seem to always end up stuck in trees or on grassy hillsides, or seen news reports about the giant swirls of plastic junk floating in the middle of the oceans? Every plastic bottle not made and plastic bag not used helps a little bit.

, Just because you don’t want them anymore doesn’t mean someone else wouldn’t be happy to have them. People always seem to assume that all teens need to have the newest everything and discard perfectly good things that are no longer “cool” enough. Prove them wrong.


Buy used and vintage items as well. Freak out your parents by buying a shirt from their high school days and declaring it “so retro.”

, Can you use some parts from your broken-down old bike for your science fair project? Or use your (or, okay, maybe your parents’) old CDs to make a collage or mobile for art class?

, If your municipality has a recycling program, make sure your family uses it. Does your school make recycling convenient? If not, isn’t that something that student councils are for? Help turn recycling into a habit for everyone.

Raise awareness.,
Join an environmental group.,
Contact your elected officials.,
Don’t be afraid to lead.",How to Save the Environment (for Teens)3," Talk to family and friends about simple changes they can make, and why they should do so to help protect the environment. You don’t have to lecture or preach (but if that’s what works with your family, go for it); show them that you have thought a lot about the subject, are passionate about making a difference, and really could use their support.


Take advantage of all the new social media technologies that your parents can't keep up with. It's easier now than ever before to connect with people all over the world. Find out how environmental destruction impacts all of us everywhere, and discuss ways to stop it.
You might want to mention the notion of “sustainable happiness,” which focuses in part on how interconnected we all truly are.You parents will know how serious you are if they realize you’ve done research!

, There are numerous national organizations dedicated to protecting endangered species, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, preserving clean water supplies, and so on. But there are also probably local environmental groups doing things like planting native trees or setting up hard-to-recycle pickups in your own neighborhood.


Is there an environmental club at your school? If not, round up some buddies who know the importance of the issue and start one. You can do some good and make your college applications look a little better at the same time.

, No, you probably can’t vote for them yet, but most of them want to remain in office long after you’ve turned 18. And they want your parents’ votes right now anyway.


Depending on their respective offices, ask them to support legislation to reduce carbon emissions or protect endangered species, or to back local measures like curbside recycling or plastic shopping bag fees. Get in the habit of demanding action from your representatives when you are young and it will be easier to do so when you’re older.

, Regardless of what some adults may think, teens can have great ideas too. When you have one, put your youthful energy to good use.


Your idea might be as straightforward as a neighborhood clean-up day, but go for it. Pass out flyers. Ask local businesses to donate supplies or refreshments. Round up your buddy’s garage band and turn it into a block party at the end of the day.
Teens like you have helped pass legislation banning electronic waste from landfills, and created organizations that help schools run environmentally-friendly proms. Surely they had people tell them they were too young to make a difference. But the earth’s future is your future. So don’t be so quick to accept “can’t” or take “no” as an answer.

If you want to make a donation of something other than money, call Sierra Club at (415) 995-1780 to find out what options are available and the general process of making the donation. Basic information for your records is available on the Sierra Club Foundation website at www.sierraclubfoundation.org, including the Foundation's federal tax identification number and mailing address.

, If you want to support Sierra Club without becoming a member, consider the symbolic adoption program, which allows you to specify which endangered species will be helped by your donation.Animals available all are wild animals that are native to North America and are endangered. For example, you can symbolically adopt a bald eagle, a red fox, a manatee, or a gray wolf.
Adopting a wild animal can be a good gift for a child, because the adoption package comes with a backpack and a small plush animal, as well as a book with facts about the animal.

, If you are a small business owner, you can use the EarthShare service to encourage donations by your employees and provide a matching donation program to further support Sierra Club Foundation.This program supports the Foundation, so the contributions are tax-deductible. The program works by deducting an amount chosen by the employee from their paycheck. You can choose to match those donations up to a certain amount.
If you work for a company that is committed to environmental issues, talk to your employer about signing up with the EarthShare program to make it easier for employees to make donations and facilitate matching donations.

Professor Dr. Willem VAN COTTHEM
Beeweg 36
B-9080 ZAFFELARE, Belgium

",How to Support Seeds for Food," The charity was founded by Prof. Dr. Willem van Cotthem from Belgium. In 2005 he was invited to become the advisor for the so called “Family and school gardens in the Sahrawi refugee camps of South-East Algeria”.
He found that, while space and even water wasn't the problem, seeds were. The people simply couldn't afford to buy them. So the professor decided to step in and collect seeds, and ""Seeds for Food"" was born. And now you can help. How? By collecting the seeds from fruits and vegetables you eat at home.;
, Seeds that can be used are:


vegetables such as lettuce, beets, carrots, onions and parsley.
tropical fruits such as melons, pumpkins, peppers, avocados, papayas and eggplants.

,, Never use paper, since paper sticks to the seeds.

Calcium builds bones, and many vegetables contain good amounts of calcium.",How to Reduce Your Water Footprint1," These include caffeine, vanilla, and sugar. For example, a typical cup of cola requires 333 cups of water to produce: a cup of water for the liquid, 165 cups of water for the vanilla flavoring, 100 cups for the caffeine, and 67 cups for the sugar!;
, Most people only need 10% of their calories to be protein (USDA recommendation is 5 ounces of meat per day for most individuals).


Beef is one of the most ""costly"" proteins at 1700 cups per ounce, followed by red meats in general.
If you eat animal protein, chicken and eggs are best at 250-400 cups per ounce.
Tofu and beans also come in around 400 cups per ounce.

Eat local food.,
Reduce or eliminate your meat and/or dairy consumption.,
Reduce or eliminate your consumption of bottled water.,
Properly insulate your home.,
Maintain your heating and cooling systems.,
Replace incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent (CFL) light bulbs.,
Set your water heater to ""Vacation"" mode when you are away for extended periods.,
Plug your appliances and electronics into a power strip or unplug them when they are not in use.,
Use cold water whenever possible.,
Recycle all possible materials.,
Shut everything off that is not in use.",How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint at Home,"


Food often travels long distances between the time it is made and the time it reaches your kitchen. This requires extensive fuel use, which is usually in the form of either gasoline (petrol) or diesel, which are fuels that emit considerable amounts of carbon dioxide.
Eating local foods means that the food you eat at home did not have to travel great distances. Thus, you are indirectly responsible for less carbon dioxide emissions than if you ate food from other areas.;
,


Meat processing consumes a great deal of fossil fuels, which contribute carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
Studies have shown that diets that include meat involve nearly twice the amount of carbon emissions than vegetarian diets.
Vegan diets, where neither meat or dairy is consumed, reduce carbon emissions sevenfold as compared to diets that include meat and dairy.

,


Bottled water often travels long distances before you drink it.
Use tap water for drinking purposes if your water is sanitary. Otherwise, use a filter to clean it.
Get a water tumbler (BPA-free) and refill it bring it always with you how often you want and save money

,


Make sure all windows close properly.
Seal any drafty areas.
Have a professional insulate your home if there are problems that you cannot fix on your own.

,


Keep them maintained according to the manufacturers instructions.
Proper maintenance will reduce the amount of energy that is used.

,


As incandescent light bulbs (the bulbs that have been common for many years) stop working, replace them with CFL light bulbs. Such bulbs use approximately 75 percent less energy than incandescent bulbs. Or even better with LED bulbs, which seem expensive, but last even longer than compact fluorescent light bulbs and don't contain the highly dangerous mercury.

,


This mode will keep the water warm, but use less energy than it requires when you are home.

,


Many devices continue to consume energy when they are not in use if they are left plugged into a standard electrical socket.
A power strip can be turned off. Doing so will cut power to the unused devices.
If you do not have a power strip, unplug everything that is not in use.

,


For tasks such as laundry and washing dishes, use cold water unless the items being washed must be washed with warm water. This will eliminate wasting energy on heating the water.

,


When you no longer need something such as a plastic bottle or newspaper, offer it for recycling if that is an option in your area. Recycling uses less energy and saves more resources than the energy that is required to drill for oil (which is used to make plastic) or cut down trees (which will instead capture carbon if they are not cut down).

,


When nobody is in a room, turn all of the lights off.
Have the last person out of a room turn the television off after watching it.
Turn your computer off when it is not in use. Although standby and hibernation use less energy than while you use it, turning it off will use no energy at all.

"
Reduce the amount of fuel you use for travel, whenever possible.,
Eat seasonally-available food from local growers, rather than flying or shipping food from hundreds or thousands of miles away.

,
Reduce heating/cooling costs by increasing insulation, setting your thermostat to save fuel, and otherwise ""saving money"" by reducing energy use.

A single sheet of paper requires 160 cups of water to produce!,
Minimize use of paper products:


Use one paper towel to dry hands (there's even a TED lecture on how to do this).",How to Reduce Your Water Footprint2," A good guide is reducing your carbon footprint, since that carbon is fundamentally produced by plants that have been converted into fuel and ""burned.""

Install an automatic grey water collection system.,
Consider a dark water treatment system.,
Start small.,
Choose your plants wisely.,
Keep the water off the surface.,
Watch plants for signs of damage.,
Mitigate harmful effects.",How to Recycle Water," This refers to any used water with a low level of contamination, and no exposure to feces. This is the easiest and safest type of water to recycle. Common sources of grey water include:


Showers and baths
Bathroom sinks
Laundry (but see below);
, Most laundry detergent contains high concentrations of sodium and chloride compounds. These make the water dangerous to plants. Switch to biodegradable detergent if you plan to recycle this water for your garden.Similarly, avoid using any cleaners that contain boron, bleach, or sodium in an area that leads to grey water collection.Ammonia cleaners are a safe substitute.


Do not use liquid softener in the laundry, or detergent that advertise a softening effect. Switch to fabric softener sheets in the dryer instead., Do not wash anything that came into contact with gasoline, paint, mothballs, or other harsh chemicals down a drain that leads to grey water collection. Also avoid washing oil or fat into these systems, as grease can clog soil and fail to drain.Water from laundry that includes diapers or blood-soiled clothing should never be recycled without professional treatment. This is ""black water,"" or water that contains biohazards or other major health risks., This is the easiest way to get started recycling water. Just put down a bucket in the shower, or disconnect a bathroom sink trap and place a bucket under the opening. Although no serious health consequences have been traced back to grey water handling, health organizations recommend these precautions:Never store untreated grey water for more than 24 hours, or bacteria can multiply to unsafe levels. Since an odor can develop within a few hours (especially with shower water), you may want to limit this to even shorter storage lengths.Avoid skin contact with grey water. Wear gloves while carrying the buckets., Pour the grey water directly into the toilet bowl to flush. Never pour grey water into the toilet tank, as this can backflow into the clean water supply, or clog the flushing mechanism., This pipe diverts grey water from your washing machine directly to 1 inch (2.5 cm) backyard tubing. This directs the water to several mulch-filled basins around your yard.This is not the most efficient way to irrigate, but it is one of the cheapest and easiest to set up.


Read the garden instructions below before you set this up.
Install a filter in this system and clean it regularly.

, Instead of hauling buckets to your garden, you may alter your plumbing to automatically divert grey water to another purpose, usually a drip irrigation system in your garden. Here's a basic overview:Check your local, state, and country laws. California in particular has strict permit requirements.Keep grey water pipes clearly labeled and completely separate from clean water plumbing. Excess should drain into the sewage system, with a valve preventing backflow.
To reduce the chance of clogs, use pipes with diameter 1½ to 2 inches (4-5 cm) and avoid U-bends.
If you want to store your grey water for more than 24 hours, you'll need to have a plumber install a grey water treatment device. Due to expense, these are mainly used by businesses, but they are available for households.

, ""Dark water"" generally refers to waste water that's more difficult to recycle than grey water, but not outright unusable (that's ""black water""). If you're in an area with a severely limited water supply, you may want to take advantage of this as well:The kitchen is the most common source of dark water, containing grease, food contaminants, and powerful detergents from the dishwasher.
At minimum, you will need to install a grease trap and filter before using this water in the garden. You may also need a treatment device to remove other contaminants.
While the bathroom sink creates grey water, hooking it up to the dark water system can help flush through the particle-heavy water.

, Most grey water contains some quantity of sodium and chloride compounds from soaps and detergent. This can build up in the soil and damage your plants if you overuse the grey water. Minimize the risk by alternating between grey water and fresh water, or by spreading the grey water across a large area with a drip irrigation system.


Grey water contains beneficial chemicals as well, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. You may want to reduce your fertilizer use to avoid excess phosphorus.

, Young plants and plants in small containers are more susceptible to sodium buildup. Direct the grey water to mature plants instead.Never use grey water on vegetables that come into direct contact with the soil, or on leafy green edible plants.
Fruit tree regulations vary by region. California limits grey water use to citrus and nut trees. Queensland allows grey water for all fruit trees, as long as irrigation stops two weeks before picking, and no fruit is picked up off the ground.Grey water tends to raise soil pH. Keep it away from plants that prefer acidic soil, such as rhododendrons, ferns, and azaleas., Ideally, the grey water should travel through subsurface irrigation lines. Surface irrigation is fine as long as humans and pets minimize contact with the soil, and the grey water drains rapidly. Since it contains bacteria, never allow the water to form puddles on the surface or runoff into a storm drain or water supply. Do not use a sprinkler system, as this sends the water into the air., If you see ""burns"" at the edge of leaves, a pale bleached color in new leaf growth, dying branches, or stunted growth, switch back to fresh water.The harmful compounds can build up over time, so continue to check regularly.

, You can reduce the risk of damage and help treat existing damage with the following practices:Keep the soil slightly damp so the sodium drains through.

Lower soil pH with soil additions until the pH is around 7.
Add 2 inches (5 cm) mulch to the soil surface.

Make sure that you turn the lights off whenever you leave the room.,
Avoid wasting water.,
Check for poor insulation.,
Try using your washer at a lower temperature.,
Avoid leaving your home appliances on standby when you leave the home.",How to Reduce Your Utility Bills," If there is no one in the room, there is no point in lighting it up and all you are really doing is wasting both electricity and money. You can buy timers if you are worried about burglars and other things but make sure that you do not leave unnecessary lights on. You could also try switching to energy efficient bulbs. These might cost you a little bit more to buy at first but in the long run, they can save a huge amount on your bills.;
, You do not need to fill the kettle up for just one cup of tea so only put in the kettle what you need to make the drink or drinks. Also, turn the tap off when you are brushing your teeth and try not to shower rather have a bath. You could even go one step further than that and only flush the toilet after every two or three times of people using it – just make sure that you put the seat down to prevent any awful stenches. Water can be one of the most expensive bills and you waste it even if you don’t think you are so to cut water bills, don’t waste water and give the dishwasher a break – do you need to put it on for a couple of pots and pans?

, Around forty percent of the energy that you use to heat your home is wasted due to poor insulation. This can make such a difference to how much it costs to heat your home, so make sure that everything is as insulated as it can be and remember that short term investment in thicker insulation will mean long-term savings in heating bills.

, Just changing from thirty to forty degrees can reduce your heating bills and you will find that these days, most laundry detergents are designed to be used at the lower temperature anyway!

, Who are you leaving the TV on for? By unplugging the things that you don’t use such as the toaster, TV and lamps, you can massively reduce the amount of electricity your home uses therefore saving yourself money on your fuel bills.

The EPA's enforcement wing will prosecute any violation within their jurisdiction. To see whether the EPA can help you, visit their enforcement website and browse the issues they handle.In general, the EPA will usually be able to handle any of the following environmental violations, so long as they involve federal law:Clean water, which includes protecting drinking water and cutting raw sewage, animal waste, and polluted stormwater runoff.
Clean air, which involves reducing pollution.
Clean energy and climate, which focuses on industries that must comply with applicable rules set out by the EPA.
Clean communities, which helps ensure people are not exposed to hazardous chemicals by requiring polluters to clean up their messes.;
, While the EPA can handle a variety of enforcement issues, they are not always the correct agency to have handle an issue. Furthermore, even if they are the correct agency, reporting may not be the correct avenue for ensuring compliance. Many times, your local, state, or tribal government will be responsible for policing certain environmental actions. If it is an emergency that may lead to an immediate threat to human health or the environment, you need to report your findings to the National Response Center.For example, if you are having problems with your workplace environment (e.g., handling toxic chemicals or breathing noxious fumes), you should contact the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
If you have concerns about wildlife being harmed, you should contact the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the National Fish and Wildlife Service.
For farming concerns, you should contact your local Agricultural Extension office.If you think you have an emergency, which might include oil spills, radiation emergencies, or biological discharges, you need to contact the National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802., If the EPA is the agency you think should hear about an environmental law violation, you can use their online system to draft your report. The report page can be found at https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/report-environmental-violations. Once there, you will provide the EPA with the following:


Information about the suspected violation. This will include the violator's name, address, and the date of the incident.
Your contact information. If you want to submit your report anonymously, you can do so. However, if you submit the report anonymously, the EPA will be unable to contact you should they need further information. If they are unable to contact you, they may not be able to start an investigation.
The names and contact information of other people you have contacted about the violation. For example, if you have contacted a state agency as well as the EPA, include that information here.
A characterization of the violation. The EPA wants to know whether the violation was accidental or intentional; a release, spill, or dump; in the air, water, or land; and whether it was committed by an individual, company, or a government.
A description of the violation in as much detail as possible. This is also the opportunity to tell the EPA if you have videos, pictures, or other evidence that may help. You should also provide detailed directions on how to reach the site of the violation., When your report is complete, you will hit the ""send report"" button at the bottom of the page. At this point, the EPA will review your allegations and determine how to proceed. If you included your contact information, the EPA may contact you for more information if it is needed.If the EPA determines that the issue would be better handled by a different agency or government, the EPA will forward your information along to that entity., If you are having trouble using the EPA's website, or you have questions you would like answered prior to submitting your report, you can always call the EPA. The EPA has a different number for every region of the country. To find out which region you are in and the number to call, you can look up each region's customer service hotline online.


For example, if you live in Region 9, which covers California, Nevada, and Arizona, you can contact the EPA by calling 866-372-9378., If the violation you see involves state law, as opposed to a federal law, you will need to file a report with your state in order to start an enforcement action. Every state has multiple agencies that handle environmental compliance. In addition, each state will have a different name for their environmental enforcement agency. Do some research to determine who you will need to contact.]

For example, in New Hampshire, the main enforcement agency is the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services.In New York, you will contact the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.In Vermont, you will contact the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources., Many states will have different reports you should file depending on the type of violation you see. It will therefore be important to document the violation as best as possible so you can categorize it when the time comes. For example, in New Hampshire, there is a different report form for all of the following types of violations:Air pollution
Drinking water and groundwater
Surface water discharges
Surface water quality
Waste management

, Once you find the correct form, fill in the required information where needed. Each form should ask a series of questions you can answer. Based on your answers, the state agency may or may not start an investigation. In general, a state report will ask for the following:


A description of the affected area. This will include the address and directions about how to get there.
A description of the problem. For example, if you are reporting a surface water violation, you might be describing objects in water bodies, fish kills, flow issues, discharges, odors, or erosion.
Your contact information. However, in most states, you can also choose to remain anonymous. In a state like New Hampshire, you will not be allowed to remain anonymous if the case goes to an administrative hearing or to trial.
Information about the responsible party. This should include their address, phone number, and a description of their appearance.
Attachments. If you have any pictures, videos, or other information that can help your report, you should attach these things to your report. Make sure you are not trespassing or doing anything else illegal in order to obtain these attachments., After you complete your report and have attached any other documents, you should send your report in. Some states may allow you to send the report directly through the internet while others may require you to mail your report in.


For example, in New Hampshire, you are required to mail your report in to the appropriate agency tasked with enforcing the particular area of the environment you are dealing with.In New York, you can submit your report directly through the Department of Environmental Conservation's website., In addition to reporting violations to government agencies, private organizations can also help you find a positive resolution to environmental law violations. In general, these entities will be nonprofit organizations tasked with protecting certain environmental values. Do an online search for organizations in your area. When you conduct your search look for the following:


An organization with a legal team. These legal teams will be able to pursue legal actions should your report warrant them. You will want to contact an organization that is able to enforce the laws they are protecting.
An organization with a similar mission as yours. For example, if you are witnessing water quality violations, do not contact an organization whose mission it is to protect the air you breathe.
An organization with a positive reputation. If you want to get the most out of your report, you should work with an organization respected in your community. These organizations will usually have positive relationships with state and federal agencies, local courts, and other citizens where the violation is occurring.

, When you find an organization you think may be able to help, contact them to set up a meeting. Let the organization know why you are calling and ask if they can help. If they can, they will have you come in to discuss what you saw. If the organization cannot help you, ask if they have any suggestions for who can.

, When you attend your meeting, bring all of the information about the violation you have. The more information you bring, the easier it will be for the organization to assess the situation. For example, bring pictures of the pollution, including where its source is and who is causing it to happen. You might even take a video that shows how often the pollution is occurring, how much pollution is being discharged, and what the discharge looks like. You might also have documents including test results or letters you have written to the responsible party.

, If your assertions are valuable, the organization's enforcement team will work to investigate and resolve the violation on your behalf. While the organization will likely take the lead from here, you may be asked to help when necessary. For example, if the organization brings a lawsuit, they may ask you to testify as a ""standing witness"" who will help prove that citizens are being affected by the violation.


One common example of organizations getting involved in enforcement actions are water quality nonprofits bringing lawsuits under the federal Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act allows citizens to bring lawsuits for water quality violations. Nonprofit organizations help by providing lawyers to bring these lawsuits on behalf of citizens that bring violations to their attention., Before you can submit a valuable report, you should have evidence of the environmental law violation happening. The EPA suggests looking for an unusual amount of smoke in the air, strong odors, oily looking water in streams, large amounts of litter, large amounts of dead animals, or disposal of odd materials at odd times of the day.When you find these things, the EPA suggests you take pictures and videos to document the violation.Be careful not to trespass or break any other laws while trying to gather your evidence. If you cannot obtain the evidence through legal means, do not gather it at all.

, Once you have evidence of possible violations, you should analyze state and federal environmental laws to help you determine if a violation is occurring. While you do not need to fully understand all of the intricacies of a law, you should have a general understanding of what it protects. Having this understanding will help you decide whether to report, and if so, who to report to (i.e., a state or federal agency).


For example, you may want to know that the Clean Water Act protects certain waterways from pollution. In addition, the law creates a permitting system for allowing the discharge of waste into those waterways. Finally, it might be helpful to not that the Clean Water Act has a citizen suit provision that allows citizens to bring lawsuits for violations.

, Different agencies and organizations may be limited in the types of actions they can bring to ensure compliance with environmental laws. In general, three different types of enforcement actions are available to ensure environmental laws are upheld.


First, you might take part in a an administrative hearing. These do not involve the courts and instead are handled by a quasi-judicial branches of certain agencies. In these situations, the agency or organization will present their case to an administrative law judge (ALJ) who will make a determination regarding the violations. The ALJ may choose to issue a notice of violation or an order requiring the violation to stop.
Second, you might go to civil court. These are formal lawsuits filed in court against people that commit environmental law violations. If you sent a report to the EPA, the Department of Justice will be responsible for bringing a lawsuit should they think one is warranted.
Third, the Department of Justice may choose to bring a criminal action against polluters whose actions are particularly egregious. If found guilty, these polluters can face criminal fines and possible jail time., When you choose who to report the possible violation to, you should think about what you want to get out of the report. If you want someone to be criminally prosecuted, you will have to contact the government. Private organizations cannot bring criminal actions.


However, if you want to bring a civil lawsuit, contacting a private organization may be your best option. These organizations are often highly motivated and have systems in place to help bring polluters to justice. On the other hand, government agencies may work slowly and may work towards a settlement to help keep costs low. If you win in a civil court, the polluter may have to pay civil penalties and may be required to clean up their mess."

Avoid using plastic.",How to Reduce Water Pollution1," It's an easy switch that makes a big difference. Using toxic chemicals like bleach and ammonia to clean your home is not only bad for the water supply, it's not necessary. Natural cleaners are just as effective at getting the house clean, and you don't have to worry that you're contributing to water pollution when you use them.


The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides a list of cleaning products (as well as a variety of other products) that are considered ""green,"" meaning they won't pollute the water supply. See epa.gov/greenerproducts.Common household supplies like white vinegar and baking soda can be used for everything from washing windows to scrubbing bathroom tiles, and they're completely nontoxic.;
, Never pour something that isn't biodegradable down the drain. When it is necessary to use something that's toxic to the water supply, such as paint or ammonia, take care to dispose of it properly. If you're not sure how to get rid of something, check your local government's website or contact your sanitation department to find out how toxic waste should be disposed of in your community. The following materials should never be poured down the drain:


Paint
Motor oil
Cleaning solvents
Ammonia
Pool chemicals

, Medication is made with a variety of substances that can be detrimental to the water supply. If you have leftover medication, look into local ""take back"" programs that allow you to turn in medication so it can be disposed of properly.That way it won't end up back in the drinking water, where it can harm people and animals.

, Flushing items that don't break down, like diapers, wet wipes, and plastic tampon applicators can cause problems in the sewer system. These items will eventually end up in local streams, rivers and other bodies of water, where they can harm fish and other wildlife. Instead of flushing them down the toilet, throw them away.


You can also help by using cloth diapers, recycled toilet paper and biodegradable tampons, which reduces the number of items that end up in the landfill.

, Conservation is an important way to help preserve water as a global resource. Treating water so it's clean enough to drink and use around the house requires a lot of energy, so it's important to conserve as much as possible, especially in areas where droughts are occurring. Adopt the following habits to conserve more water around your house:


Take showers instead of baths, since baths require more water.
Turn off your faucets when you aren't using water, such as when you're brushing your teeth.
Don't overwater your lawn. Make sure lawn sprinklers are turned off when it rains.
Water your garden before the sun comes up or after it sets to reduce evaporation, which leads to water waste., Since it isn't biodegradable, plastic often ends up collecting in rivers, lakes, and oceans when it has nowhere else to go. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, for example, is a huge vortex of trash, mainly plastic, that has collected in the ocean since it has nowhere else to go.This trash endangers marine life and affects humans as well. Whenever possible, use glass or cloth containers instead of plastic.

Improve the selenium content of your diet.",How to Protect Yourself from Air Pollution," You can use the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Airnow.gov website or the American Lung Association tools at stateoftheair.org to find how high air pollution levels are in your town. Click on “City Rankings” and “Compare Your Air” tabs at the top of the page., It will help you check air quality levels on a day-to-day basis.

, For example, New York State publishes an Air Quality Index every day as part of the Department of Environmental Conservation website., Staying outdoors can increase your risk of lung diseases, heart attacks, asthma and other health problems., Choose a high efficiency model that rates 9 or higher on the MERV scale. Replace the filter every three to six months, depending upon the product’s recommendations., It will introduce fewer particles into your car.

, Air pollution is highest in the sun’s rays, so working out in cool weather outdoors or in a gym indoors will help you avoid too much exposure.


Fill up your gas tank after dark. The sun’s rays also contribute to increased gasoline emissions during the day.

, The air quality is lower on thoroughfares and highways than it is on quiet residential streets.

, Cigarette smoke creates air pollution.

, The air quality should be higher in your home and you will reduce emissions outdoors.

, They produce fewer gasoline emissions and they will be safer for your lungs.

, Some studies have been conducted that indicate certain vitamin-rich foods can help your body to be more resilient. These changes in diet pose no increased risk for other diseases, and they may protect against cancers.

, These nutrients assist the formation and maintenance of mucous membranes that line the nasal passages and intestinal tract, making them more resistant to infection. Good sources include margarine, butter, sweet potatoes, carrots and liver.

, Good sources include oranges, strawberries, mango, grapefruit, broccoli and papaya.

, This nutrient protects against cell damage, increases the oxygen supply to cells and thus, strengthens the immune system. Try leafy green vegetables, whole grain cereal, egg yolks, butter and vegetable oils.

, Selenium protects against free-radical damage to the liver and lungs that can lead to cancer. Eat eggs, onions, garlic, whole grains and fish."

Don't use pesticides and herbicides.,
Remove concrete surfaces and replace them with groundcover.,
Prevent soil erosion from occurring.,
Contain and compost yard waste.,
Keep your car in good repair.",How to Reduce Water Pollution2," These chemicals are sprayed on the surface of the yard, but when it rains they leach deep into the ground and get into the groundwater below. Contaminated groundwater can have a negative effect on the environment as well as the people who depend on it. Switch to natural methods for getting rid of pests and weeds.


Look into organic gardening practices to find creative ways to deal with garden pests. For example, many pests can be dealt with using a simple solution of dish soap and water.
Planting native species can also help, since native species have developed a resistance to the pests and weeds in the area. Species native to other lands are more susceptible to disease as well.

, When a house is surrounded by concrete patios and other surfaces, chemicals pool and runoff leaches into the groundwater instead of getting evenly distributed staying closer to the surface. It might be tempting to pave over your yard so you don't have to deal with mowing the lawn, but keeping a yard is much better for the environment.

, When soil gets eroded and ends up in streams, rivers and other waterways, chemicals that exist in soil mix with the water and create problems for plant and animal life. For example, when phosphorus levels get too high in a body of water, they lead to algae blooms that can kill fish populations. The best way to prevent erosion is to keep the soil in place by planting plenty of native trees, shrubs, grasses and groundcover. The plants' roots hold the soil in place and keep it from falling into the water., Yard waste that sits around can easily wash into storm drains when it rains. Even if the waste doesn't contain chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides, the introduction of large quantities of sticks, leaves, and grass clippings can overwhelm waterways with unhealthy quantities of nutrients.


Your compost should be contained in a bin or barrel to prevent the materials from being washed away. Some municipalities provide these for free or at low cost.
Use a mulching mower instead of bagging grass clippings. Mulching mowers add a natural layer of compost to your lawn and you don't have to deal with disposal of grass clippings.
Dispose of yard waste and grass clippings properly. If you don't compost or if you have yard waste that you can't compost, contact your local waste management or environmental protection agency to determine how to dispose them.

, If your car leaks oil and other chemicals, they can leach into the groundwater beneath the soil. Get your car regularly tuned up and make sure to repair any leaks as soon as they occur.


In addition, don't forget to dispose of motor oil properly instead of washing it down the drain.
