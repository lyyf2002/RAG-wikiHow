Get involved at school and work.,
Help clean up litter in water-filled areas.,
Speak up about water issues that affect your community.",How to Reduce Water Pollution3," You can take the same actions at work or school that you'd take at home to reduce water pollution. Look into the policies at your workplace or school and find out if there are changes you could help to facilitate to create a pollution-free environment. Getting classmates, teachers, and coworkers involved is a great way to educate others and make a difference.


For example, you could recommend that your office or school switch to eco-friendly cleaning supplies, and make suggestions as to which ones work well.
You could also put up signs reminding people to conserve water in the bathroom and kitchen areas.

, If you live near a local body of water, there's a lot you can do to help reduce pollution there. See if there's a group working to clean up local beaches, lakes, rivers or oceans. Many cities host clean-up days during which volunteers can come help clean up trash to purify local waterways.


If you can't find a local group working to reduce water pollution in your area, you might be just the person to start one! Consider hosting a cleanup day. Set a date, publicize the event, and have a plan in place for collecting and disposing of the trash.

, Corporations that allow industrial waste to seep into waterways are the biggest culprits when it comes to water pollution.There are regulations in place to prevent this from occurring, but it's still a common occurrence. Find out if there's a certain factory or energy plant in your area responsible for polluting local waterways, and speak up about the problem.


Learn about local and national laws against water pollution and join up with groups working to protect water in your area.Voting for political candidates who strive to protect waterways is a great way to do your part to reduce pollution.

Choose volunteer opportunities that matches your interests.,
Determine the requirements.,
Complete an application.,
Get your medical records.,
Complete your interview.,
Attend orientation.,
Be professional at all times.,
Wear your uniform and badge.,
Follow the rules.,
Do not accept gifts.",How to Volunteer at a Hospital," Make a list of hospitals in your area that you are willing to travel to on a regular basis. Volunteering at a hospital is a large commitment. You want to find a hospital that is convenient for you to visit. For example, if you plan to volunteer after school or work, choose a hospital that is close to your job or school. If you plan to volunteer on the weekends, choose a hospital that is close to where you live.


Use resources such as Google Maps, the phone book, and your knowledge of the area.
Don't discount smaller hospitals and clinics.
Search the internet for a phone number for volunteer services, or write down the main phone number for the hospital.;
, Once you have identified hospitals that you are interested in, visit the hospital website to find out about volunteer opportunities. The majority of hospitals have volunteer programs. The website will list contact information for the volunteer office at the hospital. You can call with any questions or concerns you have about volunteering at the hospital.


When you visit the website, look at the different areas within the hospital that accept volunteers.
Make a list of the hospitals that have areas that look interesting to you and are in a convenient location.

, There are many ways to volunteer at a hospital. You can serve patients, families, and hospital visitors.Find an opportunity that matches with your interests. Volunteering should be enjoyable and be beneficial for both you and the hospital.


If there is a special population that you are interested in working with, you should find a hospital that caters to that population.
If you enjoy working with children, try to volunteer at a children's hospital. If you enjoy working with the elderly, try to volunteer at a nursing home.
If you want to interact with patients, you should volunteer in an area that provides direct care to patients.
If you want to help hospital visitors, you may want to volunteer at the information desk or in the gift shop.If you do not want to interact with patients or visitors, you may be able to help with administrative work like filing, or shredding., Volunteer requirements vary among hospitals. The requirements will be different for teens and adult volunteers as well. Hospitals typically have age requirements and expected time commitment (e.g hours per week, six months or one year, etc.). Some hospitals have special summer volunteer programs or internships for students.


Requirements will vary depending on the area that you choose to volunteer in as well. For example, at one hospital, you can start volunteering when you are 15 years old, but you cannot interact with patients until you are 18 years old.If you are under the age of 18, you will need permission from your parents to volunteer at the hospital.

, You will need to fill out a volunteer application at the hospital. Often, an application can be completed online or downloaded from the hospital website. Typically, a member of the volunteer office will contact you to once your application has been received and notify you of the next steps. Make sure you include the specific areas that you would like to volunteer in on your application.


Choose more than one area of interest on your application in case you do not get your first choice.Most hospitals will conduct a background and criminal check as part of your application.
Get your application in as soon as you can. Slots may be filled on a first-come, first-serve basis.
If you are applying to a special summer program, check the application dates. The dates may be different than the deadline for other types of volunteers., Typically, hospitals will require that you have a received your MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine and a recent Tuberculosis (TB) skin test. If you have already received these vaccinations, you will need documentation of your results. If you have not received these vaccinations, you will need to have them before you can volunteer at a hospital.


Some hospitals also require a influenza (flu) vaccination and Varicella (Chicken Pox) vaccination or immunity.Visit your primary care physician or local health department if you need to get your vaccinations and TB test.

, Many hospitals like to interview potential volunteers. Be prepared to answer some questions when you go in for your interview. Why do you want to volunteer at the hospital? What would like to do as a volunteer? What are your interests? Do you have any special skills? How did you hear about the hospital volunteer program?It may help to think about these questions and write down the answers before your interview.
Do not think of the interview as a formal job interview. The hospital is really trying to find a volunteer placement that is a good fit for you.
Give honest answers and be yourself during the interview.

, You will typically be required to attend some sort of orientation before you begin volunteering. The orientation will cover many topics such as hospital policies and procedures, volunteer requirements and expectations, and the history and mission of the hospital. In addition to a general orientation, you may receive training in your specific volunteer area.


Orientation may be onlineor at the hospital.At some hospitals, you may attend orientation before you complete your application. If this is the case, you will receive information about the application and interview process during orientation.Pay attention and ask questions during orientation. This is also a good time to meet some of the people you may be working with.
You will receive your assignment at orientation as well.

, Although you are not an employee, you should still be professional. Show up to work on time, treat patients and visitors with respect,report any unsafe conditions, and do not use your cell phone while you are volunteering. Your professional conduct contributes to a safe environment for both you and the hospital patients, visitors, and employees.


Also avoid giving your contact information to patients and visiting with them outside of the hospital. Professional boundaries can become blurred when you share your personal information with patients. Crossing this boundary can cause patients to become dependent on you, make you feel burdened or stressed, and cause you to be less objective when helping the patients and families.Unless you are required to touch the patients as part of your job, you should avoid any physical contact. Refraining from physical contact is for the safety of both you and the patient. You do not want to pass germs back and forth between you and the patients.

, Most hospitals require volunteers to wear a uniform.Your uniform will let patients, visitors, and hospital staff know that you are a volunteer. Keep your uniform neat and clean. You are representing the hospital when you are wearing it. Your name badge should always be visible as well.


If you lose your badge, let your supervisor know.
There may be other dress code guidelinesin addition to your uniform such as wearing flat, close-toe shoes.
Be prepared to pay for your own uniform.

, As a volunteer, you must respect the privacy of all the patients at the hospital. Do not share any patient's medical information, name, address, phone number, or any other identifying information with anyone. You are also responsible for knowing and following the other policies and procedures (e.g. emergency procedure, infection control, etc.)If you are ever unsure about something, consult your volunteer handbook, your supervisor, or the volunteer office.
If you want to tell someone a story about some of your work at the hospital, be careful not to include the patient's name or any specifics in your story.

, When you volunteer on a regular basis, you will begin to develop friendships with some of the patients and families. Patients and families will be grateful for all the help that you provide and may try to show their gratitude by giving you a gift. However, volunteers should never accept gifts from patients.If a patient gives you something, try saying ""This is very nice of you, but I cannot accept this"" or ""You are very kind, but no thank you.""If a patient insists that you accept something, take the gift and give it to your supervisor. Let your supervisor know that you politely declined the gift, but the patient insisted that you take it.
Although you are not a paid employee, you are still considered a professional. Accepting gifts can compromise the relationship between you and the patients. For example, some patients may expect special treatment or favors from you after you accept a gift.Some hospitals have strict policies around this. You could lose your volunteer position at the hospital.

Eat a snack before shopping.,
Try a new food.,
Download a smartphone app to help you shop smart.",How to Minimize Food Waste1," Schedule your grocery shopping after a meal or be sure to have a satisfying snack before heading to the store. Shopping while hungry can cause you to purchase more food than you would normally buy, which could lead to food waste., Don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try new produce. Choosing a new and foreign fruit or vegetable can encourage you to learn new preservation tricks or new dishes to make. This will encourage you to use produce right away instead of letting it sit until it wilts and eventually rots.


If you have never tried a dragon fruit, you could try making dragon fruit sorbet.
You could also try ugli fruit and add it to a salad or a smoothie!

, There are a variety of applications for your phone or tablet that can help you get the most out of your grocery shopping. Some apps will allow you to create a shopping list, tabulate expenses, record expiration dates, and more. Knowing when your groceries expire will help you reduce food waste.


The Green Egg Shopper app allows you to enter “use by” dates so that you never miss one and let food go to waste.StillTasty.com offers plenty of information on the shelf life of food and how you can properly store food to avoid it from spoiling too quickly. They also offer an app compatible with Apple devices.Cozi offers a free web-based tool that allows you to enter your shopping list and plan meals. This can help you stay organized with your groceries and prevent food waste.MINI Fridge allows you to track what’s in your fridge by “use by” and expiration dates."

Contact your local animal shelter or humane society.,
Consider which animals you want to work with.,
Learn about the available volunteer positions.,
Make sure that volunteering will fit with your schedule.",How to Volunteer at an Animal Shelter1," The organization may have a contact person or ""volunteer coordinator"" who can help you get involved at their facility. Visit a shelter's website, and check for any information that is listed for volunteers. Some shelters will not offer much information on their websites, and some may not have websites at all.


Look online for shelters near your home or office. Consider the distance from your home, the type of animal, and the needs of a given shelter. If two animal shelters are right next to each other, but one of them is in more urgent need of volunteers: it may be best to choose that shelter.;
, Most shelters take in dogs and cats, but you may be hard-pressed to find a center that deals with more exotic pets. You may be able to choose between working with dogs and cats, or you may be asked to deal with both. Bear in mind that you may not even be allowed to work with the animals at first. You often need to work at the shelter for a while before you can handle animals directly.

, Depending on the shelter, you may be assigned to a specific job, or you may perform various tasks as need arises. You may be required to complete a certain number of hours of support tasks before you are allowed to work directly with animals. Laundry, dish-washing, floor-mopping, and office work are often necessary to keep a shelter running smoothly.


Ask about volunteer programs on- and off-site. Most shelters need people to help in the facility: walking dogs, handling cats, and grooming various animals. However, many shelters also have off-site adoption events or fundraisers with which you might be able to help.
If you have any special skills that relate to shelter work: tell the shelter! Volunteers can provide website support, offer legal aid, donate medical services, photograph adoptable animals for the adoption websites, or even create and donate original art for sale to benefit the shelter.

, Most volunteer opportunities occur during a shelter's open hours, although you might also be asked to care for animals and do maintenance work during the off-hours. Shelters are usually open seven days a week, with slightly fewer hours on Saturdays and Sundays.

Read your state and city's land use code.,
Meet with your contractor or architect to discuss what changes will need to be made with the landscape.,
Call an arborist or landscape architect to appraise the stability of your current trees.,
Hire a landscape architect to handle the entire landscape plan for your construction area.,
Consider relocating smaller trees to other parts of the property.",How to Protect Trees During Construction1," Many cities have rules about removing trees and protecting them during construction. Share any applicable rules with the interested parties on the project.;
, If you are doing a small renovation, some trees may not be affected at all, while others may need to be protected or removed.

, If some of the trees are dying or are not structurally sound, they may need to be removed instead of saved.


You should be especially conscious of older, mature trees. These trees often pose a risk to structures if they fall. They also have a harder time adapting to environmental changes than younger trees. If these trees will be within 5 feet (1.5 m) of your new construction, you should remove them.

, The architect can handle the transplanting of trees, removal of trees and protection of others. You should approve a plan to landscape the area before construction starts.

, If they are at risk, you can hire an arborist to help you safely move and replant the trees where they will thrive.


Tree species adapt to change differently. Consult the table of relative ease of adaptability at ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07420.html before making your decision to move or protect a tree.

Research which foods keep well as leftovers.,
Cook with portions in mind.,
Use perishable food quickly.,
Use food scraps for other purposes.",How to Minimize Food Waste2," Certain foods do not hold up well as leftovers and some make excellent leftovers! Knowing which foods you should consume right away and which ones will make great leftovers will help you know how much to prepare.


Search for recipes that make delicious leftovers. There are plenty of websites, like Allrecipes and BBC Good Food, that list recipes specifically for this purpose.In general, foods with fresh (not cooked) produce will not make good leftovers. The produce will be wilted and mushy by the time you are ready to eat it.

Curries make great leftovers because of the herbs and spices in the sauce release, even more, flavor the longer they are kept.
Beans and legumes can last up to five days as leftovers and are very tasty!, If you’re cooking for yourself or one other person, be wary of the quantities listed in a recipe you may be preparing. If the recipe was designed with a family in mind, it may not be practical to assume you’ll be able to eat the leftovers yourself.If the recipe is for a family and you are only cooking for one or two, cut the amount of ingredients listed in the recipe by half. You may also need to reduce the cooking time.
Look for recipes that are aimed at individuals who are only cooking for one or two people.

, When returning from the grocery store, use your perishable produce as soon as possible. Produce will begin to rot within a week or two so it is important to use it up first so as not to waste food.


Determine which recipes the produce will be used in right away to ensure that all of the produce gets used.
You can use the produce to make preserves or for pickling.
Freeze the produce for later use.

, There are many ways that you can utilize scraps of food, instead of throwing them in the garbage or into the garbage disposal.


When buying chicken, purchase the bone and skin versions and cut it up yourself when you return from the store, instead of buying the boneless, skinless kind. The bones and skins can be used in combination with vegetable trimmings to make a sizable amount of chicken stock.You can strain and store the excess bacon fat in a pan after frying up some bacon strips. After it cools down, it yields a shelf-stable cooking oil with a delicious flavor.

Freeze food.,
Can food.,
Dehydrate food.,
Pickle food.,
Ferment food.",How to Minimize Food Waste3," Freezing is one of the most common ways of preserving food. Keeping the food at freezing temperatures generally, prevents microorganisms from increasing in number and spoiling it. Freezing can thus be an effective way to preserve the nutrients. Freezing food will change its texture after it is reheated so it is best to avoid freezing things like creamy sauces or yogurt, basil, parsley, soft cheeses, apples, lemons, cucumbers, celery, onions, and more., A great way to preserve food is to learn how to can, if you are not already familiar with it. Canning removes oxygen and prevents the growth of bacteria that spoils food. There are a number of techniques for canning that you can choose from.


Canning in pressure cookers involves using a pressure cooker to create enough pressure and heat that will create a seal to keep air out and liquid in. This is the safest method for preserving meats, vegetables, poultry, and seafood.Canning in a boiling water bath is ideal and safe for tomatoes, fruits, jams, pickles, and other preserves.

, Dehydrating food involves eliminating the water that is in food, leaving you with a dried version. This is popular because it is all natural, makes food portable, and can be delicious. Try dehydrating food like apples, tomatoes, broccoli, or carrots with an oven or a dehydrator.

, Pickled foods are soaked in solutions that prevent the food from spoiling. Pickling can be done without canning and usually involves the use of vinegar or a salt brine. Don't limit yourself to pickling pickles - you can also preserve yellow squash, green beans, and cherries in this way., Fermenting and pickling have similar preparation processes but the methods preserve food in different ways. Fermentation uses a process called “lacto-fermentation” to preserve food and enhance the nutrient content. You can ferment fruit as well as ferment vegetables.

Organize the shelves in your fridge.,
Store vegetables appropriately.,
Store fruit accordingly.",How to Minimize Food Waste4," Knowing how to arrange your refrigerator will help your groceries last longer because the various areas in the fridge are different temperatures and some groceries need to be colder than others. This practice will also minimize food waste. Dairy products should be stored at the top of the refrigerator, where it is coolest.
Store meat and fish on the shelf or shelves in the middle tier(s).
Place cheese and cold cuts in the first drawer below the bottom shelf.
Store produce and fruit in the bottom drawer or a bottom drawer that is humidity-controlled, if applicable.
Store eggs and butter in a compartment protected by a cover in the door of the refrigerator. This prevents them from getting too cold.
Place sauces and dressings in the middle compartments of the refrigerator door.

, Certain vegetables do best outside of the refrigerator and some should be refrigerated immediately after purchasing.Store garlic in an area that is dry and well-ventilated.
Keep onions and potatoes separated, as they cause each other to spoil faster.
Store sweet potatoes in a place that shields them from heat and light.
Most other vegetables should be refrigerated.

, Most fruit needs to ripen or soften at room temperature before refrigerating, and certain fruits should be stored in the refrigerator immediately after purchasing. Still others can be stored at room temperature without fear of spoiling too quickly.Bananas, honeydew melons, kiwi fruit, mangos, nectarines, pineapples, etc. need to ripen at room temperature before refrigeration, or else they can lose flavor.
Most berries need to be refrigerated immediately after purchasing. Leaving them at room temperature will increase the rate of decay.
Apples, many citrus fruits, and watermelon can be stored at room temperature. However, they will generally last longer if refrigerated.

Clear out the clutter in the refrigerator.,
Use FIFO.,
Keep track of what gets thrown out.,
Donate to food banks.",How to Minimize Food Waste5," A cluttered refrigerator will prevent the air from properly circulating and cooling the food that is stored. You’ll want to start by learning the best way to organize your fridge.


Empty out the fridge and clean it thoroughly.
Discard food that has spoiled.
Organize the food bins. Certain bins are designated for produce, meat, and cheese.
After filling the bins, start adding the rest of the food.

, FIFO stands for First In, First Out and is a standard practice in restaurants and commercial kitchens. When unpacking groceries at home, place older products in the front and store the new products in the back. This will ensure that you are using up the older groceries first before they spoil. , Keeping a list of what you have thrown out can serve as reminder to rethink purchasing it next time. If you didn’t use it before, perhaps you just aren’t inclined to eat that food and it will go to waste if you buy it again.

, Instead of throwing something out that you do not want to eat, consider donating food to a food bank. This will both prevent food from going to waste and allow you to help others in need.


Search online for food banks in your area. You can also ask friends or family if they know of any and can direct you.
Once you have designated a food bank in your area to donate to, look online or call to find out what kind of food they do and do not accept.
Most food banks will not accept food that has not been prepared in a kitchen that is licensed to process or prepare food.
It is generally acceptable to donate non-perishable food that is sealed or in cans that has been purchased from a store.

Visit the shelter and ask about volunteering.,
Fill out an application.,
Understand the volunteer requirements.,
Attend the training session.,
Find a schedule that works well for you.,
Get onto a waiting list.",How to Volunteer at an Animal Shelter2," Call, visit their website, or visit the shelter in person. See what the atmosphere is like, and observe how healthy and happy the animals seem to be. If you still think that this is the right place for you, ask for an application to be a volunteer. Most shelters will give you a form to fill out, along with a list of basic guidelines.


Don't be shy! Ask the staff any questions you have about volunteering.
If possible, talk directly to the owner or an employee of the shelter. An employee or current volunteer will usually reach out to the owner for you if he/she isn't available when you're around.

, This may be a physical form, or it may be online. You may need to provide a birth certificate and photo ID. Fill out the application carefully and truthfully, and make sure that all of your information is correct.


You may have to complete a criminal background check. Shelters want to make sure that their volunteers are trustworthy people.
Look for a phone number if you can't find an application. Call the shelter and ask whether they are looking for volunteers. Alternately: simply visit the shelter in person when you have a free afternoon.

, Different shelters have different requirements, which often depend on the specific work that you'll be doing. If you want to directly handle animals, it helps to have prior experience with animals. As a general rule, you must:


Be at least 16 (sometimes 18) years of age. If you are under that age, some shelters run family volunteer programs where parents and children come in to work together. Check in with several shelters. If you aren't old enough to volunteer at one center, you might be old enough to volunteer at another.
Be able to commit to a long-term volunteer position. Some shelters require a commitment as long as a year, so that they know it's worth their time to train you. Many shelters require a minimum of one regularly-scheduled shift every other week. Shifts may run for two hours or longer, depending on how much work needs to be done.
Be able to fulfill the physical duties. Most volunteer roles require that you are able to stand or walk for up to 3 hours. You should be able to lift 20 or more pounds.
Be able to hear, see, and interpret animal behavior and body language. This is most important if you'll be working directly with animals.
Be able to keep a positive attitude. It can be hard to emotionally handle a stressful workplace.

, Many shelters have a training session for new volunteers before they can officially start. This usually includes a tour of the facility, instructions on the jobs you will be doing, meeting staff, etc. Depending on the shelter, you might have to RSVP for a group training session that they hold once a month. Other shelters will train you whenever you can be available. Ask the shelter staff for more information.


Do anything else that the shelter says you need to do before starting. For example, you may need to vaccinate yourself against common animal-transmitted diseases.

, Perhaps you can volunteer after work or school, or on weekends in the mornings or afternoons. The owner of the shelter will usually tell you what you can do at the certain scheduled time: bathing the animals, socializing them, feeding them, etc. Some shelters have designated ""shifts"" for volunteers, whereas others just let helpers drop in when they have time. Some shelters only allow a certain amount of volunteers at a time. Ask the staff which days and time slots are available and find one that fits in with your schedule.

, Don't be discouraged if the owner tells you that s/he doesn't need any volunteers at the moment. Don't give up if there isn't an available time slot that works for you. Ask the shelter to put you on a volunteer waiting list. Once you're on this list, they may call you and ask you to help out once something opens up.

Prepare to volunteer.,
Represent your shelter.,
Donate.,
Think about fostering an animal.",How to Volunteer at an Animal Shelter3," You may need to provide your own lunch. Dress appropriately for the weather if you'll be working outdoors. Consider bringing tennis shoes or rubber boots, depending upon your chores. You shouldn't wear shiny jewelry or baubles, because you don't want the animals taking them, breaking them, or fighting you for them. It's also a good idea to bring bandages, peroxide, and disinfectant cream.

, Some people believe that animals in shelters are unwanted or undesirable in some way. One of the most beneficial things you can do is to share the positive facts about your shelter with people, especially those who have never adopted a pet before. By helping to change the mindset of the public, you can help more animals find their ""forever homes.""

, If you can't afford to spend much time volunteering at a shelter, you can still help out by donating money and animal-care items. Shelters need food, toys, bedding, and grooming items for each of the animals that come into their care. Most shelters will be happy to accept donations of used items. Ask for a list of things that they need. Some of these items may include:


Pet food, pet treats, feeding items, and bowls.
Blankets, towels, or padding or bedding for cages. Try going to a local hotel and asking them for their stained linens.
Disinfectants, grooming items, and newspaper for puppy training and cleaning.
Toys, scratching posts, balls, and toys.

, When you foster an animal, you are committing to take it into your home and to care for it. It is your job to help it get healthy and socialized before it is placed for adoption. Make sure that you have room for a temporary dog or cat in your home, and ask yourself whether you have the energy to care for this animal. If so, ask whether the shelter has a foster program. This is a big responsibility, but it can be deeply rewarding.

Assess the tree's root system.,
Ensure you have a water source during construction.,
Buy metal or wooden posts to help put up barricades.,
Choose the size of your barricade by the age of your tree.,
Place a layer of wood chips around the tree in the barricade.,
Post signs around your barricade to help communicate that the tree is to be protected.,
Check on the health of the tree and structure of the barricades at least once per week during the construction period.

",How to Protect Trees During Construction2," You will need to consider the horizontal space below the tree as well as the tree limbs, branches and trunk. Keep the following parameters in mind:


The tree's root system extends horizontally in all directions approximately as far as its height. Measure this area away from your tree and mark it with a stake.
You must aim to protect at least 50 percent of the root system from construction vehicles in order to ensure the tree will be safe. Measure approximately half of the length of the tree and mark it with a stake on each side. This is the area you will need to protect.

, Most construction takes place during the warm spring, summer or fall months. During summer, trees need to have the soil around their roots saturated every 1 to 2 weeks.

, You will also need some netting to string around those posts. Bright orange netting will advertise an extra need for caution around the area.

,


For trees that have been planted 1 to 4 years ago, the barricade should extend just beyond the branches and leaves of the tree. This is called the drip line.
For trees that are older, the barricade should extend 1 extra foot for every inch of the trunk's diameter in all directions.

, This layer should be approximately 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) deep.

, This can help to warn construction crews, and it will reduce the likelihood of damage from machinery.

"
Minimize damage if a trench must be dug near a tree.",How to Protect Trees During Construction3," This process can easily damage root systems and make the roots susceptible to fungi and diseases.


If possible, ensure that the trench is at least 8 feet (2.4 m) away from the tree trunk.
Once the trench is dug, cleanly cut affected roots with shears.
Fill in the trench as soon as possible to avoid extra stress on the tree.

Visit the shelter.,
Be able to do physical labor.,
Fill out an application.,
Choose a shelter in need.,
Realize that volunteering can be emotionally taxing.",How to Volunteer at a Dog Shelter1," Before you decide to volunteer at the shelter, go visit. Not all shelters are set up the same way. Some shelters may treat animals more harshly or less humanely than others. Many shelters euthanize animals. You should discover how the shelter is run before volunteering your time.Go to the shelter and ask for a tour. While there, ask questions about their policies, what they do there, and how they are run.;
, For many volunteer opportunities in a shelter, you need to be able to do physical labor. You may be asked to squat, bend, or stand for long periods of time. You may have to lift objects or even heavy dogs. Find out what physical tasks will be required of you as a volunteer.If you want to volunteer but are unable to do that physical work, talk to the shelter about various other tasks that don’t require that level of physical labor.

, Most shelters require you to fill out an application before you can become a volunteer. The application will depend on the shelter. Some shelters may just require basic information to keep on file, while others will ask for references, a list of skills, or experience with dogs.You can usually find an application online. If the shelter doesn’t have one online, you can go by and pick one up in person.

, Some shelters have too many volunteers. Others may desperately need people to help out. Consider choosing a shelter in your community that is in need of volunteers so you can make a difference.Check with all shelters and rescue organizations in your area to determine which ones need help, and which ones may be the right fit for you.

, Volunteering at shelters is not just playing with dogs. Volunteering at shelters can be difficult. You will be dealing with dogs who have been abandoned, injured, abused, and neglected. It can be hard looking into the cages. You may become attached to dogs who get adopted or euthanized.Volunteering at a dog shelter can be very rewarding, but be aware of the difficult emotions you may feel as a dog lover.

Decide whether you will hold an event or use an event organized by somebody else.,
Ask for permission to hold an event or to be a part of another event.,
Choose a type of event.,
Make or assemble the items needed to help send out your message.,
Think of a special edge.,
Build a dedicated team of volunteers.,
Consider basic logistics.,
Be certain of the weather.,
Leave a clean site.",How to Use School or Community Events to Raise Awareness," Organizing your own event may be even more effective, but it will involve a lot of effort and organization. You may find it more effective and time-saving to join an event that is already planned.;
, You will also need to discuss whether you can display posters, distribute fact sheets and pamphlets, and perhaps even have a stall with games and prizes.

, Here are just a few ideas for events at which you can raise awareness and communicate information, whether or not you organize them yourself:

Rallies and fairs: these are (you hope!) large gatherings with lots of stalls, activities and games.







Walks and marches: organized walks and marches are another good way of attracting attention. You can carry posters or banners and hand out information leaflets. You could also arrange a sponsored walk to raise funds.







Concerts: stage your own or ask for permission to hand out material at public concerts.







Sports events: many successful groups use sports as a focal point for activities







Theatrical events: short dramas, comedy sketches and puppet shows are a good way of communicating information without boring people!







, Make posters, flyers, badges, banners, signs, costumes and other informational material or display items to hand out and display at the event.

, Is there something different that you can do apart from the rest of the event to alert others to your presence? Maybe stage a skit, float 100 balloons above your table, present an award to someone special? Consider possible avenues for making your cause or project the centre of attention for at least a portion of the whole event.

, Seek volunteers from your class, school or community group to join in and make the awareness raising event a success. You will need people who can make the display items, people who can write and print the information and people who are willing to stand around at the event and actively engage people in discussion and explanation of the cause or project that your are promoting.

, There are some things that must be arranged before the event that may seem mundane but are very important to its success:
Ensure that everyone can reach the event; arrange transportation or collection of volunteers if necessary






Provide means for getting the promotional materials to the event






Be sure to have the right equipment. If you want to display things, make sure there will be a table or stand available, or bring your own






Check out the venue ahead of time, to make sure you know how to set up your own area






Consider clothing - will you be wearing something that distinguishes all of you? For example, you might all wear red t-shirts, or blue ribbons or have special patches on your arms to identify you and your cause to all the people attending the event






Ensure that the volunteers have access to refreshments and water; either ask them to bring their own or have some available






Check for restroom facilities; overlooking this can result in hardship for somebody!







, Always plan for weather contingencies. If the event is indoors, you won't have to worry. But if it is held outdoors and suddenly it starts to rain or blow a gale, you will want to be sure your volunteer team and the promotional material are protected from the elements.

, Always tidy up after your own event. It leaves a good impression in everybody's mind and you will be asked back again if you leave everything the way that you found it. This is especially important when you want to hold a regular awareness raising event and you are passing down the baton to younger classes or other volunteers.

Stick to a vegetarian or vegan diet.,
Avoid wearing any clothing that contains animal skins or furs.,
Do not patronize zoos, circuses, or any other attraction that features animals as entertainment.,
Use cruelty-free beauty and hygiene products.",How to Volunteer and Be a Supporter of PETA4," A vegetarian diet excludes all meat, while a vegan diet excludes any and all animal by-products, including things like dairy. If you haven’t attempted either of these lifestyles before, make sure you understand what they entail.


PETA offers a free vegan starter kit that you can order from their website. It has recipes and tips on how to stay healthy and thrive on your new vegan diet.There are more and more vegetarian options becoming available as an alternative to meat. Even many fast food restaurants offer veggie burgers., PETA firmly believes that animals are not for wearing, so if you own any clothing that may have been made from animal skin, fur, or wool, donate it and avoid purchasing any more of this kind of clothing.


PETA offers a shopping guide on their website that will help you figure out where to shop and how to find cruelty-free clothing., It is one of PETA’s core values that animals should not be used for entertainment. They believe these attractions are cruel to animals.


PETA believes that the cramped quarters and cages that animals are kept in at zoos are not adequate, and that animals deserve to be in their natural habitats in order to thrive., You might be surprised to find out how many of your everyday products have been tested on animals. If you want to support PETA and their values, you should stop using these products and switch to products that do not test on animals.


Check your products for the leaping bunny on the label. This means the product is cruelty-free and not tested on animals.PETA has a search engine you can use on their website that will allow you to look up the companies you purchase from and see which of them test on animals."

Ask what is required of you as a volunteer.,
Determine what tasks volunteers do.,
Determine if you can commit to your duties.,
Ask if you need any training.,
Help in other ways.",How to Volunteer at a Dog Shelter2," Shelters may require different things of people when they volunteer. Even if you have volunteered at an animal shelter in the past, that doesn’t mean volunteering at a new place will be the same. Before you commit, ask the shelter what you will be expected to do and how many hours you will be required to volunteer.You may want to contact different shelters in your area to find one that fits better with your schedule and interests.

, Many shelters have different areas or duties you can volunteer for. Depending on the shelter, you may be able to choose where you volunteer, or the shelter may put you where you are needed most. You may be able to ask the shelter not to put you on a duty you really don’t want to do. Volunteer positions may include:Adoption support
Animal care
Dog walker
Education programs
Bather and groomer

, Many shelters have a volunteer schedule, so you will not be able to go in and volunteer whenever you want. The shelter will tell you when they need you. Many shelters also require volunteers to complete a certain number of hours per week or month. You may also be asked to commit to at minimum number of months.Before you agree to volunteer, make sure you can meet the scheduled hours. Dog shelters rely on volunteers to help take care of the dogs, so if you don’t show up, you are hurting the shelter.
Some shelters let you drop in when you have time or sign up for events you want to participate in.

, Some shelters require that you take a basic training class before you can volunteer. This training class may give you basics in working with dogs and performing basic tasks required of you as a volunteer.The classes may be given on an individual basis or once a month for all new volunteers.

, You can help out dog shelters in many ways. Volunteering your time is one way to help, but you may want to volunteer your resources, too. You can spread the word about the shelter and the dogs that need adopting.Many shelters need supplies to help take care of their dogs. You can donate items, like blankets, cleaning supplies, food, and puppy pads. You may also organize a drive for the community to donate needed items for the shelter.

"
"
Dress appropriately.,
Consider bringing earplugs.,
Realize some animals will be scared or aggressive.",How to Volunteer at a Dog Shelter3," When you volunteer, you need to make sure to dress for working in a dog shelter. That means you should wear clothes you do not mind getting dirty. If you are working an event, the shelter may want you to wear a shelter t-shirt or nice clothes.Not all volunteer tasks involve being inside the shelter. There may be tasks that take you outside to hand out flyers, walk dogs, or work with dogs in runs. Dress for whatever temperature you’ll be working in.

, Dog shelters can be loud. Most of the time, numerous dogs are barking nonstop. Due to the way the shelters are set up, the barking can sound even louder than normal. If you think this will bother you, get some earplugs to wear while you work., Shelters get many different kinds of dogs. Some of the dogs in these shelters have been abused or neglected, so they are scared. Other dogs may not like being in the shelter or be unnerved by the noise. This means they may act aggressively when around new people.If you are unsure how to approach new animals, ask an employee for help.
Some shelters require you to sign an accident waiver in case of biting, scratching, or other injury.

Embrace your skill set.,
Be prepared to respect confidentiality.,
Consider working with kids.,
Look into remote options, if desired.,
Get ready for some intense training.,
Keep privacy as you number one concern.,
Don't worry if you make mistakes at first.,
Take care of yourself, too.,
Don't be afraid to seek out opportunities that suit you.,
Embrace the mission.",How to Volunteer at a Domestic Violence Shelter," Are you good with people, especially children? Have an excellent phone presence? Great at raising funds? Excellent in an office setting, or  in the field? Have extensive experience with a different volunteer job? All of these skills are greatly needed at the shelters, and you can choose what you'd like to do as a volunteer. Do expect, though, to be crossed trained in all aspects of volunteering to assist survivors of domestic violence and their loved ones.;
, Once you learn the location of the shelter you cannot disclose it to anyone, not even friends or family. It's one of those secrets that must remain with you for the safety of those that are being protected. If anyone discovers its location, the people being protected have been compromised and put in danger.

, There are many children at the shelters. If you are interested in working with them, you will be trained in how to behave with children who have seen and/or experienced abuse. Many of the children suffer from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and have to be treated accordingly. They are not in their homes and will often rebel against their mothers while in the shelter, primarily out of resentment and fear. Your job will be to provide them with distractions, such as recreational activities, playtime, arts and crafts, reading them books and even going on field trips.

, If you don't want to leave your home because you still have young children or it just isn't convenient, consider answering a hotline. Then you only work when someone calls, but you are providing an invaluable service to those in need. You will be trained in how to provide advice and advocacy over the phone; you will not be expected to answer it without first training for all contingencies.

, You'll likely be cross-trained to provide crisis intervention, education, practical assistance and advocacy to survivors of domestic violence and sexual abuse who are either at the shelter, or on the phone. If you decide you're interested in Crisis Response, plan on additional training, since you will be going to the courts, jails, hospitals and anywhere else a survivor may need assistance.


Often there is a 30 day program for new volunteers. That may sound like a lot but there is a lot to cover and it's very important you are as knowledgeable as possible. Use some of the training you receive  in other parts of your life, such as public speaking, or dealing with different types of people while you are out. The skills you will master are very versatile and you will be surprised at how often you will find yourself using them.

, Never give out specific information about anyone that has been in the shelter or helped by the shelter no matter who they say they are. All of the information must remain confidential. Lives depend on it.

, As long as you don't break anyone's confidentiality or the confidentiality of the shelter everything else can be fixed. You can work on your weaker skills and improve them easily, no one is perfect when they are just starting something new.

, Understand that volunteering to assist with survivors can be sometimes be emotionally overwhelming and draining. This is normal, everyone who works with, or volunteers to, help other people has felt this way at some time. Be sure to take good care of yourself when you feel drained or overwhelmed. Take a walk, a hot bath, buy yourself something special or just relax at home.

, Sure, you're volunteering, but you can do so in a way that's a win-win for both you and the program participants. You won't ""connect"" with everyone. And that's ok. Volunteering is no different than regular life, you like some people more than others. If there is someone you simply cannot work with request a different shift, or have a different volunteer work with those people. This should be an enjoyable experience for you, not one to dislike.

, Shelters are not scary places. They are safe havens for many survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and without volunteers they would not exist. If you've every considered volunteering for a shelter please call your local hotline; they can refer you to the correct people to speak to about donating your time and energy.

Organizations can get addresses of Chaplains, FOBs (Forward Operating Bases), or base commanders who can receive care packages and mail. Often addresses come to organizations from families.;
, Make sure it is not only legitimate, but that it has a good reputation. There are organizations out there that only want your money. Do they have any awards? From whom? Look at those pages.

, Is there open information? Do they list their office phone numbers, email, address, list of corporate officers, and links to their financial information? Get the necessary information on membership. Some questions to ask may be: What obligations are there? Are there any dues? If there are other monies exchanged, how are they spent? Can they tell you where their money goes? Don't be afraid to call their office and ask some pointed questions.

, Get involved with people from that organization who have the experience. They can help you along the way, avoid mistakes, and make your membership fun.

, Many of them have been forward deployed recently. They can be very helpful. Thank them for their service while you're there.

, You can put anything in the box as long as it fits, up to 70 pounds for domestic mail. You will have to use a customs form, but an APO or FPO address is considered domestic.

",How to Start a Volunteer Organization," Friends are usually pretty supportive, and if you talk to a friend that feels the same way you do, or even one that's already a volunteer, they can give you some good advice.;
, After getting some support and advice, just plan out what you're going to do with the organization. Where will meetings be held? In which ways can you volunteer? What will be your main goal? If you aren't having meetings, how will you deliver information?

, Who can and can't join? How do you start a project? What can and can't be said? All of those things are important to know. If you and nobody else knows the rules, the whole system goes haywire.

, Recruit a team consisting of at least four members.

, Sign a license allowing you to use the SVA brand.

, Discuss your ideas and adopt a constitution.

,, It is recommended registering your club as an incorporated society. For example, in New Zealand, see: http://www.societies.govt.nz/cms/incorporated-societies, for more information on incorporation. Now you are done with the starting process.

,, Provide progress reports, detailing the requirements as set out in the rules.

, The club should normally hold two to four major events and minor weekend projects throughout the whole year.

, The following steps will detail how to prepare for an event, in what is considered to be the best practice approach.

, You don’t want to waste time of your volunteers or make them feel that their time is wasted. Your volunteers need to feel that they spent their time efficiently and that they did something useful. If they don’t, they won’t come next time. Therefore, if you expect some time lags (i.e. waiting until the paint dries etc.), prepare some other programme for volunteers (could be games or other work).

, The community advisor can help you find most urgent issues and problems in the community that the SVA could help to solve.


Example of an event: Random Act of Kindness - for one week long, the SVA organizes different events every day to be kind to others at the University of Canterbury.,, Confirm the place and sponsors. Make sure everyone from your team is aware of his or her responsibilities for the event.

, Discuss with your team what story is behind your event. Think what you want to convey to the public: “Why did you organize this particular project?” Afterwards, publish the story on your web page and share it on your Facebook/Twitter.


Give your event a name!

,, Some people could be abusing volunteers’ kindness. It is your responsibility to prevent this situation by informing your volunteers about their responsibilities and checking regularly on their work during the project.

, The President doesn’t need to know everything, but if he/she does not have full knowledge of the course of the event, let another person from your team speak. Otherwise it looks unprofessional when other team members have to correct President in front of volunteers.

, Send them the forms by email.

, Send them an email including results of a project and pictures from the event.

,, Put up posters with the information about the application process and link to your webpage where people can find all the information.


Post the information about application process on Facebook.
Inform people on Twitter.
Publish the “call for application” on your webpage. The information should include a job description of each position, person specification, application deadline and date and place of the interviews.

, It is recommended that you create an email account dealing with applications (for example, applications@uc.sva.org), which would be forwarded to an SVA committee member on the recruitment committee, your Advisor and VAF Representative.

, After the application deadline, the recruitment committee meets and discusses all the applications and weeds out any that are not appropriate for an interview. The SVA club member on the committee then makes a schedule for interviews and invites the applicants (specifying the time for each of them). Afterwards, the SVA club member thanks and apologizes to those candidates who were not selected for an interview.

, The interviews should be led by one SVA leaving committee member, the Advisor and a VAF representative. Each interview will likely last for 20Z30 minutes.

, The recruitment committee emails the successful candidate for the President and offers him/her the role before AGM. The President is sworn to secrecy until the AGM.

, All other roles are announced at the AGM. This is to help develop excitement around attending the AGM and is in line with traditional ‘members vote for the committee’ club models. Also, the SVA committee member apologizes to those who didn’t succeed–no “thank you” emails.

, Post on Facebook at least twice each week. Post the web link to each newsletter. And ensure that at least one post each week is a project. These are usually best posted the day or two before the project is to take place. i.e. usually a Thursday night or Friday during the day.


Ensure each post has an accompanying photo or video.
On special holidays, events or if a disaster or event happens, the faster you post on Facebook, generally the more likes the post will get.
Cute animals, funny trend videos are the most liked posts, relevant quotes are also good.
Also post about events in the community that you think your followers will be interested in.

, Post these online asap after the project has taken place. Ask people to tag themselves. People like to promote the work they have done, it promote the work that is being completed as well as the page.

, Be appropriate in all posts, no swearing, there will be people of all religions and races that have liked the page.

, (It looks bad.)

, Regular updates of what’s happening around the office and with projects. Most people get these updates to their phone. It can be used more frequently than Facebook to update people on what you are doing, perhaps a morning tweet saying what projects are on that day, or events (such as awesome evenings) or any media coverage you have had. It could be used as a tool to keep the VAF/SVA on peoples minds constantly?

, Be passionate about your mission and projects! If you don’t believe your mission and projects neither will your potential sponsors. Try to arrange a personal meeting to further discuss the projects.

, Show your potential sponsors your plan and the value of your project(s).

,, Offer something in exchange for their money.

, You are offering an investment into the community.


An example of your approach: “I have come to you with an opportunity to assist in the solution of a community problem…”

, Once donors are pleased with the results of their contribution, partnership may evolve naturally.

,,, You need to identify early on, which needs can be filled with in‐kind contributions and which have to be filled with cash contributions. Approaching companies for cash donations versus in-­kind contributions requires a slightly different approach.

, However, the SVA logo must always be larger than the logo of your sponsors.

, Be sure to send them pictures of the event, highlighting their input and thanking them for their part in the project's success.

Become aware of individual risk factors.,
Provide encouragement and praise.,
Strengthen problem-solving skills.,
Offer support.,
Implement educational programs.,
Check your language.",How to Take Action to Prevent School Violence1," There are certain risk factors that may increase the likelihood of a young person becoming violent. By becoming aware of these risk factors, you can better recognize when a young person needs additional support, guidance, or therapy to prevent violent outcomes.These factors include:


A history of violent victimization
A history of early aggressive behavior
Low IQ
Poor behavioral control
Involvement with drugs or alcohol
Exposure to violence and conflict within the family;
, Rather than focusing on discipline, punishment, and negative reinforcement, put your efforts toward the positive. Praise good behavior, encourage individual growth, and work towards emphasizing positive attitudes., When you foster strong problem-solving skills, you give children the skills to handle all sorts of situations. By helping kids evaluate and identify problems (and brainstorm solutions), role-modeling good problem-solving behavior, and allowing for natural consequences you can encourage and strengthen problem-solving skills.Evaluating problems: When a problem occurs, help your child to identify it and think about ways it could be solved.
Role-modeling good problem-solving: Openly discuss strategies with your child. For example, if your child brings home a bad grade, don’t rush to punish them. Instead, talk with them about how you can work together to bring up the grade.
Allowing for natural consequences: Rather than always preventing negative consequences from affecting your kids, children will learn more if they experience the true consequences for their actions. For instance, if a teenager spends all of their money on the first thing they desire (and you refuse to give them more), they will learn the effect of blowing their money without thinking.

, Allow students the space to work out problems and conflicts on their own, but also be available to offer support when needed. Offer support for conflict resolution at home, and make sure there are additional resources for character building, conflict resolution, and psychological support in schools. Troubled individuals often have a history of social problems, and identifying and helping them resolve these issues can prevent school violence.

, Educational programs that focus on self-esteem, self-control, and strategies for solving conflicts without violent action can provide a positive influence. Such programs have been proven extremely effective in encouraging empathy and decreasing instances of violent activity. Advocate for the implementation of such programs in your school., The way that you speak has a profound effect on your children or students. If they hear you using pejorative language about women, for example, they will internalize the idea that women are “less than.” Check in with the way you speak about others, particularly marginalized groups, as well as your attitude toward violence.Whenever you discuss violence with children, you should be as honest as possible without disclosing graphic details. You should always emphasize that violence is not the answer.

"
"
Become aware of family risk factors.,
Talk openly.,
Understand the reasons for violence.,
Pay attention.,
Set clear boundaries and honor them.,
Recognize the warning signs.,
Keep firearms away from children and young adults.,
Know when to intervene.",How to Take Action to Prevent School Violence2," There are many factors that occur within the family unit that can increase the likelihood of a young person becoming violent. If you recognize these risk factors within your own family, you must work to change them. When you recognize these risk factors in another family, understand that the young people in that household may benefit from additional support, guidance, or therapy to prevent violent outcomes.These factors can include:


Highly authoritarian child-rearing attitudes
Lax, harsh, or very inconsistent boundaries and disciplinary practices
Low educational and income levels of parents
Parental substance abuse and criminality

, Create an atmosphere of open and honest communication with your children or students. Give them the space to work out their views, and encourage them to express their feelings, desires, hopes, and dreams. Spend time talking about interpersonal relationships and ask them to express the expectations they have for the relationships in their lives., Although there is never a simple or clear-cut answer for why an individual becomes violent, most violent actions (by both children and adults) occur for one or more of the following reasons. By better understanding these, you may be better equipped to talk down a violent person, or better yet, to stop violence before it starts.Expression: Many people use violence to express feelings of anger or frustration.
Manipulation: Violence is often used to control others.
Retaliation: Violence comes into play when someone wants to retaliate against someone who has hurt them, or to seek some kind of revenge.

, One crucial element to preventing school violence is simply to pay attention (which is far easier said than done). Even older kids need important and focused face-time with their parents and teachers, even if they don’t seem to desire or enjoy it. Just showing up for your children or students and investing time in getting to know their likes and dislikes can go far in reducing tendencies toward school violence., Children thrive when they understand the boundaries set for them. Conversely, if the rules and boundaries are always changing, this can cause stress in children and young adults. Whether you are a parent or educator, take some time to determine the boundaries you’d like to set. Then make these rules explicit and clear, and honor them. Outline the consequences for violating said boundaries, and honor these consequences too., Notice any sudden changes or disruptions in your child or student’s behavior. (You can best evaluate this if you are clear on what is “normal” for the child.) Such changes might include withdrawal from family or friends, no longer participating in sports or activities the child had seemed to enjoy, a drop in grades, trouble sleeping, trouble eating, lying, and/or chronic physical ailments (stomachache or headaches). These changes can indicate that something is really troubling your child. If you encounter these signs, begin by talking to your child and possibly seeking some outside help.Other more drastic (and more pressing) signs may include:


Engaging in risky activity, such as recreational drugs, tobacco, sex, alcohol.
Harboring a destructive mood; hurting animals, destroying property and/or making threats or bullying.
Obsessing on suicide and death; showing interest for weapons or violence in writing, drawing or conversations
Any of these may also be signs of anxiety, depression, or another mental health issue. If you notice several of these signs, it is likely best for that young person to get some help.

, A 2006 survey of gun-owning Americans with children showed that 21.7% stored a gun loaded, 31.5% stored a gun unlocked, and 8.3% stored one or more guns unlocked and loaded. Additionally, in households with teenagers (ages 13 to 17), firearms were left unlocked 41.7% of the time. One of the best way to prevent your child or adolescent from harming themselves or someone else with a firearm is to keep it locked in a safe, with an additional cable lock. Or better yet, to keep guns out of your home., If you are a parent or educator, it is important for you to be able to intervene when you notice a child exhibiting behavior that could potentially harm others. Do you know or have you heard of any students using threatening language? Have you seen or heard of anyone bringing weapons (or threatening to bring weapons) to school? If so, immediately report them to a school administrator or directly to the police, and encourage your children or students to do the same."
"
Get involved.,
Encourage young people to speak up.,
Understand the risks young people face.,
Teach the “Five C’s.” If a violent situation should arise in school, the “Five C’s” are a set of methods used to keep students safe and stop the violence.",How to Take Action to Prevent School Violence3," One of the best ways you can work to prevent violence in schools is getting involved. This may mean joining the PTA at your child’s school, coaching a sports team, or organizing a community event. The better you are able to get to know your child (as well as the other children around them), and build a sense of community, the less likely violence is to occur., You can help prevent violence in schools by encouraging young people to speak up when they see or hear something that’s not OK. Some students may not want to get involved, but explain that by conveying information through safe channels, they may be able to prevent a serious threat of violence., Children and young adults today face a number of stressors that many adults are not fully aware of. The pressures of social media, substance abuse, dating and sex, and bullying can weigh heavily on young people. The pressure to succeed in school can also overwhelm young people. Becoming aware of the sources of stress in the lives of your children or students can make you a better advocate and source of support when they need you., Memorizing this acronym and teaching it to students can both work to prevent violence, and create a plan of action should violence unfortunately occur. The “Five C’s” are:


Calmness: No matter what, attempt to remain calm and clear-headed.
Cover: Seek something to hide behind or under to decrease your chances of being injured
Common sense and instincts: Move away from the shooter, windows, and doors. Use your common sense and instincts to stay safe.
Creativity: Try thinking of something that hasn’t been done before, such putting soap on the floor to trip the assailant.
Cellphone or landline phone: Get to a phone and call Emergency Services.

Decide what sort of work you find meaningful.,
Consider your skill set, and what kind of work you can help do.,
Make a list of locations you would like to visit or help.,
Determine how long you are willing to volunteer and how much money you can spend.,
Use targeted, specific searches to find programs you like.,
Verify the full cost of a program before paying.,
Talk to someone in the organization who has either done the trip or is currently working.",How to Volunteer Abroad1," Is there a specific cause or location that you feel passionate about helping? Do you love working with children, or do you want to do a broader sort of volunteer work, like helping at a medical clinic? Some potential work you can volunteer for includes:


Teaching.
Building schools, clinics, wells, etc.
Farming.
Social work, such as helping at a refugee camp or urban poverty center.
Clean up/repair, especially after a disaster.;
, Would you, for example, like to help build a school? Would you like to volunteer at a refugee camp? Different workplaces require different skills. If you would like to work as a teacher, you might need to be able to speak the language of the country you are going to (or know some basic phrases). If you want to help at a building site, you would help to have some building or carpentry skills. Remember, you are going over to help -- you don't want to have someone spending all of their time teaching you when you should be volunteering.


This doesn't mean that you need to be an expert before going over. However, having some knowledge of the work you are doing can help you feel a sense of purpose, instead of confusion, when you arrive.

, While your primary reason for volunteering should be a desire to help someone in need, you do not want to go to a place you feel uncomfortable or unhappy. Having an interest in a culture or country will help you dive into the experience and find the best way to help those you've come to help. Ask yourself a few questions as you choose places to volunteer:


Do I have any experience with the language? Is English common?
Do I want to go there as a vacation, or do I want to do some good?
Am I interested in this culture? Am I willing to immerse myself in order to learn more about it?
Are there any health or safety concerns I should be worried about?

, There is a variety of programs that need volunteers throughout the year. Some cost money and provide room and board. Others are free but don't provide lodging. Still others provide everything you need in exchange for volunteer work. The biggest determining factor in cost is the length of volunteering:



Short stays, between 1-2 weeks, are usually expensive. You pay for airfare as well as a program fee. Oftentimes you have designated activities as well, allowing you to tour the country as well as volunteer. This, of course, comes with a higher cost-- between $1-2000 a week.

Mid-length stays, between 1-2 months, have variable costs. You could contact an agency directly (such as a hospital in southeast Asia) and simply start working, paying for your own food and lodging. Or you could sign up for a program through a volunteer company, which may or may not charge a program fee, but usually costs less per week than a short stay

Long-term stays, or anything over 3 months, often require nothing more than transportation costs. There is usually some form of commitment (an agreement to stay X number of months), but you can volunteer ""for free"" once you arrive, as room and board are included., There are thousands of programs out there, and searching online for ""volunteering in Africa"" will result in a flood of different options. Instead, use your skills, desires, and logistics to search for specific programs online. A search for ""Short-term orphanage volunteer in South Africa"" will get you right to the programs you want to see, for example.


If you're looking to volunteer without a program you'll need to do a bit more digging. Try and contact the organizations you are interested in, such as schools, hospitals, or shelters, and ask them if they take volunteers. Many will be happy for the work, and may be able to help with lodging or food costs.

, Not all programs are created equally. Make sure that you know the exact ""benefits"" your program offers, from paid meals to medical options should you get sick. Check for testimonials online, and research their work and company history. Some groups are more effective than others, and you don't want red tape and low resources keeping you from doing the work that you want to do. Likewise, you don't want any hidden fees to get you later on, like having to pay for meals when yo expected them for free.

, Get in touch with someone on the ground, or someone with experience, to get the full details on the experience. You should ask what to expect, if they found the trip fulfilling, and their general attitude towards the work. The story advertised on the website may be very different from the one on the ground, and you should investigate before writing a check.


Make sure the group spends its money wisely by looking into old projects. Try and contact old volunteers for their opinions of the company. Many companies have a ""testimonials"" page, and you can contact them asking to speak to someone if they do not.
Get in touch with the organization and ask any questions you might have. If they do not answer back in a timely manner they may not be the best group to work with."

You may even want to draft a mission statement for your organization. Make a list of ten goals for your community center. If your community center is targeting a certain population (such as the local LGBT community or single mothers), you should include that information in your goals. Some examples of goals include:


Create a safe space for the community to gather while providing a venue for the improvement of the community.
Provide support and resources to unemployed members of the community through classes, workshops, and job fairs.
Give legal aid to the local immigrant community.;
, A community center should help fulfill certain needs and and demands of the community. To do this, you will first need to identify what those needs are. Create a list of areas that need improvement in your local area.Some common problems that communities face include:


High unemployment
Pollution
Obesity
Lack of green space
Safety issues
Low literacy rates
High rates of alcoholism or drug abuse

, Even if your community suffers from certain prevalent problems, it undoubtedly has certain strengths as well. For your community center to be successful, you should try to determine what those strengths are so that you can build upon them.You might consider:


How well does your community rally around a common cause?
Does your community have certain traditions that bring them together?
What kinds of networks exist in your community? This includes religious groups, sports teams, businesses, non-profit organizations, and clubs.
What types of skills do the members of your community have? Who can you rely upon during the process of starting your community center?

, You will need to decide what specific services you want to offer your community. These services should appeal to both the goals you have set for your center as well as the needs and strengths of the community. Some types of services you might consider include:


Adult education classes
Legal aid
Exercise programs
Community events such as movie screenings, festivals, or dances
Support groups

, While you do not need to decide on a specific location yet, you should begin brainstorming sites where you might potentially operate your community center. You will also want to think about what kind of facilities or positions you will need. Some questions you should consider:


Will the community center require staff? If so, what positions might be required?
What kind of building will it need? Will it need an outdoor area for a garden or sports?
What kind of equipment will it need?
How will the center support itself financially? Will it depend solely on donations? Will it charge for classes and events?

, You will need to have a rough estimate of how much the community center will cost. This includes start-up costs, building costs, the cost of services (such as classes), and running costs. To form your budget, contact other non-profits in your area to ask about how much their services cost per month. Compare that with what you want to offer to the community. Consider:


What is the average property cost in your area? How much will it cost to buy or rent a building?
How much will it cost to offer certain services, such as classes, to the public?
How much will it cost to fundraise? This includes the cost of events, mailing campaigns, and advertising fees.
What kind of equipment will you need? Is there any special type of technology that you will need to invest in?

, Early in your planning process, you should identify who in your community might be willing to donate money.Call these groups on the phone, and ask if someone would be willing to meet to discuss your community center. You can contact:


Local businesses
Sports leagues
Corporate foundations
Religious groups
Charities
Media organizations
Professional networks
Philanthropists, You may be eligible for funding from the government. Typically, you will have to prove that you are providing an essential service to the community. You can search for funding opportunities on your government's website. You may also contact your local government to ask them about what kinds of resources might be available to you.


In the US, you can search for funding on the Catalog for Federal Domestic Assistance.If you are offering services to a certain population, you may qualify for different types of funding.
The USDA offers loans to help rural areas develop community facilities under their Community Facilities Direct Loan & Grant Program.In the UK, you should contact your local council for information on community funding schemes. Gov.uk offers a tool to help you locate nearby resources.In Australia, your community center may qualify for government funding under the Community Development Grants Programme.The Canadian government offers a listing of funding options on their website., You can get donations from the public by sending out mass solicitations that ask for small amounts from each donor. This will help you rally public support while building a strong financial base. There are many ways that you can do this. They include:


Mailing solicitations for donations
Telephone campaigns
Media coverage on the news, radio, or in newspapers
Door to door fundraising, A good way to get larger donations is to host an event where people pay to enter. The profit would go towards your community center. Fundraisers should be budgeted very carefully to make sure that you are earning money from the venture. Form a committee for this event. You might even want to find a corporate sponsor to help defray the costs.Some ideas for events include:


Gala dinner where participants pay by the plate
Music event with ticket sales benefiting the community center
Outdoor movie screening
Wine or beer tasting event

, You should have your supporters sign a petition supporting your community center. On this petition, they should include their names and email addresses. You can present this petition to potential donors and politicians to demonstrate the interest in your project. You can also use it to form a mailing list to inform members about your progress.


You can have volunteers stand outside of shopping centers to ask pedestrians to sign.
You can also take names and email addresses from any mailing campaigns that you might have started.
You may be able to pass around a petition at a community meeting, such as a town hall meeting, PTA meeting, or a local society meeting.

, You should try to gather some support from your local government. Contact local city councilors, managers, and the mayor. Let them know about your plans to start a new community center, and ask them if they could provide any support. They might be able to designate some funding to help with your center, or they might be able to help you advertise the center to the community at large., Once you have found a few supporters, you can bring your idea to the town. Host a public meeting in a central space where community members can come and listen to your pitch. You may invite donors, policymakers, and the local media to attend. During this meeting, you should present your mission. At the end, allow members of the audience to provide their own ideas and suggestions.Good places to hold meetings include schools, houses of worship, or a government building such as the town hall. Call ahead to reserve a room.
At the beginning of the meeting, clearly outline your goals for the evening. Have multiple speakers present the different aspects of the community center, such as financial backing, potential services to the public, and government support.
You can use this meeting to solicit donations from the public.

, Your community center needs a set of bylaws that will list the rules and procedures of your organization. These bylaws must follow state and federal laws regarding nonprofit organizations. The bylaws should clarify how your organization’s internal structure will operate.Your charter of bylaws should be broken up into different articles that include:



Name: What name is your organization known as legally?

Purpose: What does your center do? What is its aim? What types of services does it provide? This is where you should list your center’s tax status.

Board of Directors: Who runs the community center? What powers does the board of directors have? How are directors elected or appointed to their position? How can directors be removed from their position?

Finances: How do you manage the finances of your community center? Who has access to its funds?
You may also want to include policies on how the center will share information with the public, how records are stored and kept, and how meetings will be conducted., You will need a physical location to house your community center. This should be in a place that is easily accessible to the community members that you want to reach.While you can buy your own building, it may be cheaper to rent a place while you get off the ground.


If you are providing one on one support to your community members, you may want a building with smaller offices where consultants can meet privately with people.
If you are looking to host events, you will need at least one large room to hold people.

, You can gain tax-exempt status if your community center is a non-profit organization that fulfills a local community need. Depending on the services you offer, you might be classified as either a private foundation or public charity. You should consult a tax attorney for help throughout this process.


If you are in the United States, you will need to submit Form 1023 to the IRS.You should request an Employer Identification Number for your center through Form SS-4.As a non-profit, you will be obligated to disclose your tax records to the public if requested.
In the UK, you must register with the Charity Commission and with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). You can register with the HMRC online.In Australia, you should register with the Australian Tax Office, where you will need to apply for a Australian Business Number (ABN). You may need to pay certain taxes such as the goods and services tax or the fringe benefits tax., Once you have started your community center, you just need to make sure that people come. You may even decide to have an opening event, such as a big dinner, to welcome members of the community to their new home. You can advertise by:


Posting an announcement in a newspaper
Contacting the local TV station
Putting up flyers
Mailing announcements

Contact your chosen program about flight times.,
Understand and plan for any ""hidden"" fees.,
Get your passport 4-6 months in advance.,
Get a visa for the country you're traveling too.,
Check with a travel doctor to get the necessary shots and vaccinations.,
Make, check, and double-check a travel checklist.,
Prepare yourself mentally.",How to Volunteer Abroad2," Most programs require that you book flights at specific times so that they can pick you up. Before buying any tickets, forward your potential flight information to the program and ask if this will work for them.


Depending on your program, how rural it is, or natural disasters, you may want to seriously consider flight insurance. Pick-ups and logistics can be very fluid in 3rd world countries.

, While this will change from country to country and program to program, you need to be prepared to fund yourself while you are abroad. Talk to the program about potential costs, from food and clean water to toiletries, and make sure you have enough money to live comfortably and safely. It is usually a good idea to have two times your projected expenses ready, in the case of an emergency.Call your bank and let them know that you are leaving the country. When foreign charges show up, many banks assume it is a scam/stolen card and suspends your account, locking you out of your money.

, You want to be sure that your passport is ready to go well in advance, as you'll need it to get a visa. This also gives you time to fix any mistakes or deal with any issues long before you're ready to fly off.

, There are some countries that don't require a visa, and some that only require them for longer stays, but you need to be sure if you need one or not. Many countries require different visas depending on how long you stay and the work you're doing. Before buying a ticket, check out the US State Department's database on travel restrictions for every country and follow their procedures for getting the appropriate visa.


Visas are provided by the country you are going to visit. So, to get a visa to go to Senegal, you need to contact the Senegalese Embassy or Consulate.
You may be required to visit an embassy, get fingerprinted, and/or have proof of immunization before getting a visa., These change from country to country, and they can get expensive. They also require several weeks to set in, and some need to be re-administered before you leave, so be sure to talk to you doctor as soon as you know where you are going. This should be planned 3-6 months in advance of leaving.

, Again, this will change depending on where you are going. Most programs will provide you with a checklist, letting you know the equipment you need to have when traveling. Pack as lightly as possible for easy travel and to decrease the risk of theft, and make sure, above all else, that you have all of your documents (passports, visas, tickets) packed. Some general advice includes:


Photocopy all relevant documents so you have a copy if something is lost.
Bring extra chargers, wall adapters, and batteries for any crucial electronics.
Check the US State Department's country by country list of travel warnings before leaving., Just as important as physical preparation, mentally preparing yourself for the journey to come will make everything easier. Volunteering abroad is not easy, and you need to be able to roll with the punches as the come. Things will go wrong, you will get homesick, and you will get lost, both literally and figuratively. The best way to avoid and manage these problems is to leave your sense of expectations at home -- be ready for surprises, and be ready to learn as much about yourself as the culture you are entering.



Flexibility - can you deal with constantly changing plans/projects?

Patience - can you cope with delays and frustrating procedures?

Humility - are you able to do the things that are ""beneath"" your skills and training without a grumble? Can you adapt your usual standard of living to something new and different?

Openness - are you able to deal with cultural differences and are your views of the world open?

Reliability - are you someone others can depend on? Are you punctual?

Sense of humor -- things aren't always going to go well, and that's okay. Being able to laugh at the weird little pitfalls will make them easier to clear up.

Take initiative when you arrive.,
Be adaptable.,
Stay energetic and enthusiastic.,
Immerse yourself in the local culture.,
Be selfless.,
Take the time to enjoy your trip.",How to Volunteer Abroad3," Many volunteer organizations, especially smaller ones, do not have the resources to run smoothly. You may arrive and get the directions, ""Go teach that group of children math,"" but little else. You need to be ready to be your own boss to a certain extent. You are there to make a difference, but you'll need to be confident in yourself to do so.


Try and be results driven -- you are there to make a difference, so make a difference. Trust your gut and push forward, doing everything to make things better for these people, not for yourself.Feel free to ask questions if you are confused, but do your best to work on your own. Small, underfunded operations cannot waste time telling you what to do at all times -- they need to trust that you'll get things done., Things are not going to go well all the time. The best volunteers are flexible and can adapt to new situations in the blink of an eye. Remember that you are there to volunteer -- to help out other people. You are not there on vacation, and no one ""owes you"" anything. So be ready for changes of plans and potentially doing different work than you expected. It makes everyone's life, including your own, much easier., There are going to be times when the work is tough, grueling, and even heartbreaking. Volunteering is not easy, and that's okay. But you need to do your best to stay positive and optimistic. It not only helps you cope with struggle, it shows your co-workers and the people you are working with that things will get better. It lifts everyone's spirits and makes the work easier and more effective.


Remember that, while this may be hard for you, the people you help often go through these hardships every single day. They don't ask for pity, and neither should you., Do not go to a country and expect people to behave the way people behave in your home country. This may sound obvious, but some volunteers come with a close minded attitude. They might avoid local food, only going to western-style places and bars, and look down on or pity the people in the country. This hurts everyone because it puts up a barrier between you and the people you want to help.


Go for walks through town and introduce yourself to people you meet.
Ask host-families or support to teach you things you don't understand like recipes, music, or games.
Make learning a priority -- whether it is a routine, skill, or language, you should aim to become a sponge of local culture and knowledge.
Avoid hanging out with only people ""like you."" Make an effort to encounter all walks of life.

, If you remember that you are there to help others, not yourself, you will be a good volunteer. At the end of the day, volunteering is about making a sacrifice (of your time, money, skills, etc.) to help someone else in need. If you are trying your best to help someone out, putting their needs before yourself for a few days, weeks, or months, you will be a good volunteer., Don't feel like you need to work the entire time you're there. Instead, use your time to immerse yourself in the local culture, take pictures, meet friends, and let people back home know how you're doing. Make the most of the experience by making it yours. While you are not there to be a tourist, you are there to make a meaningful impact on the people you help and yourself. Some good ideas to help make the most of your trip include:


Make 1-2 local friends and exchange contact information. Be sure to stay in touch.
Start a blog or email correspondence to share stories and news with friends and family back home.
Write a journal or shoot a photo diary, documenting your stay so that you can look back and enjoy it later.
Find a project, person, or task that you are passionate about while you are there and make it the very best you possibly can.
Take some time to reflect on the experience afterward -- how have you changed? What did you learn?"
"
Find a training area.,
Recruit some officers.,
Create a rank system.,
Create a uniform.,
Create facilities.,
Get some troops.,
Get weapons (EXTREMELY optional).,
Train your troops.,
Have demonstrations.",How to Start a Paramilitary Organization," All paramilitary groups need a place to train their troops. It could be your backyard or a giant 100 acre field, as long as you own it. A good training area is secluded, spacious, and flat.;
, You need officers to help train and command your troops. However, they must be just as skilled as enlisted ranks. Your officers should have good leadership ability, as your enlisted usually seek them out for advice. They can help with the next few steps.

, You need to have a rank system so that troops can easily identify each other. Make sure to create insignia for them. You can use existing (e.g. private, sergeant, major, general) or make your own.

, Unless you want your group to be a mismatched group of misfits, you need to create a good looking uniform. A good uniform blends, looks sharp and neat, and has areas for certain badges and medals. Your may also want a utility uniform for maneuvers and ""combat."" Make sure that it is dark and has plenty of storage for gear.

, Now that you have the organization almost down, you need to have some basic facilities. You don't have to spend a fortune. It can be tape outlining a training ground. It might be nice to have an office for high ranks though. If you want to go all out, create a defensible compound with a fence and drill yard.

, Can't have a paramilitary group without troops. You can start by recruiting your friends, then move on to fliers. A good number of troops would be 15-35, enough to garrison your facilities and still have a field operation force.

, It is best recommended not to support ordering (legal) weapons in bulk for your troops, but if you want to go all out and look like a real military, make sure that your weapons are legal. Obtaining licenses for handguns or shotguns is recommended if you really want to arm your troops. For ceremonial purposes, maybe buy some legal, bolt-action rifles and teach your troops to drill with them.

, Having a full faculty is pointless without training. Have your officers drill the troops every day they are there. Have an appointed time for them to come for training. Make sure you train your force to be proficient with their firearms, perform drills and marches, be able to operate in wilderness environments, and be secretive. Martial Arts is a nice training skill, as it helps with discipline and strength.

, Now that you have, more or less, a functioning paramilitary group, send out fliers saying that you will be having a public demonstration of your group. This is where your drill and crisp uniforms come in handy. Make sure to make it clear that you are not trying to take over the world, but protect your community or area.

Imagine that a comprehensive, local food system is possible.,
Include every local food source as a contributor to the overall, local food supply.,
Plant a Mittleider Garden.,
Schedule an educational program about developing a local food supply at your church, local club, school or any other public venue.,
Identify the obstacles to developing a local food system.,
Avoid politicizing anything that has to do with local food production.,
Keep it simple.,
Come up with a system that works with supermarkets, not against them.,
Try your best to understand how food is distributed to your local supermarkets.,
Check out the best local food system in America.",How to Start Your Own Local Food Movement," Without dreaming it up, it can't become a reality. Conceptualizing what a local food system would be like is key to bringing it into existence. Leave nothing out of the plan: Think big, think small, think of the impossible and think of the easy steps that will lead to reaching the goal.;
, Organic, non-organic, grass fed, corn fed, raised in a greenhouse, grown in raised beds, processed, not processed - if it contributes to the amount of local food produced, then it should be counted as a legitimate ""food asset"" for the local food system.

, The Mittleider Gardening Technique can be found online at http://www.FoodForEveryone.org. It is a non-profit, educational foundation that shows people how to raise 500% more produce in raised beds that are 30' X 5'. The soil is enriched with minerals and ready to go the first season of planting. Tomatoes raised this way average out to $0.05 per pound. It is a proven garden technique used around the world.

, The key to establishing a workable food system is to provide access for others to learn about how to become more involved in raising their own food. Awareness is the key. No sustainable living concept has ever succeeded without educational materials and resources provided for free to the general public.

, I always hear from others that if they only had enough money to start a greenhouse or a small acre farm, that they would go ahead and do it. But if we all wait around for money before doing the background work necessary to build a local food system, then we will not be prepared to put the system together if and when the financial backing arrives. Yes, it takes hard work to develop a local food supply, but it can be done in small steps before any money has to be invested in seeds, greenhouses, equipment, grow beds, livestock and supplies.

, This is America. People can choose what they want to eat. They can also educate themselves about the nutritional value of food and the various farming methods. The information is available for free on the internet. Keep the message simple: Local food is fun, it tastes good and it supports the local economy. Focus on the benefits of increasing the local food supply., There are local food systems in America that use the internet to help people order local food. What's the point? If it's local, then it should be face-to-face, personal and a community effort. We don't need an online ordering process to find a cucumber from the next town over. It's better to know the grower and buy directly from them.

, Supermarket chains are run by local people who make decisions for their stores every day. Some of these companies are willing to work with local growers to sell their produce at their stores. Some of these companies are even partnering with local growers.

, Where does the food come from? Are there some foods that local supermarkets would be better off purchasing from local suppliers? Is it possible to raise those foods all year long and supplement what the supermarkets offer? Can you identify ten foods that your local supermarkets would rather purchase from local producers?

, It is called the Willamette Farm & Food Coalition. Located in Lane County, Oregon, this local system started over thirty years ago and continues to impress locals and visitors. Here is their local grown food guide, accessible online at: http://www.lanefood.org/locally-grown.php

, Many people call companies for nutrition information and common questions are often answered in the FAQ area of the company's official website.

, If you are trying to find out about the cheese in a product, like frozen pizza, you may have to call the company and ask for information about their cheese distributor. Not all companies make their own cheese and they may not be the best source of specific nutrition details.

, The common person doesn't know a lot about the science of food, so you may have to explain your question to the person you contact or ask for someone in the company's nutrition or development department.

, Once you find out which cheese brands are vegetarian and which are not, help yourself to a few samples. It will be easier to avoid cheese that isn't vegetarian if you find a delicious alternative source.

Expect curiosity.,
Do your research.,
Stay calm when you do come across the provocative types.,
Have forbearance.,
Avoid giving a sermon or giving the impression that your choice is superior.,
Understand that some people will simply never agree with you, or even support your decision.",How to Explain a Decision to Become a Vegetarian," People are often genuinely interested to learn how you can manage without eating foods that they take for granted, enjoy and eat daily. Some of this curiosity relates to wondering how you substitute meat, find enough calories, make substantial meals and the like. It's a curiosity born of not knowing, and this is a chance for you to politely explain what you do in response to such questions. Treat the curiosity with goodwill until you get indications to the contrary; while some people will be aiming to argue with you about your choice, a lot of people simply wish to be informed.;
, If you have decided to become a vegetarian but have done no research into where you will get your protein and iron from, prepare for an onslaught of negative reactions. It is important to have at least a few basics of vegetarian health 101 to rattle off until the conversation seems sufficiently dull to change the topic. However, don't buy into justifying what you're doing or eating too much. You can politely ask if the person questioning your diet has a perfect diet and if he or she would appreciate having to justify his or her intake of adequate nutrition down to the nth degree.


Remember to tell such persons that there is plenty of protein in plants. If there is a misunderstanding that plants are spineless weedy things with a few vitamins, some good roughage and not much else, you can reassure such people that there is a lot of protein in vegetable matter.

, Don't bite, just be polite. There will always be those persons with a predilection for arguing, who love to trot out how you're going to die from a lack of all sorts of vitamins, proteins and life-sustaining goodies that they've read about in passing magazine articles. While it is tempting to ask them just when they got their nutrition qualifications and whether they have signs of the diseases attributed to over-consumption of fatty meat products, try your best to remain stoic. It's most likely that they're set in their preferred take on this, no matter what you say and if they like arguing, it'll just go on and on. Great ways to fob off the annoying grilling include:


Reply with genuine interest: ""That's interesting, I've not heard that before, perhaps you know of the scientific journal that is published in so that I may research it further?"" Or, ""Yes, I've heard that several times before, so I looked it up, and the answer is actually X, Y, Z, according the the Harvard-Yale study done in 2012. It's very interesting actually, perhaps you'd care to hear more?""
Inform them that you feel great, you are currently very healthy but that you accept that anything can happen to anyone and you're not about to insist that your diet is superior to anybody else's; however, it works for you and for now, that's all that matters.
Say that you'd love to discuss it in greater depth but that presently you're starving and need to eat. Then tuck into your food and wave off more talk with gestures at your full mouth. This one is great for mealtimes because this is most often when your dietary choice gets thrashed out in morbid detail, right at the point they have visual evidence of your non-meat dish. With any luck, the conversation will have moved on after the meal has been eaten.

, You will be asked, time and time again, ""What made you become a vegetarian?"". Try to be clear about what motivated your choice, whether it be for health or ethical reasons, or maybe you just don't like meat. You may tire of repeating yourself over and over again, but remember that not everyone is asking you because they disagree with vegetarianism––maybe some are thinking of making the switch themselves, but are looking for a compelling argument! The trick is to get the balance right between being educational and not preachy.


If someone is wanting to pick apart your personal decision, answer briefly with your reasons, then don't entertain further discussion; if the person keeps picking at the issue, explain that you feel you've answered it sufficiently and that you've nothing more to say on the topic. Then change the subject.

, Nobody likes to be made to feel like they're wrong. Explaining to a carnivore why you're a vegetarian should never be done in an accusatory, angry fashion; just as you have made the choice to be meat-free, they have made the choice to eat meat. Everyone has the ability to decide to eat what they feel is right for them, so attempting to convert hard-core meat eaters to your new way of life is a sure way to discredit your new way of thinking, at least in their eyes. It is also the wrong way to go about explaining your own decision, as it's defensive. Far better to demonstrate that it is what it is, a choice that you're happy with and a conviction that it's right for you.

, That's okay - you are doing this for yourself, your health, and the earth. You can't please everyone, nor should you even try. Moreover, it isn't a case of having to justify your choice against theirs––both of you eat differently, both of you have reasons for this and you don't need the validation of anyone else of your dietary choice.

Drain your tofu.,
Prep your veggies and cilantro.,
Saute the veggies.,
Add your coriander and cumin.,
Add the tofu, turmeric, and beans.,
Garnish, season, and serve.",How to Make a High Protein Vegetarian Breakfast2," Layer a few sheets of paper towels on top of a plate. Remove the blocks of tofu from their packaging and water. Place them on the plate. Then press them to force out any excess water.With many tofu recipes, the more excess water you can get rid of, the better. However, since the tofu here is substituting eggs (which can be pretty moist), how much liquid you want to retain is entirely up to you.
Alternately, you could use either a colander or wire rack in or over the sink instead of a plate and paper towels.

, For now, let the tofu continue to sit on the plate (or your wire rack or colander). While it drains some more, chop your onion into bite-size pieces. Do the same with your peppers. Then chop or tear up your cilantro leaves.If using paper towels and plate for your tofu, you may want to add some fresh towels before chopping your veggies if the originals have been soaked through.

, Coat the bottom of a large skillet with your vegetable oil. Turn the heat to medium-high. Once the oil heats up, place the onion and peppers in the skillet. Saute for three or four minutes, stirring occasionally., Dump them on top of your veggies in the skillet. Then stir everything up until they coat the veggies evenly. Give them roughly a minute to cook, or until fragrant., Break the tofu up into chunks and add them to the skillet. Mash the tofu into smaller pieces with your stirring spoon, then stir in the turmeric until the white tofu turns yellow. Add the beans and stir frequently while they cook. Remove from heat once everything is heated through.If the tofu has been drained pretty thoroughly, it should only take a couple of minutes to cook. If it still has a lot of water in it, you may want to cook it for longer so the excess moisture can reduce.
If desired, mash the tofu up with a fork or potato masher in a bowl before adding it to the pan. But even “extra-firm” tofu is pretty soft, so mash it in the skillet with your stirring spoon if you want fewer dishes to wash.

, Add the cilantro to the skillet and stir it in. Do the same with salt and pepper as desired. Then serve right away while it’s still hot.Tofu scramble can be served as is with a plate or fork, or you can use it to make sandwiches or breakfast burritos.
You can also garnish it further with scallions, avocado, cheese, and/or hot pepper sauce.

Then mist the foil with a nonstick cooking spray.You’re going to be making a seitan loaf, which will then be wrapped in the foil. So don’t worry about tucking or folding the edges of the foil over to the rim to secure it. Just make sure the bottom of the pan is totally covered.

Then knead the dough for a few minutes, or until its consistency turns both uniform and smooth. If needed, transfer to a cutting board or similar surface to sculpt it into a loaf that will fit in your pan.It doesn’t need to be exact, but an ideal size for your loaf is 7 inches long, 4 wide, and 2 high (18 x 10 x 5 cm).

, First, place your loaf in the pan. Then, in a mixing bowl, combine your ground black pepper with your remaining teaspoon of smoked salt, tablespoon of maple syrup, and 1.5 teaspoon of liquid smoke. Whisk until combined. Then pour the glaze over your dough and brush it over the top of your loaf, if needed, to cover it evenly., Fold the loose ends of the aluminum foil over your loaf. Seal it tightly. Make sure there aren’t any gaps where the liquid can escape. Prevent the glaze and juices from leaking, smoking, and burning., Place the pan in the oven. Bake for 40 minutes. Then take the pan out and set it on a safe surface. Let it sit and cool until it is safe to touch., Once it’s cooled off, transfer the loaf to a cutting board.

Watch for added sugar.,
Avoid white grains.,
Reduce the amount of processed food you eat.,
Include eggs in your diet.,
Eat dairy products as a source of protein.,
Add fatty foods to your diet.,
Use soy supplements.,
Reduce your carbohydrate intake.,
Add carbohydrates back into your diet.,
Determine your personal carbohydrate tolerance.,
Talk with your doctor or nutritionist.",How to Follow a Low Carb Vegetarian Diet," Many vegetarians do not realize how much added sugar (i.e. refined carbohydrates) they are consuming. This is because food manufacturers add sugar to almost everything, including soy-based products, beverages, yogurt, and salad dressings. In order to reduce the amount of carbohydrates and added sugars in your diet, you should read nutrition labels carefully.Look for words that end with ""ose"" to detect added sugars. For example, added sugars can appear as fructose or lactose, which are natural sugars that usually come in small doses and are easy to identify on food labels.Some added sugars will be harder to detect than others and may even appear to be healthy. For example, organic brown rice syrup, barley malt syrup, and agave nectar are all types of added sugars that are essentially refined carbohydrates and should be avoided.;
, Not all carbohydrates are considered “bad” and cause weight gain or increase blood sugar. A certain amount of carbohydrates are actually recommended because this is one of the best sources of energy for your body. Refined carbohydrates, however, should be avoided. This is often considered the “no white foods” strategy. Eliminate or significantly reduce all sugar, white flour, white rice, white pasta, as well as potatoes from your diet.Refined carbohydrates are created when whole plants, such as grain, are stripped of all nutrients but the easily digestible carbohydrate.The majority of fiber and nutrient in the plant is removed, leaving only refined sugar or refined starch., Processed foods contain refined sugars and refined starches and, therefore, are high in carbohydrates. These foods are typically those that are found in boxes or bags at the grocery store. For example, cereals, breads, pastries, cookies, crackers, and muffins are all considered processed foods that contain refined carbohydrates.Try steel-cut oatmeal instead of boxed cereal for breakfast.Make homemade baked goods, such as muffins and cookies, so that you can control the ingredients being used.

, Many vegetarians rely on whole grains as a major source of protein in their diet. This is not possible if you are trying to follow a low carb vegetarian diet because whole grains contain carbohydrates that are easily digested and broken down into glucose. Eggs only contain trace amounts of carbohydrates and provide an excellent source of protein for vegetarians. They also contain nutrients that can not be found in plant foods, such as vitamin B12.Try omega 3-enriched or free range eggs, if possible, for the healthiest option.
Add eggs to your diet by making an omelette with fresh vegetables for breakfast. For lunches and dinners you could try eating a vegetable quiche or a salad with hard boiled eggs.
There are multiple ways to include eggs in your diet. Search online for low carb vegetarian recipes with eggs.

, Dairy products, such as yogurt, cheese, and milk are also high in protein and low in carbohydrates making them perfect for individuals following a low carb vegetarian diet.Try yogurt mixed with fruit and nuts or seeds for breakfast, a cheesy cauliflower bake for lunch, or a chili with beans, sour cream and cheese for dinner., As you reduce the amount of carbohydrates in your diet, you will need to add fat. This is because carbohydrates are a major source of energy in your diet and can be replaced by consuming protein and fats. Fat is most easily obtained by eating meat, however, there are a variety of vegetarian foods that contain fat. Try out these low carb and high fat vegetarian foods:Avocado.
Olive oil.
Nuts.
Flax and chia seeds.
Coconut.

, Soy-based foods are an excellent source of protein and can be used by both vegetarians and vegans who are looking to reduce their carbohydrate intake. Make sure that you read the labels on soy-based products carefully to ensure that they do not contain refined sugars.Make a veggie and tofu stir fry with whole grain rice or quinoa.
Try rolled oats with soy milk for breakfast.

, Each individual has a different carbohydrate tolerance level. For example, as you age you may find that your carbohydrate tolerance decreases and you have a greater blood glucose response to carbohydrates. In order to find your optimal carbohydrate tolerance, you should begin by drastically reducing the amount of carbohydrates that you consume.Optimally you should reduce your carb intake to about 30-40 grams per day., Once you have significantly reduced your carbohydrate intake begin to slowly add carbohydrates back into your diet. Some people will respond better when you add starches first and other will feel better when sugars are added first. Monitor how your body responds. Continue to add carbohydrates until you begin to notice adverse side effects, such as:Weight loss stops.
Weight gain takes place.
Carb cravings begin.
Blood glucose control diminishes.
Poor concentration and/or low energy levels.
High blood pressure.

, As soon as you begin to notice one of the adverse side effects, you should reduce the amount of carbohydrates you ingest until you begin to feel healthy again. At this point, measure the amount of carbohydrates you are consuming in grams in order to determine your personal carbohydrate tolerance., If you are drastically changing your diet in order to cut down on carbohydrates and meats, you should talk with a doctor or nutritionist to make sure that you are receiving all of the vitamins and nutrients necessary for a well-balanced diet. For example, they may recommend taking vitamin and mineral supplements to ensure that you do not develop any nutrient deficiencies.


It is always a good idea to speak with your doctor about your diet, especially if you are experiencing low energy levels, high blood pressure, or severe weight fluctuations.

Expect some flops and some successes, and be ready to tweak as you learn.",How to Find Gelatin Substitutes for Vegetarians," Agar agar is a traditional substitute for gelatin in many recipes and basically it substitutes at a ratio of an equal amount of agar agar for gelatin when substituting like for like (that is powdered for powdered, etc).One tablespoon of powdered agar agar can be used in place of one tablespoon of powdered gelatin.The granulated form of agar agar is twice as strong as the flaked form, while the powdered form is three times as strong.Follow the instructions for activating agar agar with great care. It does not set at the same temperatures as gelatin, hence people tend to assume it doesn't work. However, it does, provided it is handled correctly. For example, agar agar requires a rapid boil and not a mere simmer in order to activate when added to a recipe requiring heating.And, agar agar gels at room temperature when gelatin requires chilling.Soak agar agar first for 10 minutes in the liquid it is to be cooked in. This makes it easier to dissolve.2 tablespoons of powder, 1 tablespoon of flakes to 600ml (1 pint) of liquid will produce a firm jelly.;
, This won't set as hard as agar agar but it can still be used for liquid setting. One ounce of dried carrageenan will set one cup of liquid.It is also a great gelling agent for a light, delicately balanced jelly or blancmange.To use dried carrageen, rinse it carefully and soak it in water to make it swell. Add it to the liquid to be set. Boil the liquid for 10 minutes, then strain out the carrageenan., Kuzu is used as a thickener in Japan. To use, add around 1 1/2 tablespoons of kuzu to each cup of liquid used for make a sauce or gravy. If you want to gel a liquid, add 2 tablespoons per cup., From the guar bean, guar gum can be used as an acceptable substitute for gelatin but requires different handling. Prepare ingredients as the recipe dictates. For the gelatin substitution, divide the amount of gelatin required by the recipe by 6 to arrive at the amount of guar gum to be used. For example, one tablespoon of gelatin divided by 6 results in 1/2 a teaspoon of guar gum. This will need to be played around with though, as the 1:6 ratio is a guide, not exact. Then, add the guar gum to the dry ingredients first while mixing the liquid ingredients in another bowl. Introduce both sets of ingredients slowly, stirring all the while to prevent the guar gum from turning lumpy. The key to guar gum addition is – be gradual and keep testing it.

, Xanthan gum is produced from the fermentation of a carbohydrate. If substituting xanthan gum for gelatin, use half the amount of xanthan gum that the recipe suggests for the gelatin. For example, if a recipe requires 2 teaspoons of gelatin, only use one teaspoon of xanthan gum., Arrowroot is a starch from the roots of a tropical herb, Maranta arundinacea. It is good for thickening an acidic liquid.It is also good for thickening jellies/gelled substances; indeed, the Victorians used to make an arrowroot jelly. However, don't use arrowroot with dairy products as these tend to turn it slimy.


Arrowroot does not handle high temperatures well. If it needs to be added to something hot, stir arrowroot in some cold liquid first, add to the hot mixture and leave on heat for no more than 30 seconds., Much of this will be trial and error when making substitutes for recipes that call for gelatin.

Come up with some great recipes that everyone can enjoy.",How to Eat Vegetarian Food when Your Family Eats Meat," They will appreciate your conviction to either animal welfare, healthy eating, or whatever reason you may have.;
, Go to the grocery store and check out some of the meat substitutes. There are some incredible things like “Vegan Roasts” and “Soy-rizo”, that unless you look for, you might never know exist.

, Things that a vegetarian might eat as main dishes (nuts, vegetables, cheeses, fruit) might be side dishes for the family and bought less often.

, It may sound tricky, depending on the restaurant cuisine, but with creativity, there's a lot of food choices out there. Appetizer salads, vegetarian chilli, or veggie burgers are some examples. Several fast food restaurants offer vegetarian-friendly items, such as Taco Bell with their bean burritos or Mexican Pizza (omit the meat and cheese) or Burger King with their ""BK Veggie"". Always feel free to ask the person at the counter, a manager, or the waiter for vegetarian menu choices.

, Examples of this include build your own burrito/tacos, using items like beans, veggies, and cheeses as vegetarian proteins, but things that the whole family will enjoy. It is also fun to do a build your own pizza night, because, like burritos and tacos, 95% of the ingredients are something that everyone can eat. Soups are also a great example as there are plenty of amazing vegetarian soups that are easy to make (or buy!). Broccoli and cheese, hot and sour, minestrone, lentil, and tomato bisque all are enjoyable to both carnivores and vegetarians. Creative salads that use fruits, nuts, and cheese are easy to make and delicious. If they are really attached to their chicken, beef, or pork, it can always be cooked separately and added later on.

, Get into doing your own grocery shopping. This creates a balance between yourself, as a vegetarian, and your needs. Create a separate space in the pantry, freezer, and refrigerator for your own food. This way, if you want to eat a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch or a cream of mushroom dish with pasta, it's available to you. Even if you have no skills in the kitchen, whoever the chef may be, will appreciate your suggestions and help. Post a list of meal suggestions on the refrigerator to help remind the family that you aren’t just refusing to eat meat, but are helping with dinner ideas.

, Faux meat has the same texture and looks as regular meat, but uses a textured soy protein. You may be more relaxed as far as planning meals for yourself for a day in the week.

, Seitan is a great substitute for meat eaters, try it as a meat replacement in BBQ. Tempeh, if seasoned correctly, can be an amazing replacement to ground beef. Try cooking with peppers, onions, and spices like blackening seasoning to create a tasty and healthy alternative in tacos or even lasagnas. Look up recipes online (or in cookbooks), and check out the comments from people who have tried them with the meat eating friends and family.

Know when to stop beating.",How to Cream Butter," Take the butter out of the fridge at least an hour before you intend to work with it. Cold butter does not blend well when mixed and will leave chunks of butter throughout the finished product.









The butter is ready when it reaches room temperature. You can test it by giving it a poke with your fingers; if the butter is soft as a ripe peach and your fingers easily leave an indentation, it's ready to use.However, if the butter is squishy and shiny it has probably started to melt, which is not ideal for creaming. Place the butter back in the fridge for 5 to 10 minutes until it firms up a little.;
, Don't worry if you forget to take the butter out of the fridge in advance - all chefs forget from time to time. You can cheat by using a cheese grater to grate the hard butter into thin strips. The increased surface area will allow the butter to soften very quickly and you'll be ready to cream in no time.








, If you're really in a rush, you can also cheat by warming the butter in the microwave. Be very careful with this though - if the butter melts, it will not cream properly and you will have to start again with new butter. To microwave:









Cut the cold butter into even sized chunks (this will ensure that they soften evenly), place the chunks in a microwave safe bowl and heat for no more than 10 seconds.
Take the bowl out and check the butter - if it is still too hard, place it back in the microwave for another 10 seconds.

, Beat the butter with a hand-held or stand mixer on a low speed, until it becomes soft and creamy.








, Add the sugar to the butter a little at a time. The purpose of adding it slowly is to allow you to work it into the butter so that it dissolves and doesn't leave lumps or granules of sugar in the mixture.









As the sugar is beaten, it cuts through the butter, leaving bubbles of air behind. This aerates the mixture, allowing it to rise and giving the final product a light, fluffy texture.
Most recipes will call for caster or superfine sugar when creaming butter. This is because superfine sugar has the perfect consistency for creaming - it has enough of a surface area that it will adequately aerate the butter as it is beaten (unlike powdered sugar), but it is fine enough that it will not give a coarse texture to cakes and cookies (unlike granulated sugar).

, Once all of the sugar has been added to the butter, increase the speed of the mixer (high on a hand mixer, medium/high on a stand mixer) and continue beating until the entire texture is smooth and creamy.









Don't forget to scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl with a rubber spatula from time to time, to reincorporate any sugar or butter that has stuck to the sides.
Also try to scrape out any mixture that has become trapped in the beaters.

, As you continue to beat, the butter and sugar mixture will increase in volume and become increasingly lighter in color. When the sugar and butter has been perfectly creamed, it should be off-white in color and have almost doubled in volume. The texture should be thick and creamy - almost like mayonnaise.









Be careful not the over-mix the butter and sugar. Once the mixture is pale and creamy, and forms slight, soft peaks, you should stop beating.
If you keep mixing, it will lose most of the air you worked in and the final product will not rise very well.
As a guideline, your butter and sugar should be perfectly creamed in about six or seven minutes, when using a mixer.

, If you've creamed the butter and sugar well, the baking process should proceed smoothly.








, You can use any type of mixing bowl you like, however, some chefs recommend using a ceramic or stoneware bowl for creaming butter.









These type of bowls have rougher surfaces which catch the butter and speed up the creaming process.Metal or plastic bowls have smoother surfaces which do not catch the butter.

, Before you add the sugar to the bowl, you should cream the butter on its own first. This will make adding the sugar much easier later on.









Use a fork, wire whisk, spatula or wooden spoon to mush up the butter before you begin to mix.
Like with the ceramic or stoneware bowl, it is believed that a wooden spoon will catch the butter more easily and speed up the creaming process.

, Little by little, incorporate the sugar into the butter, beating after each addition. This will give the sugar a chance to dissolve and prevent it from flying out of the bowl as you mix.









Continue beating the butter and sugar once all of the sugar has been added. Beat vigorously but steadily - you will have to work at it for a while so you don't want to tire yourself out too soon! Switch hands if you need to.
Just think of all the calories you'll burn while beating - you'll certainly deserve that extra cookie once they're done!

, Really with hand beating there's no way to over-mix the butter and sugar...but you'll have to stop at some point.









When it's ready, the mixture should be creamy and lump-free. It should be slighter paler in color too.
A good test is to drag a fork through the mixture - if you see any streaks of butter, you'll need to keep beating, if not you can continue with your recipe.
If you leave streaks of butter in your mixture, this means that it's not uniform and your final product will have an uneven texture.

Make tempeh ""chicken"" salad.",How to Cook Tempeh," Tempeh isn't always easy to find in grocery stores, but if you have a health food store or a natural foods store in your area you'll find it in the refrigerated section, close to the tofu. If you'd prefer not to buy commercially-made tempeh, you can make your own. The process is time-consuming, but you'll be able to rest assured that your tempeh contains only natural ingredients.Making tempeh yourself can be done with 2 cups of hulled soybeans, 2 teaspoons of vinegar and a packet of tempeh starter. Boil the beans until they're soft, then drain them and pat dry. Mix in the vinegar and tempeh starter, then place the beans in a container with air holes to allow them to ferment. They must be kept at a temperature of 88 °F (31 °C) for 24 - 48 hours. During this time, mycelium will grow over the beans and fuse them together into a solid block.;
, Tempeh comes in a dense, brick-shaped block. While it can certainly be sliced and cooked up right away, many recipes call for boiling or simmering it in hot water for a few minutes to soften the tempeh before using another cooking method to finish it. Boiling or simmering the tempeh before frying, baking or sauteing it results in tempeh pieces that are pleasingly soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. To boil or simmer tempeh,


Remove it from the packaging.
Bring a pot of water to a boil or simmer, depending on how soft you want the tempeh to be. Hotter water will result in softer tempeh.
Place the entire block of tempeh in the boiling or simmering water.
Cook it for 8-10 minutes.
Remove the tempeh from the water and pat it dry.

, The most common ways to break up the block of tempeh are by slicing it into thin strips or chopping it into bite-sized pieces. You can also shred it or chop it finely so that it takes on texture of ground beef. Cut the tempeh to whatever side is right for the dish you want to include it in. For example:


If you're making barbecued tempeh, slice it into long strips.
If you're making tempeh tacos, shred or crumble it.
If you're adding it to soup, chop it into bite-sized pieces.

, Tempeh has a very subtle, nutty flavor that picks up other flavors well. Marinating tempeh is a very common way to punch up its flavor before cooking. Tempeh can be marinated in any marinade you'd use for tofu, chicken, beef, or any type of meat. To marinate tempeh, follow these steps:


Mix up a marinade with tasty ingredients like minced garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and spices.
Place the chopped or sliced tempeh in a glass baking dish and pour the marinade over the tempeh to cover it.
Cover the dish and let the tempeh marinate for 20 minutes to overnight.
Drain off the marinade in preparation for cooking the tempeh.

, If you'd prefer not to use a marinade, you can instead season the tempeh dry with any combination of spices. Coriander, cilantro, oregano or other whole herbs can pack a punch, and powdered spices like paprika and turmeric can add good color to the tempeh, dying the slices a rich yellow-brown or reddish tone. Using plenty of herbs and spices will help with both flavor and presentation. To season tempeh,


Lay the tempeh pieces out on a baking sheet.
Sprinkle your spice mix liberally over the tempeh. Flip the pieces and sprinkle more on the other side.
Don't skimp with spices, since tempeh is a little flavorless on its own and needs plenty of spices to make it taste flavorful.

, Simple baked tempeh can be made with either dry seasoned or marinated tempeh pieces. Baked tempeh is a great main dish paired with vegetables, rice, or quinoa. To make baked tempeh, do the following:


Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or use a paper towel to oil it, so the tempeh doesn't stick.
Place the tempeh pieces in a single layer on the baking sheet.
Bake the tempeh for 15 - 20 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned and crispy.

, Heat a drizzle of oil in a skillet over medium high heat. When the oil is hot, lay the tempeh strips or cubes in the oil. Cook them on one side for about 3 minutes, until they turn golden brown and crispy, then flip the pieces with a pair of tongs and cook them on the other side.

, Heat several inches of cooking oil with a high smoke point (like peanut or vegetable oil) in a deep frying pan or dutch oven. When the oil reaches a temperature of 400 degrees, put strips or chunks of tempeh in the oil. Fry them for about 4 minutes, or until they're golden brown and crispy. Remove them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.


You can bread tempeh before frying it if you want it to have a crunchy crust. Dip the tempeh in an egg or milk, then dredge it in flour, panko or breadcrumbs mixed with salt and spices. Fry the tempeh as instructed.

, Cooked tempeh pieces taste great in any dish that calls for a protein. Decide whether the dish would taste best with baked, sauteed or fried tempeh, then top it with dressing, mix it with vegetables, add some sauce, or otherwise treat it as you would chicken, fish or tofu.


Add chopped, cooked tempeh to soup or stew.
For salads, just toss the blocks of tempeh with greens and other ingredients to make a nice hot salad, or let the whole thing cool for a fresh, chilled result.
Put strips of tempeh into sandwiches and build a panini, club or other option for a great taste that doesn't use meat.

, Tempeh burgers have a satisfyingly meaty texture, and when you mix in savory spices like garlic powder, cayenne and black pepper, you won't miss having beef. To make tempeh burgers,


Start with tempeh that has been boiled for 10 minutes, then shredded. You need about 2 cups of tempeh for 4 burgers.
Mix 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.
Beat 1 egg and mix it with the tempeh. Add the spice mix and incorporate it thoroughly.
Form the mixture into 4 patties. Roll the patties in panko or bread crumbs.
Fry the patties on an oiled stovetop grill, cooking each side until golden brown.
Serve the patties on buns or a bed of salad greens.

, This is a great weeknight dish to serve to a crowd. Leftovers taste even better the next day. To make tempeh sloppy joes,


Crumble a block of tempeh and Sauté it in oil until it's golden brown and crispy.
Add 1 chopped onion and 1 chopped green bell pepper to the pan, and Sauté them until they soften.
Add 1 teaspoon chili powder, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 2 tablespoons soy sauce to the onion mixture. Sauté for another 2 minutes.
Add 1 15 ounce can of tomato sauce. Let the mixture come to a simmer.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Serve the sloppy joe mixture on hamburger buns.

, Believe it or not, tempeh is versatile enough to taste great tossed with mayonnaise, spices and sliced grapes as a delicious substitute for chicken. If you love chicken salad but don't want to eat meat, try using tempeh. To make tempeh salad,


Boil a block of tempeh for 8 minutes, then slice it into bite-sized cubes. Let it cool.
Mix the tempeh cubes with 1/2 cup mayonnaise, a chopped stalk of celery, 1/2 chopped onion, 1/2 cup chopped green or red grapes, and salt and pepper. Add 1/2 teaspoon of curry to make curry tempeh salad.
Chill the mixture for 1/2 hour.
Serve the salad on a croissant or a bed of lettuce.

Take vegetarianism one step at a time.,
Help others cope.,
Maintain discipline.,
Eat protein everyday.,
Don't use vegetarianism as a diet tool.",How to Become a Teenage Vegetarian," Most people don't become vegetarian overnight; it does require patience and practice. Although many people do decide at one point to quit eating meat, it is easier to just take one meat product from a particular animal out of your diet at a time. For example, if you don't like pig product (bacon, ham, pork, hot dogs, etc.) or cow product (beef), then just resolve to not eat that particular type when offered to you. If you'd like, simply eliminate all red meat (pig, or cow) from your diet. Chicken and fish are white meat, and are often more substantial and healthy than red meat (they're also less likely to contain preservatives and diseases). However, keep in mind that any type of meat, red or white is still meat.;
, As a teenager, your parents may feel they don't trust you to make the right decision. Some people may find it very offensive when you tell them that you don't eat meat. Becoming vegetarian isn't just a decision; it's a way of life. You need to make it clear that it's your diet, your life, your choice. Most teens will have understanding parents, but just in case your parents keep on serving you meat, make sure you have salad or soup or grains at hand, to eat when there isn't really another choice (few parents are likely to keep on serving you meat over and over if you refuse to eat it).

, To become fully vegetarian, you can't eat meat. Ever. Vegetarians don't have a cheat day where they eat a burger and then decide they won't have another for a month. After eliminating your diet of meat, eating it again will consider you a non-vegetarian.

, Although meat contains the majority of protein in a normal diet, there are plenty of foods that have protein in them that aren't meat. Consider soy products, like tofu or veggie burgers. Those have plenty of protein and they're both delicious! There are also substitute meats for beef and chicken that taste pretty good, but always make sure to read the ingredients as assurance that the product doesn't have meat in it.

, A side effect for many vegetarian people is losing a few pounds, but do not make losing weight by cutting meat out of your diet your ultimate goal. When you do this, you are cutting protein out. Eating tofu and veggie burgers as a substitute for meat will keep your weight relatively the same, and you won't lose weight. Therefore you will most likely resolve to not eat protein at all as a diet method. However, if you don't eat any protein, your body will get sick very quickly and will lose nutrition you need as a young adult/teenager (13-18) to survive.

",How to Choose the Right Flour," Does it call for ""flour"", or does it call for cake flour, bread flour, or something special?;
, Try to understand the role of flour in whatever you will be preparing. Here are some things to look for.


Is the recipe primarily a yeast bread? Does it use yeast as the primary leavening (rising) agent? Yeast bread recipes usually also include a lot of kneading and rising.
Does the recipe use mainly baking soda, baking powder, or cream of tartar as leavening?
Does the recipe use flour as a thickening agent for a sauce or soup?
Does the recipe call for a mixture of flours, for flours made of other grains, or for additional sources of starch (such as cooked potatoes or oatmeal)?
Does the recipe call for only a particular part of the grain, such as the grain or bran?

,, When making a cake, the result should be light and fluffy. What this means for the flour is that it should be finely milled with a lot of starch and relatively low protein content. That lets it absorb the fats more readily. Most recipes will call for cake flour if it is warranted. Yeasted breads should not be made with cake flour. ,"

, Place a sheet of parchment paper on top of a baking sheet. If you do not have a baking sheet, you can use an oven-safe glass or ceramic dish instead. Make sure that the dish is large enough to fit your brie.

, Look for a younger cheese, or for something that says ""double cream"" on the label; avoid anything that says ""triple cream,"" as it may end up too runny when baked.If your cheese came wrapped in paper or plastic, you will need to remove the wrapper and discard it. Leave the white rind on the cheese.


Baked brie is usually eaten by cutting a bit off with a knife and spreading the softened cheese over a cracker. You can make a dip-able baked brie by cutting the top part of the rind off. Leave the sides and bottom of the rind intact; they will hold the cheese together while you bake it.

, You will need 2 to 3 tablespoons of honey. Make sure that it is the translucent, runny type. You can also cut the cheese in half, so that you end up with two thin circles. Spread your honey (and other ingredients if you wish) on top of the bottom circle. Then, place the top circle back down on it—just like making a sandwich.


Instead of using honey, you can also use maple syrup, agave nectar, fruit jam, or fig spread.

, You can make your brie even more unique and flavorful by adding some toppings. If you cut your brie in half, you can place these toppings in between the two slices with the honey. Place the toppings over the honey. Here are some suggestions and combinations:


A few sprigs of fresh thyme and a handful of chopped walnuts.
A few sprigs of fresh rosemary and a handful of chopped walnuts.
Before you place the brie into the oven, add a few sprigs of thyme. After you take the brie out of the oven, top it with some quartered figs.Substitute the honey for maple syrup instead, then add brown sugar, a handful of chopped pecans, and a handful of dried cranberries., Set the cheese on the baking sheet and place it into the oven. Let the cheese bake for 10 to 12 minutes. You will know when the brie is done if the cheese is soft to touch.

, Baked brie tastes best when it is served warm. If you only used honey on your brie while baking it, you can add some toppings—they just won't be warm. Popular toppings include: fresh herbs like rosemary and thyme, crumbled walnuts or pecans, dried cranberries, or fruit jams. You can serve the baked brie with crackers or bread. For more serving suggestions, refer to the section in this article on serving the brie.

, Make sure that the baking rack is in the middle. It if isn't, adjust the rack before preheating the oven. It will take 5 to 10 minutes for your oven to reach the required temperature.

, Place a sheet of parchment paper on top of a baking sheet. If you do not have a baking sheet, you can use an oven-safe dish made out of glass or ceramic instead—just make sure that it is large enough to fit the cheese.

, Choose a younger cheese, or look for something that says ""double cream"" on the label; stay away from anything that says ""triple cream."" If your cheese came wrapped in paper or plastic, remove the wrapper and discard it. Leave the white rind on the cheese.

, Spread some flour on surface you will be working on before setting down the puff pastry. Lightly dust the surface of the pastry, and roll the pastry out using a rolling pin. You want the pastry to be 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters)larger than it originally was.


If your puff pastry is frozen, you will need to thaw it first. This will take 15 to 20 minutes. Do not try to unfold frozen puff pastry, or you may break it., The pastry will be much larger than the brie, so you will have to trim it down with a knife. Leave enough of the pastry so that you can fold it over the brie without stretching it.


Consider saving the scraps of left-over puff pastry. You can use mini-cookie cutters to cut shapes out of them, and place them on top of the brie, after you wrap it., Once you have chosen what sort of filling you want, spread it over the top of the cheese. Do not spread the mixture over the entire surface; stop within ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of the edge. If you go too far, the mixture may seep out and tear the pastry.Here are some suggestions for the filling.


To make a simple, sweet filling, you will need, raspberry jam or other fruit jam, brown sugar and ¼ cup (56.25 milliliters) maple syrup.To make a sweet and savory brie, you will need 2 tablespoons chopped pecans, ¼ cup dried cranberries (30 grams), and 2 tablespoons honey.You can also stuff your brie instead. Slice the brie in half, creating two disks. Press some red, sliced, seedless grapes down onto the cheesy side of the bottom disk. Add 1 teaspoon of fresh, minced thyme, and ½ teaspoon of fresh, minced rosemary on top of the grapes. Put the top disk down onto the grapes and press down lightly, creating a sandwich. Place the brie down onto the pastry sheet.Slice the brie in half, and spread a fruit jam over one of the halves. Put the two halves back together and place them back onto the pastry sheet.

, In a cup, mix 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water using a fork. Then, apply a thin layer of egg wash to the surface of the pastry sheet with a brush. This will help ""glue"" the pastry when you fold it over the brie. Do not apply too much egg wash, or you will make the dough soggy.

, Fold the edges of the pastry over the top of the brie. You can overlap them and make little pleats, or you can simply gather them together and twist them like a candy wrapper. If you twist the dough, tie it off with a piece of baker's twine.


If you accidentally cut too much of the pastry off and don't have enough pastry left to cover the brie, do not stretch it. Instead, use the scraps left over from cutting the pastry to patch up the hole.
To help the steam escape during baking, consider poking holes into the top of the pastry using a fork., This will help give the pastry some shine. Use a brush and apply a thin layer over the top of the bundle.

, If you have any leftover pieces of pastry sheet, you can cut small shaped out of it using mini cookie cutters. You can use any shape you want, but leaves will look the most festive. Stick the shapes onto the pastry bundle and lightly brush them with some egg wash.

, Let it bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry turns a golden brown.

, Baked brie tastes best when it is served warm. You can serve the brie with crackers or sliced bread as an appetizer. For more serving suggestions, refer to the section in this article on serving the brie.

, Bake your brie without any honey, toppings, or puff pastry for 10 minutes. Take the brie out and spread some chunky cranberry sauce on top. Bake it for 5 more minutes. Before serving the brie, garnish it with some orange zest and a handful of chopped walnuts.You can also substitute the walnuts with pistachios or chopped up pecans.

, You can drizzle your baked brie with honey or maple syrup, and add toppings such as chopped pecans or walnuts, dried cranberries, sliced almonds, or pistachios. You can even spread some fruit jam or cranberry on top of the brie.

, Cut an apple into thin slices or wedges, and serve them alongside your baked brie. Sweet, tart, and crunchy apples work best with baked brie, but you can use any apple you likes. You can also cut some figs into wedges and place them on top of the baked brie before serving. For a splash of color, serve the baked brie alongside a bunch of grapes.

, Plain crackers, such as watercress crackers, work the best, but you can also use savory and herbed crackers as well. Consider including a knife, so that the guests can spread the cheese onto the crackers. If you made a dip-able baked brie by cutting the top rind off, you will not need a knife.


You can also serve the brie with sliced bread. Choose a bread with a crunchy crust, such as French bread, and cut it into thin slices. Avoid using sliced sandwich breads.

, Baked brie makes a perfect, festive appetizer for parties during the cold, wintry months. The next time you plan on hosting (or attending) a Thanksgiving, Christmas, or New Year's Eve dinner, consider preparing some baked brie.

, You can store brie in the refrigerator for several days.

, If your baked brie needs to be reheated, make sure that it is room temperature first. Place your brie onto a baking sheet and cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Transfer the baking sheet into a preheated oven set to 350°F (177°C). Let it bake for 5 to 10 minutes, or until warm.

Choose a baking dish that fits inside the machine.,
Follow your chosen recipe.,
Be careful when using foil.,
Consider preheating the halogen oven.,
Put the dish in your halogen oven.,
Set the time.,
Set the temperature to start the machine.,
Remove the finished dish carefully.,
Follow a halogen oven recipe as written.,
Note the general recommended cooking times and temperatures.,
Adjust the baking temperature when using a non-halogen recipe.",How to Bake in a Halogen Oven," Before you begin to prepare your recipe, make sure that the baking dish or baking tray you transfer the food to will fit inside of the halogen oven.


Any ovenproof dish or tray should be fine, including most metal, silicon, and Pyrex dishes.
The halogen oven is smaller than a standard oven, so you will need smaller bakeware. Make sure that the bakeware you choose is smaller than the oven itself to make removal easier.;
, Regardless of whether you use a halogen-specific recipe or a standard baking recipe, the preparation instructions can be followed exactly as written.


A halogen-specific recipe can be followed straight through, from start to finish.
For a non-halogen recipe, follow the preparation instructions but alter the baking temperature and bake time as needed.

, You can wrap foil over your baking dish if the recipe calls for it, but only do so if you can wrap the edges of the foil securely around the sides of the dish.


Aluminum foil can help prevent food from browning too quickly.
The fan inside of the halogen oven is very strong, however, and loose foil will be easily blown off. If the foil becomes loose, it could float around the inside of the machine and could damage the heating element.

, Set the temperature dial to the correct cooking temperature three to five minutes before placing the dish inside your halogen oven.


Many recipes will not mention a preheating step since the halogen oven takes such a short amount of time to reach a high temperature. Nonetheless, preheating your oven will still produce the best results.
Some machines have a preheat button. Pressing it will preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius) for six minutes. Other machines will require you to set your desired temperature to preheat them.

, Carefully place the baking dish onto the lower rack of the halogen oven. Once the dish is securely inside, close the oven lid.


Halogen ovens usually have a top rack and a bottom rack. Use the bottom rack for baking, roasting, defrosting, steaming, re-heating, and most other forms of cooking. Use the top rack for grilling, browning, or toasting.Leave at least 1/2 inch (1 cm) gap in between the bakeware and the sides, bottom, and top of the machine. Doing so will provide better air circulation and ensure proper heating.

, Turn the timer clockwise until you reach the desired time. Push down on the safety handle after setting the time. A red power light should turn on.


Most halogen oven timers can be programmed for times up to 60 minutes.
Note that the oven will turn off as soon as the timer setting has been reached. As a result, a halogen oven is less likely to overbake or burn food than a normal oven if that food is left inside a little longer than intended.

, Turn the temperature dial clockwise until you reach the desired temperature. If the timer is already set, the power light should turn green and the oven should automatically turn on.


Make sure that the lid is in position before turning on the machine.
Usually, the machine will not work unless the safety handle is set in its down position.
Removing the lid in the middle of the cooking process will usually stop the heater and the fan. To resume cooking, place the lid back on the machine and set the handle in the down position again.

, Most halogen ovens are sold with a tool designed to help you lift food out when done. If you do not have this tool or if you cannot use it to get a good grip on your bakeware, use a set of long-handled tongs.


As with conventional ovens, the baking dish will be hot when you remove it. Wear oven mitts to protect your hands and wrists.
Place the hot dish on a towel, cooling rack or other heat-resistant base after removing it from the halogen oven.

, If you are following a recipe specifically designed for use with a halogen oven, you can follow the preparation guidelines, temperature setting, and baking time exactly as instructed.


For non-halogen recipes, you will need to alter the baking times and temperatures. Follow either the general recommended cooking specifications based on the type of baked good, or alter the specifications mentioned in the recipe based on the alteration guidelines.

, While each recipe can be different, there are a few guidelines to consider when baking certain types of food in a halogen oven.Brownies: 18 to 20 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius)
Buns: 10 to 12 minutes at 390 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius)
Layer cakes: 18 to 20 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius)
Loaf cakes: 30 to 35 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius)
Cornbread: 18 to 20 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius)
Drop cookies: 8 to 20 minutes at 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius)
Rolled cookies: 10 to 12 minutes at 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius)
Muffins: 12 to 15 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius)
Pastries and pie crust: 8 to 10 minutes at 390 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius)
Pies with filling and no top crust: 25 to 30 minutes at 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius)
Pies with filling and two crusts: 35 to 40 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius)
Bread rolls: 12 to 15 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius)
Bread loaves: 25 to 30 minutes at 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius)

, When adapting a non-halogen recipe for use in a halogen oven, lower the cooking temperature. If baked according to the original instructions, the outside will likely burn while the center may remain partially uncooked.


For cake recipes, lower the temperature by 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius).
For all other recipes, you will usually need to lower the temperature of uncovered dishes 70 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 40 degrees Celsius) in your halogen oven.
Monitor the food as it cooks by looking through the glass bowl. Some foods may bake faster than instructed.

Avoid making French pastries until you have a good grasp of working with pastry and a fair understanding of its properties.,
Consider attending classes to learn the techniques used in baking.,
Learn about baking from other places and for special occasions:


Try to experiment with baking from different cultures, from Japan to New Zealand, from the USA to Romania, you will find wide variations on commonly baked goods.",How to Bake Cakes and Pastries," You won't have enough time in the day to bake a lot of items, so be selective. Pastries tend to be more effort and take more skills than making cakes, so if you're a novice, start with cakes and work your way towards making pastries.;
, To begin with, it's a really good idea to become knowledgeable about the techniques, as well as the things that can go wrong with them. For example, temperature is very important when baking a cake, so that opening the oven mid-cooking can cause it to deflate. And pastries often require cold handling (adding cold fat, keeping your fingers cool by only using the fingertips and only rubbing for a short time, and having a cool room to work in). While these ""fiddly"" things may seem overwhelming at first, once you have grasped the finer techniques of baking, they make the experience both much more enjoyable and a lot more successful.

, Start with plain cakes and pastries before graduating to fancier, more complicated versions. Some good ones to start with would be:


Cupcakes
Chocolate cake
Banana cake
Pies
Ice cream cake

, Here are some ideas to try:


A cupcake wedding cake
Fruit cake
A chocolate chip birthday cake
Red velvet cake

, French pastries become easier with practice but they are not a good beginner's pastry because you will be easily deterred by the amount of effort required. Once you do feel more certain, you might like to try:


Croissants
Eclairs
Choux pastry for a croquembouche


, It can be a lot easier learning from a pastry chef who already knows all the tricks and trickiness and you will benefit from both the visual demonstrations and the practice with help.

, It could take a lifetime to discover them all!
Learn about baked food that signify different seasons or celebrations. There are many different baked items associated with harvests, Christmas, Easter, Day of the Dead, and other celebrations around the world. These tend to be more complicated, on the whole, so you might need to be an intermediate to advanced baker to feel comfortable with them. See wikiHow's Holiday Cooking section for some ideas.

Stir until they form a thick paste. Make sure no patches of dried sugar or tartar remain. For best results, let it sit for 12 hours so the sugar absorbs as much liquid as possible.Since the eggs aren’t cooked, avoid serving to anyone who is pregnant, elderly, or under the age of four, as well as anyone with a compromised immune system.;
, In another medium-sized mixing bowl, use a whisk to mix together your rice flour, all-purpose flour, and salt. In a third mixing bowl, switch to an electric mixer to combine your butter, sugar, and ground lavender at medium-high speed for roughly five minutes. Once this mixture appears pale and fluffy, add the flour-and-salt mixture and mix at low speed until evenly combined.Once you’re done, cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least two hours before moving on to the next step.

, First, set your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). While that preheats, dust flour over a sheet of parchment paper. Place your dough on that and dust more flour over its top. Cover with a second sheet of parchment paper and then roll the dough out until it thins to roughly ⅛-inch thick (0.3 cm). Then:Use a large cookie cutter to cut out 16 cookies. As you do, collect the trimmings and reroll them to cut more cookies.
Switch to a smaller cookie cutter to punch a hole from the center of each. Reroll the trimmings from these as well in case you have enough for more cookies.

, Line a baking sheet with new parchment paper and transfer the cookies to that. Once the oven has heated up, place the baking sheet inside. Bake for about 12 to 14 minutes, or until the cookies’ edges begin to golden.Once they’ve baked, remove from heat and transfer them to a wire rack to cool off.

, Once the cookies have cooled off enough to safely handle, start decorating them one at a time. Dip the top of each one into your glaze. Hold it over the bowl so any excess can run back into it. Then place it on your wire rack and stick your whole lavenders into the glaze.You want to move fast as you do this, so the glaze doesn’t have a chance to harden and grow less adhesive.
At the same time, you need to handle the lavenders gently so they don’t tear or fall apart.

Now place two sticks of butter in a medium saucepan and melt that over medium-high heat. Stir in the cocoa and water and continue to heat until the liquid begins to boil rapidly., While the chocolate heats up, pour your flour, granulated sugar, and baking powder into a large mixing bowl. Stir until they are evenly mixed. Once the chocolate boils, pour that in, too, and mix them all together., Pour your buttermilk into a second mixing bowl, add the baking soda, and stir to combine. Then pour that into your chocolate-flour mix and do the same. Once you've emptied the second mixing bowl, crack your eggs open in that, beat them together, then pour and stir them into the first bowl's contents. Finally, stir one teaspoon of vanilla extract into the cake mix, and it's good to go., Grease the bottoms and sides of two round 8-inch (20 cm) cake pans. Divide equal portions of your cake mix into each one.

Use only edible flowers.,
Go organic.,
Buy directly from source when possible.,
Clean before use.",How to Decorate Baked Goods with Edible Flowers3," Be aware that not all flowers are edible. If you have a particular one in mind, always research that specific type first to make sure it’s safe to eat. Otherwise, stick to popular favorites, such as:Arugula, chive, hibiscus, jasmine, lavender, lemon verbena, marigold, nasturtiums, pansies, squash blossoms, and violets.

, Keep in mind that, even if a specific flower is safe to eat in general, not all flowers are grown with consumption in mind. Avoid consuming any that have been treated with chemicals, like pesticides. Always use organic flowers, which are grown without any added chemicals., If you have a farmer’s market nearby, purchase your flowers there. Inquire about growing methods with the sellers to ensure that they run an organic operation. If you shop for them at the grocery store instead, make sure you search the produce section, not their florist section. If you’re still in doubt about whether they’re safe to eat, order online from companies that sell flowers specifically for cooking, like:Gourmet Sweet Botanicals
Marx Foods
Melissa’s

, Treat flowers just like any other produce. Always wash them before you start making any foods with them. Give them a shake to get rid of any dirt or insects. Place them in bowl of cold water and gently scrub them with your fingertips. Then place them on a paper towel so they can air-dry.If you don’t use them right way, dampen a fresh sheet of paper towel and use that to line an airtight container. Seal the flowers inside and refrigerate them. Use within a week of purchase.

Mix baking soda with cream of tartar.,
Combine baking soda and buttermilk.,
Mix baking soda with lemon juice or vinegar.,
Store baking powder in an airtight container.,
Increase shelf life by storing it somewhere dry.,
Keep it cool.",How to Check the Freshness of Baking Powder," Use tap water and fill a kettle to the minimum fill line. You only need ½ cup (118 ml) of hot water to test the baking powder, but filling the kettle to the minimum fill line will ensure the heating element doesn’t overheat. Turn on the kettle and bring the water to a boil.Don’t use more water than you need, otherwise the kettle will waste energy heating the extra water.;
, Measure 1 teaspoon (4.6 g) of baking powder into a heat-safe bowl, glass, or dish. Once the water has boiled, you'll pour it over the baking powder, so it’s important to use a dish that can withstand the heat.


You can actually use this same method to test the potency of baking soda as well., When the kettle boils, pour some of the boiling water into a half-cup measuring cup. Slowly pour the boiling water from the measuring cup over the baking powder.

To test baking soda instead of baking powder, add 1 teaspoon of white vinegar to the hot water before pouring it over the soda. The acid in the vinegar will react with the baking soda and activate it if it’s still good., Baking powder that’s still fresh and good to use will immediately start to bubble and fizz when you pour the boiling water over it. Fizzing and hissing means the baking powder is fresh and can be used as a leavening agent in baking.


The more bubbles the baking powder creates, the fresher it is., Baking powder is actually just baking soda mixed with a dry acid, so you can make your own baking powder in a pinch if what you have on hand isn't fresh. To make 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking powder, whisk together 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda and 2 teaspoons (7 g) of cream of tartar.

To make larger quantities of baking powder, mix baking soda and cream of tartar at a one-to-two ratio and store extras in an airtight container., Another acid you can use to convert baking soda into baking powder is buttermilk. To make baking powder this way, combine ½ teaspoon (2 g) of baking soda with ½ cup (118 ml) of buttermilk.This baking powder alternative is best in recipes that already call for the buttermilk, such as:

Pancakes
Muffins
Biscuits
Waffles
Breading or batter
Doughnuts

, Both lemon juice and vinegar contain acid that will help activate baking soda and turn it into baking powder. To make this alternative, combine ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of baking soda and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of lemon juice or vinegar. This yields 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking powder.When making baking powder with a liquid plus baking soda, reduce the amount of other liquids in the recipe by the same amount. For instance, if you made 2 teaspoons of baking powder made with lemon juice and baking soda, reduce the milk in the recipe by 2 teaspoons., When stored properly, baking powder will last for 18 months or longer. One of the most important factors when storing baking powder is to keep it in an airtight container that doesn’t let in any oxygen.Good containers include:

Mason jars
Glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids

, When baking powder mixes with moisture, it clumps together and becomes less effective. Dry places to store baking powder for an extended shelf life include in a pantry, cupboard, or other moisture-free area. Don’t store baking powder in damp basements, under sinks, or in areas that are prone to spills or leaks.

The moisture found in the air contains water, yeast, and other elements, and all of these will change the chemical composition of the baking powder. Eventually, the baking powder will become unusable if it’s exposed to moisture., Another way to get the most life out of baking powder is by storing it away from heat.High temperatures may activate the baking powder, especially if it hasn’t been stored in a dry enough location. Pantries and kitchen cupboards that aren't near the oven are ideal for baking powder."

To bake, you need a heat source that can heat your food sufficiently for it to cook all the way through (for meat dishes, this is especially important, as undercooked meat can contain disease-containing pathogens.) By far the most common appliance used in baking is the oven. Modern ovens allow you to set precise, controlled temperatures for cooking and offer easy access to your food without leaking heat into the surrounding environment. Though less common, it's possible to bake with a variety of alternative methods, including:


Traditional outdoor ovens such as the Tandoor

Dutch ovens
Microwave ovens (technically, this is not baking - microwave radiation is used to warm the food. Still, ""microwave baking"" recipes exist for replicating traditional baked goods like brownies and cookies in a mug in the microwave.);
, Baking projects can range from the simple (staple dishes like bread or chicken breasts) to massive undertakings (like the intricately-decorated desserts you might see on specialty cooking shows like Cake Boss. If you're a beginner baker, it's best to stick to something simple - a simple cookie recipe or some easy chicken thighs. Make sure you have all the ingredients in the recipe before beginning - rushing to the store while you're cooking is aggravating and can even tank certain time-sensitive recipes.


If you can, measure your ingredients out before beginning. It's not essential, but it makes the baking process much quicker.







Practice good food safety. Wash your hands before beginning any cooking project and after touching any uncooked ingredients which can harbor disease-causing bacteria (especially meat, poultry, and eggs.)






Wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty or try wearing an apron.







, By their nature, all baking recipes require high heats. Set your oven to the temperature called for in your recipe. Then, proceed to the next step! Leave your oven alone while it heats - ovens take time to reach the temperatures required for baking (So don't open it while its preheating because that could result in a longer preheat time). In the time your oven takes to heat up, you can complete the other steps in your recipe. By the time your recipe calls for you to put your food in the oven, it should be at the correct heat. The oven will mostly make a noise once the oven has preheated.


It's tempting, but don't open the oven's door before you're ready to put your food in. Doing so will release heat trapped in the oven, lowering the temperature and increasing the time it will take to reach baking temperature.

, Every recipe is different - there's no set of rules that will guide you through every baking process perfectly. Most baking recipes, however, contain some or all of the following general steps:

Preparing your food (for meat, poultry, and vegetables.) Food placed directly in the oven without any preparation will taste dry and bland at best and will cook improperly at worst. Meats like chicken breasts often need to be marinated, stuffed, and/or browned in a frying pan before baking. Vegetables like potatoes need to be pricked with a fork before baking to allow moisture to escape. Almost every recipe contains some sort of preparatory process for the food.






Mixing your ingredients (for pastries, desserts, etc.) Often, the wet and dry ingredients are combined in separate bowls, then mixed together to form a dough or batter.






Preparing baking utensils. Pots and pans aren't always immediately suitable for baking. Sometimes, they need special preparation before baking - many baking recipes, for instance, require you to grease your pan.






Placing the food in or on a baking vessel. Your batter or prepared meat or vegetable won't cook properly if you set it at the bottom of the oven. Usually, your uncooked food is poured or placed into a heat-resistant metal, glass, or ceramic vessel which can easily be removed from the oven (with oven mitts.)






Cooking in the oven at a high heat. This is what defines baking. All baking recipes need to be baked in an oven (or suitable alternative.) Pay attention to instructions about how far the food should be from the heat source.







, Once you have prepared your food using the recipe's instructions and made sure the oven is preheated, add the food (in its baking vessel) to the oven. Close the oven's door and set a timer for the amount of time your recipe specifies for baking. Now, wait for your food to cook and enjoy the delicious aromas that (hopefully) fill your kitchen.


Take this opportunity to clean the utensils you used to prepare your food.
It's OK to check on your food while it cooks by using an oven light or by opening the oven's door briefly. If you open the door, close it as quickly as possible so that the oven doesn't lose its heat. If you're worried that your dish may burn, check on it halfway through the baking process, then after the halfway point as needed.

, When your food's time is up and you've checked it to make sure it looks done, remove it from the oven. Make sure to use some form of hand protection - oven mitts are handy because they allow you to retain some of your hand's dexterity when holding your food, but bunched-up towels held carefully between your hands and the cooking vessel work in a pinch.


Be careful! Pay attention to your food as you remove it from the oven, taking special care not to spill any hot liquids. Baking can be a fun, relaxing process, but if care isn't taken during this step, it can result in painful injury.
Set your creation somewhere where it won't burn the surface it's sitting on or any nearby objects. Use a sturdy rag, an oven mitt, or a cooling rack to protect your counter tops.

, Food is usually far too hot to eat when it comes out of the oven. It also may not have its ""final"" texture - cookies are almost too soft to hold when they come out of the oven. Finally, some recipes use the heat of the pan to continue to cook the food after it is taken out of the oven. Allow your food to cool before eating it - if your recipe calls for it, carefully transfer your food to a cooling rack, which allows the cool air to reach every surface of your food.

, For some foods, external decorations can be primarily used to improve the food's visual presentation, for others, decorations are a vital part of the food's flavor. For instance, a parsley garnish is hardly essential for a baked pasta dish, but a plain, dry cake without frosting is incredibly bland. Your recipe may have specific instructions for decoration or even contain a separate list of ingredients for the decorative elements of your recipe (as is often the case with frostings and sauces.) Give your dish some finishing touches, serve, and enjoy!

, When most people think of ""baked goods,"" they think of breads and pastries - the kinds of foods you can commonly buy at a bakery. These types of foods usually use common ingredients like flour, butter, eggs, sugar, baking soda, salt, oil, milk, starch, cheese, and/or yeast to form a dough or batter which is then baked in sections or as a whole. Breads and pastries are often flavored with spices, syrups, and other additives to give them unique savory flavors. Here are a few basic points to remember when baking breads and pastries:


Your dish's final shape is usually dictated by the vessel it is baked in. A loaf of bread baked in a bread pan, for instance, will have a different shape than a ball of dough cooked on a flat pan.






Baked goods usually require special care to ensure they don't stick to their pan. Butter, shortening, oil, or aerosol sprays are commonly used to keep cooking pans slick.






Some baked goods which use yeast (especially breads) require extra time for the yeast to ""rise."" Yeast is a live, microscopic funguswhich eats sugar in the dough, releasing carbon dioxide gas (which causes dough to ""rise"") and other compounds which affect the flavor of baked goods.Generally, the higher the proportion of dry ingredients (flour, etc.) to wet ingredients (eggs, oil, milk, etc.) in a recipe, the crumblier the dough will be. One common trick for working with especially crumbly dough is to cool it in the freezer or refrigerator - it will thicken, becoming easier to handle and shape without crumbling.







, Along with frying, roasting, and grilling, baking is a great cooking method for meat and poultry. The hot, dry air used in baking can give a cuts of poultry a crispy, browned exterior while keeping the interior of the meat moist and juicy. Roasting a large cut of beef or lamb at a low temperature for hours is a great way to ensure you get a moist, flavorful final product that's cooked all the way through Here are some things to remember when baking meat and poultry:


When roasting large cuts of meat, have a meat thermometer handy, along with a list of the desired internal temperatures for different kinds of meat. It's much easier to use the thermometer to judge whether the meat's done than painstakingly removing it from the oven, cutting it all the way through, and placing it back in the oven.






Some people prefer removing the skin from pieces of poultry, while others prefer leaving it on. When seasoned and cooked, the skin can have a delicious crispy texture, but can slightly increase the fat and caloric content of the dish.There are pros and cons for leaving the bone in cuts of meat (as opposed to removing the bone.) Cuts of meat with the bone in are generally cheaper and, according to some sources, more flavorful (though this is not backed up by hard evidence.) They also sometimes offer additional options for cooking (try stuffing garlic or other herbs into the section of ribcage attached to a bone-in chicken breast). On the other hand, eating around bones can be annoying.






Always cook meat and poultry thoroughly. A 2011 study found dangerous Staph bacteria in about half of the meat and poultry samples tested.Don't take any chances - make sure the center of the meat is cooked with no pink spots and that the meat's juices run clear. For bone-in meat, insert a fork to the bone, feeling for any resistance - a fork will smoothly and easily pierce a done piece of meat.







, Baked or roasted vegetable dishes are a nutritious addition to any meal. Some, like baked potatoes, stand up as delicious main courses. Compared to frying, baking is almost always a lower-calorie, higher-nutrition cooking option for vegetables. Brushed with a little oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper, vegetables can even be baked to give a crispy, satisfying crust. Here are just a few tips for baking vegetables:


Generally, vegetables are ""done"" when they're tender. However, different vegetables tenderize at different speeds - whole squashes, for instance, can take over an hour to soften, while carrots can take half as long.Look up cooking times for your vegetables before attempting to bake.






Some vegetable dishes (notably baked potatoes) require you to puncture the vegetable with a fork or knife before cooking. As the vegetable cooks, water trapped inside will heat and turn to steam. If it can't escape through pre-made holes, the pressure buildup may cause your vegetable to explode!







, Some baking recipes incorporate multiple types of food (some even cooked separately from the other ingredients) into a casserole-style dish. Often, these dishes use a carbohydrate, like rice, pasta, or a starch, as the central ingredient.The ingredients in these dishes are either layered or combined freely. Usually, the casserole is served directly from the deep-sided plate it was cooked in. Casserole dishes are filling, easy to serve, and often quite rich. Here are just a few examples of baked casserole-style dishes:


Lasagna
Ziti
Potatoes au gratin
Macaroni casserole
Moussaka

, Snickerdoodles are a simple (yet elegant) sugar cookie that are mouthwatering paired with milk or ice cream or eaten on their own. Great for beginners, they're easy to bake and even easier to eat!

, Sweet potatoes are delicious, nutritious starches. They're rich in fiber, naturally great-tasting, and surprisingly versatile - sweet potatoes can be dressed with butter and some simple spices for a wholesome staple or loaded with beans, cheese, bacon, and other toppings for a decadent feast.

, Chicken thighs are an underrated cut of poultry - they're cheap, delicious, and lend themselves to finger-licking baked dishes. Marinate before baking for a rich flavor or rub the thighs with a dry rub or a glaze to give them a crispy, blackened texture.

, Whether it's for a family Easter dinner or just for own enjoyment, a baked ham with a sweet glaze makes for a great main course. Even better, you'll have leftovers to make delicious thick-sliced ham sandwiches for weeks.

, Cake recipes can be a little tricky, but if you pull one off, you'll instantly be a celebrity at the party. Birthday cakes have endless potential for decoration - with practice, you'll eventually be making masterpieces with fondant and frosting!

Obtain your grains, seeds, nuts, beans...something to grind to a pulp.,
If you're going for wheat flour, know what's best for your cooking needs.,
Choose your grinding mechanism.,
Place the good stuff into your mill/blender.,
Grind away.,
Continue to crank your mill or blend your grains until the flour reaches the texture you want.,
Once you're satisfied with your flour, pour it into a resealable bag or container.,
If making bulk amounts, keep it in the fridge or freezer.,
Experiment with your flour first.",How to Make Flour," Practically any grain, nut, or seed can be turned into flour. Try exotic items such as quinoa, popcorn, acorns, and peas to the more traditional options like rice, wheat, oats, and barley. Fresh, whole wheat berries, rye berries, whole oats and the like can often be found at health food stores, sold in bulk. They'll be white, russet, purple or amber-colored.And it's cheaper by volume than the pre-made stuff, too!


Know what kind of flour you want to make. Want whole wheat flour? Get whole wheat berries (they don't look like berries -- that's just what they're called). Want rye flour? Get rye berries. Flour ain't no rocket science!;
, Each kind lends itself to a different use. Spelt, Emmer and Einkorn grains are on the comeback and are healthy versions of wheat, too. For yeast breads, hard red (winter or spring) wheat is best.


For breads that don't need yeast (like muffins, pancakes, and waffles), soft white is the standard choice. Spelt, kamut, and triticale work, too., If you'd like to spend hours cranking for your daily forearm workout, you're more than welcome. Or you could throw the seeds/berries/nuts/beans in your blender/food processor/coffee grinder and let it do the work for you. If you do use some sort of electric device, the higher powered it is, the finer your flour will be.


The manual mill really has one advantage: It doesn't produce any heat to damage the nutrients of the seeds. Other than that, it just takes a lot of time.
The main drawback of electric mills is that they're just mills and they're a bit expensive (your cheapest one is going to run at about a couple hundred bucks).The only downside of using a blender/food processor/coffee grinder is that it may not get you the finest quality of powder (""finest"" here meaning like small, not of good quality). It all depends on the specific product you're using.

, Make the amount you plan to use right now -- fresh flour can go bad very quickly. Fill the mechanism only about halfway full so there's room for it to blend away.


1 cup of wheat berries should produce just over 1 1/2 cups of flour.For beans and nuts, etc., the same to 1.5x the original amount will be produced.

, If you're using a mill, turn the crank until all of the grain has been processed through it. If you're using a blender, select the highest setting to blend the grain for about 30 seconds. Then turn it off, remove the lid, and stir with a rubber spatula. After stirring, place the lid back on and blend some more.


Your mechanism determines how fast the stuff will grind. If you're using one of those fancy schmancy high-powered blenders (like Blendtec or Vitamix), your flour will be done before you can say, ""Is the flour done yet?"" If you're grinding manually, well, hope you took the afternoon off work.

, You can check on this by sifting the mixture you have into a bowl and surveying it up close. Touch it to make sure it has the right consistency (wash your hands thoroughly first!) and if it doesn't, run it again.


Your coffee grinder will never get the flour to a processed-flour-like consistency. What you may have to do is take the flour through a sifter to get out the chunkier bits and make do with what's left over.It'll still be delicious!

, You may have to use more than one if you've made a lot of flour, but keeping it fresh will definitely pay off in the long-term. And there you have it: ready-made flour for the dough of your dreams!


Keep your flour in a cool, dark place. This will prevent insects and sunlight from doing irreparable damage. If you'd like, place a bay leaf in with the flour to prevent bugs from bugging your flour., Whole wheat flour will go rancid especially fast, clocking in at only a few months if put in a cabinet. If it changes color or smells bad (which it won't do when kept cold), don't hesitate to throw it away.To freeze the flour, just put it in its resealable container and chuck 'er in. It'll keep for years. Just don't forget to use it occasionally!

, You may find that your homemade flour has a much different taste than you expected and acts quite differently when cooked (that's because it's super fresh). So don't use it straight away if you're looking for a gold medal at the fair. Experiment first.


Fresh flour gives the yeast more to feed on, resulting in more fermentation activity. This can change the tastes of recipes you have been baking for years. It should definitely change it for the better!"

It is easiest as a beginner to start with flat objects before advancing to 3D figures with details. Layering details over the initial figure should only be attempted when you feel confident about making the initial shape.

, There are several different ways that salt dough can be dried:

/images/thumb/c/c0/Create-Salt-Dough-Step-6.jpg/v4-300px-Create-Salt-Dough-Step-6.jpg









Air dry your decorations. Choose a warm, dry place to let the figures dry. Place figures on a grill to permit air circulation. This method will take about one week and is only suitable for small, flat and thin figures.
Air dry and use an oven. Allow for a little drying by air and then bake the figure in the oven for half an hour at 50ºC (122ºF). You can increase to 100ºC (212ºF) after the initial half hour if more time is needed.
Put your decorations directly into the oven. Set the the oven at 180ºF (82ºC) for about 10 minutes. Dry directly on the oven rack to ensure even drying over the entire figure.

, You do not want to brown or burn the figure.

Whisk the eggs, milk, and salt together.,
Whisk in the flour until it is completely mixed.,
Place the muffin pan in the oven for 2-3 minutes to warm.,
Divide the batter into each cup.,
Bake for 20 minutes at 450 °F (232 °C).,
Do not open the oven.,
Turn the heat down to 375 °F (191 °C) and bake for an additional 10 minutes.,
Remove the popovers and turn them out on a wire rack to cool.,
Use a knife to cut a slit in the bottoms.,
Serve while still warm.,
Add melted butter for a richer pastry.,
Top your popovers with shredded cheese before cooking.,
Try sweet popover recipes.,
Try out savory popover recipes.",How to Make Popovers," Popovers get their shape because the high heat quickly puffs up the steam inside the pastry, so your oven needs to be hot.

, You do not need a popover pan to make them, as a regular muffin dish will work fine. You can also use 6-ounce custard dishes.Non-stick cooking spray can substituted for butter.

, You can also use a food processor if you prefer.

, You do not want to overmix, as this leads to a coarse and chewy popover. Simply whisk it until there are no more chunks of flour, then stop.


You should see little air bubbles – this is what will cause the popover to rise later.

, To make popovers “pop” you need to preheat the pan. This heats up the batter and causes it to grow rapidly in the first 20 minutes in the oven.

, Put an equal amount of batter in each popover pan, muffin dish, or custard cup and put them in the oven.


Some cooks suggest quickly whisking the batter before pouring so that it is frothy and airy as it goes into the pan.Be careful-- the dish will still be hot from the oven.

, Quickly get the batter back into the oven after pouring the batter and cook it for 20 minutes.

, This is the golden rule of popovers! The high heat inside the oven creates steam that shoots the popover sky high, but even quickly opening the oven lets out enough heat to deflate them. Resist the temptation to check your pastries and leave the oven closed., After the first 20 minutes, the popovers will have a crispy shell and will retain their form. Lower the heat and cook them for an additional 10-20 minutes, or until the outsides are golden brown.


It is safe to open the oven door during this second cooking period.
If you have 2 pans of popovers in, rotate them now so that they heat evenly.

, The outside will be crispy and the popover won’t collapse or crumble, so quickly pull them out of the oven and set them aside to cool.

, This allows the steam to quickly escape the pastry and keep it crispy when you serve it., Popovers are best right out of the oven, so eat them right away whenever possible.

, Melt 2-3 tablespoons of butter and whisk it into the batter with the milk and eggs for a rich, buttery popover.


Let the butter cool slightly after melting it – otherwise it might cook the eggs slightly.;
, Simply sprinkle shredded cheese, such as gruyere or cheddar, on top of the batter before it goes in the oven, then cook normally. The final popover will by topped with crispy, delicious cheese.

, Simply add 1-2 tablespoons of sugar with the flour and whisk it into the batter, then add whatever other sweet ingredients your heart desires. Some ideas include:½ teaspoon vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons orange zest
½ teaspoon vanilla and 1 ounce chopped semisweet chocolate.Brush the tops of cooked popovers with melted butter, then sprinkle with ground cinnamon and sugar., Popovers are a fantastic addition to dinners in place of rolls or bread, and can be customized to fit your meal. Try mixing and matching the following variations, adding them to your batter with the flour:


¼ cup chives, chopped finely
¼ cup roasted shallots or garlic, chopped finely1 teaspoon rosemary, thyme, or basil, minced
4 pieces cooked bacon, finely chopped

Decide between white and regular whole wheat.,
Opt for whole wheat pastry flour for lighter bakes.,
Start with spelt when branching out from wheat.,
Add barley for creamy textures.,
Use oat to support chocolate, fruits, and nuts.,
Avoid “multigrain.” If you’re looking to eliminate baking with white flour entirely, read the package of any flour labeled as multigrain.",How to Bake with Whole Grains1," Regular whole wheat flour is arguably the most widely available whole grain flour, and perhaps the most often cited in recipes. However, be aware that it has a nutty and tannic flavor that may not always lend itself well to your baked goods. As an alternative, consider using white whole wheat instead, which has a milder flavor and can be used in direct ratios when substituting regular whole wheat or white flour in recipes.The difference between the two is which type of wheat berry is used to make them. Regular whole wheat flour comes from red wheat berries, while white whole wheat comes from white wheat berries.;
, Both regular and white whole wheat flours tend to result in heavier finished products. If the baked good you’re making is supposed to be light and crumbly, but the only whole grain available is whole wheat, go with whole wheat pastry flour. Expect pastry flour to have less protein than regular flour, and therefore less gluten when baked, which is what weighs down the texture of baked goods., If you’re looking to use flours other than whole wheat, begin with spelt. Utilize its sweet but mild flavor to avoid overpowering your baked goods, which is a risk with stronger grains that have bolder flavors. At the same time, eliminate the need to convert measurements in recipes, since spelt can be substituted in direct ratio to whole wheat flour., If you want a baked good that melts in your mouth, go with barley. However, be aware that it’s texture is very soft, so don’t ditch the whole wheat or all-purpose flour entirely. Instead, use half of the original amount that the recipe calls for (or, if you’re using spelt, an equal measurement of that), and then substitute the other half with barley., Whole wheat flour usually results in a heavier baked good, which you often need to support the weight of solid add-ins (like chunks or whole pieces of chocolate, fruits, and nuts). However, if you want your baked good to be less dense while still mixing in these ingredients, substitute half of the whole wheat or all-purpose flour in your recipe with oat flour. This will result in a lighter bake that’s still sturdy enough to keep those ingredients from sinking to the bottom as it bakes., Obviously, “multigrain” means that it is a combination of multiple grains, including whole grains. However, expect to find white flour listed as one of the flours mixed into many varieties of this product."

",How to Make Oat Flour," The type of oats traditionally used for oat flour are called ""rolled oats."" These can be bought for cheap at many grocery stores, but are not always available. Luckily, you can use instant, quick-cook, or steel cut as well -- the only difference is grain size, and you're grinding them all up anyway.


Don't use oats that have been flavored in any way, as this flavor will work into your final dish. Plain oats are best.
If you're going to be using your oat flour in a recipe immediately, measure out more oats than the recipe calls for. Once you turn them into flour, they'll settle and take up a smaller volume. You'll generally end up with about 3/4 of the volume of oats you started with.;
, Any standard blender or ""Magic Bullet""-type device will also work well.In a pinch, you could use a coffee grinder. Be sure to clean it out first unless you want coffee-flavored flour.Pulse for 30 seconds or until the oats reach a fine, powdery consistency.They should look a lot like traditional plain, all-purpose wheat flour.


No blender? There are a variety of ways to make manual flour, but you need to know they will take a while. You could try:

Mincing: Using your sharpest knife, rock it back and forth over a small pile of oats to quickly chop them up. They will be a little bigger than a real flour, but will still work.

Grinding: Using a mortar and pestle, grind the oats into a powder.

Mashing: A last-ditch effort, put the oats in a resealable plastic bag, squeeze the air out, and start crushing as if washing clothing by hand. Note that this will likely take a long time.

, It can be hard to tell whether any extra oats remain in your flour, so open the food processor or blender and stir the powder a few times to be safe. Pulse again for 10 seconds or so.

, Your oat flour is ready to use right away. You can use it roughly how you would use plain flour ordinarily, substituting it into recipes. If you need to save some, use the same rules you would use for ordinary flour. Keep it in a cool, dry place in an airtight container. Oat flour lasts for about 3 months in the cabinet and 6 months in the freezer.These are only estimates, and oat flour will never keep as long as whole oats. Only make as much as you can use in the next few weeks.
Hot and humid environments will lower the shelf life of your flour. Cold and dry areas may be able to store their oat flour a little longer without problems., The taste difference between plain flour and oat flour won't immediately jump out at you, but it's somewhat noticeable. Oat flour gives the baked goods a nutty flavor and a chewy texture, different from plain flour but not overwhelmingly so. This is perfect for certain dishes — specifically, savory-sweet baked goods tend to benefit from this taste profile.


The classic example, Oatmeal Raisin Cookies, are taken to the next level with oat flour.
In most recipes, you only need 3/4 cup flour for every 1 cup of plain flour. If a cookie recipe calls for 2 cups normal flour, you should use 1 1/2 cup oat flour.except in raised yeast breads that need gluten to give them structure.
If you're unsure how a baked good will respond, mix and match the flours. Instead of 1 cup of plain flour, try 3/4 oats and 1/4 wheat to get the textural benefits of gluten (it gives loaves of bread shape) without eating too much of it.

, One of the most popular ways oat flour is used today is as a gluten-free alternative to plain flour. Because gluten is a protein that naturally comes from wheat, using oat flour instead of all-purpose flour will usually remove the gluten from baked goods.



Note: The rolled oats you can buy at the store aren't always 100% gluten free. Small amounts of wheat can get mixed into the oats (usually, because the equipment used to process them is also used to process wheat). This can make a difference for people with Celiac disease or gluten intolerance, so be sure to use oats that are advertised as gluten-free to fully protect friends with Celiac disease.

, Compared to plain flour, oat flour is slightly less dense, which makes foods baked from it a little fluffier than they normally would be. This can be used to make wonderfully light muffins and biscuits, though it's also great for giving a unique texture to thicker pastries like scones and soda bread.


You don't need to substitute all of the flour to get this effect. To add lightness without losing the taste or consistency of plain flour, use a half-and-half mixture.
Try using oat flour in our scone recipe for a lighter version of this delicious breakfast treat.

, Just like ordinary flour, oat flour can be used as a coating for a wide variety of foods. For instance, if you're frying breaded cuts of meat, you can coat them with oat flour (instead of plain flour) before dipping in an egg wash and tossing with the breading. Oat flour can also be dusted on proved loaves (loaves that have finished rising, but aren't cooked yet) to create an attractive, crunchy crust.


Another excellent idea is to use oat flour when kneading bread dough to keep it from sticking to your work surface. Because of its lighter texture, it won't make the dough stiff if you incorporate too much.

, Oat flour is great for your body even if you don't have gluten intolerance. Oats are naturally rich in protein, fiber, and help your body burn fats. They are lower in carbohydrates than most grains and are known to have minor cholesterol-reducing properties.This makes oat flour an excellent choice for your recipes — even if there isn't a special reason to use it.


Oat flour has high levels of magnesium, making it very helpful for women going through menopause or menstruation. Magnesium deficiencies are a common cause of profuse menstrual bleeding.,"

Expect changes in flavor and texture.,
Start with darker baked goods.,
Ease into it with partial substitutions.,
Convert measurements when needed.,
Add more liquid than called for.,
Give the dough more time to absorb moisture.",How to Bake with Whole Grains2," Keep in mind that using whole grains instead of white flour will affect your baked goods’ taste and consistency. This doesn’t mean that all baked goods will taste better or worse with whole grains--just different. That said, depending on the type of baked good you’re making and your own personal tastes, anticipate having to do some trial-and-error with some recipes before you nail it., Expect the difference in whole grains’ taste to be most striking when used in goods whose finished color really reflects the use of white flour. Because of this, start off with baked goods whose color tends to be on the dark side with or without white flour. Give your taste buds a chance to adjust before attempting a bake where the difference will be more noticeable.For instance, go with a chocolate cake instead of a vanilla cake if this is your first bake with whole grains

, When you first attempt to bake with whole grains, don’t ditch the white flour right away. Instead, use the white flour for half the total flour called for by the recipe, and use whole grains for the other half. Note the difference in flavor and texture of your first batch. From there, decide if you'd like to increase the percentage of whole grains used in your next bake, or if you'd like to try again with a different type of flour., Whole wheat and spelt flours can generally be used in equal measurements to the amount of white flour that a recipe calls for. However, expect other whole grain flours to require conversions. For example, if you’re branching out into nuts and using almond flour, you should use double the amount called for in white flour.Search online for conversion charts to determine what if any conversion is needed for the type of flour that you’ve chosen to work with, like this one:
http://www.kingarthurflour.com/learn/ingredient-weight-chart.html

, Be aware that whole grain flours absorb more moisture than white flour. If you’re using a recipe that calls for white flour, expect the finished product to be on the dry side if you substitute the white flour entirely with whole grains. To compensate, add two more teaspoons of each wet ingredient than specified for each cup of flour used., At the very least, let it sit for 20 to 25 minutes after you make it before you go and knead it.For even better results, let it sit overnight. Additionally, try adding a tablespoon of lemon juice or another acidic ingredient. This allows the grains more time to soften while also breaking down more starch, which will make kneading easier."

Then, in a large mixing bowl, combine your flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut your butter into half-inch cubes (1.25 cm) and then work them into the flour mix with your hands, pinching them together, until they form what looks like breadcrumbs. Next, stir in the brown sugar and raisins, followed by the buttermilk. Now that you have your dough:Dust a surface with flour and then roll the dough into a rectangular shape approximately a quarter inch thick (0.64 cm).

Take any amount of blanched almonds, preferably sprouted.,
Once dry, place any amount of almonds inside a food processor, coffee bean grinder, Vitamix, or blender.,
Pulse until you get a fine, grainy consistency.,
Use immediately or label and store in a chilled place.",How to Make Almond Flour or Meal1," Any amount of almonds will do because the ingredients start and end with almonds. Nifty! Why blanched almonds for almond flour? Blanched almonds are simply almonds without their outer skin. These make for a more uniform-colored flour and a more even taste.









In order to blanch almonds, boil them for about a minute or two, uncovered. Use a cloth or your hand by rubbing the skin off or removing nut from the shell. Completely dry the almonds before using, as the water will make it into butter.
Why sprouted? Sprouted almonds simply mean almonds that are soaked overnight. They are easier for the human body to digest, making your overall experience more pleasant. Specifically, sprouting takes away toxic enzyme inhibitors so that the enzymes your body deploys during digestion can do their job.;
, Again, it doesn't matter how many almonds you use. It's probably better, however, to err on the side of fewer almonds, as almond flour has a relatively short shelf life — 3 to 6 months in the fridge and even less outside.







, This usually takes anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute, perhaps longer depending on your pulsing apparatus.









If you want finely textured almond flour, be sure to pulse the almonds a little longer. Be advised, however, that pulsing the almonds for too long can result in almond butter.

, Unused, room temperature almond flour can become rancid when it oxygenates for too long.

Prepare a surface for kneading.,
Combine the ingredients for your dough.,
Turn the dough onto your work surface.,
Wash your hands before kneading.,
Gather the dough into a pile.,
Punch the dough.,
Knead the dough.,
Consider the texture.,
Test if the dough holds its shape.,
Pinch the dough.,
Continue the recipe.",How to Knead Dough," It's easiest to knead dough on a flat surface that comes up to the level of your waist. Prepare a countertop, table, or another stable surface for kneading by cleaning it with warm, soapy water, then wiping it completely dry with a towel. Sprinkle flour over the dry surface so the dough won't stick when it's time to knead.









Some recipes call for kneading the dough inside a bowl. In these cases the dough is usually only supposed to be kneaded for a minute or two. For recipes requiring a kneading period of more than three minutes, plan to use a flat surface instead.
If you don't want to knead the dough directly on top of your table or countertop, you can line your work surface with parchment paper sprinkled with flour. Special nonstick surfaces designed to aid in kneading dough are available for purchase at baking stores.;
, Use the ingredient amount listed in the recipe you are using. Basic dough ingredients are usually flour, yeast, salt, and water. Mix the ingredients well with a wooden spoon in preparation for kneading.









If loose flour is still sticking to the sides of your mixing bowl, the dough is not yet ready to knead. Keep stirring it with a spoon until all the ingredients are combined.
If you're having trouble moving the wooden spoon through the dough, it's ready to be kneaded.

, Dump it from the bowl directly onto the flat surface you prepared. It should form a loose, sticky ball. The dough is now ready to be kneaded.








, Kneading requires working the dough between your bare hands, so wash them and dry them well before you begin. Remove your rings and other jewelry that might get caught in the dough, and roll up your sleeves so they don't get sticky. Since you're working with a floured surface, you may want to protect your clothes with an apron.








, When you first plunge your hands into the dough, it will be sticky and difficult to gather. Go ahead and work the dough with your hands, forming it into a ball, pressing it down and reshaping it. Continue doing so until the dough is no longer as sticky, and it becomes possible to shape it into a ball without the dough falling apart.









If the dough doesn't seem to be losing its stickiness, sprinkle more flour over the top and work it into the dough.
You can lightly dust your hands with flour to keep the dough from sticking too much.

, Press the heels of your hands into the dough, pushing forward slightly. This is called ""punching"" the dough and helps the gluten start working. Continue doing this until the dough is slightly springy.








, Fold the dough in half and rock forward on the heels of your hands to press it flat. Turn the dough slightly, fold it in half, and rock into it again with the heels of your hands. Repeat for 10 minutes, or as long as the recipe tells you the dough should be kneaded.









The kneading process should be rhythmic and steady. Don't work too slowly; handle each part of the dough quickly, never letting it rest for too long between turns.
10 minutes is a long time to repeat a physical task. If you get tired, have someone else step in and continue the kneading process.

, The dough starts out sticky and lumpy, but after 10 minutes of kneading it should be shiny and smooth. It should be tacky to the touch with an elastic feel. If any lumps or sticky parts remain, continue kneading the dough.








, Shape the dough into a ball and let it drop to your work surface. Did the ball shape stay intact? If the dough is ready, it should hold its shape.








, Dough becomes firmer as you knead it, just as winding a spring makes more winding more difficult. Pinch a bit of dough between your fingers. If it's ready, it will feel like an earlobe. When the dough is poked, it should spring back into shape.








, Most recipes instruct you to let the dough rise in a warm place for a few hours after the first kneading is finished. Once it has doubled in size, you may need to punch the dough down and knead it for a few more minutes, then let it rise again before baking.









If you kneaded the dough until it was firm, springy and shiny, your bread should have a crunchy crust with a soft, chewy interior.
If the dough was not thoroughly kneaded, the bread will turn out tough, dense and a little flat.

Have your child read aloud to you.",How to Teach Your Child to Read," As with all things, it's difficult to learn anything without exposure to it. In order to get your child interested in reading, you should be reading to them on a regular basis. If you’re able, this should start when they are an infant and continue through their school years. Read books with stories they comprehend; at a young age this may lead you to read 3-4 small books a day.


Books that combine other senses besides listening help your small child to comprehend the story as you read it. For example, read many books that have pictures, tactile pages, sounds, or have accompanying scents.
Try reading them books that might slightly challenge their comprehension level but that have an interesting or engaging story.;
, Even before your child learns to read, they can learn reading comprehension. As you read stories to them aloud, ask them questions about the characters or the plot. For a toddler, these may be questions like “Do you see the dog? What is the dog’s name?”. The questions can escalate in difficulty as the reading level does.


Help to teach your child critical thinking skills by asking open-ended questions about stories. You might not hear complex verbal responses until your child is four or five years old, but ask away and be patient.

, It’s no good if you have books around, but located in places that your child can’t easily take them. Keep books low to the ground and in typical play-areas so that your child begins to associate them with play activities.


Because your child may be touching and reading the books often, be sure to choose ones that have wipeable pages and that aren’t incredibly sentimental. Pop-up books may not be the best option for young children.
A fancy bookshelf may seem like the most attractive option, but until your child is in school focus on the utilitarian purposes of book storage.
Set up a reading space next to the bookshelf. Set some beanbags, pillows, and comfy chairs around to sit in while reading. The top of the bookshelf can hold cups and snacks for having while reading.

, Show your child that reading is interesting and worthwhile by reading for yourself. Spend a minimum of ten minutes a day reading when your child is around, so that they see you enjoying the activity on your own. Even if you’re not an avid reader, find something to read - a magazine, the newspaper, or a cookbook all count. Soon they’ll become interested in reading on their own, simply as a result of seeing you doing it too.


Include your child in your reading time. If you’re reading something child-friendly, tell them about what you’re reading. Accompany this by pointing to words on the page to help them connect the lines on the page with the sounds that form words.

, This can be done in two ways: create your own mini-library at home by collecting dozens of books in your child’s reading level, or make weekly trips to the local public library together to check out books. Having a variety of books on hand (especially with an older child) will add interest for reading, and help to incorporate more vocabulary into their knowledge base.


That being said, don't turn down a request to re-read a favorite book just because it's already been read a dozen times. , Before you even start getting into the alphabet and sound specifics, help your child recognize that the lines on the page are directly correlated to the words you are speaking. As you read aloud to them, point to each word on the page at the same time you say it. This will help your child grasp the pattern of words/lines on the page relating to the words you speak in terms of length and sound.

, Some companies have advertised specialized flashcards to help babies, toddlers, and preschool age children to read. In general, flashcards are not the most useful or effective technique for teaching reading skills. Time spent reading stories with your child will be much more beneficial than flashcards. “Reading aloud to young children, particularly in an engaging manner, promotes emergent literacy and language development and supports the relationship between child and parent. In addition it can promote a love for reading which is even more important than improving specific literacy skills.”, When your child has developed word awareness, begin breaking down words into individual letters. Although the alphabet song is the most classic means of teaching the alphabet, try getting creative. Explain each of the letters with their name, but don’t worry about trying to incorporate the sounds the letters make yet.


Teach lowercase letters first. Capital letters account for only five percent of all letters in writing English. Therefore, pay more attention to teaching the lowercase letters. lowercase letters are far more important in developing reading skills.
Try making each of the letters out of play-DOH, playing a toss game (where the child tosses a beanbag/ball onto a specific letter on the floor), or fishing for foam letters in the bathtub. These are all interactive games that encourage development on multiple levels., One of the most important steps in teaching reading is associating a spoken sound with a letter or letter-pair. This process is known as phonemic awareness. There are 44 speech sounds created by the 26 letters in our alphabet, and each sound must be taught paired with its letter(s) counterpart. This includes the long and short sound produced by each individual letter, as well as the specialized sounds some combined letters make (like ‘ch’ and ‘sh’).


Focus on a single letter/part/sound at a time. Avoid confusion and build a solid foundation by working at a steady pace through all of the speech sounds.
Give real life examples of each speech sound; for example, state that the letter ‘A’ makes the ‘ah’ sound, like at the beginning of the word ‘apple.’ This can be turned into a guessing game, when you speak an easy word (like apple) and have the child guess the letter that it starts with.
Use games similar to those used when teaching the alphabet, that combine critical thinking on the part of the child in order to determine sound/letter correlations. See the aforementioned list for ideas, but substitute in sounds.
It is easier for children to develop phonemic awareness when words are broken down into their smallest parts. This can be done with the clapping game (clapping out each syllable in a word) or by sounding-out words into their individual letters., Rhyming teaches phonemic awareness and letter recognition, in addition to the most basic English words. Read nursery rhymes to your child, and then eventually make lists of easy-to-read rhymes such as mop, top, flop, pop, and cop. Your child will begin to see the patterns of sounds that are made when certain letters are combined - in this case, the sound ‘o-p’ makes.

, Traditionally, children are taught to recognize a word based on its size, the first and last letters, and the general sound. This method of teaching is known as implicit phonics - working from the largest piece down. However, studies have shown that readable vocabulary dramatically increases (from 900 words to 30,000 words by the third grade) when taught in the opposite fashion: breaking each word into the smallest parts, and building them up into a full word - explicit phonics. Help your child to begin reading by having them sound-out each individual letter without looking at the overall word first.


Don’t move onto explicit phonics until your child has developed adequate phonemic awareness. If they cannot associate sounds with letters or letter pairs quickly, they need a bit more practice before moving onto complete words.

, Classically known as ‘sounding out’ words, decoding is when a child reads a word by making the sounds of each individual letter, rather than trying to read the whole word at once. Reading is broken up into two primary parts: decoding/reading a word, and comprehending its meaning. Don’t expect your child to recognize and comprehend words just yet; have them focus on decoding and sounding out word parts..


Don’t use whole stories or books yet; have your child read from word lists or from a basic story (not focusing on the plot). This is another great time to use rhymes for practice.
Decoding aloud is typically easier for the child (and you) to learn how to say the word. Have them break it into parts with clapping if necessary.
Do not be rigid in how the child pronounces the sounds. Regional accents and weak auditory skills make it hard for children to say most sounds in an academically correct way. Accept a reasonable effort. Recognize that learning sounds is only an intermediate step to learning to read, it is not the goal., By age four, most English speaking children already have an excellent grasp of grammar and in due time, they will learn all the formal grammatical rules. At this point, you need to concentrate only on the mechanical skill of reading, that is learning to decode new words and incorporating them in memory to build fluency.

, Certain words in the English vocabulary are spoken often, but don’t follow the typical phonics rules. These words are easier to memorize by shape association than by sound, and are therefore known as ‘sight words.’ Some sight words include ‘they,’ ‘she’, ‘an,’ ‘said,’ and ‘the.’ The complete list of sight words, called the Dolch list, can be found online and broken down into sections to work through.


Show your child sight words on a piece of paper. Le them copy it and after telling them what the word is, ask them to tell YOU what the words is.

, Odds are, your child will be in school by the time they are able to read and will be given their own reading material by their teachers. Help them to read these whole stories by encouraging explicit phonics use, and recognizing vocabulary. As their word recognition increases, they’ll be able to more fully understand story plots and meanings.


Allow your child to look at the pictures - it doesn’t count as cheating if they do. Image and word association is a helpful aspect of building vocabulary.

, After every reading session, have your child describe what the story was about to you. Try to get them to be detailed, but don’t expect an elaborate response. An easy and fun way to help encourage this is to use puppets who represent characters in the story, so your child can describe it to you through them.

, Similar to when you were reading stories to your child, every time your child reads ask them questions about what they’ve just read. At first it will be difficult for them to think critically about meanings of words and the buildup of character development and plot (or the semblance of those things in the most basic of stories), but over time they will develop the necessary skills to answer questions.


Make a questions list that your child can read; their ability to read and understand the provided questions is nearly as helpful as answering the questions themselves.
Start with direct questions, such as ‘who was the main character in the book?,’ instead of more abstract questions like ‘why was the main character upset?’

, Reading is a necessary precursor to writing, but as your child develops reading skills have them practice their writing in conjunction. Children learn to read faster and easier if they learn to write at the same time. The motor memory of the letters, listening to their sounds and seeing them in writing will reinforce new learning. So, teach your child to write letters and words.


You’ll notice an enhanced reading ability as your child learns to spell by decoding and sounding out words. Work slowly though, and don’t expect perfection.

, Just as you taught your child the joy of reading before they knew how, you should continue to promote reading by reading to/with them on a daily basis. They’ll develop a stronger phonemic awareness when they can see words as you read them, rather than struggling to do both at the same time themselves.

, You’ll be given a better idea of your child’s reading ability when they read out loud, and they’ll be forced to slow down their reading to correctly sound out words. Avoid stopping your child to correct them while reading though, as doing so can interrupt their train of thought and make comprehending what they’re reading more difficult.


Reading out loud doesn’t have to be limited to stories; whenever you are around words, have your child sound them out to you. Road signs are a great example of something your child sees on a daily basis, and can practice reading out loud to you."

Likewise, if you catch yourself demonstrating less-than-ideal behavior in front of your child, don’t be afraid to call yourself out. Let your child know, “It was rude of me to interrupt this person while they were talking. The polite thing to do is always to let someone finish speaking before you start to talk.”;
, Every conversation has a beginning, a middle, and an end. It is important to teach your child about these different parts of a conversation to help them build good communication skills. Some things that you might explain to your child to help them with their communication skills include how to:



Start a conversation. Teach your child about the best way to greet someone. For example, you might teach your child to say something like, “Hi, Christy! How are you today?”

Continue a conversation. Teach your child how to ask open ended questions to keep the other person talking, and about how to be a good listener. For example, you might teach your child to ask questions like, “How is your family?” or “How do you like your new teacher?” or “How was your vacation?”

End a conversation. Teach your child how to tell when a conversation is reaching its natural end. For example, the person might start looking around or go silent. When this happens, teach your child to say something like, “It was fun talking with you! Have a great day!” and then leave.

, It is important to explain to children that some topics of conversation are off limits. Otherwise, your child may unintentionally offend someone while talking with them. Make sure that you explain to your child what is and is not appropriate for conversations.


Some topics to teach your child that they should avoid include finances, politics, religion, death, sex, a person’s age or appearance, and gossip.Your child might not know enough about some of these topics yet to worry about them, so consider what suggestions would be the most helpful for your child.
For example, you might say to your child, ""I know you're really interested in money right now, but we don't want to ask Mr. Bob about how much money he makes because it might embarrass him. You can ask him about what does at his job.""

, Children may get excited and start speaking loudly indoors, or some children might not speak loudly enough for others to hear them. Teach your child about appropriate voice levels to help them know when they are being too loud, or not loud enough.


For example, you might say to your child, “When you are outside, you can yell and talk loudly. But when you are inside, it is important to speak in a lower voice.”
Or, “I know that you might think you are speaking loud enough for other people to hear you, but you are being so quiet that some people might not be able to hear. Can you try to speak a little louder so we can hear what you have to say?”

, Talk about your own feelings, and encourage your child to talk about theirs. This will help them not only communicate clearly, but teach them that expressing and listening to other’s feelings are important skills.Use sentences that start with ""I,"" instead of ""You"" to effectively convey your feelings to your child. For example, say ""I am upset that you didn't finish your homework"" instead of ""You make me upset when you don't finish your homework.""
When your child says something like, “I don’t like that!” ask them why they feel that way. Have an open dialogue about their feelings.
If your child is truly uncomfortable sharing, do not force them to talk. Do, however, try to ask them why they feel uncomfortable talking about their feelings.

, Ask questions of your child, and encourage them to ask questions of others. This helps your child understand that speaking with others is about engaging them. It encourages listening as well interacting with new people.


When your child is speaking with someone, encourage them to ask questions by saying things like, “Why don’t you ask your friend what they are going to do after school today?”
When your child is talking with you, ask questions like, “How was school today?” or “Do you like what you’re learning in your homework?”

, Use your regular playtime to show your child how to communicate clearly and effectively. Create storytelling games with your kid where you develop a narrative and dialogue together, and encourage them to practice their new communication skills while you play.Use dolls, action figures, sock puppets, stuffed animals, or whatever else your child likes to play with to help them with their communication. Create characters and have conversations.
Take turns talking and listening to your child in 10 or 15 second increments. For example, listen to your child while they talk for 15 seconds, then make your child listen to you while you talk for 15 seconds.

, If you have a shy or quiet child, help them learn how to be assertive. Ask them what they want or need, and let them know that it is ok to express their needs because if they don’t say something, no one will know what they want.Find certain situations where you can let your child call the shots. Allow them to pick what they want for dinner one night, or give them control of the remote for an hour on the weekend.
Encourage your child to be comfortable with themselves. Avoid statements that encourage peer worship by comparing your child to one of their friends or classmates. Instead, focus on their good traits and let them know it’s ok to be who they are.
If your child comes to you with a specific situation such as a bully, help coach them through their specific scenario to figure out the best way for them to stand up for themselves.

Get out a small white board or a piece of paper, whiteboard pens or markers, and, optionally, some candy.,
Sit the child down at a table and sit next to him/her.

,
Tell the child that today is the day that they learn to write their name.,
Put the paper/whiteboard and the pens/marker in front of the child.

,
First, write their name for them on the paper and explain that this is how you write their name.

,
Write their name but in little lines or spots so that they can trace them.,
Once their confidence grows, tell them to try it on their own.

,
They may take a while, but be patient.,
Check it to make sure they have drawn each letter correctly.,
Praise the child once they have done it correct a few times.,
Do this for a couple days, praising the child and giving the child a little more candy every day.",How to Teach a Child to Write Their Name1,";
,, It's okay if they can't write yet, this will give them a head start.

,,, Have them trace a few times until they get the hang of it.

,,


If their name is ""Jack"" or ""Emma"", this should be easy. But if their name is ""Kimberly "" or ""Madison"", this might take a while.

, Even if you see a small error like the letter ""a"" has it's line too long, correct the child immediately. It will be easier to correct now than later.

, Give them them a little bit of the candy. Tell them they have earned it. Then let the child go run and play.

, Soon, they will be able to write their name fluently and perfectly!

Place any amount of sprouted almonds in a food processor, coffee bean grinder, Vitamix, or blender.,
Pulse the almonds in the food processor for less time than you might have making almond flour.,
Use immediately or label and store in a chilled place.",How to Make Almond Flour or Meal2," While there is no official difference between almond flour and almond meal, the unofficial difference is that flour contains blanched almonds and meal contains almonds with the skins still intact.Therefore, if you decide to make almond meal or have a recipe that calls for meal, it may be preferable to make it using whole, sprouted almonds instead of blanched, sprouted almonds.

, Almond meal is generally (again, unofficially) supposed to be coarser than almond flour. If you pulsed your almond flour for 45 seconds, only pulse your meal for 30 seconds.








, Unused, room temperature almond meal can become rancid when it oxygenates for too long.

Get a large clock with big hands.,
Explain that the shorthand is the hour hand.,
Explain that the long hand is the minute hand.,
Demonstrate how to read the hour and minute hand together.,
Allow the child to quiz you.,
Quiz the child.",How to Teach Kids to Tell Time2," A clock with no glass or plastic cover and easily maneuverable hands will be the most approachable to work with.;
, Keeping the minute hand at 12, move the hour hand to various positions on the clock. Explain that any time the minute hand is exactly over the 12, it is __ o'clock. Allow the child to move the hour hand around until (s)he is comfortable reading it.

, Keeping the hour hand stationary, move the minute hand around and explain what each position means to your child. Start by covering the 5-minute marks; once they understand those, progress to the “off” numbers like 12 and 37. Allow the child to move the minute hand around and practice reading it until (s)he is comfortable. Don’t worry about hours for the time being.

, Start with simple times (ex. 1:30, 4:45, 8:05) before moving on to more complicated ones (ex. 2:37, 12:59) – especially ones with overlapping hands (ex. 1:05).

, This will give him/her confidence and a sense of control while simultaneously getting in another form of practice.

, Always be sure to do this after he or she has mastered the concepts as an encouragement technique.

Teach the child how to draw the face of clock on paper.,
Create “pie slices” on the clock.,
Use a crayon to demonstrate how the hour hand works.,
Draw a second clock numbered 1 through 12 with tic marks for the minutes.,
Use a pencil to demonstrate how the minute hand works.,
Demonstrate times using the pencil and crayon together.,
Allow the child to quiz you.,
Quiz your child.",How to Teach Kids to Tell Time3," To make it more fun, cut out a circular piece of paper beforehand (or use a paper plate) and fold it into four sections; the centre point (where the two folds cross) and the major markers (12, 3, 6, and 9 ) will then be clear.

, Draw a line from the center of the clock outwards to each of the 12 hour markers. Allow the child to color each pie slice differently if (s)he wants. (Starting with red at 1 o’clock and working upwards through the rainbow will make the number progression more intuitive than simply coloring each section randomly.)

, Move the crayon to various positions on the clock. Use the pie slices to your advantage by explaining that anything within a certain slice is __ o’clock. (Ex. the first, red slice is 1, the second, orange slice is 2, etc.) Allow the child to move the crayon around until (s)he is comfortable reading it.

, Don’t separate this clock into slices or color each section differently; that method makes less sense when dealing with minutes.

, Move it to various positions around the clock and explain what each position means to your child. Start by covering the 5-minute marks; once they understand those, progress to the “off” numbers like 24 and 51. Allow the child to move the pencil around and practice reading it until (s)he is comfortable. Don’t worry about hours for the time being.

, Make it clear that the shorthand (crayon) always shows the hour and the long hand (pencil) always shows the minutes. Position them to show simple times (ex. 1:30, 4:45, 8:05) before moving on to more complicated ones (ex. 2:37, 4:59). When the child is comfortable with these, demonstrate times with overlapping hands (ex. 12:00, 1:05).

, Have him or her list important times of the day (ex. bedtime, breakfast, when the bus arrives) and demonstrate them on the paper clock. Once you’re confident in his or her ability, make a mistake and allow yourself to be corrected.

, Always be sure to do this after he or she has mastered the concepts as an encouragement technique.

Attach to the wall with a nail and molly bolt (butterfly bolt in some cases for dry wall and wooden studs or with a screw with a plastic sleeve for a cement wall, electric drill and hammer.

,, As an initial project, ask them to make the bell schedule, matching it to the new clock.

, This shows them the usefulness of both learning to read and to tell time.

,


Put a sticky note on the schedule showing a different time each day.
Reward the youngster who correctly points out the arrival of the time, and reads the sticky, as well as telling the reason for noting the time.

Give him some books.,
Set a positive example by reading books.,
Teach the alphabet.,
Build phonemic awareness.,
Help the child sound out words.,
Teach sight words.,
Ensure that the reading area is quiet, free of distractions, and comfortable.,
Begin by reading the book aloud.,
Ask your child to read for you.,
Read the same stories several times.",How to Teach a Child to Read," Make reading part of the routine every day. It is never too early to start reading to a child. Reading to infants has even been shown to lead to early brain development and improves language, literacy and social skills., An engaging storyteller will help to keep the child interested in the book. Even if the child is too young to understand the story, your voice can express happiness, sadness, anger, or many other emotions that will give the child some context to go with the pictures.

, Make sure the child is able to see your finger pointing to each word as you say it. Even if it does not seem like he understands the words, he will begin to realize that the squiggly lines on the page are related to the words that are spoken.


You don't have to just stick to the story. You can pause and use rich vocabulary to describe the pictures, or voices to describe the character. This will help stimulate the child's imagination, too. , Pause while reading to get the child involved in the story. Keep the questions simple. For example, if there is a dog in the story, you can ask the child what color it is. This will help the child to learn to process the story better and lead to better reading comprehension., In order to teach the child to read, having plenty of books to explore will help to spark an interest in reading.


Board books and cloth books are great for infants and toddlers. These books will hold up better than paperback or hardcover copies, and the thicker pages make it easier for children to turn the pages.As the child gets a bit older, focus on rhyming books like Dr. Seuss or books that have songs like ""Barnyard Dance"" or ""Snuggle Puppy"" by Sandra Boynton.
Get a library card. Take the child on regular visits to your local library. Go to the children's section and let the child pick the book he wants to read. Once a week on a set date (Friday after school for example) is also a good way to get into a structured routine. It's alright if he is a bit too old for the book or has already read it. When he is a bit older, let him check out the book at the front desk, but always under your supervision.

, If a child notices that you are enjoying a book, he will be more likely to develop an interest in reading as well. Try to read around them for about 20 minutes each day. If the child gets curious about what you're doing you can tell him about the book you are reading, or take the opportunity to ask if the child would like to find a book to read.

, To begin the process of reading the child will need a solid understanding of the alphabet. In addition to singing the alphabet, the child should develop an understanding of letter shapes and sounds.


Start with an alphabet book.Make it fun by playing games. You can get some alphabet letters for the fridge, or cut out a bunch of letter shapes and decorate them with objects that begin with each letter. For example, cut out a letter S shapes and have him decorate it by gluing sunflower seeds or applying star stickers.

, Phonemic awareness is the process of associating letters or letter shapes with the corresponding sounds. Children will need to learn the 44 sounds made by the 26 letters of the alphabet.You can use a list of phonemes and help the child learn to correlate the sounds with the letters of the alphabet.


Teach the child how to pronounce each phoneme. Focus on one letter at a time and teach the child how to pronounce them correctly. Say the letter, then tell him the sound it makes. For example, ""the letter A makes an ah sound. Then give him examples of words that start with that sound such as apple or ant.
There are a lot of great apps that have fun games to help teach a child phonemic awareness, many of them such as ABC Genius and Build A Word Express are even free to download.

, Once the child can identify the first sound of one syllable words, teach him to add the ending. Use a picture to break up the letters and make each individual sound, then ask the child what the word is. This will help him to understand how each of the sounds created by letters will work together to form words.Have the child practice sounding out the words in the same way.


Put one syllable words together in a two or three word sentence. Have the child practice reading the sentence by sounding out each word. Try working with some of the pages in the Spot series by Eric Hill. They have many sentences of short, one syllable words.
Once he has the hang of sounding out one syllable words, add another syllable. Keep challenging the child to sound out longer words.

, Sight words are any short, common words that a child will see often. Some examples of common sight words include plant, father, their and here. Many of these words are difficult to sound out. The best way for a child to learn these words is through repeatedly seeing the word in the context of a sentence and alongside the object it represents.There are a number of books that focus on teaching sight words. Often times books with sight words will indicate that on the cover.
Use cards with sight words on them and help the child put them alongside the objects they represent. Eventually the child will begin to associate the written word with the object on their own.
Use flashcards to teach sight words. Show the child the card and pronounce the word. Spell it out and use it in a sentence. Then go through and have the child say the word, spell the word and use the word in a sentence. Repeat until the child can identify all the cards.
Play games to help the child learn, like bingo.Mark the spaces on a bingo board with sight words, then call the words out. The child must identify the word on his card and mark it.
Point out word families. Word families are groups of words that rhyme. Make sure the child notices words that rhyme, such as cat, pat, hat. Once, the child sees the words written and hears the similarity of sounds he will begin to identify the at sound and how it appears when written.

, Turn off any televisions or electronic devices that could cause the child to lose focus. Put away any toys that might be too tempting to play with.

, Choose and read aloud a paragraph, or a page of a book. If you start the reading, this helps to set the tone for enjoying the reading activity together. You will also be giving them a good example of fluent reading so the child can hear how the story should sound.

, As your child reads, he will pause on words he is not familiar with.


When your child pauses, immediately provide the word for him and let him move on. Underline or circle in pencil the words he initially cannot read.
Go back and review any incorrect words and help read the words correctly.

, With practice, the child will be able to correctly read more words each time through. By going over the same words again and again, the child will eventually be able to read the story more fluently.The words will be easier to decode and the child will need to stop and sound them out less often.

Actively listen to your child.,
Verify that your child is listening.,
Curb interruptions.,
Read books to your child on a routine basis.,
Play listening games.",How to Teach Your Child Good Interpersonal Communication Skills2," Demonstrate active listening when your child is talking to you by letting them finish their thoughts and asking them questions to engage them further. This will demonstrate to your child that paying attention to others when they speak is an important aspect of interpersonal communication.Sit down or kneel to your child's eye level so you can make eye contact when they speak to you.
Remove distractions that make it difficult to hear your child by turning off the radio or television, or by moving into a quiet room away from others.
Display signs of verbal and nonverbal listening as your child speaks; such as nodding your head or saying short, verbal expressions that prove you are listening.

, This will help your child understand that they must listen to others in addition to being listened to for means of effective interpersonal communication. When you are addressing an important matter with your child, ask them to pay attention and listen closely.Ask your child to repeat what you said back to you in their own words, and show them encouragement when they do so by thanking them.
If you have to repeat something because your child was not listening, let them know, “It is important to listen the first time you are told something. I will not repeat this again.”

, Teach your child not to interrupt others when they speak. A good display of interpersonal communication is allowing others to speak fully and express their opinions without being disrupted.If you catch your child interrupting someone, let them know, “It’s another person’s turn to speak right now. You should always let someone finish speaking before you start.”
Demonstrate the courtesy of not interrupting your child when they speak to you by allowing them to speak in entirety about a particular matter.

, This will help teach your child to listen when they are being spoken to, while at the same time providing them with a fun experience. Find stories your child will find engaging in order to keep them listening closely.Practice both listening and speaking by having your child read certain characters in the book. Let them listen while you read and pay attention so that they know when their turn is coming. Then, let them lead the conversation as they read for their character.

, Mix playdates and practice listening by having your child play games that encourage them to listen. Games such as musical chairs help encourage your child to listen carefully while they are having fun.Telephone is another game that encourages careful listening. Pick a phrase, and whisper it to your child. Then, have your child whisper the phrase to a friend. Continue the process down a line of friends until you reach the last one, and have the last person say what they heard.

Explain nonverbal signals.,
Encourage sharing.,
Look your child in the eyes.,
Encourage observation.",How to Teach Your Child Good Interpersonal Communication Skills3," One of the easiest ways to help your child understand nonverbal communication is by simply explaining it to them. When you see that your child has missed a nonverbal signal, stop them and let them know what is going on.If, for example, your child doesn’t recognize that wide eyes mean fear, let them know that big eyes and restricted pupils may indicate that a person is afraid or uncomfortable.

, Sharing and playing together requires a host of nonverbal skills as well as verbal skills, and helps foster trust and understanding. Encourage your child to share with their siblings, friends, and peers.Demonstrate both verbal and nonverbal means of sharing. Ask your child, “Would you like to try this?” on some occasions, and on others offer something to them without words.

, Teach your child the importance of looking people in they eyes when they speak by getting on their level and looking them in the eyes when you speak to them. Likewise, when they speak to you, ask them to look you in your eyes.Explain to your child that it is polite to look others in the eyes because it shows they have your attention and that you are listening carefully.

, When you and your child are in a place where you can see others interacting, encourage them to observe the nonverbal commutation between others. Ask them questions, and let them analyze the situation for themselves.

If, for example, you are at the store with your child, you could ask them if people in the check-out line seem happy, and let them explain why or why not.

, Place the felt letters on the felt or flannel board, just like step 2. Say the letters of the child's name together after they have spelled it out.

, The tactile letters do not have any special place to be placed but, you can lay them on a table, floor, or any clean, hard, surface. Feel the letter every time you pick a new letter up. Tell the child what the letter is unless they have learned letter recognition already. If they are trying to learn letter recognition, ask them what the letter is. If they get it right, give praise. If they get it wrong praise them for trying and tell them what the letter actually is. After the child has spelled their name, praise them and review the letters.

Start out with a simple task.,
Circle Time: This is the central component of any preschool classroom, and as such, you should take a lot of time and effort into making it engaging not only for the students, but for the parents as well.,
Cubbies: Coat hooks, milk crates, or box shelves can all serve as cubby areas for children.,
Teacher supplies: In addition to basic supplies that should be offered by your center, there are several items you may need to request or buy yourself.,
Understand that creating centers can be a bit of a challenge.,
Math & Science: These toys and activities can take many forms, but many are fine motor toys.,
For general centers, there needs to be plenty of manipulatives.,
Reading center: This is usually treated as a quiet area.,
Blocks: Blocks are not only great for fine motors, but are easily one of the most popular centers in any preschool classroom.,
Ideally, you can go outside every day.,
Gross motor examples include:


Bowling with paper towel rolls and a large ball
CDs with dance music
Obstacle courses.,
Dramatic Play: This is a center that should change at least monthly and should be based on the monthly or weekly theme.,
Free art: Some teachers overlook this area because most classes have a daily art project.,
Art displays: Children are, and should be, proud of their work.,
Sensory: This can seem like an easy center to work on, but many teachers aren't creative enough.,
a ""garden"" with dirt, shovels, watering buckets, and beads for seeds


sand with dinosaurs, brushes, and magnifying glasses
an aquarium with rocks, toy houses, toy fish, and plants
finger painting with paint and shaving cream.

,
Puzzles and Games: Educational games and puzzles are crucial for not only fine motor skills, but also the specific skill each puzzle focuses on.",How to Set Up a Preschool Classroom," Choose your name. You can use your real name, but you can also choose one based on an animal, clothing item, food, street name, location. (i.e. Mrs. Cheetah). Just use anything that appeals to your class.;
, Some things a circle should have:


a calendar
teacher books (books not accessible by the children during the day, but rather used only during circle or reading times with the teacher)
a CD player for any audio books, singing activities, or dances.
a cork, white, or felt board for placing your circle time items. Some things to put on the board:

a letter or sight word of the week,
a Spanish Word of the Week,
a Star of the Day
Daily Job List
a Class Constitution (list of rules, preferably child-directed)
a schedule for the day and/or week
a ""Homework"" Center (optional activities to do at home)
an emotions wheel
a weather wheel or chart
information about that week and/or month's theme(s).



, Names should be clearly displayed. You may choose to make a separate area for lunchboxes and water bottles to reduce clutter.

, Some of these include:


art supplies
books (organize by theme or author)
office supplies
organizing tools
dress-up clothes
cooking supplies
cleaning supplies
bulletin board materials
lesson plan book
curriculum guides.

, Add a STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) one to encourage early recognition of STEM, although you can do a math/science center instead. Treat the center like a ""half-team"".

,


Pattern toys, such as multicolored bears or shape blocks are great for spatial understanding. Melissa & Doug are a great resource for these.
There are various things you can do for a color mixing center, and there are many toys you can buy, but simply allowing access to watercolors and displaying a color wheel is enough for most kids to get pretty creative.
Use your weekly or monthly theme to your advantage; using ladybug spots to create an addition game or The Very Hungry Caterpillar to encourage patterns are examples of creative ways to incorporate your theme.
In the spring, catching bugs for a day or two can be fun; there are many companies that offer ants, caterpillars (and thus butterflies), and red worms (for classroom compost bins) for educational purposes.

, These can include:


Legos
Kinex
People and cars
Animals
Mr. Potato Head
Letters and numbers (magnets, felt, or plastic)
Lincoln logs
TinkerToys
Play-doh or clay.

, Try to keep the number of children allowed in this center to 2-3, as more than that can cause the area to become an imaginative play center. Keep well-stocked with age-appropriate, theme-based books.

, The different types of blocks you can get for this center are almost infinite, but just the classic wooden blocks are enough for most children to create everything from New York City to their own fantasy castle.

, In reality, there are days when the weather just doesn't let that happen. You need to make sure there are gross motor activities for inside, though this ""center"" may be kept in the closet until appropriate times, as it can be space consuming and difficult for children to not use during curriculum times. Some great indoor activities include:


Ask: Who wants to get outside? Hopscotch is great for a gross motor area.
Incorporate outdoor activities that you liked to do while growing up.

, Get the kids to be creative and make their own out of materials in the classroom! You can use hula hoops, balance toys (or simply a line made out of masking tape), and cones.
Hopscotch (this can be made out of tape).


You can also look up various exercises, such as stretches, easy aerobics, and easy yoga and do them in a center.







, For instance, it can be a puppet theater while learning about fairy tales, an airport with luggage and passports for Around the World, or a post office to learn addresses.


This may include costumes, makeup and props. Try to limit makeup, if you have any, as there is no need to instill this lesson so young.

, Daily projects are not enough! Children need access to art not only for their own enjoyment but for development of fine motors, letters, and creative expression.

Scrap paper and crayons are the bare minimum, but don't be afraid to give them access to age-appropriate scissors, markers, and even watercolor paint.






Try to limit the number of children allowed in the center at one time, or else it might get crazy.
You may even want to set up a 1-2 person easel center for free painting. This can encourage even the most stubborn child to practice letters and shapes.

, Having their projects on display is important to them and their families. Make sure each child displays at lest one piece of his or her work.

, Playing with various toys in rice or water is only fun for so long. Don't afraid to get messy - but use smocks or old t-shirts! Some creative ideas:


""goo"" made from various household items (an easy one is simply corn starch, water, and food coloring)

,, There are games that emphasize patterns, math, feelings, dinosaurs, and pretty much anything you can think of. Keep this center rotating by putting out puzzles and games that are related to the theme and putting away either inapplicable games or those which the children are tiring of.

Read expressively.,
Pause to let the child study the pictures.,
Pause to let the child predict.,
Adjust your reading based on the child’s body language.,
Be patient with a child new to reading.,
Ask the child questions about what they read.",How to Read Aloud to a Child1," Your tone sets the stage for a story just as much as the words and images do. Determine to add inflection to your voice when you sit down to read a book out loud. Perform the voices of the different characters, too. Reading with expression means that you’re reflecting the tone of the story, and you should read slowly so that the child has time to think about what is happening.Adding voices can grab the attention of a bored or distracted child.;
, Your goal in reading aloud to a child is to help them understand the story and relate to it. Pausing until it looks like the child is done studying the pictures is one way to make sure that they are understanding that the words you read are describing these images.If you’re sitting with a child in your lap or beside you, they may want to turn the page themselves, which can also indicate that they have finished studying it.
Pay attention to the child, and if they seem like they are trying to get you to move through the book faster without taking the time to study the images, ask them questions about the pictures or the story so far to help them connect with the story.

, As children grow, they become more and more cognitively aware. If they are old enough, pause in the middle of the book to ask the child if they think they know what happens next. Tell them to guess what happens, and then confirm or correct these predictions as you work your way through the book.Don’t shut down predictions if you know they aren’t the “right” ones; encourage the child to think in terms of “possibilities,” affirming their guesses and referring to what actually happens in the book as “what the author had in mind.”

, Pay attention to the way the child is behaving. If they are twisting in place and commenting on other things going on in the room, you know that they are bored or distracted. Adjust for such behavior by adding more inflection to your tone or asking questions to help the child engage.You may also just need to shorten how long it takes to read a book next time.

, Being still long enough to understand what a book says can be difficult for a child who has not been read to very often. Children need time to develop interest in books. To help with this, begin reading stories aloud that are short and have bright colors. Pay attention to what they like and make sure this element is included in each reading time.For example, a child may like characters who are dogs; or they may like it when you read the mother character with a particular-sounding voice.
For children who are active, you may find success with giving them something to fiddle with while you read, like a ball of playdough or a crayon and paper.

, When you finish the book, ask the child questions to help them remember what they just read. You can also ask them what they think happens after the story ends. Just try not to turn this questions into a quiz or drill, so that it doesn’t feel like reading is a task they “have” to do.Try asking, ""What happened at the end of the story?""
You could also ask, ""What was your favorite part?""
Even ask, ""Who was your favorite character?""

Pick out an interesting book.,
Preview the book.,
Plan when and where to read it.,
Introduce the book to the child.",How to Read Aloud to a Child2," There are potentially thousands of children’s books on the market today, and you can find plenty of them at your local library. Look through your personal collection or go to the library in order to select a book that will grab a child’s attention.Books that tend to be successful with young children include those with bright pictures, funny-looking (and therefore memorable) or familiar characters, and predictable plots.

, You want to be able to anticipate the questions and reactions that the child will have to the story you pick out so that a reading session stays fun. It is good to flip through the story you have selected and make sure you understand the characters or plot—or both—so that you can answer the child’s questions as you read, instead of having to do this while you read, interrupting the story.If you are allowing the child to pick the book out themselves, you can distract the child and flip through it for a moment before sitting down to read.
Try making suggestions to the child if you see a title you are already familiar with.

, Decide on a fun place for reading the story ahead of time and designate this area as the “story spot.” Repeating reading times in this same place will teach the child to associate that area with reading, allowing them to look forward to story time. Make sure that the area suits your needs for reading books aloud, depending on how you like to conduct story time.Set aside about 15 minutes at a time for reading out loud.
If you like to sit and hold the book up for the child to see, make sure you have an area wide enough for the child to get comfortable and see the book.
If you like the child to sit next to you and look at the book with you, turning the pages themselves sometimes, make sure you have a couch or bench long enough to fit both of you.
A comfortable chair like an easy chair or rocking chair is suitable if the child will sit in your lap as you read.

, When you sit down to read, show the child the cover of the book and read them the title and author. Point out interesting portions of the cover art, and ask the child what they think the story may be about. You may even want to offer a reason why you selected this book in particular.For example, you may choose a book because you think it will be fun, such as having a character in it that you know the child loves, or because the story was one of your favorites when you were a child.

Decide to help children develop language skills.,
Try to create a positive view of books and reading.,
Attempt to build a foundation for success in school.,
Try to give a child social context and knowledge.,
Be a role model.,
Try to encourage a child's imagination.",How to Read Aloud to a Child3," Reading is one of the most important keys for language development. Reading out loud teaches children what words are supposed to sound like: it teaches them to connect sounds with letters. The more words a baby hears, for example, the broader their vocabulary at age 3.Yes, you can simply talk to your infant to boost how many words they hear, but reading gives you words so that you don’t have to think of things to say, and it teaches the baby new words.

, When you read to your child one-on-one, it adds to their perception of reading as a positive, nurturing activity. Not only that, it has been proven that reading out loud helps children cope with trauma. Reading out loud helps children return to reading later in life, both because it reminds them of happy times with parents and because it helped them through a hard time., Difficulty reading leads to failure in school, which of course leads to problems later in life. Exposing children to reading even before they can read exposes them to words and experiences they would have never received in daily life, which lays the foundation for them to be familiar with concepts they will later learn in school.Failure in school leads to social problems like delinquency, teen pregnancy, and substance abuse.

, Reading out loud familiarizes children with experiences they would not otherwise be exposed to, giving them knowledge before they ever enter school. It also teaches them to have a bigger vocabulary, which can help them get further in life.For example, teachers tend to pay attention to kids who have better reading comprehension than the rest of class, and often provide them with access to books at higher levels of reading, giving a child more knowledge than other students.

, Reading to a child provides you with an opportunity for a child to look up to you because when you are excited about reading, a child will be too. You set the example for your child to become a reader, and when they engage with reading over time, they turn to you for help., Reading out loud provides children with a world they can imagine, even when the book already contains pictures. Books give children ideas, characters, and settings outside of their experience, which they often will explore when playing “pretend.”"

Create rules.",How to Provide a Safe Environment at Preschool," You should have enough employees to supervise all of the children in your preschool, and to ensure that all of the areas in the preschool where children congregate are monitored at all times by staff members. Additionally, you should require that your staff is trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and is certified in first aid.;
,


Employees need to have references checked on, and pass a background check.
In the US (and most other locales) there are legal ratios of staff to children, dependent on age.
Staff get sick, need to go to training sessions and meetings, need to go to medical appointments, vacations take lunches and breaks--be sure there is coverage with substitutes to allow this.

, Make sure there are no blind spots where children can get lost from your sight.


If you use cubicles or partition walls, configure them in a way that allows you to see around them from as many angles as possible. For example, it is better to put a partition wall at a right angle to a perimeter wall than it is to put 2 partitions walls at right angles to each other in the center of the room.
Set up play areas in the center of the room.
Arrange chairs, desks and work tables in circles.

, When it comes to preparing, storing and serving food, there are a number of precautions you should take to ensure daycare safety. Your government's daycare facility regulatory agency can provide you with a comprehensive manual of food safety guidelines.

,


Ground covering must be soft to cushion falls.
The height of swings, slides and other playground equipment must be a safe distance from the ground.
There should be no bolts, nuts, screws or other fasteners protruding from the playground equipment in a way that could potentially harm children.
Openings must be large enough to ensure that body parts cannot get trapped. A standard rule is to make sure there are no openings between 3.5 inches (8.4 cm) and 9 inches (21.6 cm) wide.
Space play equipment at least 12 feet (3.7 m) apart.
Clear traffic areas of tripping hazards. Examples of tripping hazards include tree branches, boulders, sudden shifts in elevation and tree stumps.
Check playground equipment regularly for ease of operation and structural integrity.
Elevated platforms should have guard rails.
Encircle the playground with a tall safety fence, and make sure any gates leading to the outside are locked.

, In a preschool environment, cleaners, insecticides, first aid solutions, medications and all other toxic substances should be kept in a high, flame-resistant and safety-locked cabinet.

, Common environmental safety issues include water impurities, lead-based paint, mercury, asbestos, waste management and indoor air pollutants like mold/mildew, carbon monoxide, tobacco smoke, allergens and dust. Call the appropriate authorities to the premises to test for environmental hazards before allowing children to enter the preschool environment, and place applicable electronic detectors throughout the facility.

, Conduct fire and natural disaster drills on a regular basis to ensure that everyone at the preschool is familiar with the proper procedures for handling emergency situations.

, Rule lists can be used in a variety of ways to promote a safe environment at preschool.


Post school rules clearly where are preschoolers can see them, and be sure to address them on a regular basis so that the children are familiar with them. For example, rules like ""keep your hands to yourself"" and ""tell the teacher if you have a problem with another student"" can help prevent physically harmful arguments in the preschool environment, and rules about washing hands and covering sneezes can help prevent the spread of illness.
Establish a set of rules for picking up and dropping off preschoolers. For example, you may require parents to provide photo IDs, fill out forms for other parties they wish to pick up their children, sign in and out, stay inside a pickup zone during pickup time and/or call ahead of time if the pickup method is to temporarily change.

Visit the school or kindergarten in advance.,
Meet the teacher.,
Obtain the school handbook.,
Shop together to obtain school supplies.,
Obtain a class schedule.,
Be organized.,
Reassure your child.,
Be supportive but also learn to let go.",How to Prepare a Child for the First Day of School or Kindergarten," Many schools and kindergartens encourage the student and parents to attend the place before term starts. This way, the child and parents can both become familiar with the location, layout and look of the school. Look for such areas as the classroom, bathroom and cafeteria. This will be a good visual reassurance for your child and will help you to discuss things about the classroom, grounds, lunch area with your child in advance and during school year.;
, It is very important to meet the teacher in advance if possible. That way, both you and your child will feel comfortable with knowing her or him before class commences. This will also ensure that your child recognizes a familiar face immediately upon the first day of class.

, It is important to know the expectations of the school in advance. Ask for a copy and read it well. If you have any questions about the rules, the requests for money etc., ask them as soon as possible. It is also important to work through the rules with your child so that she or he is aware of what is expected during school attendance.

, A big part of the fun is getting school supplies and this should be a shared experience. Following the supplies list given to you by your school, within the boundaries it gives you can allow your child to select his or her own favorite items to take to school. Often there will be leeway on a pencil case style or name stickers etc. that will allow you to personalize your child's things. If the school supplies most of the items already, you can still buy some personalized items such as a pencil case or backpack.

, This will allow you to discuss the day's activities with your child in advance. Try to link this with the things that you do everyday so that the child begins to see the connection between daily schedules of things to do and routine that all of us practice.

, From the start, it is really important to get into a routine of being organized, both for you and for your child. Together pack the backpack with the school items. Together select the outfit to wear (or lay out the uniform). In the morning, it can be a great thing to start preparing lunches together as early on as possible. That way, your child has a stake in making healthy lunches and will eventually evolve into packing his or her own lunch a grade or so down the track. Early good habits last.

, Spend time together before school commences talking about school, about your own love of learning and about the friendships that develop at school. Boost your child's confidence by telling positive experiences and of all the things your child will enjoy about school.

, On the first day, give plenty of hugs and reassurance but also be balanced and let go. If you have done a good job beforehand of emphasizing all the positives of attending school and you have involved your child in all the preparations, this should be an exciting and fun opportunity for your child and he or she should feel more willing to attend. Tell your child you'll be waiting for her or him at day's end and be sure to be on time!

Play with your child.,
Note what toys interest your child.,
Imitate and expand upon your child’s play.,
Introduce your child to new experiences.,
Provide your child with terms for new things.,
Read to your child.,
Don’t place limits on your child.",How to Play House," Provide your child a space (or two) in your home, apartment, or yard that is a special make-believe space. In this space, your child is free to create and explore imaginary worlds. Your child is in control of the space and directs the pretend play that occurs within it. The space may be a bedroom, playroom, family room, patio, or yard.If you are limited on space, it is still possible to designate a play area for your children. Consider:


If your children currently are not sharing a room, move them into one bedroom and transform the second room into a play area.
Make a mobile play station. Place all of your children's toys in a movable chest or tub. You can move the toys from room to room throughout the week or day.
If the weather permits, take your child to a public park or outdoor play area.;
, Playhouses provide your little one with a magical, transformative space in which to dream up new worlds and act out familiar scenes. The playhouse you create does not need to be grand and elaborate (although it certainly could be). Many children are thrilled to play within a pretend home built out of cardboard boxes., The playhouse is your child's personal space. To give them a sense of ownership of the space, allow them to decorate their playhouse. Provide them with the decorations and tools, such as markers, stickers, crayons, craft paper, and other odds and ends, and then let their creativity take over. They may choose transform the cardboard boxes into a pirate ship or a space station instead of creating a traditional house., When children play house, they are exploring the roles of mommy and daddy. While playing house, your child will often imitate tasks they see you perform in the home. This type of play is benefited by toys based on household items. Fill the playhouse with mini home appliances, food items, dishes, cleaning tools, power tools, and furniture.Too many toys can overwhelm some children. Only keep out a small sample of your child’s toys. Throughout the following weeks or months, you can rotate through the toys to keep your child engage in the pretend play., While it is tempting to sit back and watch your child play, or narrate their make-believe, playing together is beneficial to you and your child. When you join in on your child’s play, you teach them new things and develop a lasting bond with your little one. Actively involve yourself in the game of make-believe by coming down to your child’s level and role playing with them., When you join your child in play, it is important that you allow them to take the lead. This is their imaginary world, you are just a guest. Before you jump into the game of house, observe what toys your child is using.


If your child is drawn to the kitchen toys, direct your role play towards food-related make-believe. Perhaps you are a guest over for dinner or a child wanting breakfast.
If your child wants to play with the cleaning tools, gear yourself up to become their helper as they clean their playhouse.If your child does not know how to pretend play, you may need to start of the role play. Once they are comfortable, step back and let they take control.

, After noticing the toys your child is drawn to, observe how they are using the toys. If they are not using a toy, such as an iron or drill, in a traditional manner, don’t correct them. Instead, mimic their actions. By copying their actions, you will encourage them to complete new actions. Occasionally, introduce your child to a new, or more common, way of using the toy. Complete the action once and then wait to see if your child copies it., When you expose your child to new experiences, you provide them with material for their pretend play. For example, when you take your child to the zoo, you provide them with the knowledge and language they need to recreate and elaborate upon this experience.In order to equip your child to play house, you need to model and and explain different household experiences. These may include:


Cleaning
Cooking
Folding laundry
Paying bills
Mowing the lawn
Watering flowers
Caring for a sibling

, Children encounter new things each and every day. Instead of passing by these items, people, places, and feelings, take a moment to provide your child with the correct name and a minor explanation. Doing so will increase their vocabulary, enhance their understanding of the world around them, and heighten their creativity.


You can label basic items, such as trucks, mailboxes, shopping carts, and coffee mugs.
You can name people or professionals you encounter. They may include mailmen, cashiers, zookeepers, or extended family members.
You can tell your child when you have arrived at the store and pool, or in the laundry room or kitchen.
You can describe feelings to your child, such as hunger, anger, excitement, or fear., When you read your child books, or tell them stories, they gain several important pretend play skills. First, stories can inspire your child’s pretend play scenarios. To teach them how to play house, read them books that are set in the home. Second, books introduce your child to new dilemmas, characters, and settings. Lastly, stories provide children with an understanding of how imaginative tales are structured. They come to learn that stories have a beginning, middle, and an end.


As you read, pose open-ended questions to your child. These may include questions like: “what do you think will happen next?” or “why do you think the character did that?”
Remain enthusiastic as you read.
After reading your child a story, you can encourage them to draw pictures based on the tale you read., Every child is unique. Children are not required to play in the same way, imagine the same things, or like the same games. Instead of pushing your child to imagine a specific situation, such as taking care of a family, or execute a certain task, such as cooking dinner, allow them to take the lead on their pretend play. Encourage them to use their creativity and explore the ideas that come to them."

Tell them what to expect.,
Get familiar with the school.,
Play pretend preschool.,
Read books.",How to Prepare Your Child for Preschool1," No matter how excited your child is to start preschool, they also may feel a little nervous or scared. Help them understand preschool by giving them an idea of what it will be like. Tell your child where they will be going, what they will be doing, and what a normal day in preschool might include. Give them a sense of what will happen so that they can feel prepared to start with as little worry as possible.For example, say, “You are going to this building right here. I’ll drop you off at the door and say goodbye, then you’ll go inside and do lots of fun activities. You might sing, dance, color, draw, paint, or play. Then, you’ll have snack time and quiet time. When preschool is over, I’ll come back and pick you up!”;
, Some schools have a meet day where children can come and explore their classroom and meet their teacher. Have your child meet the teacher, tour the school, and spend some time on the playground. Point to things around the classroom and show your child where they might sit. Let them look around the classroom and see what activities, games, and toys they can play with at school. This should help them get excited about coming.If your child’s preschool does not have this, they might have a parent-teacher meet day. If so, tell your child about the teacher and the classroom and let them know what kinds of things they can expect. You can also bring your child to the playground and let them play there.

, Take turns being the child, teacher, and parent. Practice the roles and do common activities performed in preschool such as saying goodbye in the morning, hanging up a jacket, having circle time, singing songs, and reading stories. Let your child experience the different roles.When role playing, make preschool sound exciting and fun.

, A great way to prepare your child for preschool is to read books about preschool. Your child can learn how their favorite characters deal with the changes that preschool brings. It can help them get a sense for what preschool will be like and how to adjust to it. Some books help children cope with the uncertainty or fears they have about making big transitions and being away from parents for a longer time.Read books specifically designed for getting a child ready for pre-school. Some books to check out from the library include, “Llama Llama Misses Mama,” “I Love You All Day Long,” “Maisy Goes to Preschool,” and, “What to Expect at Preschool.”"

Get them socially involved.,
Work on independent skills.,
Develop their motor skills.,
Follow a schedule.",How to Prepare Your Child for Preschool2," If your child hasn’t spent much time around other kids, get them involved in some playgroups, story times, or other social activities. It’s important for preschool children to know how to share, take turns, and play cooperatively with others. Give them opportunities to learn and practice these skills around other children their age.Your child should be comfortable with tasks and skills including waiting in line, listening to an adult, and being quiet when asked to be quiet. Practice these skills and make sure your child can do them well.Check out community classes for children such as gymnastics, music, or kids yoga.

, Your child may be expected to hang up their own jacket, zip up their coat or sweater, put on and take off their backpack, and tie or fasten their shoes. Practice these skills at home together. Make it a race to see who can do it fastest.Get your child comfortable dressing on their own and picking up their own toys without help so that they develop confidence on doing tasks on their own.


If your child brings a snack, make sure they know how to open their lunchbox or snack bag. Practice opening and closing containers and plastic bags. Ask your child to help pack their lunch and practice their food skills each day during preparation. , Children may be expected to complete certain activities using fine-motor skills. Help your child prepare by doing crafts with them. Help them learn to cut and fold paper. Provide coloring and painting activities and let your child glue small items. Buy some putty or dough for your child to play with to build their hand muscles.Have your child cut dough and shape it into letters, numbers, or shapes.
Hide a bead, coin, or another small object in clay and have your child find it.

, Allow your child to get used to following routines and schedules. This way, they can begin to learn about expectations and following directions. Get your child up at the same time each day and establish some consistency. Try to mimic a typical schedule your child may have for preschool. So, if your child needs to be at preschool at 8:30, start waking your child up so that they are ready by that time.If you are at home with your child, start doing activities that may mimic the activities in preschool. Have a schedule so that your child knows what to expect and can make transitions with ease.
You may want to have a picture schedule for your child. For example, arrange pictures of a book, musical instruments, and crayons in a row so that your child knows what activities come first, second, and third. This can help with difficult transitions and knowing what to expect.

Listen to your child.,
Develop a goodbye ritual.,
Look out for separation anxiety.",How to Prepare Your Child for Preschool3," Encourage your child to express their thoughts and feelings. This shows that your child’s thoughts and feelings are valuable. Your child may not immediately offer up information, so ask questions. Say, “What do you think about going to preschool?” or say, “You’re starting preschool tomorrow. How does your body feel?”Give them a vocabulary to use to label feelings by naming them for them. Say, “You look disappointed that you didn’t get a star today. What happened?”You can also say, “Wow, I can tell you had a good day today, you look very happy!” This will help them talk about their own feelings and express them to you., Have something you do with your child each time you leave them at preschool. This could be a special hug or high-five and a phrase such as “See you later, alligator! After a while, crocodile.” Be consistent and make a point to say goodbye. The ritual can comfort your child and make them feel special.Resist the urge to run back and rescue your child if you hear them crying or screaming. Going back for your child sends the message that they are safe only if you are there. This can prolong their distress. Trust the teacher’s years of experience to calm your child.

, Some children may have an especially hard time separating from you when they go to school. If this is the first long stretch of time your child has spent away from you, don’t be surprised if they struggle with separation anxiety. However, plan to combat it before it starts. If your child expresses concern (either before or after preschool starts), listen and make them feel heard and understood. Let them know it’s normal to feel happy, sad, angry, scared, and nervous.Reassure them that they will be safe and that you will come back for them.
Also, make sure to be consistent about the time when you take them to school. If they start off later than other children or at different times throughout the week, then this may throw off their day.

Sprinkle chia seeds over foods to keep the seeds crunchy.,
Hide chia seeds in raw one-dish meals.,
Make granola bars with chia seeds.,
Create flavored chia gelatin or jelly.",How to Eat Chia Seeds1," One of the most common ways to eat chia seeds raw is to sprinkle them over or mix them into other dishes. Stir them in any wet food to turn the dry seeds gelatinous and mushy, which will help them blend into the food less obviously.


Add chia to your breakfast by sprinkling 1 or 2 Tbsp (15 or 30 ml) of chia seeds over oatmeal, yogurt, or breakfast cereal.
For a healthy snack or light lunch, stir 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of chia seeds into a cup of cottage cheese.
Mix chia seeds into wet sandwich ingredients. Use tuna salad or egg salad for savory sandwiches, or peanut butter or hazelnut spread for sweet sandwiches.;
, If the food is dry, the seeds will stay crunchy, which some people prefer. Even on wet foods, a sprinkling of seeds at the top may not form a gel if not mixed in.


Sprinkle the seeds over any type of salad.
Decorate pudding with a dash of chia seeds.

, This is especially helpful if you have picky eaters in your household that may otherwise scoff at the notion of consuming these tiny seeds.


Mix chia seeds into potato salad or cold pasta salads. Add 2 tbsp (30 mL) of chia seeds to a large serving bowl of potato or pasta salad and stir thoroughly.

, Mix 2 Tbsp (30 mL) chia seeds into your favorite granola bar recipe. For a no-bake recipe, stir the seeds into 1 cup pitted, blended dates, 1/4 cup peanut butter or other nut spread, 1 1/2 cups rolled oats, 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup, and 1 cup chopped nuts.Spread this mixture on a pan and harden in the fridge. You may toast the oats before adding to add a different flavor, or explore other granola bar recipes that require baking.

, Add chia seeds to pureed fruit. More chia seeds will create a gelatin, while fewer will create a jelly. You may need to experiment with different amounts until you find a ratio best suited to your type of fruit and preferences.


Roughly speaking, 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of pureed fruit and 1/2 cup (125 ml) chia seeds mixed together create a chunky jam.

Grind chia seeds into flour.,
Mix chia seeds into bread and baked goods.,
Slip chia seeds into casseroles and similar dishes.,
Soak them to form a gel for later use.,
Thicken soups and sauces with chia seeds.",How to Eat Chia Seeds2," Stir 1–2 tbsp (15–30 mL) of chia seeds into a cup (240 mL) of warm milk or any milk substitute. Let stand for 10–15 minutes until the mixture forms a gel, whisking occasionally to break up seed clumps, then eat cold or heat again before eating.The mixture alone is quite bland, so you may enjoy eating with sliced fruit, dried fruit, nuts, or honey. Add extra flavor with a pinch of cinnamon or sea salt if desired.


2 tbsp (30 mL) will make a thick porridge. Use less if you prefer a thinner mixture.
Stir in any liquid or powdered flavoring while the mixture is gelling to add more flavor. Try cocoa powder, malt powder, or fruit juice.

, Pulse the seeds in a food processor, blender, or coffee grinder until a fine powder forms. Use it in place of all-purpose flour by substituting it completely or mixing it with other flour.


If using it in a thick dough, you can substitute the chia flour in equal parts.
If using it in a thinner batter or dough, mix one part chia seed flour with three parts regular or gluten-free flour.

, Instead of grinding the chia seeds down into flour, you can add them whole to a variety of flour-based baked goods. Add 3 to 4 Tbsp (45 to 60 ml) chia seeds to your favorite whole-grain bread, muffin, oatmeal cookie, whole-grain cracker, pancake, or cake batters.

, If you have picky eaters in your household, you can sneak chia seeds into your diet by mixing them into one-dish meals. Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) chia seeds to a lasagna or casserole prepared in a standard casserole dish, or follow these suggestions:


Ground meat mixtures for homemade meatballs or burgers can be thickened with 1 or 2 tbsp (15 to 30 ml) chia seeds for each 1 lb (450 g) of ground meat, instead of breadcrumbs.
Mix 2 Tbsp (30 ml) chia seeds into scrambled eggs, omelets, and other egg-based dishes.
Add a dash of chia seeds to your favorite stir-fries.

, Mix 1 tbsp (15 ml) chia seeds with 3 to 4 tbsp (45 to 60 ml) water and let sit for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it forms a thick gel. Mix it with up to 9 tbsp (130 mL) water if you prefer thinner gels.This gel can be refrigerated for up to two weeks before eating. Forming this gel in advance saves time and ensures that there are no dry, crunchy seeds when you add it to another food.


You can use this gel as a substitute for eggs in baked goods. 5 tbsp (75 mL) of gel is roughly equal to one egg.You cannot use this as an egg substitute in omelets or other recipes where the egg is not mixed with other ingredients.

, Add 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) of chia seeds to any bowl of soup, stew, sauce, or gravy. Let sit for 10 to 30 minutes or until it thickens. Stir occasionally to break up clumps of chia seeds.

Learn about the nutrition benefits.,
Treat other claims with skepticism.,
Choose a small portion size.,
Know what to expect in taste and consistency.,
Buy high quality, food-grade chia seeds.,
Approach chia seeds with caution if you have kidney problems.",How to Eat Chia Seeds3," The health benefits of chia seeds are sometimes over-reported in news or personal anecdotes, but it is true that they are high-energy foods (partially due to the high fat content) and are good sources of some nutrients. One ounce (30 mL or 2 tbsp) of dry chia seeds contains about 138 calories (138 kcal), 5 grams (g) of protein, 9g of fat, and 10g of fiber.They provide significant amounts of useful calcium, magnesium, and potassium, even in small servings. They are most likely good sources of antioxidants and mediocre sources of (digestible) Omega-3 fatty acids, both of which may have beneficial health effects., Claims about weight loss, improved heart health, and improved athletic performance have not yet been verified by scientific studies. More than one study has failed to find any benefits of this type from adding chia seed to your diet.This does not mean that chia seeds are not a healthy food, but don't expect it to change your health or fitness drastically without making other changes to your diet or exercise routine.

, Chia seeds are high in fat and calories compared to their size, and can provide significant nutritious benefit even in small servings. The large amounts of fiber they contain may cause digestive issues if eaten in large quantities. While there is no ""official"" recommended serving size, you may wish to limit yourself to 1 or 2 ounces (30–60mL or 2–4 tbsp) of chia seeds each day, especially when you are adding them to your diet for the first time., Chia seeds are relatively bland, with little flavor of their own. When combined with liquids, they take on a gelatinous texture which some people enjoy but other find unpleasant. Fortunately, these qualities make them easy to mix them into other foods. You may eat chia seeds dry, stirred into other foods, or cooked into other foods. None of these methods provide significantly more nutritious benefits than others.


If eaten plain, chia seeds will actually start to combine with the saliva in your mouth and begin taking on their trademark gel-like consistency.

, Even though these seeds are the same type used in ""chia pets"" and other gardening applications, it's best to consume chia seeds that are packaged and sold for the purpose of consumption. If you do eat chia seeds intended for planting, make sure they were organically grown, without pesticides or other substances that could make them unsafe for human consumption.


Chia seeds can be bought in the bulk section or supplement section at most health food stores, or online.
While chia seeds are often expensive compared to other seeds, keep in mind that a large bag should last a long time if you stick to one or two small daily servings as described above.

, If you have renal failure, or any medical issue that affects the functioning of your kidneys, avoid chia seeds or eat them only in amounts recommended by your nutritionist or doctor. Their high plant protein content produces more waste than other protein sources, which impaired kidneys may not be able to deal with. The high phosphorus and potassium content can also cause itchy skin, irregular heart beat, or muscle weakness if they are not successfully processed."

Add chia seeds to smoothies.,
Make ""chia fresca."",
Stir chia seeds into juice or tea.",How to Eat Chia Seeds4," When preparing any single-serving smoothie or shake, add 1 or 2 tbsp (15–30 ml) chia seeds to the blender or food processor with the other ingredients before blending., Stir 2 tsp (10 ml) chia seeds into 10 oz (310 ml) of water, the juice of 1 lemon or lime, and a small amount of raw honey or agave syrup, to taste.

, Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) chia seeds to an 8-oz (250-ml) glass of juice, tea, or any other warm or hot drink. Allow the drink to sit for several minutes so that the seeds can absorb some of the liquid, creating a thicker beverage.

Begin the application process.",How to Pick a Preschool," Your community may offer a variety of different types of preschool programs. Having an understanding of what types of preschools are available will give you a better idea of what to look for in your area. Most communities will have public and private preschools, which may differ in terms of expense, scheduling, and the types of curriculum they offer.


Public preschools, also called prekindergarten programs, are offered by your local public school system. Typically, public schools offer half-day or full-day preschools. There are no income restrictions. However, there is a residence requirement. You must live in the municipality where the public preschool is located.
Private preschools are independent, for-profit, or may have a religious affiliation. Generally, private preschools have a smaller number of students than other types of preschools. In addition to teaching the basics, these schools may include religious teaching. Private preschools may offer a variety of schedules (full-day, half-day, full-time, or only a few days a week). Some private schools may have more strict admission policies than public schools.;
, Head Start programs provide free education for low-income families. Head Start programs may be based in schools or child care centers, and some areas offer home-based Head Start services. Check out the website for the national Head Start office: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs/about/head-start. If you are interested in applying for a Head Start program, this website provides general information, and can help you locate programs in your area.

, Before you start looking at preschools, it is good to have an idea of how much you can afford to spend each month on school-related expenses. Some preschools require tuition, application fees, or fees for supplies and meals.


Some private preschools may offer financial aid.
Consider other possible sources of financial support, like help from a relative, your school or employer, or child care assistance programs offered by your local government.

, Depending on the work or school schedules of people in your household, you may need to find a preschool that offers a full-day schedule. If someone is able to stay home with your child at least some of the time, you may only need a half-day or part-time program.

, Some preschools will accept new students at any time of the year, but others have strict enrollment periods. Some schools may have waiting lists for applicants. If you want your child to begin preschool at a particular time, it is a good idea to plan in advance.

, If your child has any special needs, you may need to find a preschool that can accommodate them. These can include health, dietary, or behavioral needs.


If your child has food allergies or dietary restrictions, some preschools may be able to provide meals that conform to your child’s dietary needs. When you are looking at potential schools, you may wish to find out if the school follows the Center for Disease Control’s guidelines for preventing and managing food allergies in school settings.Many preschool programs are designed to accommodate children with special physical, developmental, and behavioral needs in an inclusive manner. If your child has a disability or other special needs, look for preschools that are designed to be inclusive and allow special needs children to participate fully in the school experience., Do you want a preschool closer to your home, or near your workplace? Note that if you end up choosing a public preschool, you may be limited to the school nearest to your home address.

, Smaller class sizes allow teachers to have more one-on-one time with children and offer a more individualized approach to teaching and learning.


Compared to children in larger classes, most children show stronger developmental gains and experience fewer health problems in classes with twenty or fewer students.Some of the drawbacks of larger class sizes can be offset by a higher adult-to-child ratio. For example, if two teachers work together to teach a larger class, the children can still receive more one-on-one attention than they would in a large class with just one teacher.

, Some preschools are more play-focused, while others offer a more structured approach and focus on academic readiness.Study up on different approaches and decide which approach will work best for your child. These are a few of the most popular preschool teaching philosophies:The Montessori approach focuses on independent, child-centered learning. Kids are encouraged to learn at their own pace in a Montessori setting, and children of different ages and developmental levels interact in the same classroom.
Waldorf schools provide a creative, play-based, but carefully structured experience.
Reggio Emilia schools offer highly individualized project-based learning based on each child’s interests. This approach is all about cooperation and problem-solving.

, Once you’ve figured out what you want and need from your child’s preschool experience, putting it all down on paper will help you stay focused as you begin looking into your options.

, There, you should be able to find information on public preschool programs in your area, application instructions, and useful links to other resources.

, A general search will bring up websites for private preschools near you as well as public schools that offer preschool programs. Keep a list of preschools that look promising, or bookmark their websites so that you can explore them further.

, If you know people in your area who have children in preschool, they may have some good insights into what the local schools have to offer.

, Once you have an idea of what preschools are in your area, you can begin to take a closer look. Most preschool websites will have information on tuition, application processes and requirements, curriculum, and class schedules. They will also provide contact information so that you can ask questions or schedule a school visit.

, Pick four or five schools that seem the most promising. Write down their contact information, and make a few general notes about what you like or dislike about each school.

, Ask any general questions you may have (about tuition, financial aid, the application process, scheduling a visit, etc.), but also address any specific concerns you may have about the individual school. This may help you eliminate schools that are not a good fit before you go to the trouble of making a visit. Some preschools will ask you to fill out an online form expressing interest, and then a member of the administration will contact you. In other cases, you can simply call or email the school directly.

, Once you have decided which schools you are most interested in, contact the school and set up a time to come by for a meeting or tour. Some schools offer regular tours or visiting hours, while others will require you to schedule a time in advance. Discuss whether you should bring your child or other members of the household.

, Even if you already addressed some of your concerns and questions during pre-visit calls or emails, the visit is a good time to get more detailed answers. Ask school teachers and administrators any questions you might have about curriculum, school policies, facilities and accommodations, or teacher and staff qualifications. You will probably have lots of questions, but here are a few things you might want to ask about:Find out about teacher turnover. You want to know how long teachers have been teaching at the school.
Ask about the lesson plans and what educational goals the schools have for their students.
Find out how the school keeps you informed on your child's progress. For example, find out if they provide you with daily or weekly progress reports.

, Bring something to write with. If there is anything that stands out about your visit experience, good or bad, write it down so that you can remember it when you are making your final decision.

, Make a note of teachers who engage students in a conversation while teaching. For example, they may ask students open-ended questions that help them comprehend what they are learning. Try to get a sense of what kind of rapport they have with their children, and how excited they seem about their work.

, Do they appear happy and engaged? Are they all working together on the same projects, or are they given freedom to choose which activities to engage in? Do they have plenty of opportunities to play and explore? Try to picture your own child participating in these activities, and consider whether they would thrive in such an environment. , Try to get a sense of whether the school has adequate, age-appropriate supplies. These might include the following:Picture books.
Toys that encourage the development of gross motor skills (riding toys, balls, climbing equipment) and fine motor skills (beads for stringing, small objects for sorting, puzzles).
Toys that encourage dramatic play, like dress-ups, dolls, or farm sets.
Supplies for making arts, crafts, and music.

, Make sure the environment is clean, safe, and up to safety codes. Ask about escape plans in case of a fire or other emergency.

, If you child has special health, dietary, or behavioral needs, make sure the school personnel are aware of these issues ahead of time and are ready to accommodate them.

, Preschool applications can be expensive and time-consuming. Wait to start the application process until you are feeling sure that you’ve selected the school that works best for your child and you. Ask ahead of time what kinds of materials and information you will need to complete your application (e.g. medical records, proof of residency, etc.), and try to get an idea of how long the application process will take.

However, given that your body is fighting off a cold, you should add a few hours a night or add in naps so you get even more rest than normal., When you are fighting off the symptoms of a cold, your throat may be irritated and feel uncomfortable. If this is the case, gargling with salt water will help. Fill up a small cup with warm water and put a teaspoon or two of salt into it. Stir it in to let it dissolve. Then sip a little into your mouth and gargle it in the back of your throat.


Once you've gargled for a little while, spit the water out and repeat with fresh water.
If your throat is still sore or if you are coughing too much, try cough drops or a throat spray to alleviate the symptoms."

Know how you get a cold.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Look for complications.,
See a doctor.",How to Relieve Colds Through Diet4," You can catch a cold very easily. You catch a cold by being too close to someone who already has a cold. When that person sneezes or coughs, the virus-infected saliva or snot helps spread the germs to you., There are some common symptoms that occur when you catch a cold. These symptoms include:


Nasal dryness or irritation
Sore or irritated, itchy throat
Nasal discharge and congestion, typically thin and clear
Sneezing
Head and body aches
Watery eyes
Congested sinuses, which may cause face and ear pressure
Inability to smell and taste
Cough
Hoarseness or loss of voice
A low-grade fever may occur, typically in small children, There are some conditions that can be escalated by a cold. You may get sinusitis, ear infections, chronic bronchitis, or have worse asthma symptoms.Make sure you take care of yourself while you are sick so you don't develop any of these conditions.


If you have a history of these conditions, be careful when you get a cold.

, If your symptoms don't get better within two to three days of using diet treatments, you should see your doctor. If they get worse despite treatment, you should also see your doctor. If your small child has a cold, she needs to see the doctor immediately if she has these symptoms:


A fever higher than 100.4° F
Symptoms that last more than 10 days
Severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, or difficulty breathing"

Understand your restrictions, both what you can and cannot eat, and why your diet is restricted.,

Start with the basics of a clear liquid diet.,

Add ""full fluids"" as soon as it is appropriate to do so.,

Look for foods that are already soft.,

Use your blender and your fork to chew for you.,

Cook foods until they are soft.,

Dissolve foods.,

Eat as wide a variety of foods as your diet permits, and be creative.,

Have dessert.,

Avoid very chewy things.,

Take steps to add calories if it is necessary to do so.,

Look out for your teeth while eating a soft or liquid diet.",How to Follow a Soft Diet," For example, if a doctor prescribes some form liquid or soft diet because of a medical condition or in connection with surgery, the restrictions may be greater than if is soft diet is recommended because of difficulty chewing. Always follow your doctor's advice, of course, but knowing your specific restrictions enables you to be more creative within them.

Know how long you should expect the restricted diet to last.
Know if there are specific foods you should avoid.
Find out if you can safely ""chew"" soft foods by mashing them between your tongue and the roof of your mouth.
Find out whether you can have solids that are pureed or mashed.;
, A doctor may order a clear liquid (or clear fluids) diet in case of lacerations or incisions in the mouth, a compromised digestive system, or other reasons. A doctor who orders this diet should also advise you of how long you must restrict yourself clear liquid. A clear liquid diet is limited to liquids that you can see through, such as apple juice and other pulp-free fruit juices, gelatin deserts like Jell-O (even though they are solid at room temperature), clear sodas, tea, and clear broths. Ice pops and other ices can also be clear fluids, provided they are not made with pulp or sorbet (sherbet)., Full fluids can include suspended solids as well as all the items that are clear liquids. If you can have full fluids, you can have most fluid nutritional supplements; milk; milkshakes; yogurt (well mixed and without fruit chunks); smooth hot cereals, such as oatmeal; juice with pulp; and pudding., Smooth, hot cereals, such as oatmeal, soups that are pureed or strained, applesauce, smoothies, mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes, scrambled eggs, custard, cottage cheese, and many other foods are soft enough to eat without chewing., Chop soft pasta into small pieces with a fork. Puree a chunky soup and see what you get. Mash some potato salad or put it through a blender. Mash or puree just the contents of a burrito or sloppy Joe.

Some small chunks may be all right, as long as you can swallow them without chewing.
Blenders work best with enough liquid. If potato salad is sticking to the walls of the blender and not moving, add a bit of milk, yogurt, water, or sour cream. Try to add liquids with flavors that will be compatible with what you're blending. Use broth, water, barbecue sauce, or ketchup for meats. Adding liquid will also help if you need to get the food through a straw to eat it.
Some foods work better than others when blended. If you're not sure, try a small amount and see what happens.

, Fresh, crispy celery and carrots need to be chewed, but celery and carrots cooked in a soup may be soft enough to mash between the tongue and the roof of your mouth. They can certainly go through a blender., If you can't eat bread because you can't chew it, could you have bread pudding or pancakes reheated with plenty of syrup, instead?, Just about any fruit or cooked vegetable can be pureed to the point where it need not be chewed. Many entrees can, too. Aim for a balanced mixture of starches, proteins, fruits, veggies, fats, and the occasional sweet treat, just as you would if you were chewing., Many desserts are high in calories, so if there is any concern about taking in enough calories, this is a very good place to add some., You may be able to grind tuna or soft-cooked chicken enough to eat it without chewing, but steak is probably not a good option while you are on a liquid diet or just coming out of one.,

Eat smaller, more frequent meals.
Use whole milk, milk products, and cream.
Add protein powder, powdered supplements, powdered milk, or even chocolate syrup to foods.

, Crunchy and crispy foods serve to help clean teeth and stimulate gum tissue. Ask your doctor or dentist whether you should try to brush your teeth, or, failing that, whether you should rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash after eating."

Know how to eat soy safely.,
Eat soy in moderation.,
Replace unhealthy foods with soy.,
Eat edamame.,
Drink organic soy milk.,
Cook with tofu.,
Eat fermented soy dishes.,
Avoid processed soy products.,
Learn the importance of phytoestrogens.,
Know how eating soy can benefit your health.,
Understand the risks of soy.,
Understand the risks of soy for children.",How to Eat Healthy Amounts of Soy," The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), a division of the National Institutes for Health, considers soy safe for most people “when used as a food or when taken for short periods as a dietary supplement.”When choosing a soy product, it should be whole, organic, and non-GMO instead of refined or processed.


Research has indicated, however, that eating large amounts of soy can reduce fertility in women. It may also interfere with the normal development of fetuses and infants fed on soy formulas.
Asian societies used soy for centuries without a problem. This is probably because in Asian cuisine, soy is usually used as fermented food like natto, miso, and tempeh. The process of fermentation may change some of the components of soy while leaving the isoflavones, which are the potential disease fighting elements in soy, unchanged and functioning in different ways.;
, Following the recommendations of NCCIH and the American Association of Family Physicians, men and women should eat soy in moderation.This means that adult men and women should limit soy to 25 grams a day. This means you can have one to two servings of soy product a day, like a cup of soy milk or four ounces of tofu.


A reasonable recommendations for those under 18 would be about half this amount, or 12 to 13 grams of soy each day.
This amount of soy can benefit you by lowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The same amount of soy can decrease menopausal hot flashes and maintain bone density.
Currently, there is not enough information to provide recommendations about how much soy for women with a history of breast cancer.

, One of the benefits of soy is that usually soy products are eaten in place of unhealthier options containing more fat. Incorporating soy into your diet adds fiber, vitamins, minerals, and polyunsaturated fats.Soy is a healthier option for protein over red meat. It includes high levels of protein without saturated fat.
Soy can be used in place of red meat and dairy products, both of which can be unhealthy.

, One of the best and healthiest ways to incorporate soy into your diet is to eat the whole soybean, commonly called edamame. A whole soybean has not been processed, so you are getting the nutrients from the bean.Try steaming the edamame. You can eat it as a side dish, or throw some into a salad.
In half of a cup of soybeans, there is 16 grams of protein, along with a good amount of vitamin B6, vitamin B2, vitamin B1, Vitamin K, folate, potassium, magnesium, manganese, copper, selenium, phosphorus, iron, and calcium.Buy organic or non-transgenic soybeans if possible., Another way to get healthy soy into your diet is to drink soy milk. To get the healthiest soy milk, make sure to buy organic and GMO-free. This eliminates the use of pesticides and potential dangers of GMO.One 8-ounce cup (237 ml) of soy milk daily is a good serving.For the best health benefits, get unsweetened and unflavored milk. Flavored milks have added sugars, which are not good for you.
You can also make your own soymilk, which is even better than buying soy milk. All you need to make soy milk is organic non-GMO soybeans and purified (fluoride free) water.
Check the labels of the soy milk before buying. Avoid buying any soy milk made with soy protein or soy isolate. This means the soy milk has been processed., Tofu is a versatile, healthy way to incorporate soy into your diet. As with other forms of tofu, make sure to get organic soy that is non-GMO if possible. A daily serving of three to four ounces is acceptable.Tofu can be used to replace meat in dishes. For example, you can make stir fries and other dishes with tofu instead of meat. Try tofu in place of eggs. You can also make tofu patties for tofu burgers. You can even try tofu chicken fingers.
Try grilled tofu with vegetables as a side dish. Add tofu into your smoothie.
There are many websites and books full of tofu recipes for you to try and enjoy.

, Many believe that fermented soy dishes are the healthiest way to eat soy. Many Asian dishes are fermented, such as tempeh, miso, and natto. Fermented soy products are easier to digest, and they are good sources of probiotics.Tempeh is high in protein and B-vitamins, along with other minerals. Tempeh is versatile and can be put into many dishes, such as salads and even tacos.
Miso has a lot of B12. Miso is generally found in a paste and soup, which can be purchased in stores.
Natto is a paste made from fermented soybeans. It is most commonly found in health food stores, online retailers, or Asian grocery stores.

, While eating whole, organic, non-GMO, and fermented soy products provide healthy forms of soy, all other forms of soy should be avoided. This includes soybean oil, soy proteins, soy burgers, soy energy bars, and other forms of refined or processed soy.Avoid anything with the words soy protein or soy isolate on the label.
Refrain from eating products made with soybean oil.

, Soybeans and soy products contain isoflavones, a class of plant substances that includes phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens are substances that are similar in structure to human estrogens.


In some circumstances, they can either increase or decrease the effects of human estrogens. Because of this, eating soy has raised some concerns about reproductive cycles, fertility, puberty, and overall safety.
The main phytoestrogens in soy are genistein and daidzein. These phytoestrogens have been labeled endocrine disruptors; however, the disruption can be positive or negative depending on a number of variables, including age, gender, and hormonal status.
The isoflavones in soy can also act as goitrogens, substances that interfere with normal thyroid function., Soy has been recommended to help with various health conditions. Soy has been used to help with menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, to help reduce the risk of osteoporosis, and to aid in lowering the risk of heart disease, especially in women).Soy has also been used for lowering LDL cholesterol and prostate cancer.The results for the benefits of soy have not always been consistent, however.This inconsistency can be due to a number of issues, including how much soy is ingested, in what form, and the individual variations of people to soy based on their particular hormonal status at the time.

, The benefits or dangers of soy is inconclusive. For example, phytoestrogens have been implicated in increasing the risks of breast cancer in lab animal studies. Human breast cells are also affected by the phytoestrogens; however, many studies have also indicated that women who eat soy regularly have a lower risk of breast cancer.In men, some studies have indicated that soy can lower sperm count. Other studies have indicated no effect at all.Most of the studies have been conducted in lab rats and mice, but the concerns exist because rats and mice have hormonal systems that are similar to those in humans.

, While the studies done on lab animals or adult humans are a mix of benefits and risks, the studies of soy in children are less promising and the evidence of harm is more significant.


In one study, infant girls who were fed soy-based formula had significantly more breast tissue at the age of 2 years than girls who were breast-fed or fed a dairy-based formula.The use of soy-based infant formula is also associated with early puberty for girls as well as longer and more difficult menstrual cycles.Infant formula based on soy should be avoided completely, unless specifically recommended by your child's pediatrician.

Know the topic.,
A Socratic Seminar is supposed to be a learning experience as well as a way to show your teacher you know what you're learning.",How to Prepare for a Socratic Seminar," Socratic Seminars are usually held in social studies classes, so reading is a huge help once it's actually discussion time. If your teacher gives you the topic beforehand, read all applicable chapters in your book, using sticky notes or another form of page marker to keep track of interesting, useful, or information filled sections. If your teacher doesn't give you the topic, you are probably going to be discussing a recent chapter. Read that chapter and any other chapter you think might be helpful.;
, Use a search engine (such as Google or Yahoo) to find web pages with information on your topic. Bookmark or copy and paste pages with useful info.

, Ask the librarian for help finding books or articles that might help you prepare. Borrow books that you know you'll be able to use again. Some libraries only allow you to borrow a certain number of books. If this is the case and you need more than is allowed, use a copy machine to get copies of the pages you need. This is also a solution for reference books, such as encyclopedias, that libraries generally don't loan out.

, This will help organize your thoughts, and, during the discussion, will allow you to quickly find the information you need. Include next to each new bit of information the place where the information was found and the page number. Some teachers will grade you based not only on what information you have, but whether you have evidence to back it up. Quoting well-known encyclopedias and textbooks is sure to give you those points.

, Teachers like to see you use the vocabulary you've learned. Don't go overboard during the discussion by using a vocabulary word in every sentence. Just know the words so when the opportunity arises you use them naturally.

, Review all of your notes and read the chapters. The better you know the subject, the more you will be able to contribute to the discussion and the better your grade will be.

, It's not uncommon for a large debate to ensue over a topic. In the end, though, everyone comes out of it knowing more than when they went in. Socratic Seminars can open your mind to new ideas and bigger concepts. Try to enjoy it and keep an open mind.

Know if you must include sources or visuals.;
, If you're giving a presentation to your classmates, you probably have a rough idea of their knowledge on the topic. But for virtually every other circumstance, you may be in the dark. Either way, cater your paper to make zero assumptions.


If you're presenting to people you know, it'll be easy to know what to break down and what to gloss over. But if you're presenting to unknown stockholders or faculty, for instance, you need to know about them and their knowledge levels, too. You may have to break your paper down into its most basic concepts. Find out what you can about their backgrounds.

, If you are giving a presentation in a facility you've never visited before, it's best to inquire about what you'll have at your disposal and what you'll need to set up beforehand.

Think in terms of conversation.",How to Prepare a Paper Presentation2," Although you could write everything out, it's best to use notes to jog your memory -- you'll sound more like you're talking and be able to make more eye contact.


Only have one point per notecard -- that way you won't end up searching the notecard for your information. And don't forget to number the cards in case you get mixed up! And the points on your cards shouldn't match your paper; instead of regurgitating information, discuss why the key points of your paper are important or the different points of view on this topic within the field.

, These are the ones you should be drilling home. The rest of your presentation should be extras not necessarily addressed in your work -- if they've already read the paper, they don't need to be lectured on it. They're there to learn more.


Make an outline of the highlights to help you prepare your presentation. As you form the outline, you'll see what aspects of your paper pop out the most and what order they would best be relayed in.

As you go through this outline, remove any jargon if it may not be understood.



, To help your audience follow along (and for the visual learners), use slides with graphics, charts, and bullet points to make everything a bit more captivating. It can enhance the information in your paper, yes, but it also keeps everyone from wiggling around in their seats.


If you have any statistics at all, turn them into graphs. The contrasts will seem more stark when put in pictures before your audience -- numbers are sometimes meaningless. Instead of thinking about 25% and 75%, they'll be thinking about the 50% difference they see before them.

If you won't have access to the proper technology, print visual aids on poster board or foam-core board.


Presentation software (Powerpoint, etc.) can also double as notecards. Instead of messing with small pieces of paper, you can just click a button to get your next prompt.

If using presentation software, use words sparingly, but enough to get your point across. Think in phrases (and pictures!), not sentences. Acronyms and abbreviations are okay on the screen, but when you talk, address them fully. And remember to use large fonts -- not everyone's vision is fantastic., Just because this is paper-based does not mean your delivery should be equivalent to what an 8.5 x 11 can do. You have personality and are a human engaging with an audience. Use their humanness to do things you might not otherwise do in a paper.


It's okay to be a bit repetitive. Emphasizing important ideas will enhance comprehension and recall. When you've gone full circle, cycle back to a previous point to lead your audience to the right conclusion.
Minimize the unnecessary details (the procedure you had to go through, etc.) when highlighting the main ideas you want to relay. You don't want to overload your audience with fluff, forcing them to miss the important stuff.
Show enthusiasm! A very boring topic can be made interesting if there is passion behind it.

Practice your presentation in front of friends and family members.,
Tape record yourself.,
Be warm.",How to Prepare a Paper Presentation3," Don't be shy -- ask for constructive criticism. This helps you know whether or not you're meeting the time requirements and if not, how you could tweak your style.

Adjust the projector settings to fine tune the image.",How to Mount a Projector," Depending on the layout of your room, you may have little choice as to where the screen must go, but if possible, choose a wall that has no direct light, as light on the screen will make the image look washed out.If you must choose a wall that receives direct light, consider an ambient light rejecting projector screen or, if you’re painting your screen on the wall, you can use ambient light rejecting paint (available at hardware stores).You might also consider buying blackout curtains for your windows.;
, This will again depend upon the layout of your room. If you only have a couch and some chairs in the room (i.e. not theater-style seating in rows), an appropriate height would be between 24 and 36 inches (61 and 91.5 centimetres) off the floor.If you have multiple rows in your home theatre, you’ll want to have the screen a bit higher so that people who aren’t in the front row can still properly see whatever images or films you are projecting on to the screen.When deciding on how far above the floor to place the screen, always keep the screen size in mind, as starting it too high off the ground might not leave enough room for the entire screen.

, This will be the height and width on which you wish to project the images from your projector. Keep the measurements handy, as you will need them while calculating where to mount your projector.


Most new projectors can create a high-quality 100-in. (254-cm, or 8.33-foot) image, so if you’re unsure of what size of screen to get — and your room can accommodate it — you should be safe with something close to 100 in., Throw distance measures the distance between your screen and your projector’s lens. You calculate it using your projector’s throw ratio, which should be listed in the instruction manual as either a single number (for projectors without optical zoom) or a range of numbers. To calculate how far away from your screen to place your projector, use the following formula: throw ratio x screen width = throw distance. The formula works for any unit of measurement — you can use inches, centimeters, feet, etc.


If you have a 100-inch screen and a throw ratio range of 1.4:1 to 2.8:1, you can position your projector anywhere between 140 and 280 in. (355.6 and 711.2 cm, or 11.67 and 23.33 ft.) from the screen.The calculation looks like this (using the 1.4:1 ratio as an example): 1.4 x 100 in. = 140 in.
You can also switch the formula around. If you would prefer to choose a screen size that suits where you want to mount your projector, follow this formula: throw distance divided by throw ratio = screen width.

Say you want to place your projector 16 feet away from your screen, and your projector has a throw ratio of 1.4:1 to 2.8:1. Using the lower end of the ratio (1.4:1) as an example, you would divide 16 ft. (192 in.) by 1.4, which equals a screen size of 11.43 ft. (137.16 in.). Given that the throw ratio ranges up to 2.8:1, you can actually choose a screen size between 5.71 (68.52 in.) and 11.43 ft.



, Once you know your throw distance range, you can evaluate the room and decide upon where it makes the most sense to mount the projector. Things to keep in mind while evaluating:


Seating/viewing position — if your projector is loud or quite heavy, you might not want it hanging right above your head.
Power outlets/cabling — your projector likely has two cables: HDMI and power. You’ll want to make sure that you’re either close enough to your receiver to plug in your projector, or that you have the appropriate-length cables/extensions.
Image preference — even within the throw distance range, there will be variations in the image quality, so you’ll want to test out which distance you prefer before finalizing where to mount the projector. Shorter distances (i.e. projector closer to the screen) will be brighter, and longer distances (i.e. projector farther from the screen) will give more contrast and a sharper image., The vertical offset of your projector is how high or low it needs to be in order for the image to project at the proper screen height.It should appear as a percentage in your projector’s manual. A positive offset (ex., +96.3%) means the image will project higher than the lens, whereas a negative offset (ex., -96.3%) means it will project lower. As projectors are mounted upside down, positive is the more important offset to pay attention to.Many projectors are equipped with a vertical lens shift, which allows you to adjust the image height without having to move the projector. If yours has this, try holding your projector at different heights while adjusting the lens shift to see where it works best before mounting it.If your projector doesn’t have a vertical lens shift (i.e. it has a fixed vertical offset), you’ll need to place it at exactly the recommended height.

, To calculate your projector’s ideal vertical placement, follow this formula: screen height x offset percentage = distance of lens above/below center of screen.The following example is for a projector with a -96.3% to +96.3% offset:

A standard high-definition projection screen will have a 1.78:1 (16:9) aspect ratio, meaning that the screen will be 1.78 times as wide as it is high. If your screen is 100 in. (8.33 ft.) wide, it will likely be 56.18 in. (4.68 ft.) high.
To calculate a vertical offset for a 56.18-in. screen: 56.18 in. (height) x 96.3% (offset — if your calculate doesn’t have a % symbol, use 0.963) = 54.10 in.
This means that the projector can be positioned anywhere from 54.10 in. below the center of your screen to 54.10 in. above the center of your screen.



, It’s ideal to mount the projector so that it lines up with the center of the screen width-wise, but if your room layout requires otherwise, you’ll need to calculate your horizontal lens shift. The rules for horizontal lens shift are nearly the same as for vertical lens shift, except that you use this formula to determine it: screen width x offset percentage = distance of lens to left/right of screen center.It’s best to avoid using horizontal lens shift whenever possible, as this can distort your image and cause issues with your vertical lens shift., Projector mounts vary in what they attach to (i.e. ceiling or wall); whether they include piping or arms that help with adjusting the height of your image; and what type/size/weight of projector they can hold. You’ll need to keep all of these things in mind while choosing a mount.Buy something sturdy and high quality; poor quality projectors are more likely to drift over time, causing your projector (and the image) to move out of alignment with the screen.You may need to buy adapters for your mount depending upon your ceiling type. For a suspended ceiling (one that is dropped down from the structural ceiling, and thus will be unable to support heavy loads), buy a suspended ceiling kit. For a cathedral ceiling (high and arched), purchase a cathedral ceiling adapter.

, Attach the appropriate mount to the projector. Follow the instructions that come with the mount kit and the projector. Make sure that the mount plate is level with the projector once attached, before moving on.Ensure that the entire mount is attached to the projector before securing it to the wall/ceiling.

, Use a tape measure to determine the distance between the center of the mount and the front of the projector’s lens. Add this length to the acceptable range of distances between the projector's lens and the screen (i.e. the throw distance).If the mount-to-lens distance is 6 in., the new total for an original throw distance of 16 ft. is 16.5 ft.

, Use a stud finder to locate a ceiling stud within the appropriate range of screen-to-projector distances. Secure the mount to the stud with a screwdriver, wrench and 2 lag bolts.


Lag bolts (aka lag screws) are fasteners with flat, hexagonal heads and threaded, cylindrical shafts. They can be screwed directly into wood. They can also be screwed into concrete when used with an insert called a lag. The lag bolts for your projector installation should be 3 in. (7.6 cm) long and 0.3125 in. (7.9 mm) wide (unless otherwise stated by your mount manual).
To use a stud finder you simply run it along the wall until its indicator tells you that it’s hit a stud. More detailed instructions will be in your stud finder’s manual.
If there are no joists available in the location where you want to mount your projector, you’ll either need to reconsider that spot, or first install a piece of wood that spans the space between the two joists. If possible (i.e. if there's an attic above you), hide the wood inside the ceiling., Attach the cables to the projector. Follow the instructions in the projector's manual.


You might consider using wire molds (aka cord covers) to help your cables blend in with the wall as they run down to your receiver and power outlet. These should be available at your local hardware store.
If you don’t mind the look of the cables but would like to at least keep them neat and tidy, you can also just fasten them at certain points on your wall using cable supports and fasteners (also available at your local hardware store).

, Turn on the projector and follow the instruction manual to adjust the zoom, lens shift, and focus to the desired settings. Follow the instruction manual to set the desired contrast, color, and brightness on the projector.


Before going into fine tuning, adjust the image so that it is as close to accurate as possible. This will ideally save you some time and frustration while fine tuning."

Determine the purpose of your talk.,
Consider your audience.,
Prepare a talk using the following format:


Lead with an introduction.,
Apply the strategies of ethos, logos and pathos when you prepare a speech for an audience.,
Make your speech easy for the audience to follow.,
Practice your delivery.",How to Prepare a Talk," When preparing a speech, you must keep this purpose in mind and tailor the content around it. Consider what you want to accomplish with your talk.


Illicit a response. That response may be emotional, intellectual or action-oriented.
Convince the audience. An argumentative speech aims at presenting a specific point of view and bringing the audience to a point of relating, or agreeing, with that point of view.
Teach the audience. The purpose of an informative speech is to educate the audience on a subject or idea that they may not be familiar with.;
, When you prepare a speech, it is important that you take your intended audience into consideration.


Identifying characteristics. These include age, race, common interests, socioeconomic class, gender and education. It is important that you are careful not to alienate your audience with the language or tone of your talk.
Audience knowledge. Consider how informed your audience is on the issue of your talk, and what type of understanding they are seeking from your talk. This will determine the depth of information you need to provide in your speech.

, Your introduction should grab the audience's attention, inform the audience of the talk purpose (thesis) and lead into the main body. For example, you may grab your audience's attention with a personal story, present your thesis by explaining how the story illustrates the purpose of your speech and lead into the body with a strong transition phrase.
Fill the body with relevant content. Identify points that reinforce your thesis and organize the body of your talk accordingly. Illustrate each point clearly, providing supporting information to give audience a clear picture of how each point lends itself to your thesis. 3 to 5 supporting points is standard, depending on the time constraints of your talk.
Close with an effective conclusion. Prepare a speech conclusion that reminds the audience of each of your main points, then restates the thesis. Include a call to action in your conclusion that incites the audience to partake in a realistic response to what they've just learned. For example, if your speech was about the importance of parental involvement in education, your call to action may be to instruct the audience to participate in their children's education by joining parent-teacher conferences, voting on education reform and helping with homework.

,


Ethos involves gaining the audience's trust by establishing trustworthiness. Be genuine in your approach, and reveal your personal stake in what you have to say.
Pathos involves appealing to the audience's emotions. You may do this by using a personable tone, and by providing supporting information that the audience relates to.
Engage the audience's logos sensibility by providing reliable and factual data to back up your thesis.

,


Use short, concise sentences.
Incorporate clear transitions from 1 point to the next.
Repeat important words and phrases several times throughout the speech.
Provide previews and summaries of the information you relay as you move through each segment of the speech.
Avoid overusing statistical information, as it may be too much information for the audience to take in on an auditory basis.
Avoid using pronouns like ""it"" and ""this"" in favor of specific nouns.

, You may opt to summarize your talk into outline format, or you may transfer your key points onto cue cards. Rehearse your speech out loud, using your outline or cue cards as a reference, until you are comfortable with your ability to deliver the material without prompts.

Breaking down your information into parts and sections will help you to memorize the details more easily. Your outline does not need to be formal or structured in any particular way since you won’t be using it during your presentation.You want to present your main ideas and the secondary ideas for the concepts or subjects you are presenting in your speech.
First determine your main ideas, then determine what information would accompany those ideas and finally any subsidiary information that would help to support your secondary information.;
, Once you have created a basic outline summarizing the information for your speech, you can begin to decide which parts of your speech are more important than others. This will help you allocate the proper amount of time to each point., After determining the importance of each point of your speech, you can start dividing your time accordingly. Be sure you are aware of any time constraints given for the delivery of your speech and distribute the time appropriately., Use your imagination to produce images for each point in your speech. This is the time to really be creative and think outside the box. Close your eyes and form whatever picture comes to mind for each and every bit of information.If your point is about a particular animal such as a tiger, visualize a tiger for that point. If your sub point to that main idea is about how a tiger finds prey, visualize a tiger running towards its prey in the wild.
If you main idea is about how education is changing, visualize a caterpillar turning into a butterfly or a person changing their shoes. If your sub point to that main idea is how different classrooms look, visualize a classroom or visualize two contrasting things like oil and water.

, Now that you have generated images for each point within your speech, come up with a trigger word or phrase to assign to that picture. This trigger word or phrase will help to swiftly prompt you and remind you of the information you need to deliver.A trigger word for a sub point about how a tiger finds prey could be “yum” to stimulate you to think about food.
Trigger words should be short and clear.
Sometimes using unique trigger words works best.
Your trigger words or phrases only have to make sense to you.
Choose words or phrases that quickly jog your memory about the point you’re trying to recall.

, Begin assigning your trigger words to your body parts. Be sure you assign your pictures thoughtfully to easily provoke the information you need to remember.You may want to assign main points to larger body parts such as your feet, stomach, arms, hands, and head.
You may want to assign details or less important points to smaller body parts such as your toes, knees, hips, fingers, and ears.

, You can decide on any order you like when moving from body part to body part. If you have a lot of points to make, start low on your body like your feet or high on your body like your head so you can gradually move along without running out of body parts.Lets say you have 10 points, you can begin at your feet, move to your knees, then your thighs, next to your hips, ribs, shoulders, neck, ears, head, and finally eyes.

, Be sure to remember exactly how many body parts or points your will be making in total when giving your speech. If you are stopping at a total of ten body parts when delivering your speech, be able to recall than number in an instance.


It is vital that you remember how many points to deliver in your speech. Be sure to memorize this number and count as you go so you don’t go over or fall short.

, The most important thing to focus on when memorizing your presentation is to review the information so it becomes second nature to you. Once you know the information within each of your points, you will feel more confident in your ability to articulate the details with ease., Be very certain about the order in which you plan on traveling around your body when delivering your presentation. Memorize the order you will follow when presenting.Besides just recalling how many points to hit, be sure you know the correct order. You must not be reluctant about where to go next when moving from body part to body part or your presentation will lack fluidity.

, Practice moving in the correct order from body part to body part without practicing your points. You have to be able to move quickly from one spot to the next without thinking so that when you are delivering your presentation you can do it smoothly and without hesitation.Take some time to simply practice the order you plan on moving around your body. Make sure to do this without actually stopping to present the main ideas at these stopping points. You’ll want to be able to move very swiftly and be certain about where to go next.

, Make sure you come up with fluid transitional sentences to move you from one point to another so your presentation flows with ease.Transition sentences are phrases that link one thought to another. It is so very important that you incorporate these into your presentation.
If you do not shift from one idea to the next in a proper way using transition sentences you run the risk of sounding robotic and rehearsed. Make certain your thoughts flow so that you are not stopping abruptly or jumping suddenly from one point to another.Examples of good transition words or phrases between similar ideas include ""Similarly,"" ""Likewise,"" etc.
Examples of good transition words or phrases between contrasting ideas include ""On the contrary,"" ""Contradictory to,"" etc.

, Be certain that you remember each trigger word or phrase you created and review them over and over until you can swiftly name them in proper order.

, Practice makes perfect and memorizing a presentation in order to deliver it smoothly is no exception. Practice aloud by pretending you are in front of an audience. The more you rehearse your presentation the better your delivery will get."
"
Prepare your presentation.,
Make note cards with your key points at the top and smaller points below.,
When you are speaking to people, look them in the eye.,
Give your entire presentation to yourself, in the mirror.,
Go for it!",How to Make Eye Contact While Giving an Oral Presentation," If it is entirely oral and there is no visual aid (i.e.: Power Point, Photos, Short Film, etc) you will need to make sure that you know all of your material. Spend time reading and trying to memorize your key points. It might help to make a list of ten key points that you absolutely need to cover. Study them, recite them, record them and put the sound file on your iPod or MP3 player and listen to them before you go to sleep.;
, Practice giving your presentation by reading off of the cards and looking up towards a stuffed animal or pause a video or TV show when the screen is focused on a character's face. Try looking the figure in the eye while doing this. Repeat this often and try using the cards less and less. Don't look at one person for too long making them uncomfortable. A rule of thumb would be to hold eye contact for about 3-5 seconds. Make eye contact across several areas of the audience in a natural manner trying not to jump from person to person quickly.

, If you don't normally do this, it might give you a boost of confidence in a regular conversation. Try asking someone to listen to a bit of your presentation (in between classes, during lunch, when ever you have free time). Tell them the key points and try look them in the eye while you are doing so.

, Look into your own eyes as much as possible while you are doing it(this is much harder than it sounds). After you've done this technique, you can also record yourself on your camera and note how many times you look away when you play it back.

, If you've followed these steps and you feel that you are confident in knowing your material, you should be able to look people in the eye while giving your presentation.

Listen to yourself presenting.,
Practice until you have little need for your notes.",How to Plan a Presentation," You should always begin with the end in mind when it comes to planning a presentation. Think about what you're trying to convey, and the best means to do so in the time you have.Try jotting down your most important points. See if you notice a key point emerging. If you wanted your audience to take away one thing from this presentation, what would it be?
Presentations often involve sharing information. However, it isn't enough to just bombard your audience with facts. What do these facts do? What bigger point are you making with the information you have?;
, Your audience will come into the presentation with certain expectations. Know a bit about your audience, their background, and their beliefs. This can help you structure your presentation based around audience needs.One major question is, ""How much background information will my audience have about this topic?"" You need to be able to fill in some blanks for the audience, so keep in mind what your audience may not know.
Also, what does your audience expect from the presentation? Are you trying to sell them a product, introduce them to a new idea, alter their way of thinking? Think about the kind of people in your audience. Do you have a tougher crowd, or do you have a group of enthusiastic people excited about what you're going to say?

, What statements, facts, and points best illustrate the theme of your presentation? These should be included in the body of your work. Think about the length of your presentation. A 10-minute presentation, for example, should include no more than 3 points. What points best speak to one another? Information should flow in a cohesive fashion. Say you're trying to convince a company to implement a recycling program. You have the three following points: corporate pollution is a major contributor to global warming, recycling can help the company save money, and global ice caps are melting at an alarming rate.
While they're all good points, the third does not fit. The first two involve how to improve the company's public image and profits, while the third is just a fact. Try to pick another point related to the company's relationship with recycling.

, Comb through the research you are presenting. Look for your most solid supporting information. This should be the information that will really get the audience thinking, and can inspire change. Supporting information should do three things:It should add clarity to your argument, meaning it will explain anything the audience may not understand. For example, a brief overview of pollution's effect on climate change.
Information should also add authority. You should make connections with existing research, studies, and information. For example, you could mention there is a consensus in the scientific community that global warming is manmade, and briefly overview a few studies.
Lastly, information should add color to your argument. No one likes to sit through a lecture. Try incorporating visuals, like pictures and videos. You could, for instance, show a picture of the amount of waste the average corporation produces in one month.

, Once you've assembled your information, you can get started on outlining your presentation. A presentation must start with a solid introduction that grabs the audiences attention.Include the basics of introducing yourself. This can be brief. You can say something like, ""I'm Clara Thompson from Clean Water Action, and I would like to address your company today.""
Find a way to get your audience's attention. Why should they listen to you? You can open with a question, or a fact, that will grab their attention right away. For example, ""Have you ever passed a body of water covered in green sludge and wondered how this happened? The answer may surprise you. Pollution from corporations, like yours, is a leading cause of water pollution worldwide.""

, Your body should make up about 60 to 70% of your presentation, so put all your best points here.Think of your body as the path to your point. Therefore, you want to find a way to present the information in a logical fashion.For example, you're trying to get the corporation to alter their recycling program. Start by overviewing the vast amount of corporate pollution in the world.
Explain the consequences of this. Show how this pollution contributes to climate change. Then, show your corporation what they can do. Overview ways they can change their policies, and the impact those changes could have.
You have given a clear path here. You started by explaining the problem, moved on to the problem's consequences, and then offered a solution.

, Linking statements are transitional statements that help bridge the gap between ideas. This signals to your audience you're going to switch topics, so your presentation doesn't get confusing.Common linking statements include things like, ""Another important issue...,"" ""Based on this data, you can now see..."" and, ""This brings me to my main point...""
For example, ""Now that I've shown you the effects of corporate pollution, this brings me to my main point. What can you do to stop it?""

, Your audience may get bored with data and lecturing. It's a good idea to add graphics to your slides to shake things up. A short video may also help.If you have any graphs or diagrams that will help illustrate your point, use them. Physically seeing information can help make your point more clear.
You should also see if there are any videos you can include. A brief video of someone succinctly explaining an issue can shake things up a bit.
Pictures are also nice. Each slide should have a picture related to the topic at hand.

, A conclusion should summarize your points, and leave your audience considering the topic you presented. The conclusion should only take up 5 to 10% of your presentation, so keep it brief.You only need one slide. Recap what your point was. Begin with something like, ""As you can see..."" and then briefly repeat your main point.
A visual can help as well. Try adding one last visual aid that sums up your point. A graph or diagram would work well here.

, Time yourself as you practice. Going over 1 to 2 minutes per slide can bore your audience.If you're taking longer, cut some information out. You do not want to talk fast to include all information, as this can make you difficult to understand.
For accuracy, talk in your regular voice. Do not speak too fast or too slow. You want to make sure you can fit in all information talking at a normal rate.

, As you read through your presentation, be on the lookout for irrelevant information. There may be some facts that are interesting, but do they really illustrate the point? When looking for areas to trim down, cut information that does not speak to your theme.Are any facts extraneous? It's great to illustrate the effects of global warming, but do you really need five examples of environmental decay? Maybe you could cut it down to two or three.

, It's a good idea to record yourself and then play the recording back. Listen to yourself talk to see what you need to work on.You should sound enthusiastic when presenting. You should talk without hesitance. There should not be a lot of ""ums"" in your speech.
Make sure you're using your linking sentences. Remember, between topics you should say things like, ""And this brings me to the following..."" rather than jumping between topics.
Watch the time. Make sure your presentation isn't going on for too long.

, It can be distracting if someone is reading from a script during a presentation. While a small index card with key points jotted down can help, you want to minimize your need for notes. Keep practicing until you can deliver your presentation smoothly without fumbling with your notes."

Collect your data.,
Draw an x and a y-axis.,
Label the x-axis.,
Label the y-axis.,
Draw your bars.,
Interpret the data.",How to Make Bar Graphs," The first thing you have to do is to collect all of your data. Remember that a bar graph should show a comparison among categories. Let's say your goal is to organize data on how many inches of rainfall a city received between the months of February 2005 and February 2006. You'll need to find out exactly how much rain fell during each of the months. Once you have this data, you can begin to draw the graph.









Another use of rectangular bars on a graph is called a ""histogram"", not ""bar graph"", to display a continuous range of data in increasing or decreasing value in a list of equally divided range segments to show how these compare. For example, if you were to measure how many people in a classroom fell into a range of heights, and one range was 5 feet (1.5 m) to 5 feet 3 inches (7.6 cm), and so on, then you'd need to use a histogram.

, This will look like a large ""L"" shape. Bar charts are often drawn when one set of data is expressed as a set of categories (which can be periods of time), in which case this set will be the base. The other axis will be values (sales, costs, grades, scores, production amounts, other quantities, etc) for the base categories, groups or periods.








, Divide the number of squares (convenient units) across the page by the number of bars you need to draw to find the width of each bar. If this gives a fraction, round down to the nearest whole number. If the bars do not touch, choose a convenient space and leave this blank between the pairs of bars, often from an appropriate beginning point, such as January, or a certain year. In this example, you should label the x-axis with the names of each of the months you will be using. Let's say you're looking at the months between February of 2005 and February of 2006.









Label the bottom axis. After you've marked down all of the months that you'll be categorizing, you can give the entire axis a label. In this case, let's label the axis ""Months"".

, Divide the highest value of all the bars by the number of squares left above the bottom axis to find what each square represents. If this is a fraction, round up to the nearest whole number. Label the point where the axes meet as 0. Each square above 0 increases by the calculated amount until the value is equal to or greater than the largest vertical bar. If you're working with inches of rain, and your range of rainfall falls from between 10 inches (25.4 cm) and 70 inches (177.8 cm), then it will make sense to label the vertical axis in increments of ten, starting with 0, then 10, then 20, then 30, and so on.








, Extend the base you have marked on the bottom axis to the horizontal line labelled with the value of that bar. If the value falls between two lines, approximate where the correct value would lie. Notice that bars are normally separated (not continuous), as they are comparing the value of different but comparable events, unless this is a distribution (histogram).









For example, if the rain fell to 30 inches (76.2 cm) in February of 2005, then raise the bar up to 30 inches (76.2 cm). If it fell 20 inches (50.8 cm) in March of 2005, then draw the bar accordingly.

, Now that you've made your bar graph, you can have a better sense of the data because you can visualize it. Now you can take a step back and take a look at the important aspects of this data. Here are some things to look for:










Outliers. Outliers are the pieces of data that fall outside the range of normal data that you gathered. In this case, 70 inches (177.8 cm) of rain, which occurred in February of 2006, is an outlier because the rest of the data is far below this norm, with the next highest amount of rainfall being 40 inches (101.6 cm).

Gaps. Look for gaps between the data. There was a gap, or no rainfall, in the month of July, as well as in the months between August and February.

Frequency. See if there's an amount that is frequently occurring. In this bar graph, the most common occurrence is 10 inches (25.4 cm) of rainfall, which happens in April, May, and June.

Clusters. Look for clusters of data. Most of the inches of rainfall occur around the months of February, March, and April of 2005.

Choose organic ingredients to stay within the bounds of your diet.Toss your mix with spices to add a punch of flavor.
You also can drizzle your snack mix with olive oil and herbs and roast it in the oven.;
, Mushrooms are a common ingredient in many appetizers. Many are stuffed with ingredients that are already Paleo, or have stuffing recipes that are easily adaptable.Search the internet for stuffed mushroom recipes you think you'd enjoy, and then experiment with the ingredients.
Don't be afraid to substitute something of similar consistency if you think it would work, or do a separate search for common replacements or substitutions.

, While experts continue to debate whether potatoes are truly Paleo, almost everyone is in agreement that sweet potatoes are. Sweet potatoes and kale make excellent chips for dipping or snacking on alone.For appetizers, you also can experiment with sweet potato fries, or sweet potato skins stuffed with bacon and vegetables.
Bowls of chips encourage your guests to congregate and chat while you put the finishing touches on your holiday meal.

, Trays of sliced fruits and vegetables are Paleo, but many salad dressings, dips, and spreads are not. However, with a little creativity you can satisfy your guests and still stick to your diet.For example, since chickpeas are legumes, they are technically out of the Paleo diet – which means so is hummus. However, you can blend steamed cauliflower in a food processor with your favorite seasonings to create a hummus substitute of similar flavor and consistency.
Pesto is Paleo. You can make many different flavors of pesto sauce, and they're relatively simple to whip up in a few minutes.Even though they're technically sugars, many consider honey and maple syrup to be Paleo, provided you use them sparingly as a treat.
Since avocados are Paleo, you can enjoy guacamole. Mash up the flesh of the avocado with a fork. Add a spritz of lime juice if you would like or some chopped tomatoes.

, Many of the foods that typically crowd the holiday table are already completely (or mostly) Paleo already – think turkey or ham and vegetables. A Paleo holiday meal doesn't have to be too far removed from the traditional holiday meal your guests expect.Dig out your favorite old family recipes well before the meal so you have time to play with them. You might stumble upon a masterpiece through trial and error.
Check Paleo cookbooks or blogs to get ideas of common substitutes. Many Paleo cooks have already adapted lots of recipes, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.
Don't be afraid to think way outside the Paleo ""box."" You can find all sorts of recipes that may be relatively easy to adapt once you study them, even though you would normally steer clear of them.

, If you're serving a turkey, you may think stuffing, which typically includes breading, would be problematic from a Paleo perspective. However, there are plenty of bread-free stuffing alternatives available.You can substitute squash or sweet potato for breading in most stuffing recipes and they'll come out just fine. You also might try using cauliflower.
If you want to get really creative, think about the ""turducken"": a turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with a chicken. Three birds on one plate, and not a grain in sight – you don't get much more Paleo than that.

, Roasting in the oven can help you want to bring out all the subtle flavors of the fresh Paleo vegetables you're serving. You also can get creative with spices and seasonings without a lot of prep work.Cut your vegetables as desired and spread them evenly on a baking sheet. Season them to taste, and slide them in an oven that has been preheated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (about 204 degrees Celsius).
Roast your vegetables for 30 to 40 minutes, or until they reach the desired shade and consistency.
You also can drizzle them with olive or parsley oil, or sprinkle parsley on top once they're done roasting.

, Starches often are considered a staple of the holiday meal, but you can find plenty of ways to manipulate cauliflower so that it stands in for the starches that don't quite fit into the Paleo diet and lifestyle.To whip cauliflower to the consistency that it can substitute for mashed potatoes, you typically want to use a food processor.
Cauliflower rice is perhaps the closest Paleo substitute to actual rice, and has a similar texture. You can also use the cauliflower rice to recreate your favorite rice-based casseroles, or in your turkey stuffing.

, Baked fruits are warm, comforting desserts that are sure to satisfy a sweet tooth while also rounding out a filling and flavorful Paleo holiday meal. Season them with your favorite holiday spices, or drizzle them with honey or maple syrup.Common spices used with apples and pears include cinnamon, ginger, allspice, clove, and nutmeg.
You can also drizzle them with vanilla extract, and garnish with vanilla beans, cinnamon sticks, or lemon rinds.
Hollow or halve the fruit and fill it with chopped nuts, dried currants, or raisins.
Just preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (about 177 degrees Celsius) and bake for 20 to 40 minutes. Check frequently for doneness after the 20-minute mark.

, When you decided to go Paleo you may have sworn off dairy, but you also know that coconut milk isn't really milk. Combine high-quality organic dark chocolate with coconut milk to make the perfect winter treat.You can easily adapt your hot chocolate to suit many different tastes by adding cinnamon or nutmeg, or a few drops of peppermint or vanilla extract.
Make a spicy Mexican hot chocolate by adding a pinch of cayenne and a dash of sea salt.
Use the coconut milk to make coconut whipped cream to twist on top for an extra-decadent holiday treat.

, Pumpkin and apple pies are prominent fixtures at most holiday tables, but while pumpkins and apples are perfectly Paleo, that crust definitely is not. Thankfully, there are many recipes you can use to create grain-free pie crusts so you can honor tradition without sacrificing your dietary principles.Grain-free pie crusts typically use almond flour or coconut flour, along with palm shortening, sea salt, eggs, and honey.
If your recipe calls for gelatin, try to find an organic, grass-fed variety to stay true to the Paleo philosophy.
If you've never tried a grain-free pie crust before, you may want to do a trial run before the day of your holiday feast as they can be tricky.

, Pumpkin pie typically contains dairy products, but you can make a Paleo version by using coconut milk instead. Put one can of pureed pumpkin in a food processor with two eggs, a cup of coconut milk, one teaspoon vanilla, and half a cup of either maple syrup or honey. Blend until smooth, and stir in your favorite pumpkin pie spices. Pour it into your grain-free crust.

Bake this pie for 45-55 minutes at 350 °F (177 °C).

Distribute your pamphlet.",How to Make a Pamphlet," The strongest pamphlets are built around 1 idea, goal or issue. Too many goals will muddle the message to your readers.

,,


For example, a call to action may be to donate, like you on Facebook or email a senator. Make this request short and strong.
Place the Call to Action on an inside page or inside panel.

, Unless you have a highly specialized audience, you will want to make this pamphlet for the layman. Cut out clichés and industry-only phrases. , The front is a good place for the website, while the back panel is a great place for address and map information.


You can save an online map image of your location and place it on the back to help people find you. Make sure all the major streets and landmarks appear on the map.

, Separate your additional information into small excerpts of text that can be divided between the 6 panels in a tri-fold brochure.

, Make a tri-fold and start testing out placement for your information. Ask each person who is working on it to make a sample pamphlet layout in order to share ideas about what should be on the front, inside and back.

, You may even consider putting it on the inside. Make sure it is noticed when it is picked up.

, The place where you put the largest text will train the reader’s eye to follow your message.

, The following are good guidelines for pamphlet design:


Don’t make text less than 12-point. It will become hard to read.
Use bold formatting and italics to highlight information.
Don’t use more than 2 fonts. Make sure those fonts are easy to read by printing out sample text in 12-point font.

, They can be numbered as well.

, If you plan to have it professionally printed, you can do brighter colors; however, keep in mind that it can distract from the text if the layout is too busy.

, Get digital copies of the image, so that you can use them as you make your pamphlet. There are several places you can find captivating images:


Hire a professional photographer to take photos of your location, employees or cause. 1 hour of professional photography can run between $50 and $500, so shop around and hire based on what you can afford. Keep in mind that good photos will increase the effectiveness of a pamphlet.
Find or buy clip art. Search Google or Bing images. Click on the image to see if it is open for use or must be purchased. Very good clip art can be found for $5 and under.
Buy photo rights from Flickr or from local photographers. If you want a stunning image for only 1 project. Buying stock photography is a good investment. Do some price comparisons and negotiate for limited photo rights if you only want to use the photo for a single printed project.

, There are also many options for this project.


Microsoft Word allows you to make brochures within its Publishing layouts. Use a newer version of Word and click “File” and “New from Template.” Choose the “Brochures” option in the Publishing Layouts tab.
Apple’s Pages program is used by many amateur graphic designers because of high quality templates and the ease of use. Click on the “Brochures” option in the “Page Layout” tab. You can purchase Pages for your Mac computer for $19.99 or for your iPad for $9.99.
Graphic designers can turn your sample layout into a finished product using programs like Adobe InDesign or Illustrator. Either hire someone in-house or search for local graphic designers. Most professional designers keep a portfolio so that you can see their past work.

, Pages allows you to drag and drop images into the template. Word asks you to insert the image by right clicking on the image in the layout and changing it or by using the Insert menu above the layout.


Don’t forget to insert your logo in several places.

, You can also type your text from your sample layout, if it is not currently on the computer.


Be careful when copying and pasting from Microsoft Word into Apple’s Pages. You may want to save the text in a rich text format program, such as Notepad or TextEdit so that you can remove the formatting.
Don’t forget to include your contact information.
Format your information using the Word/Pages formatting bars. Both programs are similar, using a top menu for formatting and a pop-out formatting panel. Click on a tab to see different formatting options.

, The first page will include the front, back and interior flap, while the second page will include the 3 inside panels.

, Spell check is not sufficient for a printed project. Ask other people who are involved to check for text and message errors.


Print out copies of the pamphlet on your own printer, as well as sending electronic files for proofing. You may see different mistakes when it is printed.

, You can print it out at home with a 2-sided printer. You can also upload the file to a local print store, such as FedEx Kinkos, upload the file to an online printer or contract with a local printer.


It is better to print using a professional printer, if you are making a brochure for a business or professional organization. Semi-gloss paper and higher resolution will create a product that people are more likely to save.
You will need to choose the paper type, size, turnaround time and proof options when you print the pamphlet professionally.

, The value of your pamphlet is decided by how well you target your chosen demographic and distribute the information. Hire people to distribute it and ask local businesses to keep it on display. "

Get the big picture.,
Find the right paint.,
Paint the wall.,
Paint the screen.,
Add a simple frame.",How to Make a Projector Screen1," Before you set out to create a painted projector screen it can be helpful to have an understanding of the whole project. Knowing what to expect can help you get the right materials and assemble them properly when you move onto those stages. Check out the following overview to get a good grasp on the project:Buy paint for both the wall and the screen.
Paint your wall entirely.
Paint the screen.
Add a frame.;
, Since the main surface of this projector screen will be a painted surface it is critical that you get the right type of paint. Using the wrong type of paint can result in reduced or altered image quality. Make sure your paint will work well for the screen you are building before proceeding.Sherwin-Williams ProClassic Smooth Enamel Satin Extra White, # B20 W 51 is recommended.

, Once you have your paint ready you can begin painting. However, you won't be painting the exact area of the screen just yet. Before you paint the screen it can be a good idea to paint the entire wall. This can help give contrast to the screen, making it stand out and prevent any paint from dripping on the screen itself.Turn on your projector and position it to where you want the image to be on the wall.
Mark off the inside area of where your projected image will be.
Paint the wall around this border, leaving the screen area for later.
Try to use a paint that is non-reflective and darker than your screen paint.

, After your walls have been painted you can begin painting your the screen itself. Take your time and make sure everything is where you want it before you begin creating the screen. Keep some of the following tips in mind as you paint your screen:Move your tape to the outside border of your screen.
Sand the area and make sure the wall surface is flat and free of any holes, cracks, or bumps.
Apply primer and let it dry.
Apply your first coat of paint. Use a small paint roller for the best results.
Once you've got a smooth and dry first coat you can add another to finish.

, To finish your screen you may want to add a simple black frame. The easiest way to add a frame to your painted screen is to use black velvet tape. The frame will help make your screen look completed and can also help improve picture quality as well.Add a strip of black velvet tape to each edge of the screen.
Make sure the tape runs evenly and that your frame is level and straight.
Check that the tape is laying smooth and flat against the wall.

Find a good wall space.,
Measure your projector image.,
Gather your materials and tools.,
Build the frame.,
Attach your screen.,
Add the finishing touches.,
Draw your guidelines.,
Mount on a wall.",How to Make a Projector Screen2," Before you can get started building your projector screen you will need to locate a space in your home that will be best suited for it. This space should be ideal for your projector and have plenty of room for the screen to hang an appropriate distance from your projector.Make sure you have a wall with enough empty space to accommodate your finished screen.
You should have enough space in the room to allow your projector the right amount of distance from the screen.
All projector models will have different requirements.

, Once you've found the ideal space in your home for your projector and projector screen you will want to measure the actual size of the image from your projector. Measuring the image size that you plan on using will allow you to determine the final size of your projector screen.Turn your projector on and have it set to its test image.
Measure the size of the image where you will be using your screen.
Record both the width and the length of the screen.

, Having measured the image size that your projector will be using, you are ready to gather your materials for the screen. The size you are building your screen will vary depending on space and projector model. However, you will need the following basic materials:Four pine boards for the frame. Two will be longer and will run horizontally and two shorter boards will be used for the vertical sides of the frame.
Material for the screen itself. 53” seamless white paper or blackout cloth can be good choices.
Make sure to have at least an extra 5” of your screen material so that you can attach it to the back of your frame.
Screws and a screwdriver.
Flat corner braces.
Three or four picture hangers.
A level and pencil to mark guidelines.

, The frame will be the base upon which your projector screen will be fixed. Creating a square and level frame will help keep your screen flat, smooth, and optimized for using your projector on. Take the following steps to create the perfect frame:Cut your boards with a handsaw to the length you need if they are too long.
Lay the frame out.
Place a corner brace on each corner where the boards meets.
Sink your screws into the wood through the corner braces.
Check to see how stable your frame is. You can add additional braces if needed.

, Once your frame has been built you can affix your projection screen material on and over it. Make sure you work slowly and carefully when attaching the screen to ensure that it properly covers the frame and is free from any wrinkles or dips that could affect picture quality.Lay your screen down flat on the floor.
Place your frame on top of your screen and center it.
Pull the extra screen material up and over the edge of the frame.
Start stapling the screen to the frame. Space your staples about ten inches apart.
Keep the screen taught as you add staples, removing wrinkles as you go.
Go around again and place staples every five inches.

, Although your screen is technically ready to be used you will want to add a few more elements to it. These last few additions will allow you to easily hang it on a wall and can help make the edges of the screen look clean and professional.Screw in regular picture hangers evenly along the top horizontal beam of your frame.
You can try adding black artists tape to the edges of your screen to give it a nice stylistic finish.
Adding a dark border can also help improve picture quality by cutting down on light reflection.

, Before you can hang your projector screen you will need to make sure you are hanging it in the right place. Once you hang your projector screen it will be difficult to reposition, so take your time and be exact.


Turn your projectors test image on.
Use a pencil to lightly outline where the image is being projected.
Use this guideline to help you hang your projector screen in just the right place.

, Now that your screen has been attached to your frame it's time to hang the entire screen on a wall. Place your screen in the exact position that you took your original screen measurements from to ensure that the projected image will fit. Once your screen is hung on the wall it's time to sit back and enjoy your favorite films on it.Use a stud finder to locate stable places on your wall to install the hanger screws and mark them with a pencil.
Draw a level line between the points where you will be adding the hanger screws.
Install the hanger screws using a screwdriver.
Hang the projector screen and enjoy.

Gather your materials and tools.,
Cut the pipes.,
Build the frame.,
Attach the tarp.",How to Make a Projector Screen3," Building a portable projector screen can be a fun way to allow you to watch movies in any location that has electricity. The screen and frame will require you to purchase some easy to find materials from nearly any hardware store. Take a look at the following materials and tools that you will need to get started:Something to cut PVC pipe with.
A glue for PVC pipes.
Twenty feet of rope or cord.
A drill to make holes in the PVC pipes.
6 10' long sections of 1” diameter PVC pipes.
8 1” diameter, 90 degree PVC elbows.
2 1” diameter, 45 degree PVC elbows.
1 straight connector
6 1” diameter T connectors
Tape
1 6'x8' white tarp.

, The PVC pipes that you bought will need to be cut down to the right sizes before you can begin assembling them together. It's important that you measure them carefully and make your cuts accurate. Double check that your cuts are the right ones by taking a look at this list:Cut two pipes to be 8' 6”. Save the parts you cut away.
Cut two pipes to be 6' 6”. Save the pieces you cut off.
Cut two pipes to be 6' 3”. Don't throw the scrap away.

, After you have all of your pieces assembled and your pipes cut to the length you can begin assembling the screen. Since PVC pipes are standardized, building the screen will require you to simply connect the pieces to one another. Take a look at the following order of connections to build your frame:Connect the two 8'6” pipes to the 6'6” pipes using your 90 degree connectors. This builds the bottom rectangular base.
Add three T-connecters to the 8'6” pipes. They should be spaced two feet apart from each other and the corners.
On the back of the base, place the 3'6” pieces of pipes into the T-connectors closest to the corners.
Put ninety degree elbows on these 3'6” pipes and then add the 1'6” piece out of them. Add a 45 degree elbow on the end of that pipe.
From those 45 degree elbows, connect the 6'3” pieces and connect them down to the front T-connectors.
Use a straight connector to join the two 3'9” pipes. Add a ninety degree elbow to each end.
Take a small 3” piece of pipe and join this long pipe to the center T-connectors.

, After your screen is setup you can add your tarp to finish off your portable projector screen. Adding the tarp will require you to drill some holes in the pipe, running your cord through them and attaching the screen to the frame.Drill holes in the four corners of your frame.
Put your cord through the holes.
Thread the cord down the length of the frame, putting it through the eye-holes of the tarp as you go.
Tie the cords off to secure the screen in place.

Learn and understand the topic.,
Organize the material in a clear and logical manner.,
Clearly explain and define key concepts.,
Create interesting visual aids.,
Include audio and video material when possible.",How to Make a Presentation Fun1," If you are asked to give a presentation on a certain topic it is likely because you are knowledgeable about the material. If this is not the case, you need to make sure you fully understand the material inside and out prior to the presentation. The best presenters are those who understand the topic and are clearly passionate about the material they are presenting.For example, if you are asked to present on ethics in business, for a university business class you are likely not an expert on the topic. However, you should still thoroughly research the topic and communicate to your classmates why this is an important topic.
Keep in mind why you are presenting on the topic and what should be achieved at the end of the presentation.;
, The most engaging presentations are easy for the audience to follow. Make sure that the material you are presenting is arranged in a logical order and flows between topics. This will help you maintain the attention of your audience. The audience should not struggle to follow the presentation because this will detract from the information being communicated.For example, if you are giving a presentation on how to engage with social media you should begin by outlining different social media platforms. Then explain how each one works, and then provide more detailed information concerning different types of posts, when to post, how to respond to comments etc.

, Some presentations will include complex concepts or key terms that require special attention. It is a good idea to isolate these terms and concepts and clearly explain them to the audience.If you are teaching an undergraduate class in geography, for example, you may want to spend some time defining the difference between human geography and physical geography.
Often these definitions will warrant their own slide if you are using visual aids.

, The most engaging presentations are always accompanied by some form of visual aid, usually a slideshow presentation. Slideshows allow you to provide graphs, charts, images, and text to accompany your oral presentation. Often these materials provide a fun way to enhance the learning experience for the audience. For example, if you are presenting financial reports to your coworkers a slideshow will allow you to include graphs and charts that can help the audience visualize the numbers you are explaining.Consider using one of these helpful tools:Powerpoint
Keynote
Google Slides
Zoho Show
Prezi

, Audio and video material can also be included to make a presentation more dynamic and fun. When possible, include a video or audio clip from a relevant movie, television show, music video, or commercial. This will help to break up your presentation so that the audience does not become bored listening to your voice the entire time. Depending on the type of presentation, videos or music can be played before a presentation begins while people are still taking their seats.If you are giving a lecture in history you may want to provide video footage of the event your are discussing, for example, the Vietnam War or Iron Curtain Speech.
You could also use a recent clip from a television show to highlight a specific point you are trying to make in your presentation. Be creative.

Come up with a general idea for your presentation.,
Organize existing information and materials.,
Plan a logical flow of your presentation.,
Find user-friendly and efficient software for creating interactive presentations.,
Start building slides using the chosen software.,
Use only suitable items.,
Try to stick to a unified color scheme in your presentation.,
Leave some empty space in your slides.,
Make it short and highlight the most important information - less words more action.,
Add some action to engage a viewer.",How to Make a Great Slideshow Presentation Without Being a Pro," It helps if you have a particular reason for making a presentation, such as using slides for illustrations for your public speech or creating an animated user guide. Otherwise, you may get inspiration from truly exceptional presentations, pictures or videos that you have seen or know about.;
, Put all digital files in one folder. Doing this provides multiple benefits:


Easy access to all relevant text documents, pdfs, digital images and video
Assessment of the material accumulation you have brought together
When looking at the files, you might use for your slideshow you are getting ideas on better ways to apply them.

, It does not need to be a real plan drawn on paper. You may create it in your mind. Just take a moment and think what information should come at the beginning, how to engage a viewer with the first slide and how to put an end to your presentation.

, Note that the software should offer stylish templates and graphic elements, handy tools to modify and customize your slides along with an intuitive interface. Last but not least - it must be able to produce a slides which are viewable on every device. There are several popular tools like Flash, PowerPoint, and a variety of online options. Flash used to be the gateway to interactivity but its demise has been result of not being supported by mobile devices. Powerpoint remains a popular tool but has its limitations or a learning curve for creating professional slides.

, In the beginning it helps to take it easy - open any pre-built template you like and start adding your own titles, text, pictures and icons. As appetite comes with eating, inspiration comes within creative workflow. As soon as you begin to compile visual elements, an idea on how to rearrange and modify your slides can come instantly.

, Generally a presentation should contain graphic elements designed in a similar style. This gives it continuity and a cleaner feel. Avoid adding pictures or icons which do not look good together with other slide components. If you are short in pictures, you can always find plenty on them using free online services (free photo stocks, Flickr and similar resources). The other good idea is to use complimentary icon and other graphic elements gallery (usually a good presentation software has built-in galleries).

, It means using the same color and color combinations for background, titles, text, frames, shapes and icons throughout all the slides. It makes your slideshow look very neat and stylish as if it was designed professionally.

, A lot of people tend to pack their slideshows with as much information and graphic as they can. But it makes slides hard to read and understand. That’s why it is so important to leave some empty space which separates different sections. Blank canvas helps viewers to focus on key blocks instead of shifting their eyes around the slide hopelessly trying to find the main idea.

, Formulate every issue in just one brief sentence, turn it into a big title and add an expressive picture. It works much better than tons of text typed in 10 point font.

, Help a viewer to absorb information quickly - give short ideas one by one. Using animation effects add more fun to your presentation. Arrange the logical order in which elements must appear on canvas. Choose several built-in animation effects you like the most and use them for all of the slides. Don’t forget to add enough time to let your viewers read each slide thoroughly.

Ask questions throughout the presentation.,
Have audience members help with the presentation.,
Find creative ways to distribute additional material.,
Provide a refreshment break if possible.,
Allow time for the audience to ask questions.",How to Make a Presentation Fun2," Encourage your audience to think actively about the subject you're presenting by asking questions. This will help to engage your audience and make the presentation more fun. Make sure that the questions you ask either promote discussion or critical thinking. For example, asking an audience: ""Does anyone have any questions?"" is good manners, but is often met with silence. Try asking your audience open-ended questions like ""What's the most difficult or frustrating aspect of this new software for you?"" Try out these fun ways to encourage audience participation in your next presentation:Ask questions that people can answer by raising their hand. For example, you could ask “how many people in the audience are bloggers?” This will engage the audience without putting them on the spot to talk and is a great way to ask questions when you have a large audience.
Give out treats when people answer questions correctly. For example, you could hand out a lollipop or chocolate bar each time some answers a question correctly. This may motivate people to engage with the material and participate frequently.
Put questions in a bowl at the front of the room and have audience members pick them out at random. This is a creative way to ask questions and helps to involve audience members in the presentation.

, Depending on the type of presentation you are giving you may be able to ask some of the audience members for help at different points. This will allow you to actively engage audience members and will ensure that your presentation is both fun and memorable. A few ways to allow the audience to actively engage with your presentation include.Having audience members read out information or explain certain points.
Asking audience members to help hand out additional material.
Allowing audience members to help with a demonstration.

, If you need to provide the audience with a handout or any additional material you can come up with creative ways to include the audience. For example, you could hide material under their chairs so that the audience members have to move around in order to access the material. During a more informal presentation you could create a scavenger hunt for the audience to find materials hidden throughout the room. Be creative and come up with a fun way to distribute material and make your presentation stand out.

, If you are giving a long presentation, regardless of how fun you are making it people will get tired and their minds will start to wonder. By giving a 10 to 15 minute break you will allow the audience a chance to go to the washroom, get a coffee, socialize, and stretch their legs. This will help you keep their attention for the remainder of the presentation.

, Some audience members may want to ask questions during the presentation. Make sure that you set aside time to allow your audience to make comments and ask questions about the material. This will help them engage with the presentation. Here are a few suggestions for incorporating a Q and A section into your talk:Allow audience members to raise their hand and ask questions at any point.
Periodically ask the audience if anyone has a question. Typically this should be done at the end of a specific section or segment of the presentation.
Set aside time for questions at the very end of the presentation.

Be a dynamic presenter.,
Provide a humorous observation or anecdote.,
Make eye contact.,
Make a personal connection.",How to Make a Presentation Fun3," These is nothing worse than listening to a presenter with a monotone voice. Entertain your audience by showing your enthusiasm for the topic. This will make your presentation more fun to listen to and will help keep the attention of the audience. Use inflection in your voice, be excited, incorporate hand gestures and move around the room. Your enthusiasm for the topic will rub off on audience members. Even if you are presenting on a perceivably boring topic you can help make it fun by being enthusiastic and dynamic.If you are standing on a stage there's nothing stopping you from getting off and walking through the audience as you present.
Be aware of the volume of your voice. In a large auditorium you may need to speak louder in order to be heard in the back.

, Presentations are always more fun if you can find a way to insert a little humour, but this is not an easy task. Here are a few things to consider when adding a joke to any presentation:Know your audience: You should know the general age and interests of the audience members in order to ensure that the joke is not offensive and that they will understand the joke. For example, avoid making references to the television show Frasier if you are presenting to high school students. They will not get the joke.
Use safe humour: Avoid using the audience as the butt of the joke or dividing the audience (ie joking about women or blondes), or using offensive language. Instead you can use gentle self deprecating humour. You could say ""I know you all rushed here to listen to a presentation on making photocopies."" This joke allows you to acknowledge in a sarcastic way the dry nature of the topic you are presenting on.
Integrate the humour into your presentation: The best way to include jokes in a presentation is to stay on topic. Try and make sure the joke relates to the material being presented.
Rehearse the joke: Practice the joke as part of your presentation and test it out on other people before presenting. This will allow you to get the timing right and ensure that the joke with get a laugh.

, Making eye contact with your audience is a great way to hold their attention and provide an effective and entertaining presentation. If you are presenting to a small group you should try and make eye contact with all audience members. For larger audiences try and make eye contact with each section of the audience.Avoid only making eye contact with the people you know in the audience or with the person who is assessing the presentation.

, If you can find a way to make the topic you are presenting meaningful to your audience it is more likely to have a lasting impact. For example, try and tell a relevant story or current event and connect it to the topic of the presentation. This will get your audience thinking and will make your topic more relatable. Alternatively you could try providing a local connection. For example, how does this topic directly impact the people in the audience?For example, if you are presenting to a group of high school students about bullying and social media you may want to draw their attention to a few examples of young celebrities using social media to attack one another. This could help to make the topic more relatable to the young audience by connecting to a story they are familiar with.

Though having a degree or lots of experience in the field can help convince your audience, researching the topic as thoroughly as you can is your best bet for making them believe every single word you say.


Hit the Internet and library and talk to experts to get a better idea of your subject, until you feel that you can effectively give a presentation on your subject and answer any questions that will arise along the way.






The more research you do, the more confident you'll be about giving your presentation. And if you're more confident, you'll be better at giving your presentation.;
, If you want to polish your presentation skills, then you have to give a lot of thought to who will be in the audience. If you know you'll be presenting to your fellow classmates, then you have to think about what will intrigue and interest them. If you're presenting your topic to a group of specialists, then you can assume they know the lingo; if you're presenting a complicated topic to a group of eighth graders, however, then you'll have to simplify it so they can follow along.


Though you can't know everything your audience will and will not want to know, you can figure out a lot based on the age and the make-up of the group of people you'll be presenting to. Keep this in mind as you hone your presentation.

, Chances are that you have a certain time limit for giving your presentation, whether it's half an hour for a work presentation or ten minutes for a presentation in class. Whatever your time limit is, you should make your presentation so it fits comfortably under the time limit so you don't spend your time talking too fast to try to hit every point; however, you shouldn't make it so much shorter that you're left with a lot of ""dead time"" at the end.


The closer your presentation is to meeting that time limit, the more relaxed you'll be about presenting your material, and the better your presentation skills will be.

, Technology, from using music or a slide projector, can help enhance your points and engage your audience. However, having too much technology can have the opposite effect -- they call it ""Death by PowerPoint"" for a reason. So, if you do decide to use technology, make sure that it helps you engage your audience and to have stronger, more confident presentation skills instead of alienating your audience.


It can be easy to use technology as a crutch. You may feel less prepared and skilled if you're depending on a machine to do some of the work for you. However, if you think having some charts, graphs, or bullet-pointed arguments will be really helpful for making your point, then by all means go for it.

, A logical and well-organized presentation structure will help you improve your skills because all of your work will be laid out for you. Though you can have room for creativity when creating a presentation, most presentations, just like most essays, typically follow a similar structure. Here's how it should look:Introduction: Hooking your your audience and introducing the main points you'll be making. In other words, ""Tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em.""
Body: Using specific examples, facts, stories, and data to help illustrate your point. In essence, ""Tell 'em."" Restate your most important points to make sure they resonate with your audience.
Conclusion: Wrapping up your presentation with some food for thought while summarizing your main points. That is to say, ""Tell 'em what you told 'em.""

, If you want to improve your presentation skills, then one of the best things you can do is to practice your presentation. Practice it in front of the mirror, practice it in the shower, practice it in front of your close friends or family members. You should not, however, memorize it word for word, or your presentation will sound too rehearsed and you'll feel out of your element if you lose your place or are asked an unexpected question. Instead, you should practice it enough that you feel so comfortable with the subject matter that you can ad-lib a little.You can film yourself giving the presentation if you think that will help you improve. However, some people actually get more nervous by doing this, so it's up to what you think is best.

, You can't go into a presentation sweating bullets or stuttering because you're so nervous that you can barely see straight. Instead, take a breather at least a few hours before a presentation, whether it means drinking a cup of camomile tea, meditating, or going for a walk. If you want to relax, then you have to prepare well in advance -- you won't be able to relax if you're perfecting and practicing your speech minutes before you have to present. Remember that the more relaxed you are, the easier it will be for your audience to connect to you, and the more fun you'll have.Drink a tall glass of water to lubricate your vocal chords before you go on stage. Keep a glass or bottle of water with you on stage if it helps you relax and to pause occasionally.






Arrive early to feel comfortable in the space where you'll be presenting. If you're presenting in an auditorium or another large building, then walk around the place or even sit in the audience to get a feel for it.
If you want to help yourself relax, then remember that your aim is connection, not perfection. You want to connect with your audience instead of giving a bullet-proof presentation, and it's much easier to connect if you feel like you're being yourself.

, Kill 'em with confidence before you even say your first word. If you look like you're confident about who you are and believe in what you're saying, then the audience will be much more likely to have faith in you. So, look sharp, have a big smile on your face, and make eye contact with your audience to show them that you're unafraid and know your stuff. Even if you're not feeling very confident, giving off confident vibes will help you feel at ease, and will make people more likely to believe in you.Don't slouch. Keep your head high and your spine straight.
Don't fidget or play with your hands. You can use your hands occasionally to gesture for emphasis, but don't do it too much or you'll look even more nervous.
Be able to laugh at yourself. If you've made a little mistake, laugh it off and the crowd will laugh along with you instead of feeling awkward.
Use forceful words and speak as if everything you say is a fact. Don't say, ""I think that San Francisco may be a better city than LA"" if the goal of your presentation is to prove that San Francisco is vastly superior to its southern cousin city; say, ""San Francisco is a better city than LA, hands down,"" and your audience will be more likely to agree with you.

, You have to wow your audience from the get-go. If you have them hooked from the first word, then they'll be more likely to follow along the rest of the way. Start with a shocking or relevant fact, a funny and engaging anecdote, or with an inspiring quote. Whatever you start with, make sure that it's conducive to your presentation and isn't just there for the entertainment value.Whatever you do, do not apologize for having to give the presentation, even if it's a required presentation for work or school. Nothing will make your audience zone out faster than if you say, ""Sorry to bore you guys with all this technical mumbo-jumbo, but I've gotta do it…""

, Being articulate is the key to improving your presentation skills. You can plan the most fascinating presentation of all time but your audience won't get a thing out of it if you're speaking too quietly or too fast or are rambling on so much that they don't get your main point. Focus on speaking clearly and slowly, and loudly enough for everyone to hear you. Let your expression match your words and people will be more likely to understand your words and to connect with you.Pause between sentences for emphasis, and work on eliminating as many ""ums"" and ""uhs"" as possible without freaking out if you use a few of them -- after all, even President Obama has been known to use a healthy dose of ""ums"" when getting his point across.
Keep it concise. Work on trimming down any extra words and focus on what's important. You don't need a million adjectives to get your point across -- just one perfectly-chosen adjective will do.
Read as much as you can to improve your knowledge base and vocabulary. This, in turn, will make you sound more intelligent and articulate.

, If you want to fully articulate your points, then you'll need to use stories, anecdotes, statistics, and facts to support your ideas. If you tell your audience that a healthy diet is the key to a happy life but have no evidence to back it up, why should they believe you? Even if you're charming and funny, if there's no substance to your speech, your audience will be able to tell. Stories are a great way to create a human connection and to illustrate a point effectively without slowing down your momentum.You don't need a million facts and statistics, either; one or two carefully-chosen facts or statistics can really blow your audience away.
A story or a statistic can be an effective, engaging way to open a presentation. You can also return to it at the end to wrap things up.

, Though you should avoid the second person when you're writing a formal essay, the word you is crucial to connecting to your audience during a presentation. You want to make each and every person feel that you're talking to him or her so that the person feels that your presentation can actually benefit him or her. You should say, ""You can learn to manage conflict effectively in under an hour with five simple points,"" instead of ""Any person can learn to manage conflict…"" Though you're essentially saying the same thing, using you whenever it's appropriate will get your audience more involved in your presentation., Connect through your emotion. Nobody likes a boring speaker so infuse some energy into your gestures, inflect your voice as you would when talking to someone one-on-one, attempt self-deprecating humor and don’t be afraid to show your failures as an example to learn from.

, Though every word in your presentation should count, undoubtedly there will be at least two or three points that you want your audience to walk away with. It's okay to remind your audience of these points by repeating them for emphasis; you can even do so without getting boring or repetitive. If you use a story or anecdote to illustrate a point, remind your audience of what the point is, and return to it later in your presentation, if not at the end. Let your audience see that some of the points you've made are more important than others.


Another way to emphasize your important points is to slow down when you want your audience to really home in on your words. Use your hands to gesture for emphasis if it's necessary.

, Having a question and answer period can help your audience really understand your material, connect with you and your presentation, and feel like they have gotten the full story on the subject you presented about. If you feel that your presentation calls for a question and answer period and that you can effectively make time for one without derailing your presentation, then you should plan for having a question and answer period after you've given the body of your presentation -- but before the closing.You should give a time limit for questions, say, 5-10 minutes. Tell your audience that you're going to make this much time for questions so that you don't get off track by answering so many questions that your audience has forgotten the gist or your presentation.
Make sure you have a conclusion after the question period. You don't want to give a stellar presentation and then have it peter off into a series of irrelevant questions.

, End your presentation on a solid note. Don't let your presentation taper off or wrap things up when you or the audience looks bored. Give a firm conclusion that continues to engage your audience while reminding them about the most important points of the presentation. It's okay to ""tell 'em what you told them,"" as a reminder about the central message of the presentation. Stay confident up until the very end, keep your head high, and even thank your audience for their participation if it's necessary.Avoid looking bored with your own presentation or eager to get off stage. Don't say something like, ""Well, that about covers it,"" or ""That's all I've got"" -- be confident that you've given a great presentation and be excited about wrapping it up with a nice little bow.

, You can't just walk off the stage or away from the front of the room with a big grin on your face just because you feel like you nailed it. Even if you've given a stellar speech, there is always room for improvement, and you should look at every presentation that you give as a learning experience. And if you feel like you failed horribly, that's okay, too, and it means that you can learn even more from your experiences. Here are some great ways to get feedback:Have a trusted friend or co-worker sitting in the audience who can evaluate your work objectively. He or she can take notes on your confidence level, your articulateness, as well as the audience's reaction. You can even ask a few people to do this if you want more objective feedback.
Pass out a questionnaire at the end of your presentation. Ask people to give you an honest analysis of how you did. Though taking criticism isn't always fun, it's an incredibly valuable tool.
Consider taping yourself to see how you look on stage. How you felt during the presentation may not be a completely accurate representation of what the audience saw.
Consider taping the audience. This can also help you gauge the audience's reactions, and will show which parts they thought were the most engaging, and which parts were the most boring or confusing.
Check in with yourself. How do you feel that you did? Which parts did you struggle with the most? How can you learn from this presentation to make your next one even more stellar?

, Go see the best speakers in person and decide for yourself what makes them great. Why is Anthony Robbins a good or bad speaker? Is Steve Jobs inspiring? How does he deliver that inspiration through his presentation? How about MLK, FDR, or Winston Churchill? Watch other people give presentations or speeches and take notes. See what you can learn -- and what you can toss out. Seeing other people speak to large audiences can be inspiring and can make you feel like you too can accomplish this daunting task.


Remember that even the speakers who look the most relaxed may suffer from horrible stage fright. With enough hard work, anyone can overcome that fear and look completely relaxed while being scared on the inside.

, If you really want to improve your presentation skills, then joining a Toastmaster's organization can help you grow as a public speaker. You'll also meet interesting people, learn a variety of topics, and will learn to give articulate and exciting presentations in front of large audiences. If you want to succeed in public speaking for work, school, or just because it's something you love, then this is a wonderful option., Another option is to take a course or seminar that can help you improve your public speaking skills. Your school or workplace may offer such courses, and they can be a great resource. You'll gain insight on what it means to give great public speeches from experts and will also be given the chance to practice in front of a relatively small audience. These courses will be small and supportive, and you'll feel less nervous about presenting since you know that everyone in the audience will also have to present at some point.


If you want to improve your presentation skills, then taking a course in the subject will boost your abilities -- and your confidence.

, They will be able to help you in deciding if each show is suitable for your business.

, Do not go overboard if your on a tight budget.You don't want to be stressed thinking about all the money you're putting out upfront and hoping that you'll make it back.

, Most companies fail to let people know they are participating in a trade show. This is a big mistake! If you don't tell anyone you're at the show and all the other vendors don't tell their customers they're at the show, how do you expect to have a successful show? You must let all your customers, family, friends know about the event your participating in. To do this you can try some of these approaches:


Simply send out an email blast, send Twitter updates about the event, post an event on Facebook or invite your Facebook contacts to an existing event page.
Post free ads on online classifieds.
Put up a poster in your store so customers coming in can see or post up a note on your website.


These simple yet effective methods will increase your chances of a successful show.

, Entice your customers to come to the show by offering a show special. You can do this by emailing/mailing your customers a printable coupon or having some coupons by the till to hand out to let them know about your special offer.

, Easy way to do this is smile! ""Welcome to..."".

, This is unwelcoming and people will just walk by. For those inevitable needed breaks, hire staff to help you out.

, Make it inviting so people want to come in and see what you have.

, Although this sounds trite, potential customers respond to your vibes and enthusiasm. If they can see you're passionate about your product or service, they'll be attracted.

Don't be scared to make a difference.",How to Make a Meaningful Difference in the World," Journal about why these things are important to you and the personal connection you have to them. For example, you may have witnessed a beautiful local forest become an industrial nightmare and now you feel strongly that this kind of beauty and natural resources should have more protection from development. Journal as much or as little as you like, writing a journal is a great habit, it helps reduce stress and also helps you become a critical thinker, which brings us to the next point.;
, Question everything and try to see as many viewpoints as possible. Expand your research beyond Googling, there are many resources for information, such as magazines, books, documentaries, newspapers and opinions and experiences of people you know. Be educated, stand for your rights. Know that even the news and school-teachers can give you information tainted with biases which may not be the whole truth. There are two sides to every story. When you research realize that issues are two-sided and both are valid healthy viewpoints even if you do not personally agree. Diversity is one thing that makes this world an amazing place to be.

, Know that a positive attitude will help you through many things in life, and also that you do not have to have another's praise to affirm your own worth. Know thoroughly and truly your own strengths and weaknesses, don't lie to yourself, it's a waste of time, live in courage and not fear. Embrace your strengths and even your weaknesses, use them to your advantage. We all have something to give and our voice is meant to be heard.

, Have at least a vague idea or even a list of what you want to accomplish for the day, be it one thing or many things or part of a larger goal. Don't completely waste your time talking negatively to yourself or other's or spend an excessive amount of time on the computer, though of course there are many constructive things you can do on the internet too. It can be used many ways so pick a meaningful use of time, like perhaps learning a bit of a foreign language. Know that you will achieve what you want to with patience and persistence.

, In the past religious values were very important to most and to some they are still but our values today are less rigid and you can define what you value personally. The way you perceive the world is different from anyone else, your spiritual views can shape them too.

, Know what goes on in the world around you. As an example of this, in European countries most people keep a careful watch of what goes on in the news, because they have dealt with tyrants and do not want leaders to take advantage of them. You have more power when you know what goes on because it trickles down and will perhaps, in some way, effect you. Make an effort to watch the news everyday and read the newspaper.

, It is so important, the greatest gift if you can, voting is a right women and various cultural groups fought for centuries. Still today in some countries people are trying to achieve this great right. It is a privilege and you must know it is and treat it as such.

, Write letters to your country's leader, a response to a newspaper article that sparked your interest, email companies you believe are using unethical practices. What you think matters.

, It looks great on resumes, it builds character, people and social skills, work ethic, improves your self-esteem, helps you see the bigger picture, use your time constructively, gives you experiences and maybe great memories too! Many people that volunteer learn of talents they never knew they had.

, See beyond appearance, as they say, looks are deceiving, imagine all the people that can prove you wrong. Be generous and sensitive to violence in our desensitized culture.

, You may not know how many things we buy from various stores, the worst culprits being Bargain stores but many others are produced by Third world labor, when something says ""Made in China"", it almost always means the people who made it were exposed to horrible conditions and paid barely anything. Research the effects on Third World Labor on the environment and on human rights. Know that the more people speak up about this issue, the more it will change. You can help this issue by buying Fair trade, which supports workers in developing countries by paying them fair wages which help break the cycle of poverty.

, Thank your ""God"" whoever he/she might be, that you are the unique you and nobody else like you and never will be. Make it a challenge to come up with the biggest list of blessings in your life you can.

, Save them, they will add up and you can put them in donation bins commonly found near cash registers for various charities. Every cent counts!

, Instead learn about an exotic culture, history, pop music from a different nation such as C-Pop, J-Pop and K-Pop, look at beautiful art, post your own art, upload beautiful photography, learn a recipe from a different culture that sounds yummy, go on magazines websites for free articles of information, write and read poetry, start a blog, etc. Some great sites that truly make a difference are Change.org, where you can sign petitions of things you believe in, SocialVibe.com which has sponsors that donate to the charity of your choice when you sign up and complete activities, thehungersite.com which has sponsors also that donate when you simply click and there is a site called blackl.com which uses less energy than standard Google and is also run on wind energy! Create Facebook groups for a cause, leave kind messages on the internet and try to say kind, truthful things in general even when you are angry. It makes a strong person to do this but something we are all capable of.

, Think of all the flags that represent you, first would be the flag your country, than state or province and city, maybe your nationality or cultural group has a flag, perhaps you are homosexual and the rainbow flag represents you. You will be surprised how many groups you belong to yet you are your own self regardless of your flags. They are part of who you are but do not define you.

, We all only have so much time on this earth, so seek to understand the power of love and peace and know no matter who you are or where you come from you are part of the bigger picture and you matter in creating a better future for the generations to come.

, There are many, many wonderful charities out there.

,, You cannot be afraid to speak up in front of people. Speaking in front of people to make them believe in your idea may seem like a grand way to get yourself in trouble, but only if you really want to fulfill your dream you shall have the courage to do so. Most of the time people laugh at your idea and say that it is not possible, but if you work hard enough and never give up then you can prove them wrong."

",How to Make a Positive Contribution to the World," While there are many serious issues equally worthy of your attention and support, you'll have the greatest impact if you focus on the challenges that you are passionate about.;
, Some causes can be supported simply by choosing a certain product over another while shopping (e.g. Fair Trade). For other causes, without having qualifications or expertise, they can only really be supported by donating money (e.g. charities for diseases). Consider your natural abilities, skills and strengths and how you can use these to make a positive contribution in your own unique way. Don't despair of the skills you don't possess, but work with what you have. Remember, not even people like Gandhi or Mandela were perfect in every way. They just had strong belief and determination in their own personal power to change things.

, This might sound like hard work, but if you're serious about implementing positive change, it's important to be as knowledgeable as possible on it, otherwise people won't take you seriously. Plus if it's something you're truly passionate about, then you will most likely find the motivation to do this. Ignorance is not your friend!

, Yet, understand that not everyone shares the same priorities as you, though they might still support your cause of choice. If everyone's main priority was the environment, and they all devoted their energy to it, there would be serious imbalance in other areas, which could lead to disaster! Don't berate people if they don't agree, just try to spread awareness. A lot of positive change has occurred when enough people have become aware and educated about world issues.

Find out about development aid.,
Orient up of successful models.,
Connect Help and Self-Help.,
Promote the common sense.,
Build islands of happiness first.,
Work for the cooperation of all positive people.",How to Help Save Africa From Hunger and Poverty," Harvard Professor Jeffre Sachs published in 2005 the book ""The End of Poverty"" . In it, he makes concrete suggestions as to how extreme poverty can be overcome in Africa. His main finding is that Africa itself can not escape the economic hardship. The rich Western countries need to help financially and with personnel. Jeffrey Sachs has developed a concrete plan for overcoming poverty in Africa:


The agricultural income of the farmers could by good advice and some resources (irrigation, fertilizer, high-performance seed) can be doubled easily.
For the larger crop is not eaten immediately, the population growth should be stopped by a specific family counseling and the free distribution of contraceptives.
The funds must democratically be managed by the communities themselves so they do not disappear in the government corruption.
The poor countries must be freed from their debt burdens, so that they have money to overcome the poverty.
There must be an adequate infrastructure (schools, roads, health, electricity).;
, There are examples of ecological self-sufficient communities, where aid workers can be based on. That sustainable development works, proved the actor Karlheinz Böhm in Ethiopia. He has personally supervised four villages and collected donations in Germany. He established an organic agriculture and thus preserves an entire tract of land from starvation. It took more than a decade, but today, the villages are self-sufficient in everything necessary. , The main solution to the world hunger problem is the principle of self-sufficiency through their own country. Every farmer should have the right to have his own piece of land from which he can live with his family. The landless farmers have to get fertile land by the governments.


The landlords must give a portion of their land to the poor. Without land reforms, the world hunger problem can not be solved. Some new agricultural land can also be created. This can happen by the forestation of desert areas. Deforestation must be stopped. Instead establishing mono-cultures (oil palm, biofuel) for export, each country should provide sufficient land for the population.
Small farmers in developing countries must be helped with a good advice from agricultural experts, an effective organic farming, with cooperative structures and a fair global trade.

, It is important to promote the common sense in the world. Without a return to the values of frugality, inner happiness, universal love and mutual aid the world can not be saved. If egoism dominates the happiness in the world has no chance. We need a world family, which consists of many small families, and where everyone helps everyone, so it all goes well.

, The village communities should become places of happiness, so that rural migration ends. If people have arrived in the city slums, it is very difficult to get them back. In the slums we have to built up positive structures in a special way. But everywhere a new culture of civic spirit is very important.

, We need a global change. This can happen only through a global alliance of all positive forces in politics, science, religion and society. By the intensive efforts of many individuals, each in his place and within his means.

Wear patriotic colors, flags, historic figures, or images.,
Fly your country's flag.,
Attend a national pride parade.,
Celebrate holidays.",How to Love Your Country1," Nothing shows you love your country more than showing it through clothing or accessories! Each country has their own identifying image that defines who they are, and how they are perceived internationally. Make sure in the US you are aware that wearing an image of the US flag is a violation of the flag code.


Some national colors are indeterminable from one another. A unique flag shape like Nepal’s flag, however, is undoubtedly unique. Two pennants on top of one another, with a sun and moon inside, is different from all other rectangular and square flags.The bear has been associated with Russia since the late 1500s. It represents a variety of things, like guardian status. A fierce bear on a red shirt, perhaps superimposed on top of a hammer and sickle, is unmistakably Russian.There are a wide variety of flags with red, white, and blue, and those with stars, but there are none other than the United States flag, with that grouping of colors and prominent 50 stars.An article of U.S. flag apparel is very recognizable.;
, You can purchase flags, bumper stickers, or any other emblems at a local store. Hang them on your car, your front lawn, or anywhere that can outwardly show you respect your country. Remember to treat the flag with the utmost respect.


Learn the flag etiquette. Generally, a flag should not touch the ground, be used in severe disrepair, or disposed of improperly. In the US, the flag should not be a part of a uniform, costume, or outfit. Fold the flag properly when it’s being stored. There is a precise way to fold each flag, and researching your specific flag should provide you with specific instructions on the proper folding techniques., Many countries have parades displaying the pride they have for their country, or country of origin. It could be on the day of independence, or some other historic date, but the important part is to celebrate with your countrymen.Participate by getting up and dancing to traditional music.
Cheer on the participants who are beaming with national pride.

, What happened in your country on this day in history? Did they win a war? Did they gain independence? Recognize that holidays are much more than just occasions for parties or, in some countries, sales at department stores. Acknowledge the solemnity inherent to certain holidays, especially those that commemorate a victory that involved bloodshed.

Be an active citizen.,
Encourage children to love their country.,
Find a hero.,
Join the military.",How to Love Your Country2," Actively demonstrate your love for your country by being part of its political process. Continually strive for a better country for all! There are a variety of ways to contribute your time, effort, and knowledge to the politics of your country.


Volunteer at a voting or polling area. Take part in the voting process by helping others who may not be as versed in politics, or who may not understand specific ballot measures upon which they are voting.
Be part of a phone bank. Call several people with the script provided by your political party, or member running for office. You’ll appreciate it when you reach someone who shares your appreciation for the political process.Raise funds for your candidate’s campaign. Whether it’s asking for large donations from big contributors, or hosting a fund-raising event, running for office takes a significant amount of money., Grow their national pride so they will have respect someday as a citizen. This is the best way to set a positive example. As children grow older, explain to them why you feel they should hold their country in high regard.


Remember that blind patriotism can be dangerous. Encourage your children to use their minds.

, Look for a person who is a good role model and embodies the values your country holds dear. Find one who will make you proud to be where you call home. Seek out a hero who was instrumental in your country’s history and development.


Medal of Honor winners are perfect role model. Whether it’s the Victoria Cross of U.K. and Commonwealth countries, the Congressional Medal of Honor from the U.S., or the Order of Taegeuk Military Merit from South Korea, someone who is awarded the highest military honor has most likely sacrificed much for their country.Great leaders responsible for sweeping reforms are great role models. One such ruler, King Chulalongkorn of Siam, became the king and immediately attempted visionary reforms such as ending slavery, remodeling the judicial and financial systems, avoiding colonialism, and setting up the structure for current-day Thai citizenship.Athletes are sometimes great national heroes. For instance, during the buildup for WWII, Adolf Hitler planned to use the Olympics as a display of Aryan dominance. U.S. track star Jesse Owens ruined those plans by capturing four gold medals in as many events., Nothing speaks more to the commitment for one’s nation than joining the military. It is the ultimate act of willingness to sacrifice life for the liberty of countrymen. It is so important that, in some countries, like South Korea, the mandatory conscription may even lead to pro-military voting habits as an adult."
"
Study the history of your country.,
Research and memorize the National Anthem.,
Read patriotic legends of your country.,
Focus on current events.",How to Love Your Country3," Learn about the foundation of your country, the key moments leading to its creation, and its reputation since the time it became a nation. Embrace the positive changes your country has made since historical errors of the past.


Read about where your country stood during various wars near and afar. Who were their allies and nemeses? Did they always align with the righteous side of history, or have they historically been considered the villain in large confrontations?Research the politics of your nation. Was it always in its current form? Or did a great war or uprising change the system from something like a monarchy to a republic?Look up the great milestones during your country’s history. Check the timeline from inception until today, analyzing and interpreting the major events., Showing your patriotism through the National Anthem is important because most contain words that vividly describe a historical event in the country’s past. Additionally, many National Anthems have gone through several amendments, which modify the potential meaning of an ever-changing nation, and may not have been adopted as the National Anthem initially.


The Canadian National Anthem was written in Quebec city by Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier and was initially titled “Chant national.” It represents the combined feelings, particularly after WWI, of a united French and English-speaking Canada.During the French Revolution, a French Army captain named Claude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle composed “La Marseillaise” – named so because troops from Marseilles sang it when approaching Paris – as an act of defiance against the combined invading forces of Austria and Prussia. It’s meant as a rallying cry for citizens fighting for their rights and liberty.Written by Francis Scott Key in September of 1812, the U.S. National Anthem – also known as The Star-Spangled Banner – started as a poem celebrating the perseverance of U.S. Fort McHenry during British attack. The lyrics were written on a British ship the morning after a pre-battle, prisoner release negotiating. That following morning he was let off the ship and the lyrics are his recollection Fort McHenry’s triumph., Most legends and tall-tales possess at least a shred of reality. The creativity and imagination required to concoct some of the stories is amazing. A few of the following tales perfectly illustrate how one could be proud of their nation's creative past.


The Chinese held the secret to silk production for over 3000 years. It was said they held the secret to their lucrative export so dearly that anyone revealing the production secrets was sentenced to death.One Egyptian legend says King Surid had a dream where the flat earth flipped upside down, and because of that, he inserted riches inside the pyramids and sealed them.Since some of the pyramids are yet undiscovered, this may yet be true.
The American Indian legends related to “Devil’s Tower” say a great god pushed rock and earth upward and upward to save young boys from a great bear, one who scratched and clawed to get them.Given that “Devil’s Tower” was formed by a geological process called intrusion, the legend is actually somewhat correct.

, Learn about what your country is currently doing that brings great honor upon your nation. See if they are the leader in a specific industry, export, or sport. Examine how much they help others in need, or align with organizations attempting to make the world a better place.


On May 23, 2016, India became just the third nation in the world to launch a space shuttle, potentially cutting other nations' costs by ten-fold.The Syrian refugee crisis of 2016 has affected numerous countries. The experience has been debated far and wide, but learning about why your country has or hasn’t helped is a potentially debatable moral issue of our time."

, Buy basic foodstuffs and donate these to charity. Basic foodstuffs typically cost less as they are not processed. Good examples of basic foodstuffs would include meat or poultry found in the meat department. Other examples could include produce, flours, pasta and rice. Learn to prepare home cooked meals using these food stuffs. Purchase a general purpose cookbook to learn how to prepare these items. You can also download Tips for Healthy, Thrifty Meals that is a free PDF file from the USDA.

, They typically cost less and taste better. and save on global resources such as furl for delivery costs.

, Plan to rotate and use bulk groceries so you do not waste food. Donate your purchases or use this method to help reduce global hunger.

, Food co-ops purchase foodstuffs in bulk and share the savings amongst other food co-op members.

, SHARE is a volunteer food distribution program offering low cost food packages .

, Call them planned overs. Prepare a roast for a Sunday dinner and then use the meat to make tacos, beef hash, beef sandwiches or casseroles throughout the week.

, Consider meat an accent to the meal rather than the main course.

, Plan a meat free day and learn how to prepare meat substitutes. You could fix beans and rice or cheese enchiladas. If cholesterol is not a concern try preparing a quiche, souffle or omelet.

, Slow cooking tenderizes tough cuts of meat, allows soups to tastefully simmer or prepare legumes with ease. Another bonus is when you come home from work your dinner is ready-to-eat or requires little prep to finish.

, Cook and freeze a month of meals and tuck them away in the freezer. If this is too daunting try preparing a week's worth of meals instead. Either way having food stashed away in the freezer means you'll not be ordering take-out thereby saving you money.

, Stick to the shopping list once you get to the store. Do not shop when you are hungry either. Use a Price Book to track grocery prices. You can find and add recipes using the USDA recipe finder .

, Less trips to the grocery store usually means less fuel costs.

, Study and determine your family's nutritional needs. Most people only need about 4 to 5 ounces of protein at a meal. Buy only what you need or plan to serve the leftovers promptly.

You'll be able to do the most direct good and see the impact on the people that you help. If you have a practical skill or can learn one, or evening volunteering at the Humane Society in your local neighborhood. using that skill will offer the most good (skills like construction or medicine are good examples).


Tutor disadvantaged kids
Work at a local soup kitchen
Work with a charity like Habitat for Humanity.;
, Another way to really make the world a better place is to reduce the negative impact you have on the world around you. Being good stewards of the world has a significant and positive impact on your environment and helps to preserve the planet for the next generation.


Be consistent about recycling.
Reduce the waste you produce and compost.

Conserve water and grow some of your own food.
If you really want to help your local environment, buy and install solar panels for your home and switch to public transit, a bike, or an electric vehicle.
Increase positive impacts. Notice how your happiness and well-being are interconnected with other people and the natural environment. Learn how you can leave a legacy of sustainable happiness.

, Exercise your right to vote. Bad politicians and policies can have an incredibly negative impact on your community and your environment. By not voting and letting your voice be heard, you are allowing opportunity for bad policy to rule. Be engaged in your city, states, and country by voting and talking with the politicians you support, as well as educating others on important issues.


In America, for example, only about 50% to 60% of eligible voters actually vote during the presidential election. And that number tumbles to about 35% to 40% in midterm elections.Imagine the changes people might enact if 90% of people voted during presidential elections and 60% of people voted during midterms!

, With companies, your money talks....so shout as loud as you can! Don't buy products that harm animals or from companies that use abusive tactics with their animals. Whenever you can, buy local products that support the people around you and your local economy. When a company makes poor choices that negatively affect people, stop buying their products.


Always, always feel free to contact companies to let them know what you're doing and why! Some, not all, businesses actually care about what their customers want. They'll never know how to change if people don't tell them.

, Take care of and take pride in the area where you live. This preserves the area not just for you but for everyone else in your community. If you have the opportunity to help, take it because not everyone will have the chance. You should also find ways to improve the environment where you live. Here are just a few ideas:


Combine good citizenship and environmental cleanup by volunteering with your city to plant trees, maintain sidewalks, and keep green spaces green.
Never litter when you're out and about — always try to find a proper trash can or recycling bin for your trash! Clean up trash that you do find, even if someone else dropped it.

, If you want to help people across the world, it's important to give to charities that provide the right kind of help and provide it where it will do the most good. Charities which create sustainable good in areas where it is needed are the best and will do the most good. Examples of such charities include The Against Malaria Foundation, The Deworm the World Initiative, and Give Directly.

, Fair trade certified products are guaranteed to have been produced under humane conditions for worker, with that worker being paid a fair wage, and produced under sustainable conditions. By buying these products as much as possible, you show companies that you think these practices are worth a few extra pennies and encourage other companies to invest in these practices as well.


Fair Trade items will almost always be labeled as such. If you're unsure, try to at least avoid items that are often unethically sourced. Coffee, bananas, cocoa, many tropical fruits, wine (mainly from California), clothing items (mainly from China, Bangladesh, and SE Asia) and jewelry are often unethically sourced.

, Sometimes, all a third world or disadvantaged community needs is a chance for their own economy to flourish. One way you can help these people help themselves is by providing small business loans. This means that you should get your money back and the small business will get what it needs to contribute to that economy and community. An easy way to get in to this is through Kiva.org, which provides small business loans to people in disadvantaged areas.


This is an especially good way to help women and other vulnerable groups to support themselves.

, Do things that help the environment globally. A great way to do this is to reduce your reliance on fossil fuels and other fuel sources that have a negative impact on the environment. You can do this by using public transit, a bicycle, or an electric vehicle to get around. You can also use solar power to heat your home, instead of things like natural gas (which put a strain on the environment). Eating local food and using local products will also cut down on global fossil fuel usage.



Conserve as much energy as you can. Producing energy is very taxing on the planet, often requiring the burning of gases or the production of nuclear energy. Any energy you don't use can then be used for more important things and less power will need to be produced overall. Turn off lights in rooms that you're not in, take colder showers, switch to energy efficient light bulbs, turn off your computer when you're not using it, etc. There are lots of ways to conserve power!

, Don't eat more than you need to, don't buy a bunch of junk that you don't need, and avoid buying new clothes every year. Buying used clothing can help reduce waste that is created. Eating a healthy, balanced, minimal diet will also reduce waste. If you do have leftover food, compost it. You want to reduce the waste you produce before our planet ends up looking like a still shot from Wall*E!



Compost your excess organic waste. Get or build a large bin that can be left outdoors, as well as a small one that can go in your home. Collect all of the food scraps that are leftover from eating and preparing your meals, as well as things like yard waste, and deposit these items in your outdoor bin. Use a pitchfork or rake to turn and mix the compost regularly. You will also need to add soil on occasion. One it has turned into a homogeneous mixture, it's ready to be spread in your green spaces.

Recycle more and correctly. Most cities will come and collect your recycling along with your garbage, though they'll be kept in separate bins. Recyclable items vary by city, but generally most plastic jugs, metal cans, and paper are all recyclable.

, As the dominant life form on this planet, it is our responsibility to protect the creatures that cannot protect themselves. Because of the way we currently live, many animals suffer and are even going extinct! If you want to improve conditions for animals, there are many ways you can help.


Encourage and vote for legislation that protects animals.
Only buy products that do not contribute to animal abuse.
Donate to charities which help animals, such as the Humane Society, The Marine Mammal Center, or the Performing Animal Welfare Society.

, In many disadvantaged countries, like many regions in India and Africa, women do not have access to sanitary feminine hygiene products. This leads to humiliation and isolation at best, and at worst discomfort and even life-threatening infections. By donating items and money to charities that work to solve this problem, you'll be keeping women healthy and help them to do things like attend school and work so that they get the opportunity to better their own lives.


One such charity is Days for Girls.

, A lot of the time we can get so caught up in working to improve the globe as a whole that we forget there are lots of things that we can do every day at home that have a positive impact too. One of the best things you can do easily and every day is to treat others how you want to be treated. Do something nice for someone as often as you can. This can be small things like making someone a birthday present, or big things like driving someone around until they get their car fixed. When we work together, everything runs more smoothly and we're better able to further invest those gains in benefiting the rest of the globe.

, Set a good example for your friends and family members, and educate them on the issues so that they can make good decisions too. Help them to understand why these things are important, so that they're also motivated to change their lives. By changing a few minds you can double, triple, or even more greatly increase your positive impact on the world.

, Almost any job that you get can have a positive impact on your community. You'll be providing a service to people who want it and adding to the economy in your immediate area, improving the lot of everyone around you. It will also give you money that you can use to donate to charity or fund small business loans!

, When we're surrounded by people who are negative and mean, it makes us sad and pessimistic, making it much harder to get through the other difficulties in life. Let your attitude show everyone that a smile and hopeful attitude can really improve the day of everyone around you. By finding the upsides in tough situations and working hard to fix problems, you can positively impact the people you come into contact with.

, We have lots of opportunities to be nice and helpful to other people every day. Many times we don't take the opportunity because we think we're too busy or someone else will help. If you want to make the world around you better, just do the right thing and help, instead of thinking that it's someone else's problem.


For example, if someone is carrying groceries to their car and they drop a bag, help them by picking up the groceries and loading them back into the bag. The simple things like that are very much appreciated by anyone!

, The homeless are a vulnerable group that are often misunderstood. By helping the homeless, both locally and across the world, you'll be improving people's lives and helping to create more sustainable and safe cities.

, Women have traditionally been another vulnerable group. Though conditions have improved in many places, even in the most feminist countries you will still see unequal pay and disproportionate abuse. Do what you can to help women not just in the obvious places, like third world countries, but also closer to home. Remember: by creating a gender equal society, we open up more opportunities for everyone.

, Studies show that low IQ scores in children with low socioeconomic status are affected more by their environment than by their genes.The score reflects lowered opportunities more than it does their innate intelligence.

, People with intellectual and developmental disabilities may score very low, or may have subscores that vary wildly. Consider whether these are accurate representations of them, and whether they could cause mislabeling of needs and abilities. If disabled students are told that they are below average, this may hurt their self-confidence and performance.Some capable students with disabilities may underperform on IQ tests due to unmet accessibility needs, and thus be underestimated.

, In telling children that they are innately smart, they may fear failure and shut down when challenged,or look down on children whose intelligence is measured as average or below average.


Gifted students with disabilities may be overlooked if their IQ is high.
Students with anxiety issues may not do well in timed or high-stakes testing.

, Creativity, mechanics, and social skills play an important role in future success, and IQ tests do not measure these.IQ tests tend to focus on pattern recognition and reading comprehension, while general intelligence has many more components

, A child who comes to school tired might score lower than one who is well-rested and well-fed that day. Sleep, diet, personal issues, stress, time of day, and more can all affect a person's concentration. One day may not provide an accurate snapshot.

, In what is called the ""drop from the sky"" method, examiners provide a set of questions in a controlled circumstance with a limited amount of time.This is not how problems frequently surface in the everyday world.

, Few issues are black and white, and it is important to gain a well-informed perspective by reading many different opinions. Evaluate the information you read and use it to form a nuanced, thoughtful opinion.


Are any of the opinions flawed? How so? Do they have personal experience and/or expertise?
Who is most affected by these issues? How do these people feel?
Are there some situations in which IQ testing may be the best tool available?
Are there other ways to achieve the benefits that IQ tests provide?

Watch for suspicious behaviour.,
Recognize the diverse forms of extremism.,
Note alarming changes in members of your community.,
Report potential danger to local authorities.,
Submit a tip online.,
Report possible cyber terrorism.,
Support charities that fight global poverty.,
Do your part to combat everyday discrimination.,
Reach out to marginalized peers.,
Put terrorism into perspective.,
Consider a career in counterterrorism.",How to Help Stop Terrorism," While large-scale, transnational terrorism has more wide-reaching effects, domestic terrorism is a more frequent occurrence in the U.S. and many other nations. Look for suspicious activity in your community to help thwart local terrorism attempts. Alert local authorities if you witness:Individuals amassing a large quantity of weapons, chemicals, or other potentially harmful items
Individuals who are not authorized security officials conducting surveillance (e.g. with binoculars, video cameras)
Individuals trying to gain information about secure facilities (in person, by telephone, or via email)
Individuals attempting to breach secured entrances;
, To truly be vigilant and observant of suspicious behaviour, avoid narrowing your scope to a specific demographic or profile of terrorism. Violent extremism is not unique to any one social group or religious belief system, and should not be regarded as such. Make a point of being aware of suspicious activity regardless of the race, age, appearance, or social standing of the person(s) involved., Individuals who commit terrorist acts generally go through a period of radicalization that leads to their violent behaviour. Be on the lookout for alarming behavioural changes in colleagues, acquaintances, friends, or family that might indicate radicalization. These changes might include:Suddenly dropping relationships with family and long-time friends
Unexplained dropping of commitments (e.g. school, work)
A drastic change in dress, eating, sleeping, money management, or spoken language
Becoming antisocial and withdrawing from everyday life
Expressing radical or extremist views, or participating in social media networks that promote these views

, Be sure to contact your local police department immediately if you witness suspicious events or behaviour in your area. Be sure to provide a clear, accurate account of what you saw, exactly when you saw it, where you saw it, and why you are concerned. Include concrete details about the person or persons involved, as well as any vehicles or other objects involved.For instance, report a suspicious event by calling local authorities and saying, ""I am calling to report something suspicious that I just witnessed on the corner of 45th avenue and Center street. A man was pulling on a chain lock on the gate of a secured building and appeared to be trying to gain access. He was about 5""11, was wearing black pants and a black jacket, and appeared to be between 30-40 years old. He seemed agitated and nervous so I thought it best to report what I saw.""

, If you have strong suspicions that terrorist activity is taking place, submit a tip online to the federal authorities. Online reports will be viewed by an agent or another professional staff member of the organization and handled accordingly. To report an immediate threat, find the number for your local federal security office and contact it as soon as possible.


In the U.S., visit the FBI website at https://tips.fbi.gov/ to fill out a form for tips and public leads, which will require your name, location, contact information, and a detailed description of the suspicious activity that you witnessed., If you suspect that a breach to cyber security has occurred (e.g. an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a secured system or its data) report it to local authorities. Finance and power systems are especially vulnerable to cyber terrorism, but security fixes and upgrades are increasingly being mounted to lower the risk of such attacks. Reporting potential threats may aid with these measures.If you are a U.S. resident you may also report your suspicions to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Visit the organization’s website at https://www.us-cert.gov/forms/report to submit a report.

, Extreme poverty can cause a low standard of life, a sense of disenfranchisement, and a lack of opportunities. This lack of choices and hope sometimes creates a feeling of desperation that leaves young people vulnerable to recruitment by terrorist groups. Support charities that fight poverty on a global level, such as:Unicef
K.I.D.S. (Kids in Distressed Situations)
Interaction
Action Against Hunger

, Discrimination can cause unrest, distrust, and anger, all of which may create an environment where terrorism becomes more likely. Do your best to fight discrimination within your community on a day-to-day basis by being aware of it, denouncing it, and declining to associate with individuals who perpetuate hate against specific demographics of people. Be considerate in your dialogue and treatment of others.For instance, if you observe discrimination of a client or customer by an employee of a business or other organization, report the incident to their superiors as soon as possible to ensure that they will be held accountable for their behaviour.

, While terrorism might seem like a huge, overwhelming phenomenon, efforts to make small-scale social improvements can help in the larger fight against it. Radicalization cannot be traced to one common cause, but it is attributed to both “push factors” (e.g. marginalization, inequality, discrimination) and “pull factors” (e.g. the appeal of extremist groups, who offer a feeling of inclusion and an outlet for grievances). Reach out to marginalized colleagues, peers, and acquaintances who may be feeling isolated to help foster a stronger, more inclusive sense of community.For instance, invite marginalized colleagues out for group lunches or other activities.
Reach out to uneasy or isolated new neighbours by making a kind gesture (bringing over a gift or offering to help with an outdoor task (e.g. shovelling the driveway).

, The goal of terrorism is to spread fear, so help overcome its paralyzing effects by keeping terror statistics in perspective. The odds of a U.S. citizen being killed in a terror attack are approximately one in twenty million, taking into account both home and overseas incidents. Keep this information in mind and share it when family, friends, or colleagues express anxiety about the threat of terrorist attacks., To really make an impact in the war against terrorism, pursue a counterterrorism career. Government agencies provide a wide variety of job opportunities in the field, while public and private organizations offer numerous positions in counterintelligence. The jobs may include:Criminal investigators
Intelligence analysts
Special forces
Business intelligence analysts
Loss prevention managers
Fraud examiners, investigators and analysts

Support small local businesses.,
Locate your biggest expenses where they can make a difference.,
Vote for economic growth.,
Invest in small businesses.,
Invest in education.,
Protect against the ravages of poverty.,
Keep it local.,
Raise wages.,
Cut costs.",How to Fix the Economy," As much as you can, buy locally produced, locally sourced products and services from small businesses in your community. Buy clothing made in the United States and sold by smaller stores in your town. Instead of ordering books online, buy from a local bookstore. Dine out at a local mom-and-pop, instead of at a fast food chain.


Small businesses are standalone companies with fewer than 99 employees that are headquartered in the same state they operate within.Small businesses tend to hire within the community, and they spend their supply budget locally, more so than large chains.
Money spent within a community tends to circulate more than money spent at large companies, meaning that it benefits more people and stimulates greater growth.Avoid large businesses. National and international chains employ a lot of people, but they actually depress economic growth. Money spent at large chains tends to circulate longer within the company rather than returning to the economy.;
, Where does the majority of your money go? For most U.S. citizens, the answer is either ""rent"" or ""mortgage payments."" Rent from a landlord who lives in your town and manages his or her own properties. If you're about to buy a house, get your mortgage from a local bank, one that doesn't sell its loans to secondary markets.Groceries are another major expense. Do your grocery shopping at the local corner store, coop, or farmer's market instead of a major chain or an online grocery service.
The rise in online shopping means you may have less control than ever over where your money goes. Before you buy online, ask yourself if you can find the same goods at a nearby store. If you can't, try to find online vendors who sell directly from their own website and are located within your state.

, In national and state elections, get to know the stance of each candidate on issues such as minimum wage, small business support, education, and social welfare. While different political parties have various approaches to fixing the economy, support for a raise in the minimum wage, for instance, is bipartisan.Register to vote.When you find a candidate you support, do more than vote. Volunteer for your candidate's campaign, or volunteer to work the polls., To support small businesses, cut taxes for small businesses seeking to grow. Offer loans for startups. Incentivize capital investment in small businesses. Support successful government programs such as the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC), which invests in small businesses and supports impact investments in communities that lack venture capital investors., Politicians operating at a state and national level can help the economy by promoting an across-the-board investment in education. The economy of states with better-educated workers benefit from the higher median wages.Moreover, access to quality education in childhood is one of the primary factors in adult success.Fund early childhood education. Federal investment in effective pre-school programs can produce substantial economic benefits.Quality preschool improves lifetime educational and financial achievements for the children involved. Publically funded preschool could increase the future economic contributions of all children involved.
Support measures to lower the cost of college. While it may appear that youth are over educated, the market for college-educated employees is growing, not shrinking.However, today's college-educated youth are saddled with debt that inhibits their spending and entrepreneurial activity.Provide training for laborers. High-skilled laborers are a boon to the economy. Support federal and state funding for training programs for high-demand jobs, such as nurse practitioners. Create tax incentives for companies to provide job training to veterans, high school graduates, and the unemployed., Higher rates of poverty lead to lower rates of economic growth.Poverty leads to high rates of incarceration and poor health. It limits the ability of individual citizens to study the skills that would allow them to contribute to the economy.


Expand SNAP. SNAP is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the Food Stamps Project.It provides low-income families with nutritional assistance. For each dollar the government spends on food stamps, the economy benefits $1.84.However, only 75 percent of people eligible for SNAP apply.
To increase the economic benefits of SNAP, advocate for greater outreach to eligible households. Advocate for a program to mail applications to the unemployed.Support the expansion of Medicaid. States that expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act see budget savings and, in many cases, increased revenue.Raise the minimum wage. More than 1 in 4 workers would benefit from an increase of the minimum wage, which would lower debt, increase spending, and benefit local businesses.Mandate the refinancing of private mortgages. The 11 million U.S. citizens struggling under the burdens of negative mortgages, in which the money owed is worth more than the house itself, are trapped in a lose-lose situation that has an enormous negative effect on the economy.
Allowing these homeowners to refinance would allow them to forego desperate measures that depress the economy, such as foregoing necessary purchases or running up credit card debt., Avoid purchasing or producing overseas. Hire locals, and stay headquartered in the same area as your business. Not only will this benefit the economy, it may be advantageous for your business. Purchasing locally solidifies your company's position in the community while producing locally not only creates local jobs (and therefore customers), it can also save your company money in the long run.


Use local vendors for your company's goods and services. You will contribute to your local economy, and you will benefit your personal brand by building name recognition and loyalty in your region.
Produce goods at home. While the immediate benefits of lower costs and fewer regulations may make it seem financially wiser to locate your factory abroad, the costs of doing so may ultimately outweigh the gains.
Costly factors include underemployed, unskilled laborers (and a resulting drop in efficiency and productivity), the costs of relocation, and the dramatic changes to wages to which developing economies are prone., As a percent of the U.S. economy, wages are at an all-time low.As your business grows, include your employees in the growth. You'll see greater productivity and greater worker loyalty.Hire full-time employees. More U.S. Citizens are working part time jobs than before the recession, and they aren't doing so by choice. Give your employees the chance to commit to your company and earn enough to support themselves by offering full time work whenever possible.Offer investment opportunities so your workers can share in your company's profits.
Consider the ""Henry Ford way."" If your employees can't afford to buy what they help produce, raise their wages until they can., Treating your workers well and supporting other local businesses is excellent for your company's long-term productivity and brand, but can be expensive in the short term. To remedy this, cut costs and increase efficiency. Get bids and negotiate for any expenses you plan to take on. Ask your landlord to renegotiate your office lease.Telecommute. Save money on office space and supplies by allowing your workers to telecommute all or part of the time. Productivity increases an average of 10-20% when workers work from home, and your business will save thousands of dollars per employee each year.If telecommuting leaves you with unused office space, sublet it."

Identify the core point you want to make.,
Research everything you can about your topic.,
Use a simple, deliberate structure for your speech, repeating your key point in the beginning, middle, and end.,
Pepper your speech with specific facts and details to sound knowledgeable and authoritative.,
Write out note cards for each major point of your presentation.,
Keep visual aids simple, unobtrusive, and visual.,
Find clear, authoritative phrasing, aiming to talk at a roughly high-school level.,
Practice, practice, practice.",How to Prepare an Oral Presentation1," What is the crucial bit of information you want to get across to the audience? Think of this as the thesis or theme of your presentation. People can only process a limited amount of information in one sitting, so don't try and hit them with 10-15 different ideas and points. Instead, find one good idea and expand on it fully. The best points are unexpected, exciting, or controversial -- the sort of idea that piques people's interest and give you lots of room to elaborate, so think of a unique take on your topic.Is your presentation trying to be persuasive? If so, ask yourself ""what do I want the audience to do/believe when they leave?""
Is your presentation informative? If so, ask yourself ""what does the audience need to know when they leave?""
Is your presentation a sales pitch or business related? Your presentation needs to make someone pull out their wallet at the end, so the product and it's uses must come first.;
, In order to prepare a successful oral presentation you need to be the most knowledgeable person in the room about your topic. You can never do enough research. More likely than not you won't use all of the research you uncover in your presentation. However, the more context, facts, and figures you find the easier it will be to field questions and structure your talk.As you research, write down crucial facts or figures on note cards. As you prepare the presentation you can move them around and order them, helping you see your argument visually.Even oral presentations about personal topics and issues can benefit from research. Find the background data for your story, pepper in a few facts about yourself or the larger issues, and ground the personal problems in issues the audience is familiar with.

, Many speechwriters and presenters use the same structure for all of their talks. Though it is a bit cliche, it works: Tell then what you are going to tell them, tell them, and then tell them what you have told them. You want to use repetition to help your audience follow along. For example, if you are trying to convince a new mall to buy your sandwich shop:



Intro: Tell Them What You're Going to Telling Them. This is where you state what problem or issue your presentation is going to address. Tell them why your shop is a good fit for the mall and keep it simple. ""A sandwich shop is a perfect fit for your new mall because it is affordable, popular with shoppers, and provides incentive for people to stay in the mall during lunch instead of leaving.""

Argument: Tell Them. This is where you fill up your argument with relevant facts, figures, and details. Again, use the repeating structure to keep things simple. For the example, you could break the argument down into 3 mini-arguments: 1) The affordability of a sandwich shop. 2) The popularity of the restaurant with shoppers. 3) The benefits to the other shops in the mall. All three of these points feed to the idea that ""you should buy my sandwich shop.""

Conclusion: Tell Them what You Told Them. To wrap everything up, briefly highlight the points you've made before, then finish by returning to your key point: ""Thanks to extensive market research, cost analysis, and prior examples of success, it is clear that this sandwich shop is the perfect answer to the new mall's ""where will people eat?"" question., A great oral presentation is specific and actionable. Specific means that you back up your arguments and points with credible details and facts. If you're talking about the sandwich shop, you could point to market research about shoppers and eating habits, the projected costs/profits, etc.

, On each note card, write down the idea or fact you need to deliver. The amount of information you put on the card is up to you, but you should try and keep them concise. Your note cards should not be your script or you'll spend the whole time staring at the paper and not engaging the crowd. This makes you look unprepared, and it is hard to quickly find your place again in a sea of words if you get lost.


Note cards should be your occasional lifeline, helping out if you get stuck. If you need them to deliver the entire presentation then you have not practiced the speech enough ahead of time.
Presentation software, like Powerpoint or Keynote, has a note function as well. This puts up a small window on your screen with note that does not show up on the audience's screen or projector., Too many people give PowerPoint presentations a bad name. Audiences complain that they spend more time reading slides than listening to the talk, and some presenters end up just reading right off the slide. As obvious as it seems, a good visual aid needs to remain visual. Keep the words to an absolute minimum, focusing instead on letting the images complement your speech.


Skip the fancy transitions and effects -- they will only distract the audience.
This is you visual aid. Use it to help guide your presentation instead of expecting it to carry the whole speech.
When putting text on slides, stick to a maximum 6 bullets, each with no more than 6 words., Phrasing is not what you say, but how you say it. A good oral presentation is clear and concise. It gets the points across without over-explaining, and everything leads back to your core concept or idea. Think of teaching high schoolers first-- you want to be clear, avoid wordy phrases or huge vocab, and get right to the point. There are generally two ways to practice phrasing:


Written speeches. If you are uncomfortable improvising, you should consider writing out your speech in advance. This is best for long, complicated presentations. But writing your ideas down can be a great way to find your wording for any presentation, however long.
Improvising off of note cards. Think of your note cards as your road map, telling you what points to hit and in what order. This allows you to improvise, feeling out the crowd a bit, without forgetting to say anything. However, you should practice 4-5 times in advance to find a couple of good phrases ahead of time., Research and planning are only half the battle. You need to know your presentation backwards and forwards if you want to deliver a great speech. You should practice exactly how you plan to give the speech -- standing, using your visual aids, and looking up at the imagined ""audience."" Use these practice presentations to memorize your note cards and structure. You want the words to become second nature so that you can focus more on eye contact, inflection, and your phrasing when giving the actual presentation.

Practice in front of the mirror or record yourself. Watch it back and note any areas you can improve on. You might work on removing the words ""like"" or ""um,"" speaking more clearly, or slowing down on a difficult point.
Ask a professor, friend, or family member to watch your practice presentation. When you're done, see if they have any questions or pointers. What did they think the main point was? Did they follow the argument? Where there parts where they got confused?

Consider whether and how you (or someone you know) may be employed in a workplace where a union has the right to “represent” you and collectively bargain for you which many workers may/may not like.

,
Look into how your National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) USA and your state's laws give unions “exclusive representation” power, but that contract may be: Terminated by the workers as a decert, or
Changed by state and local contracts, or laws (statutes).

,
Check that some state governments grant bargaining privileges that:Give union officials monopoly (exclusive) power to make contracts;
Bar you and other employees from individually negotiating your own contracts and terms of employment.

,
Explore decert elections: though it is generally challenging, the NLRA allows employees to call for a special election to completely get rid of the union as their “exclusive representative.”""Decertification Election"" -- employees revoke the union’s ""certification"" to be the exclusive ""bargaining representative"".,
Decide whether you would prefer to seek to decertify in order to have a workplace where you are free to discuss your terms and conditions of employment directly with the employer, without intervention by a third-party (union).

,
Decide whether you would work for state right to work legislation -- if you prefer a workplace in which union membership and the payment of dues is voluntary, which may require the company and union hierarchy to be accountable to negotiated, agreed upon rules, without requiring unionism or money from you to the union.,
To get started: The petitioning employees should decide the strength of the support for decertification within your specific bargaining unit.,
Get the official ""NLRB’s Petition form"" at the website which requires Adobe Acrobat Reader (PDF).,
Get/collect signatures when the employees are on non-work time (before and after shifts, at lunches and at breaks), and in non-work areas!,
Attach the separate NLRB “Petition cover sheet”, filled out, which is ""NLRB Form 502"".,
To win: You need the simple majority of only those that actually cast the ballot on the ""official election day, place and time allowed"" with the positive answers meaning Yes, I agree to decertify (more than 50% out of those who showed up and voted).",How to Help Get Rid of a Union1,",,,

In effect, the union may be voted out of your workplace.
Elections of this type occur under the laws in the NLRA, which governs the general U.S. national labor relations of most private sector workers.



,,


Instead of relying on the power of rules in the union-state to gain financial support for the union -- perhaps, including firings for refusing or failing to follow union-contract rules -- union officials may have to sell the benefits of union membership to each individual employee in the open union shop.

, It can be worth it, only if you, the petition signers, agree that you could win.

, You can find a directory of the regional NLRB offices in your area on the website., You must fill in the names of the union and the employer in the blank spaces above on the petition form before you collect signatures.


Use no employer help to collect signatures of 30% or more of employees, with no employer resources to get votes (no employer motivation, promises and not on company work time), or it will be thrown out, if proven.

, This one sheet of paper is easy to fill out, and is available from any Regional Office of the NLRB.If the number of valid signatures are more than 50% of the eligible employees of that particular bargaining unit represented by the union, then the signed employees can request that your employer immediately withdraw recognition from the union, because it does not enjoy the support of a majority of employees in the bargaining unit.

Consider opposing continual use of the recent decades that presidents of both parties and their federal agencies have used/and maybe abused their ""Constitutional Power"" and enforced agency edicts as ""rule by decree"" of regulations by the ""executive power"" especially under regulating commerce.,
Encourage Congress to STOP new bureaucratic schemes with a ""Joint Resolution of Disapproval"" (JRD) -- within 60 days of a new bureaucratic ""rule"" being issued with a simple majority vote -- but if the parties can not agree, then they can not stop it without passing a new law (not just the resolution) -- but either vote can be vetoed by the president (veto can be overridden by enough votes in Congress).The ""Congressional Review Act"" (CRA): The JRD was passed into law in 1996 in a little used law called the CRA.,
Expect appointed bureaucrats in government agencies (such as divisions of government departments) to create non-legislated regulations, to interpret laws and oversee enforcement efforts to help the agendas of their own concept of government.,
Seek to inspire and assist (insist that) your U.S. representative of your district and the two senators from your state to exercise their power of ""Congressional Review"" which can stop any ""out of control"" government bureaucrats, if they act within 60 days in the Congress to avoid the ramrodding of the agenda that would move events in a direction that you oppose, ie: policies of the executive branch, even when they seem ill conceived, unnecessary or not good practices/in your thinking.

,
Consider helping independently or by your choice of party and candidates by these means to resist bureaucrats in government for example overriding eCommerce, controlling of the Internet, and your access to information.,
Speak out in disagreements on the ""Environmental Protection Agency"" (EPA), if you oppose regulating dealing in carbon dioxide emissions as a market similar to commodities that include buying and trading emission, ""carbon credits"" (some can pay for the right to pollute by buying carbon credits from others who do not pollute in their kinds of business) -- a step toward a full-blown ""Cap and Tax"" method/scheme with or without a Congressional vote.

,
Fight back quickly, in case there could be even much more to come, and all of that might only be the beginning, against:


""Fairness Doctrine"" that restricts previously free speech and would control your opinions or ones you could hear and see to require ""government-approval"" (the idea is that you would be required to allow your opposition to contradict you on your website with opposing points of view), which would complicate the free exercise of your opposing and/or supporting of opinion for your or your groups publication;
""Card Check Union Organizing"", where the ""National Labor Relations Board"" (NLRB) would eliminate workers' right to ""vote in a secret ballot election"" about getting, keeping or removing a union at your workplace, subjecting hardworking men and women to possible threats, intimidation, and worse from unionists or management who could know how you voted;
Mandated naked body scans, invasive or strip search, not only required by ""Homeland Security"" for American citizens to board an airplane, and perhaps soon to go to a mall, a sporting event, travel by bus or train, as well;
Medical Panels of ""Health and Human Services'"" (HHS) unaccountable government bureaucrats with power to deny care - resulting in what amounts to government life and death power over you and your loved ones;
Avoid possible 401(k) private retirement fund seizures by the IRS and the Social Security Administration to take Americans' private accounts and fold them into Social Security to help the federal government pay its bills for a few months or years (then what?,
Join in shining a hot spotlight of public awareness into the dark recesses and corners of government so those in government might think twice before passing unnecessary, unpopular or ill-advised laws or using the veto pen then standing for reelection, and those agency bureaucrats overriding the will of your Congress and the American people to empower/impose some new scheme won't be pleasant for their side's candidates.,
Keep pressure on Congress, prepare rounds of hard-hitting messages and conversations on:


social nets,
blogs on the Internet,
phone calls,
emails,
faxes,
talk radio,
newspaper writing, Letters to Ed

post cards,
newsletters, bulletins,...

,
Put Congress engarde (on notice): making sure every representative and senator knows that ""sitting and folding their hands"" once a bureaucratic push begins won't get your approval.,
Seek out petitions to congress or start your own or a phone and email campaign, and/or chip in your most generous contribution of $10, $25, $50 or more to your choice of organization or candidates to help them decide and to use their power of ""Congressional Review"" to STOP oncoming bureaucratic actions that you expect.

",How to Help Resist and Change Unelected Bureaucracy Rules,"


This bypasses Congress and avoids following the letter of the U.S. Constitution about passing new laws with the bureaucratic concept of ""regulations/rules"" -- to, perhaps, at least try to impose their agenda by issuing many new regulations -- all with big price tags of millions or perhaps billions of dollars costs to the businesses, cities and states affected by rules.;
, These resolutions literally stop any new regulatory measure -- unless vetoed by the President.,


Though the elected government and congress may have trouble passing changes without a strong majority -- yet agencies may try to order sweeping changes in policy to attempt to control workers, filter information, control private enterprise, entrepreneurs' activities, install vast new ideas that you may oppose or support.

,, You can communicate your opposition of the ""Federal Communications Commission"" (FCC) possibly starting to control information or opinion on the Internet.

,,).

,


Stay vigilante in the fight to defend your rights.

,,


Use social media messages and email, etc. to recruit and mobilize a grassroots army to give a message to Congress: contact many Americans even in the initial push!
Launch your election/reelection eve email and blog campaign, targeting key representatives and senators to urge them to vote to pass ""Resolutions of Disapproval."" Even election victories may vaporize in smoke, when you see the full, bureaucratic agenda enforced, most of it could be done without congressional vote. No one may be seen making often, controversial laws. No one takes responsibility because unseen and mostly unknowable worker-bees/borgs are doing it deep in the hive, offline, or in political party think tanks.
Tell them they will be held accountable for failing to try to stop the bureaucrats?

, The green badge is Blue Peter's environmental award. Any viewer who achieves something extraordinary with an environmental theme get a green badge.

, The orange badge is given to viewers who have been either a winner or runner up in any of Blue Peter's competitions. To win one of these badges, you will have to enter a Blue Peter competition. However, they only have competitions once or twice a year, so you will need to wait for the next scheduled competition.

, The purple badge is awarded to children a month who write a review of an edition of Blue Peter. This can include writing in with an idea for the program or writing your thoughts about an episode.

, The gold badge is Blue Peter's highest award given for exceptional achievement. The achievement is up to the individual and has been given to people who have performed acts of extreme bravery, represent their country in a major event, or demonstrate any other unique and astounding accomplishment. These are very difficult to get.

, This will help you get an idea of what kids and adults appearing on the show have accomplished.


Let your parents know you are trying to get a badge. This way, they will allow you to watch the show every time it comes on, and they may even have an idea for a project.
When you watch, keep your eyes and ears peeled for competitions you can enter.
Take notes on what the other kids have done, especially if they are near your age.

, You could draw or paint a picture to send to Blue Peter. This will be more successful if you like art already and have artistic skills. Badges have been given out for a drawing of a clown, a soldier, and an endangered species, to name a few.If you’re good at drawing or painting, pull out your art supplies and create a picture relevant to the show.
Draw something you really love, like your favorite animal, your favorite sport, or even your parents.
Practice every day. Drawing skills can be easily forgotten, so if you’re not happy with your first picture, keep trying.Draw or paint imaginary creatures, tell a story with your drawings, or use unusual colors in your art.

, This depends on your personal preference because you can write Blue Peter a poem, short story, or even a personal letter. Badges have been given out for a letter about endangered parrots, an Easter-themed poem, and a banana cake recipe.Writing a good poem or story can take many different attempts. If you don’t like the first thing you write, keep trying.
Write from the heart. A poem that rhymes perfectly may not be as good as one that is written sincerely.
Try different styles. Did you know there are poems called haikus?There are also stories called myths.Trying to write a cool haiku or your own myth will set you apart.
Write a personal essay about your favorite memory, a poem to your pet, or a letter to your personal hero.
You can be silly, too. Write a sci-fi story about bugs that talk or make up a funny character.

, Environmental conservation is important nowadays, so think of a project about the environment to get a green badge. Maybe you can start a greywater recycling program at your school or home.You could also track the types of glass recycled in your community, and present your research in a chart.Creativity is key, so think outside the box.
If you have a favorite outdoor activity like hiking or swimming, take interesting pictures outdoors and send them to Blue Peter.If you want to do a conservation project with your school or local community, ask an authority figure for guidance. This can include picking up trash, planting trees, making a neighborhood vegetable garden, or any other environmental activity you come up with.
Reuse trash in a creative way. The bottles your parents usually throw away can be candle holders and old newspaper can be a sculpture.

, An idea may not hit you out of nowhere; it may take months or years to draw, write, or accomplish something extraordinary. The more you watch the show, figure out what you’re good at, and try to be a creative and good person, the more likely you are to win a Blue Peter Badge.

, Here, you see what you have to include in your letter or e-mail. Ask your parent to read the steps to enter, since they can help you fill out any forms and e-mails.

, Include which badge you are trying to get and why you want it. Really show how you accomplished or made something special.

, This could get tricky depending on what your accomplishment is, so ask your parent for help.


If it's a letter, use a first class stamp to mail it to Blue Peter. Make sure to use enough stamps if you are mailing your project from a country outside of the UK.
Paintings will likely be sent in a box. Visit your local post office to mail works of art.
If you can send your project in an email in a picture or word document, do so.

, Keep track of when you are supposed to hear back on a calendar so you don’t forget. Soon, you will have a reply saying if you will receive the badge.


If you didn’t win this time, start on a new project.
Not getting a badge doesn’t mean your accomplishment was bad.

Keep your volume high and relatively consistent.,
Speak slightly slower than a normal conversational pace.You want to talk at a pace that feels a bit too slow.,
Move your eyes around the crowd.,
Reference your visual aid, but don't rely on it.,
Think of a common question or two to kick off the Question and Answer period if it goes silent.",How to Prepare an Oral Presentation2," Set up in advance as much as you can. Make sure your laptop is charged and all other equipment is working. If you are relying on IT personnel to set up, try to talk to them in advance so you know what you need to bring with you.Have another version of your presentation saved on an external hard drive. Put it in your bag and have it with you at all times. In addition, bring a printed copy of the presentation in case the technology fails.

, Get your audience on your side. Ask if they can hear you, and move appropriately if not. If you have one, tell a joke or two while IT sets up the projector or while the rest of the group files in, or ask about the location, the crowd (where are they from, etc.), or their previous exposure to your topic. Just be yourself and the audience will naturally gravitate towards you, as they like the ""candid"" feeling before the talk begins.


Even if you must go directly on stage, you can still begin with 1-2 lines of introduction and a quick joke. Keep it light, then turn your attention completely to your presentation once you're ready.
Scan your audience for a few friendly faces, usually the people who make eye-contact and seem ready for your presentation. As you talk, turn your attention towards them frequently, as they will help you stay engaged with the audience.

, You should stand with both feet shoulder-length apart and firmly planted. You shouldn't hunch, and your arms should be comfortable by your side or gathered in front of you, depending on what feels comfortable and appropriate. Some people stand on one leg, cross their arms, or hunch over their note cards, to feel more comfortable on stage. This, however, makes you seem informal and takes some of the importance out of your presentation.


Think of your best ""Superman pose."" Your back is straight, your head is held high, and your shoulders are slightly back.

, Some people get really quiet when they speak out loud because they're shy, while other people speak too quickly because of excitement or nerves. When you talk, err on the side of being a bit too loud, because that is often the perfect volume for the people sitting in the back rows.


If you notice people straining to hear you, feel free to pause and ask if ""they can hear you in the back."" The technical crew may be able to turn up the speakers, or you could step forward and/or speak louder.
If you think your voice may be wobbly, start with a little cough.
When possible, test out the microphone and your speaking volume in advance with the tech crew or a friend.

, That said, you don't want to treat your audience like idiots. Imagine you are addressing your grandparents who are a bit hard of hearing. You'd likely speak a little louder and slower, but you'd still be respectful of their intelligence and ability to follow your words.

, When people perceive that you are looking at them they are more likely to pay attention. As you speak, look to all the parts of the audience. You don't have to make eye contact with every single person, but glancing over each section of the crowd will make everyone feel like you are talking to them and keep them engaged.If you're nervous about eye contact, keep looking back to your friendly faces. If you know someone in the crowd, direct the majority of your speech to them. Look up and around every 1-2 minutes or so to include the rest of the crowd.

, Unless it is a major point or an important quote, never read directly from your slides or poster. Instead, let the audience view it casually, using the pictures to reinforce your presentation-- not the other way around. Direct the audience to specific images or visuals as they come up in your speech, only showing the images that are vital for your current point. No one comes to an oral presentation to read -- they come to hear you speak. Your speech should offer the majority of the information and intrigue.The patron saint of oral presentations, Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth perfectly blends smart visuals into a compelling, authoritative speech. Note how he references his visuals, but rarely gives the presentation over to them. He is still the expert and main focus.

, If you offer Q&A time and no one asks a question, there is a good chance everyone is too shy to get the ball rolling. If you have the time, you might want to say something along the lines of-- ""frequently, people will ask me about..."" and give a short, to the point answer.


If you still don't have any questions, thank them for their time and offer to stick around for 4-5 minutes for individual questions."
"
Eliminate pauses and filler words.,
Tie your oral presentation together with a hooking introductions and emphatic, full-circle conclusions.,
Give the audience a call to action.,
Come up with a simple, easily remembered refrain.,
Watch great speeches and presentations.",How to Prepare an Oral Presentation3," Vocal pauses include words like ""um..."" ""uh..."" ""like..."" and ""yeah"". For example, ""I, like, had so much fun at the... uh... yeah!! That place! You know..."" These small words go unnoticed in everyday conversation, but using them now makes you look unprepared. Your audience will lose focus as a result. You should try to add emphatic pauses to key points, without filler words. Let the audience hang onto the words a bit after you've made an important point, then move on to the next statement without any ums or ahs.


For a masterclass in dramatic pauses, watch one of President Obama's speeches. Note how he goes silent after major points that he wants to sink in, but only for 1-2 seconds.

, A great oral presentation feels a bit like a circle, and by the time the presenter is back to the beginning the audience is already onboard. A good introduction includes a surprising statistic or anecdote, grabbing the audience's attention for the speech. The conclusion brings you back to this important, enthralling statistic, issue, or story. When you return, you've illuminated the fact in a new light. When you ""retell"" the intro the second time, the audience has a new appreciation for it, and maybe some ideas about how to address the problems or ideas., You want your points, especially your final, overarching idea, to be actionable. Actionable means that the audience can do something or get involved. For the sandwich shop, this might be an invitation to invest a certain amount of money or sign a contract. But even informative/academic presentations can benefit from this strategy. Ask yourself: where can the audience learn more or get involved? If the audience feels engaged with your presentation they are much more likely to remember it.

, The human brain remembers short, repeated phrases easily, and you can use this to your advantage. You may not know that full text of the speech, but ""I have a dream"" became one of the most iconic phrases of the 20th century because it perfectly summed up King's point. It was quick, on-topic, and repeated frequently.

, The internet is a treasure trove of great oral presentations, all of which have something to teach you. From the casual information dumps of TED talks to the speeches of great orators like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr, watch a few speeches to get a sense of how the best conduct themselves. More likely than not, you'll notice a few patterns:


The ability to work the crowd. Get a few laughs early on, go slow, and lay out exactly what you are talking about. Great speakers get the audience on their side so that there is thunderous applause to cap the best points.
Simplification of ideas. Even the most complex ideas are boiled down into 1-2 easily comprehended, coherent points. When neuroscientists talk about the brain for TED talks, most of the science may go over your head. But if the main finding or idea is presented clearly, early, and often (""your brain both resists and adjusts to trauma,"" ""synesthesia is the mixing of two senses in the brain""), you can still get the important information across, even if the finer details are lost.
Relevance to the audience. Why should your audience care? How does what you're saying affect the people in the crowd? A great oral presentation makes everyone in the room feel personally affected. It brings them into your world and helps them see your point of view as their own."

Check for National Labor Relations Board rules for a decertification election or barring these such as the:""Certification bar"" -- stops petitions for a decertification election from being filed for one (1) year after a union wins an NLRB conducted election.",How to Help Get Rid of a Union2,"
""Contract bar"" -- holds that petitions for a decertification election cannot be filed during the first three (3) years of a collective bargaining agreement, except for during a certain 30-day ""window period.""
“Window period” -- for 30-days filing a decertification petition with the NLRB occurs 60 to 90 days ""prior to"" the expiration date or 3 year anniversary of the contract, whichever comes first. In the health care industry (such as hospitals), the 30-day “window period” occurs 90 to 120 days ""before"" the expiration date of the contract, or after the 3 year anniversary of that contract (if not expired), whichever comes first.
""Contract expired"" -- a decertification petition can also be filed anytime after a contract expires or becomes more than 3 years old.
""Successor contract"" -- if your employer and the union enter into a successor contract, the new contract will begin another 3 year ""contract bar"" on decertification elections. Thus, if you miss the ""window period"" for filing a petition for a decertification election, you may have to wait for another 3 years to request a decertification election.;

Be sure your petition is an employee effort (not lead by the company).,
Realize that there is any employer assistance, the union can nullify the effort by filing an ""unfair labor practice"" charge and winning that.

Open Powerpoint and create a new presentation.,
Draw the first frame of your animation.,
Duplicate the slide, and make a very slight change in this slide for the progress of the animation.,
Do not duplicate the new slide and keep going.,
Preview your presentation constantly, changing anything you think needs to be changed.,
Add in sounds and other details, then make a beginning and ending slide, maybe even an opening sequence.

, this one is important - it is the frame that all of the other frames in this scene will be based on. Take your time with it.

, If you had a ball falling, make it go down one or two places. (Note: Powerpoint doesn't use actual pixels, but a slightly larger placement system. Think of it as an invisible graph.)

, For things like gravity, make the motion stronger each time, eg, changing it more and more. The most catastrophic thing is to make things go too fast, so don't be afraid to take a lot of slides to do one thing - you can always delete them later.

Set your goals.,
Remember that style matters.,
Keep in mind some other things when creating teaching presentations.",How to Make Powerpoint Courseware and How to Distribute It," Before starting any PowerPoint courseware, ask yourself a question, “What is the goal of this lesson?” Goal is the key. You cannot well organize your class without figuring out the goal of a lesson. Many educators suggest using an outline to list clearly what skill or knowledge is being assessed. Brainstorm in mind, and then outline your ideas in PowerPoint. And, the most important thing, be sure to weigh content heavily in the assessment tool, don’t let style to take precedence over content.;
, Avoid using too many animations, clip art, backgrounds and so on. But keep in mind that a judicious use of those tools can be effective. Below is a research on under which set of conditions people learn best. Hearing spoken text and looking at graphics – 91% more learning, Looking at graphics alone – 63% more, Reading printed text plus looking at graphics – 56% more, Listening to spoken text, reading text, and looking at graphics – 46% more, Hearing spoken text plus reading printed text – 32% more, Reading printed text alone – 12% more, Hearing spoken text alone – 7% more.

, These include:


Include only 3-7 points per slide and 3-7 words per bullet;






One theme or background;






One font set;






One text animation effect;
Avoid using complete sentences, using clause instead;
Don’t show all points on a slide at once, otherwise, students will read ahead and stop listening to the presentation;






Challenge students to use pictures in stead of text, initiate talking with students and among students.







"
"
Be as concise as possible.,
Know your audience.,
Use animations and graphics wisely.,
Add background sound or music to keep the presentation interesting.,
Make use of color, design, and style.,
Link to video clips or websites from the internet.,
Structure your presentation.,
Practice your presentation.,
Show your own interest in the topic so that listeners can understand why they should be interested too.,
Dress appropriately and let your personality show.,
Utilize energy.",How to Make PowerPoint Presentations More Interesting," Use as few words as possible, but include important details and nuanced explanations if necessary. Be aware of the average audience member's attention span and avoid excessively lengthy presentations.;
, Design your presentation to fit your audience. An executive board should expect a clean, professional presentation that addresses points they are interested in. A classroom presentation for children needs to be entertaining and captivating.

, Images can be extremely helpful in helping you convey information. Graphics are, with the help of the internet, available in abundance. Keep images appropriate to the setting (unless you have permission to be humorous!) and present them in a way that is easy to understand. Use animations sparingly, but remember that if used simply, they can effectively display things like data changes, motion, growth, etc.


Keep graphs and charts simple, but include all the necessary details. Make sure the information is up-to-date and accurate.
Give appropriate credit to the sources of your images.

, You might want to choose some light instrumental music to stop your audience from becoming distracted by the latest pop hits.

, If you need inspiration, look to professionally designed color palettes or complimentary colors in nature. Stick with readable fonts, but experiment within this range for a fresh look. Remember that words and information can be arranged in countless ways within the rectangular space of the slide.

, Depending on the equipment available during your presentation, you can link videos, photographs, news articles, etc. directly to your slide. Before your presentation, make sure you have a stable internet connection and the necessary sound equipment.

, Organize your presentation in a logical fashion. At the start, present a ""road-map"" that will let audience members know approximately how the presentation will progress. This lets the listeners know what to expect and look forward to.

, Make sure you sound knowledgeable and natural. You should be able to answer questions about your topic and navigate quickly between slides.

, Use facts to support your opinions. If you are passionate about a topic, explain why it matters to every person in the room.

, Your audience will be looking at you. Give them something interesting to look at. Make eye contact with all sections of the audience.

, Before you make a point, let the audience know why it matters and why they should care. Be a dynamic present in the room -- if possible, walk around the front of your room during your presentation. This can help you loosen up in order to gesture or speak extemporaneously, if needed.

While preparing a presentation there are certain basic guiding principals:


Make it simple.,
We need to take certain points in consideration, while preparing the presentation:


What are the key points you want to make?,
Remember: A presentation is different than a paper.,
Resources of information is key to success.,
Logistics to be taken care of:


How big is the hall where you will be speaking?,
Equipment Needs should also be taken care-of:


Ask what you will be given and what you must bring with you.,
Be prepared for a chalk talk because you never know if/when there will be technical problems.

,
Organise the Material Introduction:


Time to sell your idea or research.,
Organise the Material Body


Make sure you cover your main points.,
Organise the Material Conclusion.,
Format Of Presentation:


For a presentation in a dark room, choose a dark background with light letters.,
Practice several times before delivering the actual presentation.

,And don't forget to be happy about it

",How to Prepare a Professional Presentation,"
Make it clear.
Don’t let the technology dominate the presentation. You want the audience to remember the quality of your research, not your PowerPoint wizardry.;
,
Who is your audience?
What are they interested in hearing?
How familiar are they, with your topic? Do they expect data or concepts?

, Don’t try to cover everything.

, We must think on ::


What will you cover, what can be eliminated?
How much detail do you need? (Remember, your time and your audience’s attention are limited. For any part of your presentation, ask yourself “So what?”)

,
How much time will you be given?
What time of day is your talk?
Carefully consider if you will depend on anyone else for producing your presentation—allow plenty of lead time.

,
Consider all equipment you will need

Internet connection
Computer
Microphone
Software



,,
Answer the question, “Why should I listen to you?”
Establish your personal credibility.

Decide what you want your audience to learn.,
Boil your information down.,
Plan out your structure.",How to Make a Great PowerPoint Presentation1," Before you begin, it will be necessary to determine what you want your main take-away message or information to be. This should be an identifiable main point, which all of your other information will support. If you are doing an academic presentation, it will be the equivalent of your thesis statement. If your presentation is business related, it will be the product or service which you are proposing or advocating. Nevertheless, prepare for the content to put in your presentation before you open and start with a blank presentation.;
, Try to only keep the information that you can't do without. If you have a load of text in your hands, cut it down to the most important bits. If you have a boring graph about how internet users have increased throughout the years, make a statistic instead. Say, the amount of internet users have tripled since the last decade, now up to 3 billion. This way, you will be presenting the same information to your audience, just in a more interesting and instigating way. It will also keep your presentation from being to long or sounding ""rambling"".

, Now that you know what information must be included, begin to plan the structure of your presentation. You will want to plan as much of your speech and slides on paper as possible. Outline not only your speech but your slides as well.


The structure of an academic presentation should follow roughly the same structure as an academic paper, first introducing your main point, supporting it with evidence, and then a short conclusion.
For business presentations, Guy Kawasaki (a notable business adviser and marketing guru) suggests this standard presentation structure:

The Problem
Your solution
Business model
Underlying magic/technology
Marketing and sales
Competition
Team
Projections and milestones
Status and timeline
Summary and call to action

Streamline text.,
Give handouts.,
Use informative graphics.,
Cut unnecessary sounds and visuals.",How to Make a Great PowerPoint Presentation2," When using PowerPoint slides you want them to actually help and raise the quality of your presentation, not simply exist alongside it. The best way to do this is to ensure that your slides do not simply restate what you are saying. You should not be reading from your slides. Really, you want PowerPoint presentations to contain as little text as possible. Having to read text will distract your audience, even if only unconsciously, from what you are telling them. With this in mind, keep your text to a minimum and present it in a way that is easy to read, such as a bulleted list.

, So, if you can't put all your information onto your slides, how are you supposed to tell your audience everything that can't fit into your speech? Handouts! Make a one or two page handout, for each audience member or for people to take at will, which contains a section for each slide or portion of your presentation. Here you can put extra information or key points of information that were included in your presentation.

, Graphics are what make a really engaging PowerPoint presentation. These can provide your audience with a new way of looking at what you are trying to tell them. They can provide information which may be difficult for you to convey in words, such as charts and graphs. You will want to be sure, however, that they actually add to your presentation and do not simply provide a distraction.

, With the above information in mind, you will want to be absolutely sure that you do not include unnecessary visuals or audio. Examples would include transition animations, clip art, sound effects, and cluttered templates or background images. These are the features which tend to make Powerpoint presentations boring, dated, and unhelpful.They distract audience members and add nothing to the presentation. They even hinder the audience's ability to absorb information.

"
"
Practice.,
Present as if there were no PowerPoint.,
Get to the point.,
Be inspiring.",How to Make a Great PowerPoint Presentation3," You will want to spend a lot of time practicing before delivering your presentation. Make sure that your speech matches well with your slides. You will also want to be sure you know how to time your speech, especially if you want to put the presentation on automatic, rather than having to stop or refocus to change slides.

, Don't use your slides as a crutch. They're there to add to your speech, not carry it along. If you present as if there were no slide, by being an engaging, enthusiastic speaker, your audience will be enthralled and remember your presentation for years to come.

, Don't ramble. Don't include information you don't need. Tell your audience what they need to know and don’t take any more time than you need to get there. Use bullet points for important information and expand on it while presenting instead of writing a long paragraph and reading it word for word. Remember, presentations should never be more than 20 minutes long. If you are a teacher with time to fill, break up presentations with activities. Having to listen to a presentation for more than 20 minutes will cause most people to disengage, which is not what you want to happen.

, Find ways to inspire your audience. You want to give them an emotional connection to the material you are presenting. This will make them more invested in the information and will also help the retain the information more accurately and for longer. Be enthusiastic about what you are presenting and make the audience understand why it’s important.


It’s not enough to show why your information is important to someone else; you have to make it important to your audience. Make them understand why they should care. For example, don’t give a lecture on history and just expect students to care. You need to show them how that history directly ties to current events and affects their lives. Look for parallels and direct correlations to tie your information to your audience.

Write the outline of your PPT on papers at first, the more detailed the better.
,
Open PPT but don’t use any templates.,
Begin to search information.,
Check out what content of this PPT could be transferred into pictures.,
Choose the appropriate templates and choose different color according to your content’s emotions.,
Adjust your title, size of words, fonts and drag it to the appropriate position.

,
Beautify the pictures by adjusting the color, shadow, etc.,
Beautify the page, add decoration pictures for your PPT.,
Check it yourself, especially the wrong characters which will leave a bad impression to your audience.,Make use of the templates provided by the default installation of Powerpoint, and the online templates gallery.",How to Make a Beautiful and Efficient PPT,", Write your outline as one title one page.

, Write out or copy the content that is suitable for the titles and revise the words. Make the content of each page as a point with “Project number”. Of course in the process of searching for information, you will find some useful information which may not be included in your outline. You can adjust this and add new page in suitable position.

, For example, contents including numbers, processes, causal relationships, trends, time, juxtaposition and sequences etc could all be expressed by pictures. If sometimes the content is too much or can’t be expressed by pictures, you could express it with charts. If it couldn’t be expressed by pictures and charts, express it in text. So the best sequence of expression is pictures-charts-words. In this process, don’t care about whether the pictures are beautiful or not, just use the pictures that could accurately express your content.

, If you think that the templates are not quite suitable for your contents, you could adjust it by yourself, such as adding logo, background pictures or decoration pictures and so on. Of course, if there is a standard template of your company, you could use it directly.

,, Do remember that the colors of the whole PPT shouldn't be more than three. Otherwise your PPT will appear unusual.

, The principle of using decoration pictures is that they should be related to the title and the size and color.

, If your PPT is very important, you could ask your colleagues to double-check it because sometimes we can’t find our own mistakes.

Research your topic by doing a little background reading.,
Further refine your topic.,
Formulate good research questions.,
Give the reference librarian a chance to help you narrow your research.,
Compose your research questions so that you will find in-depths answers.,
Don’t expect a reference librarian to provide all the answers for you.",How to Do Research in a Library," A quick look at some basic information about your chosen topic will indicate the scope of information available. A quick way to start is to simply look up the topic in an encyclopedia. If you can’t find sufficient basic information about your chosen topic in an encyclopedia, you will have to dig deeper to find the basic information you need to get started on your research, such as dates and events, just to get an overview of your subject. Ask the reference librarian for help to get you started. For example, if you want some background information on the dairy industry, formulate your questions with these queries:


Do you have some general information about the dairy industry?
What are some of the issues involved with hormones and milk production?
Where can I find information about the benefits of organic milk?
Where can I find some background/history on the dairy industry in Europe?
Who was involved with the invention of automated milking machines?;
, If your first exploratory research efforts didn’t yield much information, think about narrowing down your topic, or expanding it. This becomes more important if you have serious time constraints: if it is difficult to find broad background information on your topic, how will you find in depth facts if you have only 2 or 3 weeks to research and write about your topic?


Look at the Library of Congress Subject Headings for keywords that apply to your topic.
Browse through your library’s interlibrary loan system, if they have one. If you can’t find books about your topic in an interlibrary system, you might want to change topics; it is a sure indicator that you will not have an easy time finding resources to support your paper.
Ask if the library has access to SAGE. This software helps researchers with their projects, including designing your writing project. You will be able to search for information about your topic in a variety of sources, including government documents, magazines and journals.

, Reference librarians can assist you much faster if your research request if specific. Tell the reference librarian about the topic you want to research, and about what you intend to do with the information. The depth and breadth of resources you will need will vary according to what you need the information for. Are you going to write a short speech? Are you working towards a dissertation? Are you writing a short summary of the topic, or are you writing a 20 page paper on it?

, Tell the librarian what you have already searched for and what search terms you used. Specify your needs; break down your reference question to a single fact if that is all you need to complete your research. Phrase a single fact question in a way that will elicit the information you need:


Who is/was . . . ?

, Start by asking questions that will lead you to solid primary source information:


I need to research XYZ company. What resources would you recommend that I use?
Where can I find information about the Montreal Olympics?
What information is available about orphanages in Romania during the 1960s?
How can I find out about the origins of genetically modified seeds?

, A reference librarian can help direct you to the resources and relevant information you need; it’s up to you to extract the information.

Present your outline to your advisor.",How to Do Your Dissertation Research Productively," You may need to use a variety of research methods, depending on your subject. Make a list of the types of research you will conduct. These may include interviews, surveys, field research, experiments, and reading., Decide which research methods you can begin immediately, and which will have to wait. You can break down your timeline by week, month, or even year, depending on the scope of your project.


Reading usually can and should be started immediately. That way, you have time to digest what you read, and to include new reading materials that you learn about along the way.
Experiments often require planning. If you need to perform an experiment, begin planning your experiments now, so that they can be successful and efficient when you perform them later. Make sure to allow enough time to implement the experiment, and even to repeat it if things don’t go as planned.If your research involves other people (assistants, subjects, or interviewees) you’ll need to reach out to those people early on to find out what their schedules allow for.
You may need to travel for research. Determine where and when you will need to travel, and if you will need to secure funding in order to do so.
If you don’t know how long a certain aspect of research will take, ask an advisor or one of your academic peers. Someone who has been through this process will likely have a good idea of how much time a given type of research can take.

, Some people prefer using online tools like Google Calendar. Others keep a date book in their purse or backpack, or hang a whiteboard or wall calendar in their office.


Choose a method that you’re likely to stick to.
Online tools can be extra useful because many calendar apps will send you a reminder of what you’d planned to do each day.
Large calendars like whiteboards can help you look at the big picture, and many people enjoy the tactile aspect of adding and erasing things as a way to show progress.
It can be helpful to create a reverse calendar, which means working backward from your final deadline to see when different steps must be done by., Writing a dissertation often prevents people from having as much leisure time as they’re used to. However, people are most productive when they feel a healthy balance between dedicated work time and leisure time. Set a number of hours each day or each week that you will spend on your research. Strive to hit that number, and stop when you do. As your deadline approaches, you may need to adjust that number, but hopefully not by much.
Let the people in your life know what to expect. You may need to cut back on your hours at work or spend less time with loved ones. This can be difficult, but if everyone understands your needs and your limits, making these sacrifices can be a little easier.

, Limit distractions during your dedicated research time. Work in a quiet place, such as a library or lab, where you can be alone. You may also want to try using the Pomodoro method, which teaches you to set a timer for 25 minutes (a ""pom"") before you start working and then, take a five minute break when the timer is up. Then, if you have not finished your task at the end of the first ""pom"" or you want to start a new ""pom,"" then you can set your timer for 25 minutes again. This method helps you to stay focused and the breaks are good opportunities to get up and stretch, check your Twitter, or make a cup of tea.Avoid distractions like radio, television, and social media while you do your research.
If you stay focused during your dedicated research time, you won’t need as much of it.
Take breaks every 45 to 60 minutes. During your breaks you can stretch, surf the web, or chat with a friend. Taking scheduled breaks actually helps us stay focused and productive when we're working., Now that you have a detailed calendar and have set aside the time you need, all you need to do is stick with it. If you find yourself straying from your calendar for any reason, you may have a tendency to procrastinate. Start making efforts to stop procrastinating as soon as possible.


Make a ""to do"" list each day that you're working on research. This list can include some tasks that you can fully accomplish in one day, and some that you'll work on a little bit each day.
Reward yourself when you accomplish something on schedule. Take yourself out for a coffee or a nice lunch. Spend time with loved ones without the stress of unfinished research hanging over you.

, When working on a dissertation, you’ll have an advisor, or supervisor, whose role is to guide you through this process. Even if you’re both very busy, set up regular meetings with this person, to discuss your research with them. It is important to have your advisor's support, while also maintaining your autonomy and independence. Therefore, you do not need to meet with your advisor every day or run everything by your advisor. A monthly meeting with your advisor should be plenty.

, Meetings shouldn’t just be about “checking in.”


If you have a specific goal for each meeting, the meetings will be more productive and encourage you to stick to your schedule.
The purpose of a meeting may be to report on the findings of an experiment or discuss your analysis of a specific reading.

, Some useful goals could be finishing one of the books you’re reading, conducting a certain number of interviews, or repeating an experiment. Write these goals down and share them with your advisor. That way, you’ll both know what is expected next time you meet. Be sure to accomplish these goals before your next meeting., If you are unable to meet your goals before a meeting, let your advisor know. They may want to reschedule until you’ve completed your goals; or they may want to meet with you to find out what got in your way. Either way, it’s important to be honest about your progress. Academics are busy people, and it’s important that your advisor feels their time and expertise is valued.

, Your advisor likely knows other professors or experts who would be useful to your research. Ask your advisor if they could connect you to them. This can be particularly helpful if your advisor is very busy, or doesn’t have a large amount of experience in your area of research.

, Notes should be meaningful to you and help jog your memory later, when you’re writing. Strive to make notes long enough to be helpful, but short enough that you don't get bogged down with note-taking. Think about what you choose to write down, and why. Notes should help you answer questions related to your research.
Develop a shorthand style for taking notes during lectures or interviews, when you have to write while someone else is speaking.
Use color coded tabs to mark pages in books or journals that are referenced in your notes. That way, you’ll be able to easily find those places if you want to quote a source, or cite a specific section in your writing.

, Some people keep everything in electronic files. Others use index cards or a dedicated journal. Whatever method you choose, stay consistent, so that data isn’t misplaced during the process.

, Mind maps are great ways to organize information before putting it into a linear order.


At the center of your mind map is your research question or thesis.
The branches of your mind map can include all of the areas of your research, as well as questions that you have yet to answer. Fill in spots on your mind map with references to your notes.
If you have some large holes where there aren’t notes, you may need to do more research. Ask your advisor for recommendations on where to look, or how you might conduct that research.

, During your research, you’re likely to collect data that isn’t directly relevant to your thesis. You may want to refer to it later, but for now, keep it in a separate folder or notebook. The more you can streamline what you keep in front of you, the easier it will be to stay organized. If you aren’t sure, refer to your mind map. If research doesn’t naturally fit in the mind map, it’s probably extraneous-- at least for right now., Eventually, you have to stop researching and start writing. Determine how much time you’ll need to write (ask your advisor, if you’re not sure). Then, work backwards to determine when you need to conclude your research and begin writing. Without a deadline, you could continue researching forever, and never get to the writing., As you begin to write, you’ll want to have easy access to your notes and your research. Even if you’ve taken copious notes on a book, you’ll want to also have the book on hand for quoting, citing, and possibly cross-referencing.

, Make sure that any holes in your research have been filled in with credible sources., Outlines are crucial to any writing process-- particularly for something as in depth as a dissertation. Turning your mind map into an outline is the first step toward putting your research into a linear order.

, Your outline should include all of the necessary research to prove your thesis, and exclude extraneous research. Your outline should also allow space for your own analysis of the data, which leads to proving your thesis. , Before you begin writing, your advisor should be able to look at your outline and tell you if you’re ready to begin the writing process. Take their feedback seriously, and complete any final research or reorganization before you begin writing.

Pull together the finishing touches.",How to Do an A+ Project," Your teacher should lay out the basics of what you need to do to create the project. Look at the description, and figure out exactly how many things you'll need to complete it.For example, maybe your assigned project is ""Pick a specific country to make a presentation on. You will need to represent this project visually. You need to provide information on the geography, the people, the culture (including food), the language, and the government, at the very least. As a part of the project, provide a food for the class that represents the country.""
For this project, you'll need to focus on these components: 1) Choose a country. 2) Research the country. 3) Figure out a visual representation. 4) Provide text for informational purposes. 5) Cook or buy food.;
, If you procrastinate, you will wind up doing the project in a hurry, and you won't be able to do your best work. You'll likely need more time than you think to put your project together.


Essentially, there is no way to do an A+ project at the last minute. If you do happen to get a good grade on a project you procrastinated on, consider it luck.
Look at how much time you have. To make yourself a timeline, look ahead to when the project is due. You need to know exactly how much time you have to divide up the time properly., On a sheet of paper or calendar, label each week that you have to do the project. Next, think about how much time you'll need to do each part.For instance, the first week could be ""Doing Early Research and Deciding on a Project"" and ""Gathering Materials."" The next week could be ""Doing Research for the Project,"" followed by ""Writing the Text for the Project."" The fourth week could be ""Putting Together the Visual Aspect,"" while the final week could be ""Wrapping Up the Project and Working on Food.""

, No matter what your teacher assigns you, you will likely have to decide on part of the project. That is, you'll need to narrow down the more general project to something more specific. For instance, in the example project, you need to decide what country you want to report on.If you aren't sure whether you've chosen something appropriate, feel free to ask your teacher. She will tell you if you're on the right track.
Another advantage to starting early is that if your first idea isn't quite right, you have time to try another one.

, If you can't decide what you want to do, try doing some pre-research. Basically, you pick a good website or book on the general topic.For instance, a good website for information on countries is the CIA's World Factbook.The best sites are government websites or educational websites. Look for the "".edu"" extension or the "".gov"" extension.If you aren't sure where to look, talk to your school librarian. She will be able to guide your research and give you some excellent sources to use.

, You need to think about the direction you want your project to go. Brainstorming is a great way to develop ideas. Brainstorming is essentially just taking some quiet time to let your creative juices flow.Try blind or free writing. Basically, you just start writing with your project in mind. Try not to judge yourself while you're writing; just let the ideas flow. After you're done, highlight any ideas that seem worth developing.You may prefer a mind map if you're a more visual person. Start with a large piece of paper. Write down words or ideas that come to mind. As you write more, you can begin to connect them with lines to show how these ideas fit together.Try figuring out your questions using a graph. You can make your own by dividing a piece of paper into four parts. Label these parts as follows: ""I want to know"", ""I think maybe"", ""I already know"", and ""I don't know."" This will help you collect your ideas.

, Before you move on, you should decide, in basic terms, how you are going to present your information. If you have been assigned a particular medium, such as a poster or a paper, always follow the teacher's requirements.


If your teacher gives you free reign, use your imagination. You can do anything from using clay to a tri-fold poster board to a pop-up book. You need to decide now so you can think about materials, and you can be thinking ahead about how you will present each piece of information.
Don't just go for the ""easiest"" option. If your project is a creative one, part of your grade may be based on how creative you get with your presentation of information. The simplest, easiest way may also be the quickest way to a grade other than that coveted A+.
Consider your strengths when making this choice. If you aren't very artistic, but you're very organized, a PowerPoint presentation could be a better option than a hand-drawn portrait. If you're more creative, you could take photographs to illustrate your ideas.

, You want a basic idea of how you want your project to go. Sketch out an idea of what you want your project to look like, as well as where you want your main texts to go. This sketch will also give you an idea of what you need to research., Create a list of what you're going to need for your project. For instance, you may need clay, poster board, or markers. Look around your house first to see if you have some of what you need, and then make a list of just what you need to buy or borrow.

, For a big project, it's best to have one space where everything goes. That way, you won't spend time looking for items every time you sit down to work on it. Plus, you'll know exactly what you have to work with., Put the materials you found around the house in the selected space. Go buy what else you need. If you need to, ask your parents to take you to the store.


Make a list so that you don't forget anything. You don't want to lose valuable time having to make a second trip to the store.

, Different projects require different types of sources. For instance, if you're writing about a person's life, you'll need everything from letters the person wrote to biographies on the person. For a project on a specific country, you could use encyclopedias and well-established websites, including the country's government website.It's tempting to use the first thing you find on a Google search, but this will not get you that A+ grade. Use credible, authoritative sources for your project.
For websites, it can be hard to decide whether something is credible. In general, stick with government sources, peer-reviewed research, and major news outlets such as the New York Times or the BBC.
If you aren't sure whether a source is credible, ask your teacher or your librarian.

, Of course, one of the best places to find sources is your local or school library. In addition to having many of the resources you'll need, your librarian can guide you to the types of resources that are appropriate for your project. You'll definitely be able to find books. You may also be able to find primary resources and articles through an article database.Use the catalog to find books. Your library will most likely have an online catalog. You can use a keyword to find books on your subject.To use an article database, you pick the databases that are relevant to your topic. For instance, if you want to find newspaper articles, you limit it to a newspaper database. If you want to find articles on biographies, you may want a history database., You need to first decide how many sources you need. Your teacher should give you an idea of how many you'll need to use. If she doesn't, you'll have to decide. You may use a couple for a middle school project, while for a college project, you may need as many as 20 or more.Once you've decided how many you'll need, look at your resources to decide which provide the best information for your project. You'll be able to reject some at the library, but you'll probably need to take a selection home to look at them more in-depth.

, Make sure you dedicate a notebook, binder, or folder to the project. As you read about your project, put down notes about it. Jot down important ideas. If you write word-for-word, make sure you indicate that by putting quotation marks around it.You can divide your notes how you like; however, you should have some organization. Maybe you want to organize by topic as you go, or maybe you want to keep all the notes from each source in one area and reorganize by topic later. It's up to you., Make sure you are putting the citation information down as you take notes. It needs to be clear where you found each piece of information, as you don't want to steal someone else's ideas, which is cheating.For an article, you'll need things like the author's full name and the title of the journal and the article. You'll also need the volume and issue information, as well as page numbers, both the range of the page numbers of the article in the journal and the page number you found your information on. Finally, you'll need the digital online identifier (doi), a unique number that you can usually find on the article or in the catalog.For a book, you generally need the author's full name or the editor's full name, plus the title of the book. You'll also need publication information, such as where it was published, the publisher's name, and the book's edition. Write down page number information, such as where you found that piece of information and a page range if it's an essay within an anthology. If it is an essay, you'll want to provide the author's name and the title of the essay., If you haven't already, take time to organize your notes by topic. Be sure you don't lose the citation information for each piece of information.


For example, for our example project, you might organize your notes by ""people,"" ""culture,"" and ""cuisine"" for your chosen country.

, Decide how much text you need for each section. Write your text, using your notes to provide the information. Make sure to put the writing in your own words, unless you make a direct quote with quotation marks around it and cite the author. You need to cite where you found each piece of information, anyway, as you must give credit where credit is due.Use Purdue's Online Writing Lab to learn how to cite information. Your teacher should tell you which style guideline she wants you to use.

, Read through your text to make sure you catch any mistakes. You want your project to shine, and typos make it look bad.Print out your text. It's easier to catch mistakes in print.Try reading it aloud. It forces you to slow down, which helps you catch mistakes.Ask someone else to look over it. It's easier for someone with fresh eyes to catch mistakes.
Don't forget to use spellcheck on your computer. It doesn't catch everything, but it will help you catch some mistakes., Now is the time to get your hands dirty. Since you already have a plan of what you want your project to look like, all you have to do is execute it. If you're not particularly artsy, you can use a computer to help you create your graphics and letters.


For a project such as a PowerPoint, you'll do everything on your computer. It's still a good idea to have a plan in place so that you can figure out how your slides will be organized and what each slide should look like.

, Next, you need to add your text into your visual project. You can print off your text, or write it by hand, depending on how you want to style your project. Make sure your organize your text properly; that is, make sure you are putting like ideas together., Ensure your project guides the viewer through ideas. Label sections clearly, so that your teacher knows exactly where to find each piece of information. Also, leave some white space or negative space, so that the board isn't so crowded and busy that it's hard to distinguish one topic from another., Once you think you're done, go back over your project to make sure you have included everything your teacher asked for. If you haven't, you need to find a way to add it. Don't forget your list of references, which you can also learn how to make on Purdue's Online Writing Lab.


Make sure that you've attended to all the details carefully. Even things such as straight lines and careful cut-and-paste jobs for pictures show that you put your best work into your project. It may not land you the A+ of your dreams, but this attention to detail will show that you gave it your best try.

Decide on a question you want to study.,
Do a literature review.,
Evaluate whether qualitative research is the right fit for your research question.,
Consider your ideal sampling size.,
Choose a qualitative research methodology.,
Collect your data.,
Analyze your data.,
Write up your research.",How to Do Qualitative Research," A good research question needs to be clear, specific, and manageable. To do qualitative research, your question should explore reasons for why people do things or believe in something.


The research questions is one of the most important pieces of your research design. It determines what you want to learn or understand and also helps to focus the study, since you can't investigate everything at once. Your research question will also shape how you conduct your study since different questions require different methods of inquiry.Find the balance between a burning question and a researchable question. The former is something you really want to know about and is often quite broad. The latter is one that can be directly investigated using available research methods and tools.You should start with a burning question and then narrow it down more to make it manageable enough to be researched effectively. For example, ""what is the meaning of teachers' work to teachers"" is too broad for a single research endeavor, but if that's what you're interested you could narrow it by limiting the type of teacher or focusing on one level of education. For example, ""what is the meaning of teachers' work to second career teachers?"" or ""what is the meaning of teachers' work to junior high teachers?"";
, A literature review is a process of studying what others have written about your research question and particular topic. You read widely on the larger field and examine studies that relate to your topic. You then draw up an analytical report that synthesizes and integrates the existing research (rather than simply presents a short summary of each study in chronological order. In other words, you are ""researching the research.""br>For example, if your research question focuses on how second career teachers attribute meaning to their work, you would want to examine the literature on second career teaching - what motivates people to turn to teaching as a second career? How many teachers are in their second career? Where do most second career teachers work? Doing this reading and review of existing literature and research will help you refine your question and give you the base you need for your own research. It will also give you a sense of the variables that might impact your research (e.g., age, gender, class, etc.) and that you will need to take into consideration in your own study.
A literature review will also help you to determine whether you are really interested and committed to the topic and research question and that there is a gap in the existing research that you want to fill by conducting your own investigation., Qualitative methods are useful when a question cannot be answer by a simple 'yes' or no' hypothesis. Often qualitative research is especially useful for answering ""how"" or ""what"" questions.They are also useful when budgetary decisions have to be taken into account.


For example, if your research question is ""what is the meaning of teachers' work to second career teachers"", that is not a question that can be answered with a 'yes' or 'no'. Nor is their likely to be a single overarching answer. This means that qualitative research is the best route

, Qualitative research methods don't rely as heavily on large sample sizes as quantitative methods, but they can still yield important insights and findings.For instance, since it's unlikely that you have the funding to be able to study all second teachers everywhere in the United States, perhaps you choose to narrow your study to a major urban area (like New York) or schools within 200km of where you live.


Consider the possible outcomes. Because qualitative methodologies are generally quite broad, there is almost always the possibility that some useful data will come out of the research. This is different than in a quantitative experiment, where an unproven hypothesis can mean that a lot of time has been wasted.Your research budget and available financial resources should also be considered. Qualitative research is often cheaper and easier to plan and execute. For example, it is usually easier and cost-saving to gather a small number of people for interviews than it is to purchase a computer program that can do statistical analysis and hire the appropriate statisticians., The design of qualitative research is the most flexible of all the experimental techniques, so there are a number of accepted methodologies available to you.Action Research – Action research focuses on solving an immediate problem or working with others to problem solve and address particular issues.Ethnography – Ethnography is the study of human interaction and communities through direct participation and observation within the community you wish to study. Ethnographic research comes from the discipline of social and cultural anthropology but is now becoming more widely used.Phenomenology – Phenomenology is the study of the subjective experiences of others. It researches the world through the eyes of another person by discovering how they interpret their experiences.Grounded Theory – The purpose of grounded theory is to develop theory based on the data systematically collected and analyzed. It looks at specific information and derives theories and reasons for the phenomena.

Case Study Research – This method of qualitative study is an in-depth study of a specific individual or phenomena in its existing context., Each of the research methodologies has uses one or more techniques to collect empirical data, including interviews, participant observation, fieldwork, archival research, documentary materials, etc. The form of data collection will depend on the research methodology. For example, case study research usually relies on interviews and documentary materials, whereas ethnography research requires considerable fieldwork.Direct observation – Direct observation of a situation or your research subjects can occur through video tape playback or through live observation. In direct observation, you are making specific observations of a situation without influencing or participating in any way.For example, perhaps you want to see how second career teachers go about their routines in and outside the classroom and so you decide to observe them for a few days, being sure to get the requisite permission from the school, students and the teacher and taking careful notes along the way.

Participant observation – Participant observation is the immersion of the researcher in the community or situation being studied. This form of data collection tends to be more time consuming, as you need to participate fully in the community in order to know whether your observations are valid.Interviews – Qualitative interviewing is basically the process of gathering data by asking people questions. Interviewing can be very flexible - they can be on-on-one, but can also take place over the phone or Internet or in small groups called ""focus groups"".There are also different types of interviews. Structured interviews use pre-set questions, whereas unstructured interviews are more free-flowing conversations where the interviewer can probe and explore topics as they come up. Interviews are particularly useful if you want to know how people feel or react to something. For example, it would be very useful to sit down with second career teachers in either a structured or unstructured interview to gain information about how they represent and discuss their teaching careers.

Surveys – Written questionnaires and open ended surveys about ideas, perceptions, and thoughts is another way in which you can collect data for your qualitative research. For example, in your study of second career schoolteachers, perhaps you decide to do an anonymous survey of 100 teachers in the area because you're concerned that they may be less forthright in an interview situation than in a survey where their identity was anonymous.
""Document analysis"" – This involves examining written, visual, and audio documents that exist without any involvement of or instigation by the researcher. There are lots of different kinds of documents, including ""official"" documents produced by institutions and personal documents, like letters, memoirs, diaries and, in the 21st century, social media accounts and online blogs. For example, if studying education, institutions like public schools produce many different kinds of documents, including reports, flyers, handbooks, websites, curricula, etc. Maybe you can also see if any second career teachers have an online meet group or blog. Document analysis can often be useful to use in conjunction with another method, like interviewing., Once you have collected your data, you can begin to analyze it and come up with answers and theories to your research question. Although there are a number of ways to analyze your data, all modes of analysis in quantitative research are concerned with textual analysis, whether written or verbal.Coding – In coding, you assign a word, phrase, or number to each category. Start out with a pre-set list of codes that you derived from your prior knowledge of the subject. For example, ""financial issues"" or ""community involvement"" might be two codes you think of after having done your literature review of second career teachers. You then go through all of your data in a systematic way and ""code"" ideas, concepts and themes as they fit categories. You will also develop another set of codes that emerge from reading and analyzing the data. For example, you may see while coding your interviews, that ""divorce"" comes up frequently. You can add a code for this. Coding helps you organize your data and identify patterns and commonalities.Descriptive Statistics – You can analyze your data using statistics. Descriptive statistics help describe, show or summarize the data to highlight patterns. For example, if you had 100 principal evaluations of teachers, you might be interested in the overall performance of those students. Descriptive statistics allow you to do that. Keep in mind, however, that descriptive statistics cannot be used to make conclusions and confirm/disprove hypotheses.Narrative analysis – Narrative analysis focuses on speech and content, such as grammar, word usage, metaphors, story themes, meanings of situations, the social, cultural and political context of the narrative.Hermeneutic Analysis – Hermeneutic analysis focuses on the meaning of a written or oral text. Essentially, you are trying to make sense of the object of study and bring to light some sort of underlying coherence.Content analysis/Semiotic analysis – Content or semiotic analysis looks at texts or series of texts and looks for themes and meanings by looking at frequencies of words. Put differently, you try to identify structures and patterned regularities in the verbal or written text and then make inferences on the basis of these regularities.For example, maybe you find the same words or phrases, like ""second chance"" or ""make a difference,"" coming up in different interviews with second career teachers and decide to explore what this frequency might signify.

, When preparing the report on your qualitative research, keep in mind the audience for whom you are writing and also the formatting guidelines of the research journal you wish to submit your research to. You will want to make sure that your purpose for your research question is compelling and that you explain your research methodology and analysis in detail.

The best character sheets tend to be specific to one particular story or person. Spend a bit getting acquainted with the character you want to outline in your sheet before writing it down.


Who is your character and what world does he or she exist in? A character sheet for a 28 year-old lawyer living in modern day Manhattan is obviously going to look vastly different than one for a 45 year-old wizard living in a fictional universe of your creation.Is your character male or female? What are his or her most notable physical characteristics? Does he or she have a family? A spouse? Friends?Draw a short picture if you're a visual learner or if you're doing a graphic novel or comic. This can help you get acquainted with your character.
Keep in mind, this does not have to be terribly extensive yet. This is more of a brainstorming session to help you figure out what about the character would be helpful to know. Jot down a paragraph or two and consider what about the character needs further exploring.;
, A character sheet should explore how your character has responded to past events. It should explore how he or she's been shaped by life. Spend some time figuring out the major events in your work.


You do not need to have the entire plot of your novel outlined before making a character sheet. However, it might not be a bad idea to have some idea of what has happened to your character before the beginning of your story. Draft a short, personal history for your character. Keep in mind nothing is set in stone at this point. You can always change or adjust things down the road.Interpersonal relationships are also a huge part of your character's history. What kind of relationships has this person had with friends, romantic partners, family members, mentors, and more? Having a skeletal idea of the major relationships in your character's life can help you draft a solid character sheet., Make the first part of your sheet that asks for basic information. Things like name, age, and occupation are a great place to start when writing your own reference sheet.


Start with the basics, such name, age, occupation, and physical description. Push yourself to be detailed about description. What is your character's style? What does his or her voice sound like? What sort of habits and mannerisms does he or her display?Then, focus on your characters basic qualities on a deeper level. What are your character's likes and dislikes? What is his or her marital status? Does he or she have children? Family? What is his or her occupation? Age? Are they introverted or extroverted, a leader or a follower?, As you progress through your sheet, ask more complicated questions. Allow yourself to branch out freely and expand upon existing ideas.


From here, push yourself to go more in depth. What conflicts does your character face? How has he or she reacted to events in the past? How have certain events shape your character? For example, say you're writing about a 58 year-old widower named Robin Leland with two kids. How is he affected by the death of his wife? Does this affect his present relationships with his children or other family members? How did he cope when his wife died? How does he cope now? How long has his wife been gone? What was their relationship like? As you can see, you can focus on one aspect of the past and branch out from there.Talk about interpersonal relationships. All characters have relationships with one another and the world that affect how they move through life. Focus on the major relationships your character has and ask questions specific to that relationship. For example, say Robin has a daughter named Rose who bears a striking resemblance to his late wife. How does this resemblance affect how Robin interacts with Rose? If Rose is, say, in her early teens how does Robin handle talking to her about puberty, dating, etc.? Do these topics make him uncomfortable? If so, why? Is Robin a more conservative man? As you can see, you can learn a lot about your character's personality by focusing on his or her relationships.Talk about underlying motivations. What drives your character and why? What is his or her main motivating factor? All good characters have something they want that drives their story. Talk about wants and needs. What does Robin want and why? Say his wife was killed by a drunk driver. Maybe Robin is taking initiative in his home town to reform drunk driving laws. But go deeper than that. Is Robin ignoring his grief by taking on this crusade? Is this a distraction from allowing himself to mourn for his wife?, As stated, a good character reference sheet is as specific as possible. There may be some questions that are specific to your story. Make sure to include these in your sheet.


If you're creating a fantasy world, this is particularly relevant. If, for example, there are supernatural elements to your story you might need to include what powers your character has.
In some stories, fighting and war is central to the plot. You might need to focus on things like the weaponry and fighting style of your character., If you don't want to form your own sheet, you can find many pre-formatted sheets online. Pre-formatted reference sheets can save you a lot of time and may ask about information you wouldn't have otherwise considered. Choose a reference sheet that works for your project.


If you're writing flash fiction, which is fiction that's generally 1,000 words or less, you may need a shorter reference sheet. It's easy to find reference sheets specifically formatted for works of flash fiction. They generally ask for basic information on physical appearance and personality.Short stories, which have a higher word count, will ask for more information from a character reference sheet. They'll generally ask for some back story and mannerisms in addition to the basics of physical description and character traits.Character sheets for novels and novellas are generally a lot longer as more information is required. They'll go into depth in regards to things like backstory and will also ask for information on religious beliefs, possessions, education, and more., You may feel certain aspects of a character reference sheet feel irrelevant. Some aspects of your characters back story, for example, may not make it into the plot. However, it's better to have more information than you need. Knowing your characters well can make for richer writing. Even if you do not directly reference a particular aspect of your character's backstory or religious beliefs, they will show up in subtle ways in the subtext of your writing.

, However, keep in mind not every part of a reference sheet will be relevant in your story. For example, details about a character's clothing may never make it into the writing. Some sheets may ask for information about a character's weaponry and special skills, in case you're writing a fantasy, but if you're story is realistic this is not applicable to you. While you should strive to fill out a reference sheet as fully as possible, skip sections that have no relevance to the work you're writing., A character reference sheet is important to a work of fiction. It allows you to get to know your character in as much detail as possible. Fill out your reference sheet with as much information as possible. Spend a few days coming back to your character sheet and adding new tidbits and facts about your character as they come to you. Allow yourself to get lost in the world you're creating.

, As you begin the actual writing of your work, you'll need your reference sheet. Keep it on hand so you can consult it later on. It's a good idea to keep your reference sheet near the area where you usually write or work. It might be a good idea to get a specific folder to keep reference sheets so they don't get misplaced.

, Pre-formatted sheets are tempting because they save you some work. However, it's sometimes better to make your own sheet. This way, your reference sheet is specific to your story and will be as useful as possible to you.


Some of the questions pre-formatted referenced sheets are somewhat vague. They often do not contain enough white space for you to really expand in too much detail. You want to make sure you don't oversimplify your characters by using a pre-formatted reference sheet.Certain questions on pre-formatted reference sheets may be irrelevant to your story. For example, if you're writing a screenplay intended to be acted out you only have so much control over what a character looks like. Very specific information about appearance is not really important.There is a lot of flexibility involved in a reference sheet you create yourself. As outlined above, one question branches into another and then another. This allows your story and character to grow organically."

Or, maybe they did and you were playing Plants vs Zombies. Either way, knowing precisely what your professor is looking for is the first step to getting that A.


How many sources should you include? Does he/she want a specific number of each type? Do they have to be at least semi-current?
In discussing your themes, are you just summarizing or critiquing? Some reviews require a thesis, some may not.
Should you offer your opinion on your sources?
Do you need to provide background information, such as definitions or histories, to aid in your audience's understanding?
Is there a page or word requirement?;
, Get as narrow as you possibly can while still having the amount of sources necessary. Studying birth order may lead you to dozens of books; studying birth order of same-sex siblings will make your search for sources much quicker and more manageable.


Get current. If you are writing a review in the humanities, history, or social sciences, you can afford to be less concerned with timing (in fact, changing opinions throughout history may be an aspect of your paper). But if you are writing a literary review for the sciences, say, on treating diabetes, information from 5 years ago could already be obsolete. Sort through current bibliographies or literature reviews in the field to get a sense of what your discipline expects. , Unfortunately, you are not just gathering sources and summing up what they have to say. You should be considering what themes and ideas connect your sources together. Think of these books as your group of friends all arguing on the same topic. What are they all assuming? How are they the same and how are they different?


Read between the lines. You're not necessarily looking for explicit content. Is there an aspect of the field that is missing? Are your sources all prescribing to one specific theory? Do you see trends being revealed? This will help you structure your paper immensely, zeroing in on what will give your paper purpose.

, Now that you've found your focus, it's time to construct a thesis statement. You may be thinking that literature reviews don't have thesis statements. That's both partly true and false: They have theses, but they're quite different. Your thesis statement will not necessarily argue for a position or an opinion; rather, it will argue for a particular perspective on the material.For example, ""Current trends in are A, B, and C,"" or ""The X Theory is assumed by most sources from 1985 on."" Stating something like this begs a few questions, making your review more interesting and meaningful: How will trends change in the future? What if the assumed theories are wrong?
Again, this is not new information. You are not analyzing the material and coming up with your own, fresh perspective on it. You are simply acting like a computer--noting patterns, holes, and assumptions all your sources are taking.

, You can have the best of intentions and a form of prose that convinces the staunchest of skeptics, but if your sources aren't viable, that's it. Finito. Make sure your sources are evaluated on a number of levels.


What are the author's credentials? How are their arguments supported (narratives, statistics, historical findings, etc.)?
Is the author's perspective unbiased and objective? Are they ignoring any data to make their points seem stronger?
How persuasive are they? Do any of their points leave a bit to be desired?
Does their work lead to a greater understanding of the subject?, As with everything, first impressions matter. Your intro should give a quick idea of the topic of your review, be it thematically or by organizational pattern.


Help the reader along by letting them know what kind of ride they're in for. If you are employing a thesis statement, place it toward the end of your introductory paragraph. At the end, your reader should be anticipating getting into the evidence and bulk of your paper.

, Here is the part where you have the most options. You have a number of sources and, since they're all on the same topic, they probably have loads in common. Choose whichever way seems the most natural to you for your specific focus.



Arrange it chronologically. If you are dealing with varying opinions by era or changing trends over time, chronological organization may make the most sense.

Arrange it by publication. This organizational method fares well if each publication has a different stance. If there is a natural progression (radical to conservative, for example) between the sources, this works swimmingly.

Arrange it by trend. If you are noticing patterns in your sources, arranging them by the trends they suggest may be the most obvious structure. Certain sources may, together, suggest one pattern that shifts over time, region, or other variable.

Arrange it thematically. This highly depends on your thesis statement and what sources you have chosen. If you are choosing a focus that is more abstract (""Colonialism is depicted as evil,"" for example), the subsections may be arranged on the different methods employed to put the theme across.

, The closing paragraph needs to wrap up your paper, reiterate what was said in the intro, and discuss what you've drawn so far from your studies.


You may make your conclusion suggestive. Where might the discussion proceed if someone else picked it up where you left off? What are the consequences of the patterns and holes in today's sources?

, Feel free to combine multiple sources into your own words to make an argument. You are using your own words backed up by the works of professionals.


However, use quotes sparingly. The survey nature of the literature review does not allow for in-depth discussion or detailed quotes from the text.Some short ones are fine, sure, but all in all, it should be written by you.

, No, you are not presenting information that sprang up from the wonders of your own mind, but you should still start and end each paragraph with your own words. Your voice should remain front and center.


When paraphrasing a source that is not your own, be sure to represent the author’s information or opinions accurately and in your own words. Then, relate it to the context of your review.
Some professors may require that you evaluate the sources and conclude which pieces add the greatest contribution to the field. If yours is keen on this, determine your take in the introduction and string it throughout your paper.

, Some professors like their papers a certain way. Make sure yours not only meets content guidelines but meets formatting guidelines, too.


Does your instructor require APA formatting? What should your margins be? Headers, footers, footnotes, and page numbers? How do they want your name, headings, and subheadings? How do they want your works cited page?

, It's best to stick to clear and concise writing and it's not always easy to nail that on the first try. Go back over your work and rephrase whatever was left ambiguous or wordy.


With everything said as clear as day, does it flow together? Do you transition well not only from paragraph to paragraph, but from sentence to sentence? Be sure your evidence lines up with the support and your arrangement of sources flows logically.
Eliminate useless jargon or slang. You may have grown an entirely new vocabulary during this endeavor, but your professor has not. Write a paper that can be read by the masses. Don't make it overly esoteric.

, You've got the hard part down. Now all you need to do is go over it for spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Take a break between writing and proofreading--your brain may be a bit saturated. Jump back at it when you're ready.


It's best to have someone else go over your work, too. You may have read it so many times you can no longer see you lapsed into Portuguese absent-mindedly. A different set of eyes can locate mistakes you may not have seen, ask questions you didn't realize were left unaddressed, or seek clarification on the foggier points.

Reality is objective; it exists independently of your desires, wishes, whims, and objectives. Your thinking will be productive to the extent that you are able to accurately perceive and interpret this reality. This requires objectivity–the ability to separate ""what is"" from what you might want to believe or what might be more comforting to believe.;
, A closed mind is cut off from reality. The closed mind thinker can easily be recognized; he or she has a rigid set of opinions and attitudes that are not open to discussion. Such a thinker cannot be reasoned with, since this process involves processing new input. If you feel as if you are talking to a brick wall, you are probably dealing with a closed mind thinker. However, being open minded does not mean that you should not stand by the truth as you know it, or that you must accept every point of view. Truth will withstand questioning; only illusion is threatened by the exchange of thought.

, Most decisions that you face involve a degree of ambiguity, a gray area between the obvious black-or-white alternatives. This is not an argument for the tolerance of uncertainty; it is a recommendation to exercise the power of thought to establish clarity. Ambiguity is often a symptom of sloppy, incomplete, or irrational thinking. When you experience such a state, it is time carefully to examine your premises, your principles, your knowledge, and the efficacy of your thinking process. Knowledge is the progressive retrieval of clarity from uncertainty and confusion.

, When a notion becomes popular, many people will jump on the bandwagon to embrace it. This is usually more a function of conformity than it is of critical thought. Look (and think) before you leap.

,, It may be tempting to jump to conclusions, but you may end up in a hole you didn't see. On the other hand, once you have adequate information, do not hesitate to make judgments based upon it. Judgment is part of the process of thinking, the application of your ability to come to conclusions about reality.

, You can't think straight if everything seems like a matter of life and death to you. The ability to laugh at yourself and to see the humor in situations can often help you maintain clarity of thought and perspective. However, beware of laughter used as a weapon to denigrate what you value or as a psychological defense; such uses require a serious response.

, The world is full of things you don't yet know about. Curiosity is the sign of a mind that is free and open to the wonders of reality, unafraid to face the unknown in order to grasp new knowledge. A curious thinker will explore new manners of looking at things and doing things. Learning can be an adventure of constant and exciting discovery if you cultivate a curious mind.

, At an early age, most of us learn not to believe everything we hear. Imagine how disappointed you would be if you believed all the claims you hear in television advertising! This same principle should be applied to the other information that comes through the media, even what is presented as ""news."" It is meant to be chewed (and sometimes spit out), not swallowed whole! Beware of packaging that hides the truth. Sometimes a big box with a fancy picture on the front bears little relationship to what is hidden inside. Open it up and take a look for yourself!

, Every culture is based upon certain assumptions that go largely unquestioned. Galileo Galilei, the Italian astronomer and mathematician, was brought before the Inquisition because he dared to question the ""truth"" that the Earth was the center of the universe. Even today, members of the Flat Earth Society are said to believe that the world is as flat as a pancake! You cannot assume what is commonly accepted as truth is indeed true. Truth is established by rational thought, not by a public opinion poll or past practice.

, Emotion can sometimes cloud your reason. If you are angry or ecstatic, your thought processes will not work in the same way as when you are in a more dispassionate mood. Beware of situations in which your emotions are being intentionally stimulated (by flattery, fear, or anticipations while you are being asked to make a decision. It may be a strategy to manipulate the outcome.

, The appeal to authority is a favorite advertising gimmick: Hollywood stars, sports figures, and popular culture heroes are used to promote everything from breakfast cereal to underwear and underarm deodorant. We are encouraged to think that if he (or she) says this is great stuff, it must be! The fact that such an authority is getting paid millions of dollars for his or her endorsement might be enough to make you question him as an objective authority.

, Flattery is a time honored method of persuasion. If someone starts with flattery, they may intend to end with your thinking or your money in their pocket. It's not always easy to tell the difference between a sincere compliment and a statement designed to manipulate you.

, Decisions can often be influenced by how you want to appear to yourself or to others. If you are overly concerned about maintaining a given image, you may be doing and saying things that are not really in your own best interest. As you achieve authentic self esteem, behavior based on appearances often loses its appeal.

, When you are in the midst of an important matter, it is easy to lose a balanced view of the situation. It can often be a good practice to ""zoom out"" and view the matter in a larger context. One method to establish perspective: On a scale of one to ten, with one being the death of a blade of grass and ten being worldwide nuclear annihilation, what does your situation rate? Is it truly as critical as it seems at the moment?

, Sometimes how we behave is dictated by hidden rules. If you are not aware of such unspoken rules, you won't have the knowledge you need to make a wise decision. If you are in a familiar situation, chances are you know the rules (for example: don't rock the boat, don't question the boss, don't challenge the professor). If you are in an unfamiliar situation (or a foreign culture), it may pay to be unusually observant and to question those more familiar with the situation. This is not to say that you should be limited by such rules, only that an awareness of them is advisable.

, The impact of verbal communication is less than half of the message you receive from others. The rest of the message is communicated by nonverbal behavior. You will be influenced by both. If someone is acting friendly while painfully squeezing your hand in a handshake, you may have reason to question what he or she are saying! The same would apply if someone is stretched back in his chair and yawning while telling you how interested he is in your ideas. The clearer your perception of the facts of the situation, the clearer your thinking will be.

, Impulsive decision making often results in poor decisions. As the pressure for a decision increases, the temptation to make an impulsive decision also increases. You may rationalize this by thinking that any decision is better than indecision; this is rarely true. Indecision is often the result of poor decision making skills. Impulsiveness only assures that you'll reap the consequences of poor decisions that much sooner!

, Labels and stereotypes are a type of mental shorthand that can facilitate thinking and communication. If you are in need of a four legged piece of furniture designed for sitting, it is easier to ask for a chair and to ignore the many possible variations of design and materials. However, if you are investigating a possible career choice, you should not be satisfied with a stereotypical description of the occupations involved you want to know exactly what it really means to be a police officer, brain surgeon, or financial analyst. Likewise, dealing with people from different backgrounds or cultures is seriously hampered by prejudicial stereotypes that obscure the truth.

, Much of what passes for thinking is really self-talk–sub-vocal conversations you constantly hold with yourself. This self-talk often takes the form of critical judgments and attitudes about yourself. Your thinking skills may be undermined by self talk that conveys negative messages over and over again, reinforcing a negative self image (""I can't do anything right,"" ""I'm just not as smart as everyone else"") or attitudes (""I better not trust anyone,"" ""School is a waste of time""). Unless this kind of negative thinking is challenged and replaced by more positive self talk, it will tend to influence your decisions in an undesirable manner. The fundamental element in such change is the cultivation of self esteem. Counseling is a good solution to this kind of problem.

, Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote: ""foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."" A thoughtful consistency, however, is the hallmark of careful and thorough thinking. Consistency and logic are criteria that should be applied to whatever you consider. Inconsistency is often used to obscure the truth.

, There's an Indian saying that you should walk a mile in another person's moccasins before passing judgment. In other words, you should not judge others until you fully understand their situation. By practicing this type of empathy, you will decrease the likelihood of making snap judgments that you may later regret. You may also find that a little understanding facilitates a deeper insight into other people and their behavior. The deeper your insight into yourself and others, the wiser your decisions will be.

, If you don't have the facts straight, your decisions are likely to be skewed. In important matters, you should try to obtain firsthand access to the relevant facts. If you are trying to make a career decision and want to know something about your occupational skills, it is better to take an aptitude test than to ask your buddies what they think ""you're good at."" Likewise, it is better to find out the nature of work for a given occupation, based on accepted references and worker interviews, than to rely on stereotypes that may be full of partial truths and significant omissions. Check the reliability of your information. Did it come from a reliable source? Can you find another source that confirms your information? If you can answer yes to these questions, you can be more confident about the facts you use as a basis for your decisions.

, Information may be reliable but not valid. Validity has to do with the relevance of the information to the context in which it is being applied. It may be a reliable fact that when you strike a match, fire will result–unless you are underwater or in the vacuum of outer space! Context is important!

, When it comes to conversation, what you hear is what you get. Listening is another skill we tend to take for granted, but it is rarely utilized as effectively as we think. How many times have you been in the middle of a conversation and suddenly realized that the other person had asked you a question that you didn't even hear? How often are you so preoccupied with your own thoughts in class that you tune out the instructor? It happens to us all, which illustrates the difficulty of practicing this seemingly simple skill. The better you listen, the more correct information you will obtain; the more correct information you have, the better decisions you will make.

, There are entire philosophy books devoted to logic and the manner in which it can be distorted. Stereotypes are often based on illogical thinking, applying specific characteristics in a universal manner without verifiable basis in fact, or assuming a causal connection between two unrelated events. Advertising commonly encourages illogical associations: beef is touted as ""food for real people"" (what do ""unreal"" people eat?), and white teeth or the right deodorant seem to guarantee a bevy of babes (or hunks) at your feet (Where's the Crest?). It may seem obvious that such claims are ridiculous, but someone is paying big bucks for these commercials for a reason!

, All of us have hunches about things at one time or another. These hunches are often the result of information that registers at a level other than conscious awareness. It's like when you sense someone staring at you, only to look up and find it is true. There was no logical reason to believe someone was looking it you, but it somehow registered nevertheless. Intuition cannot take the place of logical thought, but it can be developed as a valuable supplement. By trying to be more aware of your intuitions, you can increase your sensitivity to this kind of information. As you learn to test it and to trust it, it can enhance your decision making skills.

Don't critique the work without first being asked to.,
Understand what kind of critique the writer expects.,
Be well-read, preferably in the genre of the writing.,
Be able to write reasonably well yourself.,
Read the manuscript over carefully.",How to Critique Creative Writing1," The writers who are most open to having their work read and evaluated by others are those who ask for it. Usually, writers who can't handle feedback aren't willing to put their work out for critiquing.;
, Discuss what kind of feedback the writer is looking for before you review the manuscript. If the writer tells you he or she has had trouble writing a particular passage within the manuscript, focus your efforts on that passage. If the writer is looking for help with spelling, punctuation, and grammar, provide that to the best of your ability.


If the writer comes across solely as looking for an ego stroke, you may want to politely decline the request to do a critique.

, Your critique will be more effective if you have a background in the genre or area of the writing, such as being an avid reader of science fiction if asked to critique someone's science fiction manuscript. If you aren't well read a given genre, you may still be able to critique the work for the overall quality of the writing, if that's what the writer looking to be critiqued is asking you for.

, Being well-read and being able to write well usually go hand-in-hand, but not automatically. If you regularly confuse words such as ""tenant"" and ""tenet,"" write incomplete sentences without good reason, and punctuate irregularly, you're probably not the best candidate to critique someone else's writing.


However, if you do write well, recognize that your style of writing is not necessary the only or best way to write a given story or article. You should be familiar with several writing styles and points of view in order to critique creative writing effectively.

, Reading a manuscript to critique it requires reading in more detail and depth than reading for pleasure. You're reading the text for content, consistency, grammar, punctuation, and style. Read the text carefully, making notes as you go, either in the margins of the manuscript or on a separate piece of paper. Re-read any difficult passages and, if you have time, the entire manuscript.


If you're reading the manuscript in a word processing document, you can use the word processing program's comments feature to make comments.
If you run into a word you don't understand, look it up, either in a hard-copy dictionary or online. Also look up any historical or scientific information included in the manuscript that you have questions about.

Address your critique to the manuscript, not to the writer.,
Begin with a summary of what you got from the work.,
Tell the author what worked, and why.,
Tell the author what didn't work, why, and suggest how to fix it.,
Give the author what he or she needs to refer to when incorporating your feedback.",How to Critique Creative Writing2," Comments within the critique should be in the nature of either ""This section needs �"" or ""I didn't understand this sentence,"" not ""You need to.""

, State what you thought the story was about and what the author was trying to accomplish with it. This lets the writer know how well he or she was able to communicate the story's key themes to you.

, Identify what parts of the writing and what you liked about them. Point out the author's strengths, with specific examples, such as ""I liked the details in your characters, such as giving your heroine the same middle name as her mother, in addition to describing her as being a dead ringer for her mother."" Also point out things the author got ""right"" that seem to be outside his or her strong areas.

, As with describing the strengths, provide specifics in a positive way. Don't say, ""This word 'said' in this passage is weak,"" without an explanation; instead, say, ""The word 'said' in this passage is weak because you've established that the character is frightened. You might want to use the word 'quavered' instead.""


If you're not comfortable with the genre or writing style, acknowledge it in those points where your discomforts might have an impact on your view of the work. That will let the writer know whether to dismiss your comments or to look for a critique from another person more familiar with the genre or writing style.

, The more complete your feedback, and the more effectively you present it to the writer, the easier and more likely he or she will be to incorporate it into future revisions. How you present it depends on whether you are providing feedback orally, in writing, or electronically.


If you're critiquing the manuscript orally, organize the points you want to make and be sure to cover them thoroughly. Point to specific places in the manuscript where possible and provide the writer with a copy of your notes.
If you're critiquing the manuscript in writing (hard copy), review your critique for clarity and consistency. Give the writer a copy of the manuscript with your markup and comments and a separate feedback document.
If you're critiquing the manuscript electronically, you can do a ""Save As"" on the marked-up manuscript, accept the marked-up changes on the new copy, and then save it with a different but related name from the original manuscript, such as ""ManuscriptCleanCopy."" If you're including comments about the manuscript in the email, cut and paste sections of the manuscript into the email where appropriate, using a different text color or font if sending the email in rich text format.

Pull your project together.",How to Create a Successful Project (for School)," It's always best to begin an assignment as soon as you get it. Your teacher has given you a long time to do it for reason; it's going to take that much time to do it. Begin by making a plan early, so you have time to complete everything you need to do. That way, you won't be working the night before to finish the project;
, The assignment will give you detailed instructions about what you need to do. Block out distractions and really read what you are required to do. If the teacher hasn't already done it, break the project down into components so you understand exactly what you're teacher is asking you to do.For instance, maybe your assignment is ""Create a visual representation of the Civil War. You can pick one battle, one idea, one speech, a defining moment, or focus on the war as a whole. Make sure to include relevant dates and people in your representation.""
You can break this down into parts: 1) Make something visual about the Civil War. 2) Choose a focus. 3) Include relevant dates. 4) Include relevant people.

, Brainstorming is a way to get your ideas on paper. Basically, you spend time writing out what you want to do and connecting ideas to help get your creative juices flowing. It can help you focus on what you want to do, as well as come up with things you hadn't thought of. You can use one of several techniques to brainstorm.Try freewriting. Take out a sheet of paper. On the top, write down something such as ""Civil War Project."" Start writing about the project. Don't stop yourself or censor ideas. Just let them come as they will. For instance, maybe you could start out by writing ""For me, one of the defining points of the Civil War was the Gettysburg Address. It really made clear that the fight was about human equality. But now I must make that visual. Four-score and seven years ago... I could take individual lines, maybe? Connect ideas to defining parts of the war...""Try a map. Start with a circle in the middle of the paper with ""Civil War Project"" written in the middle of it. Draw a line from the center circle to another circle, and add a fact or idea. Just keep associating ideas together, not really thinking too deeply about it. As you go, group like ideas near each other. When you're done, look at where the largest groupings are, and let that guide your focus., While it may be tempting to pick a broad topic, such as the whole Civil War, it will actually be easier if you narrow that down. That way, you won't get bogged down in as many details.The best way to pick a topic is to choose what you focused on in your brainstorming. For instance, maybe you think the Gettysburg Address is a good focal point.However, if your topic is still too broad, such as ""battles in the Civil War,"" try picking one aspect within that topic. You could choose one battle you think is defining, or a particular aspect of the battles, such as battle fatigue in soldiers., If it's a visual project, as the example has been throughout this article, think about the best way to represent your ideas. If you are doing several important events, maybe a visual timeline would work best. If you are working on something that is geographically based, such as battles, maybe a map with added details would be better. Play to what your project needs.


You can even think about doing something 3-dimensional instead of 2-dimensional. Maybe you could make a 3-D map of the battles, depicting the movement of troops.
Alternatively, you could try sculpting out of papier-mâché. Maybe you could sculpt Abraham Lincoln and use scripts coming off his body to tell your story.

, Once you've decided on how you want to make your project, make a sketch of your project. Decide what will go where, and how you will represent each part. Also, decide what information you'll need to complete your project, as that will help you with your research. Make an outline of the information you need to find.To make an outline, start with the main topic you are covering. Maybe you're doing the Gettysburg Address. Write that at the top.
Next, break down your project into sub-headings. Maybe your subheadings could be ""Speech Background,"" ""Location of Speech,"" and ""Impact of Speech.""
Under your subheadings, jot down the basic ideas of what you'll need. For instance, under ""Speech Background,"" you might need the date, what battle preceded the speech, and the reason Lincoln gave the speech.

, Before you begin, list down all the materials you'll need, from research materials to art supplies. Group them by where you can find them, such as home, the library, and the store.

, Make subgoals within your project. That is, divide your project into manageable chunks, such as ""getting materials together,"" ""researching the speech,"" ""writing out the text for the project,"" ""painting the parts,"" and ""putting the project together.""Assign time for each chunk, including deadlines. Work from the final deadline backward. For instance, if you have 4 weeks to complete your project, say you'll spend the last week painting and putting the project together. The week before that, write out the text for your project. The week before that, research your project. In the first week, make your plan, and get your materials together.If needed, divide your project further. For instance, ""researching the speech"" may need to be divided into several days' worth of work.

, Spend some time gathering what you need from various places. Ask your parents to take you where you need to go if you can't drive yourself. Put it all where you will work on your project.

, Decide what kind of resources would be most appropriate for your project. For a historical project for instance, books and scholarly articles are most appropriate. You might also look into newspaper articles, which give you a sense of what was going on at the time, as well as personal correspondence from famous people., If you're doing an in-depth college project, you'll need more sources than if you're doing a basic junior high project. For a college project, you may need eight to ten sources or more, while for a junior high project, you may only need one or two books., Your librarian can guide you to the best databases for your materials. For instance, you can use the main book catalog to find books. However, you might need to use article databases to find scholarly articles, which is a different screen altogether.


When using an article database, narrow the search engine to only relevant databases. For instance, platforms such as EBSCOhost carry a wide range of smaller databases, and you can narrow your search down to one relevant to your topic, such as a database focused on history.You can also research the archives of particular newspapers. While some newspapers offer free access to their archives, others might require you to pay., Once you've gathered a bunch of materials together, you need to sort through them to decide what's actually relevant. Sometimes an article or book that sounds relevant may not be as helpful as you thought.

, Make notes related to your topic. Be as detailed as you can, but try to put it in your own words as you write it down. As you make notes, make sure you are including the biographical information about the book.You'll need the author's full name, the title of the book, the publisher, the edition, the date it was published, the city it was published in, the title and author of individual articles in the book if it has them, and the page number where you found the information.
For articles, you'll need the author's full name, the title of the article and the journal, the volume and issue (if it has them), the page numbers of the article, the page number you found it, and the digital online identifier number (doi), which is usually on the description page in the catalog., Your project will have some text on it to represent your ideas. On your sketch, identify where the text will go. Use your research to write your text, though put it in your own words. In addition, make sure you are citing your sources, which means you are saying where you got the information.Your teacher should tell you how should cite your sources or what guidelines you should be using.
If you don't know how to write according to those guidelines, try an online resource such as Purdue's Online Writing Lab. It covers the basics of the major citation styles., If you're doing an artistic project, begin painting or drawing the pieces. If you're using something such as papier-mâché, start building your sculpture. If you're designing it on the computer, start making your art or gathering images to use.

, Write or type out your text. Put the finishing touches on the visual parts. Glue or tape the project together as needed, so it makes one cohesive whole. Use what you sketched earlier to pull your project together into your final draft.Before you turn it in, make sure you covered everything your teacher asked you to.
If you skipped something, see if you can add it in, even if it's last minute.

Be ready for participation if you are in a Socratic method.",How to Deal With Lectures," If you've got lectures at 5pm and you had three hours sleep the night before, the chances of you being alert are very low. Take a nap before the lecture if needs be but try to stick to a good sleeping schedule all through term.;
, Eat well and choose healthy, nutritious food for the majority of your snacks as well as meals. Eat slow-burning foods to give you sustained energy through a lecture; use energy bars if needed.

, This might help to wake you up and keep you alert for the duration of the lecture.

, This can be a good method for creating the focus that you might not otherwise have. Spend time highlighting parts that you find are particularly relevant or should be remembered/looked up after the lecture. This type of focus will help the lecture to pass quickly.

, This means listening attentively and having done your homework beforehand.

Define the subject of study.,
Decide between prospective and retrospective research.,
Narrow down your research goal.,
Apply for ethical approval.,
Plan for a long-term study.,
Design your research strategy in detail.,
Recruit participants if necessary.",How to Do a Case Study1," A case study focuses on a single individual, a small group of people, or occasionally a single event. You'll be conducting qualitative research to find specific details and descriptions of how your subject is affected.


For example, a medical case study might study how a single patient is affected by an injury. A psychology case study might study a small group of people in an experimental form of therapy.
Case studies are not designed for large group studies or statistical analysis.;
, Prospective case studies perform new studies of their own, involving individuals or small groups. Retrospective case studies examine a small number of past cases related to the subject of study, and do not require new involvement with the subject of these cases.


A case study may or may not include both types of research.

, This may be given to you in advance by a professor or employer, or you may develop it on your own. Here are the main types of case studies, organized by goal:Illustrative case studies describe an unfamiliar situation in order to help people understand it. For instance, a case study of a person with depression, designed to help communicate the subjective experience of depression to therapist trainees.

Exploratory case studies are preliminary projects to help guide a future, larger-scale project. They aim to identify research questions and possible research approaches. For example, a case study of three school tutoring programs would describe the pros and cons of each approach, and give tentative recommendations on how a new tutoring program could be organized.

Critical instance case studies focus on a unique cases, without a generalized purpose. Examples include a descriptive study of a patient with a rare condition, or a study of a specific case to determine whether a broadly applied ""universal"" theory is actually applicable or useful in all cases.

, Almost all case studies are required by law to obtain ethical approval before they can begin. Contact your institution or department and propose your case study to the people in charge of ethics oversight. You may be asked to prove that the case study does no harm to its participants.


Follow this step even if you are conducting a retrospective case study. In some cases, publishing a new interpretation can cause harm to the participants in the original study.

, Most academic case studies last at least 3–6 months, and many of them continue for years. You may be limited by your research funding or the length of your degree program, but you should allow a few weeks to conduct the study at the very least.

, Create an outline describing how you will gather data and answer your research questions. The exact approach is up to you, but these tips may help:


Create four or five bullet points that you intend to answer, if possible, in the study. Consider perspectives on approaching the question and the related bullet points.
Choose at least two, and preferably more, of these data sources: report collection, internet research, library research, interviewing research subjects, interviewing experts, other fieldwork, and mapping concepts or typologies.
Design interview questions that will lead to in-depth answers and continued conversations related to your research goals.

, You may have a specific individual in mind, or you may need to recruit people from a broader pool who satisfy your research criteria. Make your research methods and time frame extremely clear to the potential participants. Unclear communication could be a breach of ethics, or could cause a participant to walk out partway through the study, wasting a great deal of time.


Since you aren't conducting a statistical analysis, you do not need to recruit a diverse cross-section of society. You should be aware of any biases in your small sample, and make them clear in your report, but they do not invalidate your research.

"
"
Perform background research.,
Learn how to conduct obtrusive observation.,
Take notes.,
Conduct interviews.,
Stay rigorous.,
Collect all of your data and analyze it.,
Write your final case study report.",How to Do a Case Study2," If studying people, research information in their past that may be relevant, possibly including medical history, family history, or history of an organization. A good background knowledge of the research topic and similar case studies could help guide your own research as well, especially if you are writing a critical interest case study.


Any case study, but especially case studies with a retrospective component, will benefit from basic academic research strategies.

, In a case study involving human participants, ethics guidelines do not typically allow you to ""spy"" on the participants. You must practice obtrusive observation, where the participants are aware of your presence. Unlike a quantitative study, you may talk with the participants, make them feel comfortable, and include yourself in activities. Some researchers do attempt to maintain a distance, but be aware that your presence will affect the behavior of the participants regardless of the relationship you form with them.


Establishing trust with participants can result in less inhibited behavior. Observing people in their home, workplaces, or other ""natural"" environments may be more effective than bringing them to a laboratory or office.
Having subjects fill out a questionnaire is a common example of obtrusive research. Subjects know they are being studied, so their behavior will change, but this is a quick and sometimes the only way to gain certain information.

, Extensive notes during observation will be vital when you are compiling your final report. In some case studies, it may be appropriate to ask the participant to record experiences in a diary.

, Depending on the total length of your case study, you might hold an interview weekly, once every month or two, or just once or twice a year. Begin with the interview questions you prepared in the planning phase, then iterate to dig deeper into the topic:Describe experience — ask the participant what it's like to go through the experience you're studying, or be a part of the system you're studying.

Describe meaning — ask the participant what the experience means to them, or what ""life lessons"" they take from it. Ask what mental and emotional associations they have with the subject of your study, whether it's a medical condition, an event, or another topic.

Focus – in later interviews, prepare questions that fill gaps in your knowledge, or that are particularly relevant to the development of your research questions and theories over the course of the study.

, A case study may feel less data-driven than a medical trial or a scientific experiment, but attention to rigor and valid methodology remains vital. If you find yourself drawn to studying a participant on one extreme end of the spectrum, set aside time to observe a more ""typical"" participant as well.When reviewing your notes, question your chain of logic and discard possible conclusions that do not have detailed observation backing them up. Any sources you cite should be thoroughly checked for reliability.

, After reading and referring back to your original bullet points, you may find that the data reacts in a surprising manner. You need to pull your information together and focus it before writing case studies, especially if your research was performed in intervals across months or years.


If you are working with more than one person you will want to assign sections for completion together to make sure your case study will flow. For example, one person may be in charge of making charts of the data you gathered, while other people will each write an analysis of one of your bullet points you are trying to answer.

, Based on the research questions you designed and the type of case study you conducted, this may be a descriptive report, an analytic argument grounded in a specific case, or a suggested direction for further research or projects. Include your most relevant observations and interviews in the case study itself, and consider attaching additional data (such as full interviews) as an appendix for readers to refer to.


If writing a case study for a non-academic audience, consider using a narrative form, describing the events that occurred during your case study in chronological order. Minimize your use of jargon.

Ask permission from a client.,
Outline the story.,
Keep the study readable and powerful.,
Include actual numbers.,
Solicit quotes or write them yourself.,
Add images.,
Spread the word.",How to Do a Case Study3," A marketing case study describes a ""success story"" between a business and a client. Ideally, the client has recently interacted with your business, and is enthusiastic about contributing a positive message. Choose a client close to your target audience, if possible.Request high-level involvement from the client's side for best results.Even if the client only wants to vet the materials you send them, make sure the person involved is high up in the organization, and knowledgeable about the company–client relationship.

, A typical marketing case study begins by describing the client's problems and background. It then rapidly moves on to describe how your company strategically approached these problems, and succeeded in fixing them to a high standard. Finish by describing how you can apply similar solutions across the industry. The entire case study should divide into about three to five sections.Collaboration with the client is especially helpful here, so you make sure to include the points that left the most impact and biggest impression.
If your target audience wouldn't immediately identify with your client's problem, start with a more general intro describing that type of problem in the industry., Use bold text and headers to divide the case study into easy-to-read sections. Start each section with short, action sentences and strong verbs., Use numeric examples that demonstrate how effective your solutions were. Make this as clear as possible, using actual numbers instead of (or in addition to) percentages. For example, an HR department could show impressive retention numbers following a process change, while a marketing team could demonstrate past sales boosts from its service.


Charts and graphs can be great visual tools, but label these with large letters that make the positive meaning obvious to people who aren't used to reading raw data., You'll definitely want to quote positive recommendations from your client. Often, however, the person writing these will not have a marketing background. Ask the client whether you can write the statements for them, although of course the client will sign off on these before publication.These are typically brief quotes just one or two sentences long, describing your service in a positive light.

, Include photos and other images to make your case study more attractive. One tactic that can work well is to solicit photographs from the client. An amateur digital photograph of the smiling client team can add a genuine touch., Make your marketing case study widely available. Try using Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Business Hub, or Drupal.Send copies of the study to the client you collaborated with as well, along with a certificate thanking them for their involvement.

Write a list of objectives.,
Determine the type of questions your survey will use.,
Decide on a method of administration.,
Word questions effectively.,
Organize the survey questionnaire in a logical way.,
Design the questionnaire so that it is easy to read and navigate through.,
Provide respondents with the information they will need in order to effectively comply with the survey.,
Revise the questionnaire as necessary.",How to Develop a Research Questionnaire," This should outline the kind of data you want to collect, as it will serve as the basis for choosing your questions. For example, you may want to know how customers feel about your new product, in which case your objectives may be to gauge customer responses to the product's price range, ease of use, durability and concept.;
, There are 2 basic question formats:


Fixed-response/structured. Fixed-response questions provide research questionnaire respondents with a specified set of possible answers, and require respondents to choose from those options. Use fixed-response questions when you have a clear-cut way to define and categorize data that the answers provide and when you are not looking for unique or original information from those you are surveying. Examples of structured question formats include multiple choice, ranking, yes/no and rating scale.
Open-ended/non-structured. Non-structured questions are good for collecting fresh, individual ideas from respondents. However, it can be harder to systematically analyze, organize and categorize data collected from open-ended questions. Any question that does not limit the scope of the answer is open-ended.

, You may opt to use face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, web-based surveys or written questionnaires.

, Keep the following in mind:


Comprehension. Use simple language and keep sentences as brief and concise as possible. Be sure to cover the what, where, who, when and why so that respondents are not lacking for pertinent information regarding their input.
Answerability. Respondents should be able to provide accurate answers without having to do research. For example, people may not be able to tell you exactly how much money they spend eating out in an entire year, but they should be able to estimate what they spend eating out over the course of a week.
Double-barreled questions. Make sure your survey questions ask only 1 thing at a time. For example, rather than ask respondents if they prefer to exercise in the evening or after eating, break the question into 2 separate questions, 1 specific to exercising in the evening and the other specific to exercising after eating.
Make sure response options don't overlap. For example, multiple choice questions should never provide for the same number in 2 different range options (i.e. ""between 10 and 30"" or ""between 20 and 40"").

,


If your research questionnaire covers a range of topics, then group the questions into subjects.
Downplay sensitive questions by grouping them with neutral questions, and by placing them toward the end of the survey, after a rapport has been established.

,


Use a large, clear font.
Space questions so that it is easy to see where 1 stops and the next begins. Be sure to provide ample answer space, if you are using open-ended questions.
Answer space should be right below the question. Avoid asking a question on 1 page, then requiring the respondent to flip the page in order to provide an answer.
Use page numbers.

, In order to achieve the best results, questionnaire design should amply prepare respondents in the following ways:


Explain the purpose of the survey questionnaire. When people understand the reasons behind a line of questioning, they are more likely to volunteer accurate personal information.
Give clear instructions for completing the questions. Explain the question format (i.e. multiple choice, rating scale, etc.) and provide an example for how to appropriately answer the question. Additional instructions may be to read the questions all the way through before answering and/or to guess on an unknown question, rather than leave it blank.
Tell respondents how many questions the research questionnaire includes, and give an estimated time frame for completion.

, Each time you administer the survey, analyze the results so that you can make changes that will improve the survey's efficacy.


If you find that certain questions are consistently being skipped, then those questions may need to be reworded for clarity.
If respondents are unable to provide full answers due to space restraints, you can change the layout.
If simple yes/no answers aren't providing you with the range of data you desire, then you may want to change to a multiple choice format.

Include a deadline.",How to Develop a Questionnaire for Research," What kind of information do you want to gather with your questionnaire? What is your main objective? Is a questionnaire the best way to go about collecting this information?


Come up with a research question.It can be one question or several, but this should be the focal point of your questionnaire.
Develop one or several hypotheses that you want to test. The questions that you include on your questionnaire should be aimed at systematically testing these hypotheses.;
, Depending on the information you wish to gather, there are several possible types of questions to include on your questionnaire, each with unique pros and cons. Here are the types of commonly used questions on a questionnaire:Dichotomous question: this is a question that will generally be a “yes/no” question, but may also be an “agree/disagree” question. It is the quickest and simplest question to analyze, but is not a highly sensitive measure.
Open-ended questions: these questions allow the respondent to respond in their own words. They can be useful for gaining insight into the feelings of the respondent, but can be a challenge when it comes to analysis of data. It is recommended to use open-ended questions to address the issue of “why.”Multiple choice questions: these questions consist of three or more mutually-exclusive categories and ask for a single answer or several answers.Multiple choice questions allow for easy analysis of results, but may not give the respondent the answer they want.
Rank-order (or ordinal) scale questions: this type of question asks your respondent to rank items or choose items in a particular order from a set. For example, it might ask your respondents to order five things from least to most important. These types of questions forces discrimination among alternatives, but does not address the issue of why the respondent made these discriminations.Rating scale questions: these questions allow the respondent to assess a particular issue based on a given dimension. You can provide a scale that gives an equal number of positive and negative choices, for example, ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree.”These questions are very flexible, but also do not answer the question “why.”, The questions that you develop for your questionnaire should be clear, concise, and direct.This will ensure that you get the best possible answers from your respondents.


Write questions that are succinct and simple. You should not be writing complex statements or using technical jargon, as it will only confuse your respondents and lead to incorrect responses.Ask only one question at a time.This will help avoid confusion
Beware of asking for private or “sensitive” information.This can be something as simple as age or weight, or something as complex as past sexual history.

Asking questions such as these usually require you to anonymize or encrypt the demographic data you collect.


Determine if you will include an answer such as “I don’t know” or “Not applicable to me.” While these can give your respondents a way of not answering certain questions, providing these options can also lead to missing data, which can be problematic during data analysis.
Put the most important questions at the beginning of your questionnaire.This can help you gather important data even if you sense that your respondents may be becoming distracted by the end of the questionnaire.

, Keep your questionnaire as short as possible. More people will be likely to answer a shorter questionnaire, so make sure you keep it as concise as possible while still collecting the necessary information.If you can make a questionnaire that only requires 5 questions, do it.


Only include questions that are directly useful to your research question.A questionnaire is not an opportunity to collect all kinds of information about your respondents.
Avoid asking redundant questions. This will frustrate those who are taking your questionnaire.

, Is there a certain group of people who you want to target with your questionnaire? If so, it is best to determine this before you begin to distribute your questionnaire.Consider if you want your questionnaire to collect information from both men and women. Some studies will only survey one sex.
Determine whether you want your survey to collect information from both children and adults. Many surveys only target certain age ranges for which the questions are applicable.

Consider including a range of ages in your target demographic. For example, you can consider young adult to be 18-29 years old, adults to be 30-54 years old, and mature adults to be 55+. Providing the an age range will help you get more respondents than limiting yourself to a specific age.


Consider what else would make a person a target for your questionnaire. Do they need to drive a car? Do they need to have health insurance? Do they need to have a child under 3? Make sure you are very clear about this before you distribute your questionnaire.

, Make your plan to protect respondents’ privacy before you begin writing your survey. This is a very important part of many research projects.


Consider an anonymous questionnaire. You may not want to ask for names on your questionnaire. This is one step you can take to prevent privacy, however it is often possible to figure out a respondent’s identity using other demographic information (such as age, physical features, or zipcode).
Consider de-identifying the identity of your respondents. Give each questionnaire (and thus, each respondent) a unique number or word, and only refer to them using that new identifier. Shred any personal information that can be used to determine identity.
Remember that you do not need to collect much demographic information to be able to identify someone. People may be wary to provide this information, so you may get more respondents by asking less demographic questions (if it is possible for your questionnaire).
Make sure you destroy all identifying information after your study is complete., Your introduction should explain who you are, and what your credentials are. You should clarify if you are working alone or as a part of a team. Include the name of the academic institution or company for whom you are collecting data. Here are some examples:


My name is Jack Smith and I am one of the creators of this questionnaire. I am part of the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan, where I am focusing in developing cognition in infants.
I’m Kelly Smith, a 3rd year undergraduate student at the University of New Mexico. This questionnaire is part of my final exam in statistics.
My name is Steve Johnson, and I’m a marketing analyst for The Best Company. I’ve been working on questionnaire development to determine attitudes surrounding drug use in Canada for several years.

, No long explanation is needed; instead, a few concise sentences will do the trick. Here are some examples:


I am collecting data regarding the attitudes surrounding gun control. This information is being collected for my Anthropology 101 class at the University of Maryland.
This questionnaire will ask you 15 questions about your eating and exercise habits. We are attempting to make a correlation between healthy eating, frequency of exercise, and incidence of cancer in mature adults.
This questionnaire will ask you about your recent experiences with international air travel. There will be three sections of questions that will ask you to recount your recent trips and your feelings surrounding these trips, as well as your travel plans for the future. We are looking to understand how a person’s feelings surrounding air travel impact their future plans.

, Are you collecting these data for a class project, or for a publication? Are these data to be used for market research? Depending on what you intend to do with the data you collect from your questionnaire, there may be different requirements that you need to pay attention to before distributing your survey.


Beware that if you are collecting information for a university or for publication, you may need to check in with your institution’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) for permission before beginning. Most research universities have a dedicated IRB staff, and their information can usually be found on the school’s website.
Remember that transparency is best. It is important to be honest about what will happen with the data you collect.
Include an informed consent for if necessary. Note that you cannot guarantee confidentiality, but you will make all reasonable attempts to ensure that you protect their information., Before someone sits down to take your questionnaire, it may be helpful for them to know whether the questionnaire will take them 10 minutes or 2 hours. Providing this information at the onset of your questionnaire is more likely to get you more complete questionnaires in the end.


Time yourself taking the survey. Then consider that it will take some people longer than you, and some people less time than you.
Provide a time range instead of a specific time. For example, it’s better to say that a survey will take between 15 and 30 minutes than to say it will take 15 minutes and have some respondents quit halfway through.
Use this as a reason to keep your survey concise! You will feel much better asking people to take a 20 minute survey than you will asking them to take a 3 hour one.

, An incentive is anything that you can offer as a reward at the end of the questionnaire. Incentives can be many types of things: they can be monetary, desired prizes, gift certificates, candy, etc. There are both pros and cons to offering incentives.


Incentives can attract the wrong kind of respondent. You don’t want to incorporate responses from people who rush through your questionnaire just to get the reward at the end. This is a danger of offering an incentive.Incentives can encourage people to respond to your survey who might not have responded without a reward. This is a situation in which incentives can help you reach your target number of respondents.Consider the strategy used by SurveyMonkey. Instead of directly paying respondents to take their surveys, they offer 50 cents to the charity of their choice when a respondent fills out a survey. They feel that this lessens the chances that a respondent will fill out a questionnaire out of pure self-interest.Consider entering each respondent in to a drawing for a prize if they complete the questionnaire. You can offer a 25$ gift card to a restaurant, or a new iPod, or a ticket to a movie. This makes it less tempting just to respond to your questionnaire for the incentive alone, but still offers the chance of a pleasant reward.

,


Always proof read. Check for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors.
Include a title. This is a good way for your respondents to understand the focus of the survey as quickly as possible.
Thank your respondents. Thank them for taking the time and effort to complete your survey.

, Ask some people you know to take your questionnaire (they will not be included in any results stemming from this questionnaire), and be prepared to revise it if necessary.Plan to include 5-10 people in the pilot testing of your questionnaire.Get their feedback on your questionnaire by asking the following questions:


Was the questionnaire easy to understand? Were there any questions that confused you?
Was the questionnaire easy to access? (Especially important if your questionnaire is online).
Do you feel the questionnaire was worth your time?
Were you comfortable answering the questions asked?
Are there any improvements you would make to the questionnaire?

, You need to determine what is the best way to disseminate your questionnaire.There are several common ways to distribute questionnaires:Use an online site, such as SurveyMonkey.com. This site allows you to write your own questionnaire with their survey builder, and provides additional options such as the option to buy a target audience and use their analytics to analyze your data.Consider using the mail. If you mail your survey, always make sure you include a self-addressed stamped envelope so that the respondent can easily mail their responses back. Make sure that your questionnaire will fit inside a standard business envelope.
Conduct face-to-face interviews. This can be a good way to ensure that you are reaching your target demographic and can reduce missing information in your questionnaires, as it is more difficult for a respondent to avoid answering a question when you ask it directly.
Try using the telephone. While this can be a more time-effective way to collect your data, it can be difficult to get people to respond to telephone questionnaires.

, Ask your respondents to have the questionnaire completed and returned to you by a certain date to ensure that you have enough time to analyze the results.


Make your deadline reasonable. Giving respondents up to 2 weeks to answer should be more than sufficient. Anything longer and you risk your respondents forgetting about your questionnaire.
Consider providing a reminder. A week before the deadline is a good time to provide a gentle reminder about returning the questionnaire. Include a replacement of the questionnaire in case it has been misplaced by your respondent."

You can research to explore a topic you're unfamiliar with, as well as to provide evidence for claims you're making in a presentation or research essay. Research can be collected by gathering your own data, reading online, or using previous research projects to guide your efforts.



Exploratory research is done when you read online, getting the quickest summary of the topic at hand. Say you were researching the general topic of ""obesity"" in the United States. To explore the topic, you might start with a Google search, read the wikipedia page, and find other web entries to get yourself familiar with the topic. What's the issue with obesity in the US? What arguments are being made about it? What other subjects are related to this topic? Health and fitness? Fast-food? What are you interested in researching further? In this kind of research, you're looking for facts.







Supportive research occurs when you find those arguments in academic sources. What are academic sources? Anything that has been published, be it magazines, books, or the online database version of academic research journals. In this kind of research, you're looking for more than facts. You're looking for opinions and arguments of different sorts, related to your topic, that you can use to form an opinion and argument of your own.





;
, Once you've explored a topic somewhat, there's still a lot you might not know, and this is what you can use to guide your research by forming a research question. Start asking lots of questions and writing them down: When people refer to the ""obesity epidemic,"" what are they referring to exactly? When did it start? Where? What are some possible reasons that it may exist?

, Within every topic there is an ""issue,"" at stake. There's something debatable, something controversial about the topic, and that's what you want to spend time researching. The smaller, narrower, and more specific the topic, the better.


The topic of obesity in the US might be too large. Look at your own community, state, or region. What are the statistics? How does it compare to other regions? What might account for this? Why? If you're asking and answering these questions, you're well on your way to a solid research topic.
Issues of fact don't make good research topics, because there's nothing to research, there's just a fact to look up. A good research question, for instance, wouldn't be ""How many people have died from obesity?"" but ""How does obesity kill?""

, After you've been exploring your topic online and possibly in print, you need to come up with a solid research question to help guide your supportive research.""What policies and attitudes resulted in the sudden rise in obesity in Indiana during the mid-90s?"" would be an excellent research topic. It's specific in terms of location, controversy, and topic. It's something you can prove.

, We all have strong opinions about topics, especially controversial ones. It can be tempting to only seek out sources that will validate your opinion, or that will oversimplify the topic, rather than complicate it. As you do your research, seek out a variety of opinions, arguments, and positions, and allow yourself to assemble the strongest possible research, not just the arguments you want to hear.

, Depending on your topic, the Internet may be a wealth of information or a swampy region of opinions and comment streams. It's got the most current information available instantly, but it can also be difficult to distinguish between good sources and bad sources.


Government websites (ones that end in .gov) are good sources of data and definitions. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention site, for instance, has lots of good data about obesity in the US, how the disease affects specific populations, and a breakdown of obesity by region.
Non-profits (websites that end in .org) can also be good sources of opinions. Generally, organizations will have an ""agenda"" and will present a variety of information that backs up their position. This can be good in aiding your research, but can also feature a fair amount of spin on the issues.
Blogs and message boards can be good for getting a sense of people's opinions and are good for coming up with ideas for questions you can ask yourself, but they're not good sources of support. They're not good for quotes, in other words.

, Is obesity a disease? What do we mean by calling it an ""epidemic""? These are terms you can and should look up quickly online. By defining your terms and becoming more familiar with the topic--becoming an amateur expert on it, in fact--you'll be more informed when you get to the much more technical kinds of sources you'll need to use for your supportive research.

, One of the great things about a wiki (like wikiHow!) is that the sources referenced throughout the article are available at the bottom of the page for you to explore yourself. These are often better sources of information than the wiki itself, and the organization of the page allows for you to use it as a summary of the information in those sources, rather than a source unto itself.

, When you're reading online, look for a mixture of statistics and data, as well as opinions. It's not necessarily helpful to have a ranting blog full of someone's conspiracies about growth hormones in school lunches being a conspiracy to keep kids obese, but there might be something there to inspire you. What is the deal with school lunches? What research has been done? Do more exploring and find a more substantial page with similar information.

, The most helpful source of information at libraries isn't books. Often, librarians sit idly by while students struggle on computers not twenty feet away, digging through a difficult swamp of bad information and poor sources. Talk to them! They're here to help.


Bring your research question and any research you've done to this point, as well as any particular assignments or project descriptions that you've got with you. If you're doing research for a paper, bring the assignment sheet.
Ask at the front desk for research librarians who are on-call for student consultations, or make an appointment yourself with a topic librarian in a specific field. These meetings tend to be very beneficial. You won't waste time trying to negotiate the difficult library databases, and you'll be sure the kind of information you find will be helpful for your project.

, At the library, you've got more information that you'll know what to do with. Try to find only the most directly-related information. If you're struggling to find good sources, try refining your search terms and looking again.


Books obviously make for good overviews of topics. If you're researching obesity, you'll be able to find long-range research studies, expert analysis, and opinions on books in the subject.
Magazines and research journals will provide more specialized and technical topics, usually at a somewhat shorter length. They're be lighter on opinion and heavier on dry statistics.
Most university libraries use JSTOR or some variant of an academic database that houses research articles by topic. It can be a somewhat difficult database to negotiate, so talk to a librarian for help if you're unsure.

, It can be frustrating when you first get started at the library in trying to find information directly related to your searches. Learning to search effectively and be diligent with your efforts will pay off in the end. Vary your searches, using quotations around specific searches you want the engine to look for. If you were looking for information about obesity, specifically related to the school lunch program, you might search for:


""obesity""
""obesity"" ""school lunch""
""school lunch""
""junk food in schools""
""Indiana obesity""
""Indiana school lunches""
""weight epidemic""
""obesity epidemic""

, Learning to read quickly and skim effectively for important and on-topic information is often the difference between a smooth research project and a frustrating one. If you're getting deep into a really complicated technical topic, a lot of the research can be dry and downright boring. Learning to negotiate the sources quickly will make your job much easier.


Read the abstract, if the source has one, or read the introduction to the source to make sure the topic is applicable. If it seems peripheral, put it back and forget about it. You're not doing research to pad your bibliography, you're doing it to support your argument and explore the topic.
If you find a good source, skip forward to the end and read the summary. Much of the ""meat"" of technical research-based sources will be spent presenting their own research, whereas you're mostly concerned with the findings and the argument itself. Often, you can get away with only reading a few paragraphs of a 15 or 20 page research report or book if you read smart.
If the source provides excellent support, read the article more closely to get a sense of the argument and the evidence. Use the author's own research to look for more sources.

, There's nothing worse than getting to the writing phase of a research project at not being able to find a particular quote or statistic in the pile of research you've collected. Stay organized while you're researching and take careful notes to refer to later.


Take note cards to the library and write down specific quotes on one side of the card and the bibliographical information (Title, author, publication info, and URL if applicable) on the other side of the card.

, A good day at the library doesn't necessarily involve stacking up a mountain of 500-page books you'll never read. Research smart, taking notes on the most important parts of the information, and use a manageable number of sources to make your argument and serve your argument.


Some students think more sources makes a research paper better. It doesn't. Ideally, you want a balance of ""their"" voice--meaning the research--and your voice, your argument. A good research project uses the research to form and support an argument, not to act like a ventriloquist dummy, repeating information you read at length.

, Some topics and projects will call for primary research, which means that you'll collect the data yourself. If you've got a really localized topic--like the obesity problem at your University, for instance--you might want to consider creating a short questionnaire or other way of analyzing data of concern to your project., No surveys or questionnaires get to everyone. How many would be enough to get a good sense of the issue. Will it mean anything to gather opinions about obesity form 20 guys in the locker room? Everyone on your dorm floor? 300 people at the football game?


Be conscious of bias. Aim for a somewhat distributed mix of men and women, of different ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, and places of birth.

, If you're after opinions, a questionnaire is the best and most efficient way of collecting data, but it might not be particularly applicable to your topic.


If you're interested in food habits and the availability of junk food in cafeterias, consider posting up beside the lunch line a few days a week and counting the number of students who forego the full lunches in favor of deserts, sodas, or candy. Keep a running tally.
Interviews might be good if you have access to experts or other parties involved directly in the topic you're researching. If you want to learn about school lunches, talk to the lunch workers, the principal of your school, or other people who may be involved. Let them know what you're researching and explain the project before talking to them.

, Once you've picked a method of collection, distribute your surveys, observe your behaviors, or conduct your interviews and collect your research. Analyze the research and summarize your findings in a way that you'll be able to use it for your research.


If your hypothesis about the research ends up being wrong, don't fret. This in and of itself can be a good source of information to present in a project, displaying your commitment to finding out ""the truth"" of the topic at hand.

, When you've collected your research, identify the most persuasive arguments and sources and use them as a jumping off point for your own argument. If you found that districts with schools that feature vending machines experience a 30 percent higher obesity rate, how can you transition that into an argument to support with that research? What does the research say?, A thesis statement is the central thing you hope to prove by presenting your research. It should be debatable and specific, giving you a road map for where the research essay or project might go. A good thesis statement helps the writer as much as the reader, because it gives you a tangible thing to prove with the writing.


A bad thesis statement might be ""Schools need to do more to avoid obesity."" This is vague and difficult to prove. What schools? What do they need to do? ""Adams High School could significantly drop the obesity rate in the student body and even the region by removing the vending machines and offering a diversity of healthy choices"" does a lot more to present an argument and give you something to prove.

, How do you present your research in a readable way?


Paraphrase to translate a source into your own words. These should always be attributed, but not quoted, and are most effective when you need to briefly summarize a position or argument. You've still given credit to the author, so we know the observation isn't your own. In other words, you might write:

According to Adams, schools that feature vending machines in the lunch rooms experience an increase in obesity rates.


Quote any language directly sourced from the article. This is effectively used when there's something in the wording of the source that you want to emphasize or highlight as part of your research:

According to Adams, ""The inclusion of vending machines markedly increases the junk food desires of students in those schools, resulting in a chain reaction that rewards their bad choices.""


Learn to recognize and avoid plagiarism. It can happen accidentally, so you need to learn to recognize the ways in which it occurs and avoid it.

, If you're writing a research essay, you need to learn to effectively provide citation information for each source you reference, be it paraphrase or quotation, throughout the source. Use a parenthetical or footnote citation in the text of your paper, and include a list of references or a Works Cited page at the end of the paper including the publishing information for each source. Your teacher may want you to use a particular style of citation, but the most popular include:


MLA
APA
Chicago Style
Turabian

Compose your thesis statement.,
Organize your paper by the block method.,

Create a hook for your first sentence.,
Revise your introduction once you complete the essay.",How to Start a Compare and Contrast Essay," Most compare and contrast essays bring one or both subjects into sharper focus, lead to a new way of viewing something, or show that one subject is better than the other. To compare and contrast effectively, your essay should make new connections or distinctions between two subjects.If your instructor has already given you your topic, you may be contrasting two things that could go into the same category, but are different from each other. For example, cats and dogs are both animals, but they are different from each other in many ways. The pro-life view on abortion, and the pro-choice view on abortion could both fit under the category of a human rights issue, but they are two very distinct views or positions.

, Take out a piece of paper or start a new document on a word processor. Create two columns for each subject for the similarities and and two columns for each subject for the differences between each subject. For example: Two separate lists for the similarities between cats and dogs, and the differences between cats and dogs.Try to write as many similarities and differences you can think of. For example: cats and dogs are both domesticated animals. But cats have different temperaments than dogs, and cats are known to be indoor pets, while dogs tend to need to be walked and played with outside on a constant basis.
Think about at least one or two meaningful differences and similarities between the two subjects. For example, a compare and contrast between abortion rights could lead to meaningful notes like: The pro-life stance views fetuses are full formed humans and are often based in religious beliefs, while the pro-choice stance views fetuses as undeveloped eggs and are often based in scientific beliefs.
To focus your list, choose categories (or possible supporting points for your paper) to classify the similarities and differences between the two subjects. For example, for the abortion rights topic, you may choose categories like: legal details, women’s rights, scientific stance, and religious beliefs. You can then separate each item on the list into these categories.

, Take out a piece of paper and draw two large overlapping circles, one for each subject or item. In the center area where the two circles overlap, list the traits the two items have in common. Assign each of the areas that do not overlap. In these areas, you can list the traits that make the subjects different. Be specific when listing words or phrases for each subject or each perspective on the same subject.Once you are done listing 10-15 differences and 5-7 similarities, circle the most important items in each list. Then, match at least three opposites from one circle to the other circle.
Review the list and look for three different categories that describe these traits. For example, for the abortion rights topic, you may have “scientific studies of the fetus” on the pro-choice side, and “belief in life of the fetus” on the pro-life side. One possible category could then be the debate of the life of a fetus.

, Try to answer the questions journalists traditionally ask: Who? What? Where? When? Why? and How? Apply these basic questions to your topic to get a sense of each topic or perspective.If you’re compare and contrasting two historical periods or events, you may ask: When did they occur (the dates and the duration)? What happened or changed during each event? Why are they significant? Who were the important people involved? How did the events occur, and what consequences did they have later in history?
If you’re compare and contrasting two ideas or theories, you may ask: What were they about? How did they originate? Who created them? What is the central focus, claim, or goal of each theory? How do the theories apply to situations/people/things, etc.? What kind of evidence is used to support each theory?
If you’re compare and contrasting two pieces of art, you may ask: What does each piece of art describe or depict? What is their tone or mood? What themes do they address? Who created them? When were they created? How do the creators of the artworks describe their own work? Why do you think the artworks were created as they were?
If you’re compare and contrasting two people, you may ask: Where is each person from? How old are they? What, if anything, are they known for? How do they identify themselves in terms of gender, race, class, etc? Do the two people have any relationship to each other? What does each person do? Why is each person interesting? What are the defining features of each person?

, Your instructor may require you to do in depth research on a complex topic, like abortion rights, or you may be writing from a purely opinion based perspective, such as why you love cats more than dogs. Once you complete your brainstorm, you should be able to identify aspects of the essay that you may need to do more reading or research on if your topic is academic and/or based in current events and social issues.Your instructor may also ask for a discussion of more than one similarity and difference between the two topics or two perspectives. Identify any gaps in your knowledge and prepare to do research so you can better compare and contrast the two topics in your essay.

, The thesis of your compare and contrast essay will help you create a focused argument and act as a road map for you, and for your reader. Go for specific and detailed, over vague and general.Your thesis should note the key similarities and differences of both subjects. For example: “Dogs and cats are both seen as ideal, domesticated pets, but their temperaments and breeding set them apart.”
Your thesis should also be able to answer the question, “So what? Why should anyone care about the positives and the negatives of owning a cat or a dog?” A reader may also wonder why you chose to look at cats and dogs, and not other domesticated pets like birds, reptiles, or rabbits. Your thesis statement is much stronger if you address these questions, and a stronger thesis can lead to a stronger essay.
The revised thesis may look like: “Dogs and cats are both considered ideal, domesticated pets, and prove more popular than other domesticated animals like birds or rabbits, but the low maintenance and particular temperament of cats makes them better pets for a variety of households.” A more concise thesis, which allows for a more open discussion of both options, may look like: “Both cats and dogs make excellent domesticated pets, but an appropriate choice depends on the pet owner’s lifestyle, finances, and living accommodations.”

, In the block method, each paragraph in the essay addresses one topic only from the pair of topics and looks at the shared traits or aspects you came up with during your brainstorm. The organization for this method is as follows:Introduction: Introduce the general topic, then introduce the two specific topics. End with your thesis, which addresses what is going to be covered in the essay.
Body paragraph 1: Begins with the topic sentence for topic 1. For example: “Cats are easier to maintain and less expensive to care for than dogs.”

Leads into Aspect 1: Lifestyle, with at least two details. For example, how cats do not have to watched during the day, and are easier to get care if the owner travels or is often not home.
Leads into Aspect 2: Cost, with at least two details. For example, how food and healthcare are less expensive for cats and how cats are less likely to cause property damage to the owner’s home.
Leads into Aspect 3: Living accommodations, with at least two details. For example, how cats do not take up a lot of space and they are less intrusive as they do not require daily walks or constant play.
End the paragraph with a transition sentence.


Body paragraph 2 will follow the same structure, with three Aspects and two supporting details for each aspect.
Body paragraph 3 can follow the same structure as Body paragraph 2 and 3. Or it can be a paragraph that develops the comparison made in the previous two paragraphs. You can use scientific data, crowd sourced feedback, or a personal experience. For example, you may have been in a position where you had to compare and contrast adopting a dog or a cat and made your decision based on your lifestyle, finances, and living situation. This could serve as a personal experience to back up your previous arguments.
Conclusion: Contains a summary of your main points, a restating of your thesis, an evaluation of your analysis and any future developments that may sway your compare and contrast to one topic over the other.

, In the point by point method, each paragraph contains the arguments for only one aspect of both topics. The organization for this method is as follows:Introduction: Introduce the general topic, then introduce the two specific topics. End with your thesis, which addresses what is going to covered in the essay.
Body paragraph 1: Begins with topic sentence for Aspect 1. For example: “Cats are easier on the pet owner’s lifestyle and finances.”

Leads into Topic 1, Aspect 1: Cats, with two details supporting cats in the argument. For example, how cats do not have to watched during the day, and are easier to get care if the owner travels or is often not home.
Leads into Topic 2, Aspect 1: Dogs, with two details contrasting dogs to the previous argument. For example, how dogs are pack animals and shouldn’t be left alone for long periods of time, and how it can be difficult to find care for a dog when the owner is away.
Ends with a transition sentence.


Body paragraph 2 will follow the same structure, with a discussion of Topic 1 and Topic 2 in relation to Aspect 2, for example: “Cats are less expensive to own and care for.” There should be two supporting details for each topic.
Body paragraph 3 will follow the same structure, with a discussion of Topic 1 and Topic 2 in relation to Aspect 3, for example: “Cats need less special house accommodations than dogs.” There should be two supporting details for each topic.
Conclusion: Contains a summary of your main points, a restating of your thesis, an evaluation of your analysis and any future developments that may sway your compare and contrast to one topic over the other.

, Avoid apologizing to your reader by saying you are not an expert on the two topics or your opinion does not matter. Don’t lead with a phrase like, “In my humble opinion”, or “I could be wrong, but I believe.” Instead, you should move confidently in your introduction, keeping in mind your thesis statement and the essay outline you created.You should also avoid announcing your intentions in a straightforward and formal way. For example, skip statements like “In this paper, I will” or “The purpose of this essay is to”.
Instead, your reader should be able to perceive the purpose of your essay through the first two sentences in your beginning paragraph.

, A hook, or attention grabber, can help to engage your reader right away, especially if your topic is dry or complex. Try to create a hook using these starting points:An interesting or surprising example: This could be a personal experience of when a cat proved to be a better pet than a dog, or a scientific study that shows the differences between cats and dogs.
A provocative quotation: This could be from a source you used for your essay or one that feels relevant to your topic.
A vivid anecdote: An anecdote is a very short story that carries moral or symbolic weight. Think of an anecdote that might be a poetic or powerful way to start your essay. You can also look through your research for your essay for any note worthy anecdotes.
A thought provoking question: Think of a question that will get your reader thinking and engaged in your topic. For example: “Did you always wish you had a cat but ended up with a dog when you were growing up?”

, Another technique is to write a temporary introduction, with your thesis statement, and then revise it or rewrite it once you finish your essay. If you feel stumped by the introduction, as you aren’t sure what you are going to argue in detail or how your main argument is going to take shape, try writing your introduction last.The writing process can be an important way to organize your ideas, think through certain points, and refine your thoughts. Writing or revising the introduction once you are done your essay will ensure the introduction matches the body of your essay.

Cite while you write.,
Gather information.,
Organize the sources.,
Alphabetize the list.,
Format the Works Cited page.",How to Reference Essays1," MLA makes use of short in-text citations inside parentheses, compiling them in an alphabetical Works Cited list at the end of the document. While you're composing an essay, it's important to include where you get certain information in order to avoid plagiarism (passing another's knowledge as your own).


You will need a citation directly after every sentence containing information you didn't think of yourself. These include: paraphrases, facts, statistics, quotes, and examples.
An in-text citation using MLA will simply have the author last name (or title if no author) followed by the page number. No comma between author and page number. For example: (Richards 456) Richards is the author last name, and 456 is the page number.
If you have an author name (or title, if no author) but no page number, simply use author last name (or title).;
, When you do research using MLA style of citation, you need to gather specific pieces of information for each citation. You will need things like author’s name, publisher, date published, and page numbers.


The easiest way to keep track of MLA citations while doing research is to copy and paste copyright information into a word processing document as you go, or to write it down in a notebook.
Things to include for any source are author(s), date published, publisher, page number, volume and issue number, website, date accessed, anything that appears on the copyright page or indicates how to find it again., When you have completed your writing and are preparing to turn it in or publish it, you must alphabetize your citations in a Works Cited page. This page should be the last of the document.


As an example, the format for a standard book citation using MLA style is as follows: Last name of author, First name. Title of Book. City published: Publisher Name, Year published. Source Medium.
An MLA website citation looks like the following. If there's no author listed, begin citation with the name of the page: Last name, first name. ""Page Title."" Website Title. Publisher. Date published. Source Medium. Date accessed.
An MLA scholarly article citation looks like the following: Last name, First name. ""Title of Article."" Title of Journal. Volume.Issue (Year): page numbers. Source Medium.
Write the title of the main work (book, magazine, journal, website, etc.) in italics, or underline if you’re writing references by hand.
Chapter or article titles should be in quotation marks.

, Place your list of references in order alphabetically by the authors' last names.


If there is no author listed, as is common on websites, simply skip the author’s name and begin the entry with the title of the work.
Alphabetize by the first letter that appears in the entry, whether it has an author name or not.

, Double-space your document, and title this list of citations ""Works Cited.""


The formatting should be in Times New Roman font, size 12, with “Works Cited” centered at the top of a new page.
Each entry should have hanging indent, meaning all lines below the first line are indented by half an inch.
Make sure there is a period after each section of the citations. A period should always end the citation.

Stay consistent.",How to Create a Study Schedule to Prepare for Final Exams," Before you can actually create a study schedule for finals week, you need to decide what exactly you’ll use for scheduling. You might prefer paper calendars or planners, or you might want to use the calendar app on your phone, and download an actual study app. It doesn’t matter which type you prefer, as long as you have something., Before you even begin crafting a schedule, make sure you have all of your exam dates in front of you. This will make creating your schedule a lot easier because you won’t have to stop and search for information or, even worse, have to start over because you forgot about an exam.


Some schools schedule all finals during a finals week. In this case, the time for your final might not be on the same day or at the same time as when your class normally meets. Make sure you note if that’s true.
Some teachers might schedule your final during regular class time, even if your school has a devoted finals week. Make sure you have that information, too., If you have breaks between when you start drawing up your study schedule and finals week, you can use them to devote more time to studying since you won't have to attend class.


Depending on how long your classes usually are per day, consider adding extra study sessions for those courses during their regularly scheduled meeting times. This gives you some extra time to study without really disrupting your normal schedule.

, How much time you have to study for finals will depend on when in the semester you start drawing up your schedule. Once you’re ready to set your study schedule, calculate how many days you have between now and when your exams are. This will obviously be a different number for every exam.


When you're calculating how much time you have, keep in mind hat you probably won't be able to study every single day before finals. Subtract days that you have a lot going on and won't be able to study. This gives you a more realistic total number of days you have., Once you know how much time you have to study for each exam, prioritize them. List your exams in order, starting with the one you have to take the soonest, and ending with your last exam.


You might also want to consider prioritizing by how hard the exam is likely to be. Say, for example, you have a final for math after you have a final in English, but you know math is harder for you. You might want to move math up above English on your list so you know you have enough time to study for it., Some people study better at night, and other people are more alert in the morning. Schedule your study time for a time of day when you know you’ll be the sharpest – this will help you retain information more easily., Before you create your study schedule, make sure you add the non-studying stuff you have to do – classes, doctor’s appointments, etc – so you know what time you actually have available.


This prevents you from scheduling study time and then realizing that day you had an appointment you forgot about and have to miss your study time., Don’t schedule study time for eight hours of the day on top of the other stuff you have to do, too. The more realistic you can be, the more productive your studying will be.


You should also be realistic about what you can get done in each study session. Don't schedule studying 5 chapters, writing a paper, and working on a project all for the same two-hours block., Research shows that after about two hours, we are less able to focus on a specific topic or task, and our concentration and ability to retain information declines. Scheduling your study time in two-hour blocks not only prevents you from setting unrealistic goals, it also helps you make the most productive schedule.


This doesn't mean that you can only schedule one two-hour session per day. Depending on how much other time you have available to study, you can schedule one or two two-hour sessions in the morning and one or two two-hour sessions later in the day.
If you're going to schedule multiple sessions per day, try to schedule them for the time when you work best. If you work better in the morning, try scheduling to sessions before noon - with a good break in between. If you work better in the evening, schedule one session before dinner and one after., In each study session, studying one subject at a time can help you focus on the material better and therefore retain more.Splitting your time between multiple subjects per study session doesn't give you enough time to get deep enough in the material to really retain anything.
Some change is good when you're studying. Studying one topic for one study session and then switching to something totally different for your next session can keep things fresh and keep up your efficiency and energy., When you’re setting up your times to study, make sure you build in ten or fifteen minutes to quickly review what you studied the day before. It keeps things fresh in your mind and will remind you of the connections between what you’re doing and what you already did., While you’re scheduling time to study, it’s also important to build breaks into your schedule. Research suggests that you should take a break for 10 – 15 minutes every hour.


You should also schedule larger breaks – like time to exercise or see friends or watch TV. Giving your brain and your body a chance to relax will make you more productive in the long run., As you’re scheduling your existing appointments and obligations and your study time, color code each type of activity. This gives you a better visual representation of what your week will look like and can often help you see how much time you really need to spend studying.

, Try to study at the same time (and possibly the same place) every day. This can make studying become almost automatic."

Cite while you write.,
Gather information.,
Organize the list.,
Format the page.",How to Reference Essays2," APA requires citations inside parentheses in the text of an essay, compiling them in an alphabetical References list at the end of a document. While you're writing an essay, it's important to cite information so that you avoid plagiarism (a form of cheating).


Place a parenthetical citation at the end of every sentence containing information you didn't know before doing research.
An in-text citation using APA will simply have the author last name (or title if no author) followed by the year it was published. No comma between name and year. For example: (Richards 2005) Richards is the author last name, and 2005 is the year.
If you have an author name (or title if no author) but no page number, simply use author last name (or title). This is common when citing websites.
APA document formatting is very important. APA papers are divided up into 4 sections. The citations of a research paper using APA appear in the References section, the last portion of an APA document.

, Write down copyright information as you go for every piece of research you glean from. Write it down for every source you look at with a note to jog your memory--you'll be surprised how many ideas you you start to paraphrase, unable to remember where you got that idea.


To form APA reference page citations, you will need such information as author name(s), date published, website URL, date you accessed the website, title of work, and so on., The list of references should be alphabetized and set to hanging indent, just like MLA style format.


For example, the format for an APA reference of a scholarly journal article is as follows: Author last name, First initial. (Year published). Article or chapter title. Journal or book title, Issue number, page number range.The format for an APA book reference looks like: Last name, First name. (Year.) Title of Book: Capital letter also for subtitle. Location: Publisher.
The format for an APA website reference looks like: Author, A.A. First name, & Author, B.B. (Date published.) Title of article. In Title of webpage or larger document or book (chapter or section number). Retrieved from URL address

, Double-space your document, and title the references page ""References"" at the top-center of the page.


Capitalize the author's last name and first initial, followed by a period.
Only capitalize the first word of a journal article title, unless the title contains a proper noun (called sentence case). Titles of books should preserve the published capitalization.
Capitalize the city of publication, and use correct state abbreviations for states. Also capitalize the name of the publisher and end the reference with a period.
The title of larger works, whether a book, journal, website, or magazine, is in italics (or underlined if handwriting), as is the issue number that appears right after the title. Titles for shorter works like articles and chapters should not have any indicative punctuation in an APA entry.A period should end all citations.

"
"
Cite while you write.,
Gather information.,
Use Notes and Bibliography if instructed.,
Use Author Date if instructed.",How to Reference Essays3," CMOS or Chicago utilizes two different of reference styles: Notes and Bibliography, and Author Date. Your in-text citation depends on which style of citation you’re using.


For Notes and Bibliography, you will use a superscript at the instance of each quote in the text with a corresponding footnote at the end of the page. All footnotes are compiled into endnotes at the end of the work, on the bibliography page.For Author Date, you will use parenthetical in-text citations that include author last name and year published, using no punctuation between name and year. The full version of each parenthetical citation is listed alphabetically on the references page. For example: (Simon 2011) Simon is the author last name, and 2011 is the year.
You will need a citation directly after every sentence containing information you didn't think of yourself. These include: paraphrases, facts, statistics, quotes, and examples.

, As you do research for your essay, take note of all bibliographic information that you see. This means title, author, publication, year, volume and issue number, location of publication, website, even the date you access the material if it’s online.


If using a book, write down all pertinent information found on the copyright page, including the name of the publisher and the city and year of publication.
For other sources, look for this information near the title of the piece you’re looking at. Publication date is often at the bottom of webpages.

, The Notes and Bibliography (NB) method is preferred by scholars in the humanities (literature, history, arts). NB is conducive to recording a wide range of sources in detail, which the Author Date system doesn't allow for.Title your references page “Bibliography” centered at the top of the page. Leave 2 blank lines between this title and the first entry, and one blank line between entries.
Notes and Bibliography style uses footnotes and endnotes. The bibliography page will be an alphabetized list of all sources in hanging indent.
An example format for a book is as follows: Last name, First name. Book Title. City: Publisher, Year.
An example format for a chapter in a print scholarly journal is as follows: Author last name, first name. ""Title of Chapter or Article."" Book or journal Title Issue Number (Year): Page number range. (For an online scholarly journal article, tack on the following at the end: Date accessed. URL address.)
An example format for a website is as follows: Name of Website. ""Page Title."" Date last modified. Date accessed. URL address.

When there is no known author, the entry should begin with the title of the document, whether it's a webpage, chapter, article, and so on.
When there are multiple authors, the first listed author appears last name, first name, so that the citation is alphabetized by this author's last name. Subsequent authors are listed by first name, like this: Alcott, Louisa May, Charles Dickens, and Elizabeth Gaskill.


Always end a citation with a period.

, The Author Date style is preferred by those in the sciences, i.e. physical, natural, and social sciences. Author Date is a more concise style of documentation.


When using Author Date style, title your references page “References” centered at the top of the page. Leave 2 blank lines between this title and the first entry, and 1 blank line between entries.
Author Date style bibliographies should be organized alphabetically by last name (or by title if no author) in hanging indent.
An example format for a book is as follows: Last name, first name. Year. Book Title. City Published: Publisher.
An example format for a chapter in a print scholarly journal is as follows: Author last name, first name. Year. ""Title of Chapter or Article."" Book or journal title issue number: page numbers. (for an online scholarly journal article tack this onto the end: Date accessed. URL address.)
An example format for a website is as follows: Name of Website. Year. ""Page Title."" Date last modified. Date accessed. URL address.

,How to Start a College Essay1,
"
Have a crystal-clear understanding of the assignment.,
Master the different types of essays.,
Define your audience.,
Define your purpose.,
Manage your tone.",How to Start a College Essay2," Though you may want to jump right into your college essay, you should know exactly what is asked of you before you even open up that blank Word Document. Carefully read the prompt and see what type of essay your teacher wants you to write, how many words are required, and how much research is required for the essay. Here are some things you should be very clear about before you begin:


Word count. If your essay only needs to be 500 words long, it will be very different from an essay that needs to be 2,000 words long. Be aware of the word requirement and stick to it, or at least within 10% of it. You don't want to weary your teacher by writing an essay that is much longer than required, or much shorter than required.
The amount of required research. Some classes will require you to write a paper that is heavily based on outside research you've done. Others will require you to use the course materials, like novels, or textbooks, for the basis of your paper, and to draw your own conclusions. Though almost every good essay is based on solid research.
If you have any questions, talk to your teacher well before the day the assignment is due to clarify any concerns you may have.

, There are many different types of essays you may have to write in college, and it's good to be aware of the variety of essays out there so you know what is expected of you. Here are the basic types of essays that you should master:The persuasive/argumentative essay. This essay will ask you to persuade your readers to see your perspective on an issue. For example, an essay showing readers all the reasons why personal handguns should be banned will be a persuasive essay.

The analytical essay. This type of essay is most common in literature courses. This essay will ask you to read a work and to analyze the words, themes, characters, and meaning using your own ideas as well as other scholarly sources for the topic.

The expository essay. This type of essay will pick a process or situation and will explain important aspects of this subject, such as describing the daily lives of college students.

The research essay. This essay will ask you to dig deeper into a topic by researching it and informing your readers of its history, uses, or relevance.

The compare and contrast essay. This type of essay will ask you to compare and contrast two topics and to show how they are similar or different. For example, and essay analyzing all of the similarities and differences between living in New York City and Los Angeles is a compare and contrast essay.

, Are you writing for your professor, for your classmates, for experts in your field, or for people who are new to the subject? If you're writing for experts in the field, then you don't have to define basic terms and can use a more advanced vocabulary, but if you're writing for people who don't know much about the topic, like analyzing a film for readers who haven't seen it, then you'll have to give more basic details.


If you're writing a research paper on a topic that may be esoteric or unfamiliar to your readers, then you'll have to explain the research you've found in great detail.

, What is your purpose in writing the essay? Is it to inform, to entertain, to persuade, to define, to compare and contrast, to analyze, to synthesize, or to tell a story? Knowing your purpose right away can help you frame your argument and reach the right people in the right way. For example, if your goal is to persuade people, you'll have to develop a logical argument with compelling main points that convince your readers to see your point of view.If your purpose is to analyze something, like a poem or a play, then you'll have to provide compelling in-text evidence that supports your ideas.
If your goal is to compare and contrast, then you'll have to be knowledgeable about the differences and similarities of two topics.
If your purpose is to inform, then you'll have to thoroughly study a topic and help your readers understand it better.

, Tone is another important aspect of writing a successful college essay. For most essays, your tone should be professional, detached, and informative. If you use too much biased language to try to convince your research, then you won't sound authoritative. If you use slang or casual phrasing, then you won't sound professional. But if you're writing a personal essay (for a course on writing a memoir, for example), then you'll get to use more comfortable, informal language.


Your tone is your attitude toward the subject you're presenting. Is your tone detached, amused, slightly cynical, suspicious, or more passionate? Whatever the tone is, it has to be appropriate to the subject matter.
If you're writing an essay about stem-cell research, for example, your tone should be objective and detached; if you were writing an essay about online dating, you could take a more amused or playful tone.

Do your research.,
Know what makes an appropriate thesis statement.,
Write a thesis statement.,
Create an outline.",How to Start a College Essay3," Though it may be fun to jump right into an essay without knowing exactly what you're talking about, the best thing you can do is to do your research first so you build a solid foundation for your thinking. Get the texts you need, take notes, and read them until you feel that you've mastered the topic and have enough information to write an essay or formulate an argument.


Make sure that the materials you use are credible and come from established professionals. Don't do your research on Wikipedia.
Take enough notes to be comfortable with the subject.
Be familiar with MLA or APA citation so that you can use it for your essay.

, Once you've done your research, you'll need to write a thesis statement, which will be the central argument or point that you'll be making throughout the paper. Though you can outline some basic ideas first or find several main ideas that stand out to you, you should not begin writing the essay without a clear idea of what your thesis statement should be. One example of a thesis statement is the following: ""New York City is a better place to live than San Francisco because it has more diversity, more opportunities, and better weather."" Here are the characteristics of an appropriate thesis statement:Clarity
Precision
The ability to be argued
The ability to be demonstrated
Detail
The use of the third person

, Write a thesis statement that makes an argument clearly and precisely and which can be argued. You can't write a thesis about how unicorns exist because you can't prove that, and you can't write a thesis about how smoking is bad for your health because that can't really be argued. Instead, pick an interesting, relevant argument to your subject matter and pick at least two or three specific details to help you argue your point. Here are some examples of different thesis statements:A thesis statement for an analytical essay:""The Great Gatsby's three central themes are loneliness, the corruption of wealth, and the loss of great love.""
A thesis statement for an argumentative or persuasive essay: ""SAT scores should not be used as a factor in college admissions because they do not accurately gauge intelligence and are socioeconomically biased.""
A thesis statement for an expository essay: ""Most high school students spend their time balancing homework, friends, and extracurricular activities.""

, Once you have a thesis statement, you should create an outline that will serve as the road map to the rest of your paper, which will help you know exactly what to put in each paragraph. This will make your thoughts logical and organized and will keep you from getting overwhelmed or changing your mind halfway through the paper. The outline should include the introductory paragraph, the body paragraphs, and the concluding paragraphs, citing as much specific evidence as possible. Here's an example of an outline of an essay with the following thesis statement: ""New York is the best city for young professionals because of its attractions, weather, and job market.""Introduction: 1) hook, 2) three main points, 3) thesis statement
Body paragraph 1: attractions: 1) restaurants, 2) clubs and bars, 3) museums
Body paragraph 2: weather: 1) beautiful winter snow 2) pleasant spring 3) refreshing rain
Body paragraph 3: job market 1) opportunities in finance and business 2) opportunities for the arts 3) networking opportunities
Conclusion: 1) return to the hook, 2) restate main points, 3) state thesis

"
"
Hook your readers.,
State your main points.,
State your thesis.",How to Start a College Essay4," The introduction is comprised of three parts: the hook, the main points, and the thesis statement. The first part, the hook, should be a way to draw your readers in and to have them read the rest of your essay. The hook should relate to your main point and should get your readers engaged so that they want to keep reading. Here are some examples of hooks:The rhetorical question. Asking a question that helps draw the readers into the central debate you're discussing can help get their attention. For example, an essay that supports gay marriage can start with the question, ""Shouldn't any person be able to marry the person he loves?""
A shocking statement or statistic. Starting with a shocking statement or statistic relevant to your topic can help get the reader's attention. For example, if you're writing an essay about depression among college students, you can start with a (research-based) statement like, ""Over 10% of college students are currently suffering from depression.""
An anecdote. Starting with a short anecdote relevant to your thesis can help draw your readers in. For example, if you were writing an essay about the difficulty of being a single mother, you could start by saying, ""Jane was struggling to make ends meet while trying to take care of her son, Randy.""

, Once you've hooked your readers with a strong statement, it's time to spend at least one sentence or two describing each main point, so that your readers know what to expect. For example, if you're writing an essay with the following thesis statement: ""The Great Gatsby's three central themes are loneliness, the corruption of wealth, and the loss of great love,"" then you should spend one sentence describing the loneliness in the novel, one sentence describing the corruption, and another statement describing the loss of great love.

, Once you've hooked your readers and stated your main points, all you have to do is state your thesis. It tends to work best as the last sentence in the introductory paragraph, though sometimes the essay can be successful if you place the thesis earlier in the introduction. The introductory paragraph and the thesis should work like a road map to the rest of the essay, so that the reader knows what to expect in the rest of the paper. To recap, a successful start to a college essay, or an introductory paragraph, should include the following:


A ""hook"" to get the reader's attention
A brief discussion of the main points that will be covered in the body of the essay
The thesis statement

"
,How to Start a Conclusion1,
"
Write 3-5 body paragraphs.,
Write a conclusion.,
Remember to stick to the third person.,
Revise your work.",How to Start a College Essay5," Once you've found your thesis statement and have written that introductory paragraph, much of the hard work of the essay is over. Now, you'll have to jump into the body paragraphs that will develop the main points you've made in your thesis statement, and which will help inform or persuade your readers. You should have 3-5 body paragraphs or more, depending on the length of the essay. Each body paragraph should include the following:A topic sentence that tells the reader what the paragraph will be about.
Supporting details, evidence, facts, or statistics that develop the main point.
A concluding sentence that wraps up the ideas in the paragraph and transitions to the next body paragraph.

, Once you have your introduction and your three body paragraphs, you should write a conclusion that wraps up the ideas you've introduced and explained in your essay. The conclusion should do several things:Restate your thesis
Remind the reader of your main point
Refer back to an anecdote, statistic, or fact in your introduction (optional)
Leave the reader with something to think about beyond the words on the page

, Writing in the third person (unless you're told not to do so) is a very important aspect of writing a successful college essay. You should never say ""I think..."" or ""I believe that..."" or your argument will sound too weak or insubstantial. Instead of saying, ""I think abortion should remain legal in the United States,"" you can say, ""Abortion should remain legal in the United States,"" to make your argument sound more forceful.


You should avoid the first and the second person. Don't say ""you"" -- say ""one,"" ""he or she,"" or use the appropriate pronoun. Instead of saying, ""You should spend 3-5 hours a week if you want to succeed in college,"" say, ""College students should spend 3-5 hours a week studying if they want to succeed.""

, Once you've written your rough draft, you should go back and revise the essay and check for any lapses in your logic, and unproved points, or any weak arguments. You may also find that not everything in the essay is relevant, that your ideas are repetitive, and that you may need to tweak your thesis a bit -- that's only natural.


Once you feel that the essay is solid, you can revise it for grammar and punctuation.

"
"
Start with a transition sentence.,
Avoid saying ""in conclusion"".,
Consider starting with a reference to the original question.,
Go beyond summing up.,
Suggest some broader implications.",How to Start a Conclusion2," If you are writing a conclusion to an essay or paper for school or college, it's important to understand the functions of the conclusion. Your conclusion shouldn't only restate the main points of your argument in a way that is disconnected from the rest of the text. It should flow fluently and be written in such a way that your readers expect you to conclude when you do.


To help you achieve this fluency, you should start with a sentence that links the conclusion to the main body of the text.This might be a statement that reflects the content of your essay but connects your essay to the wider points that your conclusion will then go on to briefly discuss.
The sentence ""A sense of the impermanence of human achievement permeates this poem"", indicates a transition to the conclusion by articulating the key argument in one sentence.

, If you are concluding an essay or research paper, you should try to avoid using phrases such as ""in conclusion"" or ""to conclude"" at the start of your conclusion. These phrases are overused and an unimaginative way to begin a conclusion. You should be able to indicate that you are beginning the conclusion in a way that does not break the flow of the text so sharply., One way to begin your conclusion is to make a reference to the essay question or something you outlined in your introduction. If there is a phrase or quote that is especially relevant, recalling this in the conclusion can help you indicate that your essay is a complete a coherent argument.Echoing a key image or idea from the introduction is a good way to do this.For example, what if the essay question asks you ""to what extent did the Battle of Monte Casino change the course of the Second World War""?
Here, you could begin with a sentence such as ""The Battle of Monte Casino was a crucial moment that reflected the shifting dynamic of WWII, but did not in itself turn the tide of the war"".

, While your conclusion can be a useful place to briefly summarise the key points of your argument, you should try to go beyond this. It's important to show that your essay is coherent and all of your points connect together.You can demonstrate this in your conclusion. Instead of just going through each point one by one, try to summarise your argument in a way that highlights how the various strands of your argument are interconnected.


A short summary can be useful in a longer essay, but do not simply restate what you have said in the same terms.Rather, indicate your key points while situating them within a larger context, which displays a deeper understanding and potentially opens up new lines of inquiry., Conclusions can perform a number of functions in an essay or paper. A good conclusion can emphasise the importance of your argument and its particular relevance, as well as the significance of your unique findings or results. But it can also go beyond this and suggest how your essay has broader potential implications and applications than this one piece of work.


In your conclusion structure, this discussion of the broader implications should follow the transition sentences and the explanation of how the different elements of your argument fit together.This could include universalizing the topic of essay, making a connection to a contemporary issue, or providing a call to action.

"
"
Indicate that you are concluding.,
Return to your initial question.,
Provide a clear summary.,
Show enthusiasm and conviction.,
Finish strongly.",How to Start a Conclusion3," Although there are many similarities in the techniques for concluding an essay and a presentation there are some important differences too. Because a presentation is delivered orally rather than read, it may not always be so clear when you are beginning the conclusion. For this reason, it is advisable to clearly indicate when you are starting your conclusion.


Phrases such as ""in conclusion"", and ""to summarise"", which you wouldn't use in a written essay, can be useful for a spoken presentation.
Indicating that you are about to conclude will encourage your listeners to focus on what you are about to say., Once you get your audience's attention for your conclusion you should demonstrate how your presentation has travelled full circle by returning to the initial question or problem you set out to tackle in your introduction.Doing this will help you present a coherent and comprehensive argument. You can attempt to do this using similar techniques as an essay conclusion, by returning to an explicit question you set yourself, or returning to a key phrase or quote you established early in the presentation.For example, you could ask yourself the main question at the start of the conclusion. ""So, how do I suggest we improve our sales in the Mid-West?"" before going on provide a summary of your key points.

, In an oral presentation a clear summary of the key point in your talk can be a very important element of your conclusion. It is possible that your audience's attention will have drifted a little while you were talking and a brief summary can reinforce your argument.Generally, listening to a presentation will be more passive than reading an essay, so it is more beneficial to summarise your key points in the conclusion of a spoken presentation.
The last things your audience hear will most likely be what they take away with them, so be sure all your key points are covered in the conclusion., When you conclude a presentation, it is essential that you finish with conviction and enthusiasm that leaves a lasting impression with your audience. There are a number of ways to do this, such as using to-the-point phrases, memorable and meaningful soundbites, and making strong eye contact with your audience.You might also include a short anecdote that supports your argument and acts as a call to the action to the other people in the room.
A strong ending can make a personal connection with the audience, by demonstrating how you can resolve a problem for the audience member., When you are signing off you should try to make a lasting impression and engage you audience in the topic of your presentation. This can be achieved with a strong call to action. A call to action encourages your audience to actively respond to you and your ideas, while also demonstrating the relevance of your talk for members of the audience.


Using an action verb in your final sentence can highlight exactly how you want your audience to respond.
For example, when John F. Kennedy said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do or your country,"" he was encouraging action from the audience.Finishing this way both demonstrates your personal conviction and indicates that you think your ideas should be followed up.

Paraphrase quotes.,
Cite quotes with multiple authors.,
Cite quotes from the Internet.",How to Put a Quote in an Essay," In MLA style, a short quote is considered anything that is fewer than four typed lines of prose or three lines of poetry. If you have a quote that meets this length requirement, then all you have to do is 1) enclose the quote with double quotation marks, 2) provide the author's last name, and 3) provide the page number. You can either introduce the author's name before the quote, or place it in parentheses after the quote. You can just write the page number at the end, without using ""p"" or anything else to signify the page number. Make sure to introduce a quote with some text; don't just start a quote without introducing it or the readers won't be oriented. Use a few words to introduce a quote and then begin it with quotation marks that hold the quote; after that, cite the author's last name and page number in parentheses and place a period (or whatever punctuation you're using) at the end of the sentence. Here is an example:


According to some critics, literary fiction, ""is all but dead in the 21st century""(Smith 200).You can also introduce the author's name in the text instead of placing it in parentheses at the end. Here's another way to do it:

Jones states that, ""People who read literary fiction are proven to be able to sympathize with others more easily""(85).


You can also introduce a quote, cite it, and then comment on it a bit like this:

Many people believe that ""Sports has no meaning whatsoever,""(Lane 50), while others disagree completely.


If there's a punctuation mark in the original quote, then you'll have to include it in the citation:

Harry Harrison, the protagonist, always starts his day by saying, ""What a beautiful morning!""(Granger 12).


If you're citing poetry, then you can do so by citing the lines that the poem is using, while using a ""/"" to separate the lines, like so:

As Miller states, ""There is nothing cuter/than a cat sneezing"" (11-12), and many cat lovers would attest to this fact.



, In MLA formatting, long quotations are known to be anything that has more than four lines of prose or three lines of poetry. If you come across one of these, then you'll have to put the quote in free-standing blocks of text, and not use quotation marks. You can introduce the quote with a line of text and a colon, only indenting the first line of the quote by one inch from the left, while sticking to double spacing. You can end the quote with punctuation, and then use the author's last name and page number in parentheses after the quote.Here is an example of an introduction of a basic one paragraph long block quote:


The short story, ""The Things They Carried,"" lists the items carried by soldiers in the Vietnam war to both characterize them and burden the readers with the weight they are carrying:




The things they carried were largely determined by necessity. Among the necessities or near-necessities were P-38 can openers, pocket knives, heat tabs, wristwatches, dog tags, mosquito repellent, chewing gum, candy cigarettes, salt tablets, packets of Kool-Aid, lighters, matches, sewing kits, Military Payment Certificates, C rations, and two or three canteens of water. (O'Brien, 2)






When you're citing two or more paragraphs, you'll have to use block quotes, even if each passage from the paragraphs is less than four lines long. You should indent the first line of each of the paragraphs an extra quarter inch. Use ellipses (…) at the end of one paragraph to transition to the next.

, If you want to cite a poem, or part of one, then you should keep the original formatting of the lines to convey the original meaning. Here's how you can do it:Howard Nemerov describes his longing for a lost love in his poem, ""Storm Windows"":
This lonely afternoon of memories
And missed desires, while the wintry rain
(Unspeakable, the distance in the mind!)
Runs on the standing windows and away. (14-18)





, This is also useful when you need to slightly change the meaning of the quote to help the context of your essay, or when you want to omit some information that isn't relevant to the points you want to make. Here are some examples of how to put the quote in your essay in both cases:


Use brackets () to ""write in"" your own information to help readers in the context of a quote:

Mary Hodges, a twentieth-century realist writer of short stories, once wrote, ""Many women feel like they are somehow inferior to novelists, but that should not be the case""(88).


Use ellipses (…) to omit any parts of a quote that isn't necessary for your essay. Here's an example:

Smith believes that many Ivy League students ""feel that teaching isn't as ambitious a profession…as banking""(90).



, If you want to cite a quote that has more than one author, then you'll have to separate the names by commas and the word ""and"". Here's how it will look:


Many studies find that MFA programs ""are the single biggest factor for helping first-time writers publish their work""(Clarke, Owen, and Kamoe 56).

, It can be tricky to cite quotes form the Internet because you won't be able to find page numbers. Still, you should try to find out as much information as you can, such as the author, the year, or the name of the essay or article. Here are two examples:



One online film critic said that Trust was ""the single-most embarrassing film produced in Canada within the last decade""(Jenkins, ""Blame Canada!"").

Wedding guru Rachel Seaton stated in her well-regarded blog that ""Every woman is a bridezilla at heart""(2012, ""Godzilla in a Tux."").

, To cite a short quote (under 40 words) in APA formatting, you'll just have to make sure to include the author's last name, the year, and the page number (along with ""p."" to indicate it) somewhere in the quotation. Here are some examples of different ways to do this:According to McKinney (2012), ""Yoga is the best method of stress relief for Americans over twenty today"" (p.54).

McKinney found that, ""100 adults who did yoga at least three times a week were found to have lower blood pressure, better sleeping patterns, and fewer everyday frustrations""(2012, p.55).
She also said, ""Yoga is far superior to running or biking, in terms of stress relief""(McKinney, 2012, p.60).

, To cite a long quote in APA formatting, you'll have to place the quote in a free-standing block. You should start the quote on a new line, indent it 1/2 of an inch from the left margin, and then type the whole quote using that same margin. If the quote has multiple paragraphs, then you can indent the first line of another paragraph an extra 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the new margin. Maintain double spacing throughout the quote, citing it afterwards in parentheses after the final punctuation. The same rule applies here as for shorter quotes -- you'll have to to cite the author, year, and page somewhere, whether it's in the introduction or in the body of the quote. Here's an example:McKinney's study (2011) found the following:
High school English teachers who practiced 100 minutes of yoga per week over the course of a month were able to build better relationships with their students, feel more empathy towards their students and coworkers, feel less stress about grading and other daily tasks, and to even find new meaning in the same novels they had been teaching for many years. (57-59).





, If you're paraphrasing a quote in APA style, then you should refer to the author and the year of publication, as well as the page number that you are paraphrasing from. Here's what you can do:


McKinney believes that yoga is a form of therapy, both physical and mental (2012, p.99).
According to McKinney, yoga should be mandatory in all public schools (2012, p.55).

, If you're putting a quote in an APA style essay that has more than one author, then you'll just have to use the ampersand (the ""&"" symbol) to combine the names of the two authors, in alphabetical order. Here is an example:In the end, it was found that ""Students who watch television instead of reading develop much smaller vocabularies""(Hoffer & Grace, 2008, p.50).

, When you're citing from the Internet, you're just going to have to do the best you can to find the name of the author, the date, and the paragraph number instead of the page. Here is an example:In her article, Smith wrote that ""The world does not need another blog""(2012, para.3).
When you don't have the name of the author, use the name of the article instead. If there is no date, write ""n.d."" instead of the date. Like this:

Another study found that extra help after school was invaluable in student success (""Students and Tutoring,"" n.d.).

Set up your supplies.,
Write your topic in the center of the page.This can be just a word or two, or it can be the thesis you have already decided on.,
Write down your associations.,
Draw empty bubbles if you're stuck.,
Sketch, don't draw.,
Use an online template instead.",How to Plan an Essay Using a Mind Map1," You will need a piece of paper, a writing utensil, and some colored pencils or markers. Pull out a few of the colored pencils or markers and assign meaning to a few of them. For instance, you may say that orange is for topics you need to research further, a green marker is for an essential point, purple is for counterarguments, and yellow is for supporting examples.


Lay out the colored markers or pencils to which you have assigned meaning.
Orient your paper so that it is in landscape position.;
, If you are writing about disability advocacy, for example, you could either write ""Disability"" or you could write ""Disability is a socially and environmentally imposed issue rather than an inherent physical reality."" It just depends where you are in your thinking!


Circle your topic.

, Start writing any words or ideas that relate to the topic at hand. Draw them each in their own bubble, then draw lines to connect them to the main idea and to each other using the colors that apply. You can draw your lines as arrows, branches, or whatever other shape seems relevant.


Each thing you write down may give you another association. Write that down as well. For instance, writing ""Impairment vs. disability"" might remind you of ""wheelchair ramps.""
Try to cluster related thoughts together (""wheelchair ramps""—""access to public life""), but don't worry if it doesn't always happen—you can draw a line between things you wish to connect.
Look for connections between your unrelated thoughts and jot them into the picture.

, If you would like to take a more organized approach, you can pre-map your ideas. You might draw several bubbles and label them ""Who"" ""What"" ""Where"" ""When"" ""How"" and ""Why,"" for instance. Then fill them in.


You might also label them ""supporting argument,"" ""evidence,"" ""counterargument"" etc.

, Work swiftly so that your associations keep flowing. Don't pause to illustrate or trace perfectly straight lines—instead, try to write and sketch quickly, at the speed of your associations.


Include doodles if they occur to you, but again, don't get caught up in making them perfect.

, Some people type faster than they draw, or think better if they can look at an already organized structure. If drawing by hand isn't doing it for you, you can try an online template instead.While there are plenty of programs available for purpose, you can also use free online mapping tools like Bubble.us, Mind42, or Coggle.

Label your map.,
Redraw the map if it gets messy.,
Keep your map by your side as you write.",How to Plan an Essay Using a Mind Map2," Once you have a map, think about the way the ideas will fit into your paper. Label the bubbles according to the section of your paper they belong to. If you have to write a certain number of paragraphs, you can organize your bubbles into paragraphs. If you are thinking more about arguments and counterarguments, you can organize your map into those instead.


Add details as you go. For instance, you may write some of the sources you are planning to use to the sections of your essay to which they apply.

, If you have gone through many revisions as you drew, and it's hard to read the map, redraw it with all associated ideas grouped together into the sections of your paper.


If you do this, you can start by drawing bubbles for the sections and continue by filling in the thoughts and associations.
You can also organize your revised mind map into bubble for topic sentences that branch into smaller bubbles for supporting arguments and evidence.
Once you've done this, you practically have a rough draft of your paper.

, Referring to your map, type up the main ideas and supporting ideas that you have now organized. Group them into several lines each, separated by a space. These will become the paragraphs or sections of your essay.


Start each paragraph with a sentence that introduces the ideas of that paragraph, and write until you have incorporated all the information for that section.
If you end up adding things that weren't on your map, look at your map to check that they fit, and consider penciling them in. One of the virtues of the map is that it keeps you on topic.

Add to your intro and conclusion.",How to Meet an Essay Word Limit," As you count, be sure that you have the word limit in mind. This will help you know how many more words you have to write.;
, This step may not add too many words, but it still may add a few. It will help you know whether any sentences in your essay may sound weird or unusual.


Anytime you get stuck; read it again to see whether any additional phrases or words flow out from reading over it.
Also, some more thoughts may come to mind if you copy it over, and they probably will follow well from what you already have written.

, Even if you are sure that you've researched the topic as much as you can, do it once more. You may find new information to add to your essay that you've missed.

, For example, ""He had many great works, like"" can be changed to ""He had many great works, such as"" and it will give you an extra word. Focus on your body in this step, as opposed to your intro and conclusion.

,,, The intro and conclusion are two of the potentially most important sections in your essay. The intro, because it introduces your readers to your essay, and the conclusion, because it brings your essay to a close. Be sure that these two paragraphs do just that, and if they don't, add to them so they do.


Do not start the essay with ""Hello, my name is _______ and today I will be writing about ________. Instead, start it with the thing that you will be talking about. That should be the first or second word in the essay.
Also, do not end your essay with ""Thank you for reading this essay."" This makes the essay look unprofessional.

Read the essay out loud to catch inconsistencies or choppiness.",How to Organize an Essay," In general, essays have the same basic components: an introduction that sets the stage for your essay, body paragraphs that discuss your ideas and arguments, and a conclusion that wraps everything up. However, depending on the type of essay you’re writing, you may need to choose different organizational schemes.For example, a high-school AP essay should have a very clear structure, with your introduction and thesis statement first, 3-4 body paragraphs that further your argument, and a conclusion that ties everything together.
On the other hand, a creative nonfiction essay might wait to present the thesis till the very end of the essay and build up to it.
A compare-and-contrast essay can be organized so that you compare two things in a single paragraph and then have a contrasting paragraph, or you can organize it so that you compare and contrast a single thing in the same paragraph.
You can also choose to organize your essay chronologically, starting at the beginning of the work or historical period you’re discussing and going through to the end. This can be helpful for essays where chronology is important to your argument (like a history paper or lab report), or if you’re telling a story in your essay.
Persuasive essays can have several different organizational structures:

The “support” structure begins with your thesis laid out clearly in the beginning and supports it through the rest of the essay.
The “discovery” structure builds to the thesis by moving through points of discussion until the thesis seems the inevitable, correct view.
The “exploratory” structure looks at the pros and cons of your chosen topic. It presents the various sides and usually concludes with your thesis.



, If you’ve been given an assignment or prompt, read it carefully. It’s crucial to understand what your instructor is asking for before you organize and write your essay.If you haven’t been given an assignment, you can always run ideas by your instructor or advisor to see if they’re on track.
Ask questions about anything you don’t understand. It’s much better to ask questions before you put hours of work into your essay than it is to have to start over because you didn’t clarify something. As long as you’re polite, almost all instructors will be happy to answer your questions.

, How you organize your essay will also depend on what your writing task is. This is usually in the assignment or prompt. Look for keywords like “describe,” “analyze,” “discuss,” or “compare.” These will tell you what your writing “job” is -- what the essay needs to accomplish., If you’re in school, deciding on your audience could be fairly easy: it’s probably your instructor. However, it’s still important to consider to whom your writing is addressed. This is doubly important when you don’t have an audience specified by someone else.For example, are you writing an opinion essay for your school newspaper? Your fellow students are probably your audience in this case. However, if you’re writing an opinion essay for the local newspaper, your audience could be people who live in your town, people who agree with you, people who don’t agree with you, people who are affected by your topic, or any other group you want to focus on.

, The last thing you want to do is wait to start organizing your essay until the last minute. The earlier you can get a handle on your essay’s organization, the easier it will be for you to write the essay. Give yourself plenty of time for the multiple stages of essay planning., Make this a unique observation, a powerful argument, an interpretation of a particular work or event, or another relevant statement that is not simply stating the obvious or summarizing a larger work.A thesis statement acts as the “road map” for your paper. It tells your audience what to expect from the rest of your essay.
A good thesis statement is usually disputable, meaning someone might challenge or oppose your idea. While that can sound scary, it’s crucial to have a disputable thesis, because otherwise you’re probably arguing something that’s so obvious it’s not worth spending time on.
Include the most salient points within your thesis statement. For example, your thesis may be about the similarity between two literary works. Describe the similarities in general terms within your thesis statement.
Consider the “So what?” question. A good thesis will explain why your idea or argument is important. Ask yourself: if a friend asked you “So what?” about your thesis, would you have an answer?
The “3-prong thesis” is common in high school essays, but is often frowned upon in college and advanced writing. Don’t feel like you have to restrict yourself to this limited form.
Revise your thesis statement. If in the course of writing your essay you discover important points that were not touched upon in your thesis, edit your thesis.

, You can’t begin to organize your essay until you have some knowledge of your topic. If your argument or analysis requires outside research, make sure you do it before you start organizing.


If you have a librarian available, don’t be afraid to consult with him or her! Librarians are trained in helping you identify credible sources for research and can get you started in the right direction.

, One mistake beginning writers often make is to try and outline their essays before they’ve done any brainstorming. This can leave you frustrated because you don’t yet know what you want to say. Trying a few brainstorming techniques can generate enough material for you to work with.Try freewriting. With freewriting, you don’t edit or stop yourself. You just write (say, for 15 minutes at a time) about anything that comes into your head about your topic.
Try a mind map. Start by writing down your central topic or idea, and then draw a box around it. Write down other ideas and connect them to see how they relate.Try cubing. With cubing, you consider your chosen topic from 6 different perspectives: 1) Describe it, 2) Compare it, 3) Associate it, 4) Analyze it, 5) Apply it, 6) Argue for and against it.

, Once you’ve done your research and brainstorming, you may find that you have a new perspective that informs your argument. Go back and change your thesis accordingly.


If your original thesis was very broad, you can also use this chance to narrow it down. For example, a thesis about “slavery and the Civil War” is way too big to manage, even for a doctoral dissertation. Focus on more specific terms, which will help you when you start you organize your outline., Use your thesis statement to determine the trajectory of your outline. For example, if you will compare and contrast two different topics, outline the similarities and the differences.


Determine the order in which you will discuss the points. If you’re planning to discuss 3 challenges of a particular management strategy, you might capture your reader's attention by discussing them in the order of most problematic to least. Or you might choose to build the intensity of your essay by starting with the smallest problem first.

, Don’t feel like you have to copy the structure of the source you’re drawing from or discussing. For example, a very common mistake in beginning essays written about literature is to reiterate the plot point-by-point, building your argument along with it. Instead, focus on the most important idea of each paragraph. Even if you have to present your evidence in a different order than it appears in your source, your paragraph will have a better flow.For example, a solid paragraph about Hamlet’s insanity could draw from several different scenes in which he appears to act insane. Even though these scenes don’t all cluster together in the original play, discussing them together will make a lot more sense than trying to discuss the whole play from start to finish.

, A clear topic sentence will assist with essay organization. Devote each paragraph to discussing only the point of its topic sentence. Discussing tangential information will create a disorganized essay.Ensure that your topic sentence is directly related to your main argument. Avoid statements that may be on the general topic, but not directly relevant to your thesis.
Make sure that your topic sentence offers a “preview” of your paragraph’s argument or discussion. Many beginning writers forget to use the first sentence this way, and end up with sentences that don’t give a clear direction for the paragraph.
For example, compare these two first sentences: “Thomas Jefferson was born in 1743” and “Thomas Jefferson, who was born in 1743, became one of the most important people in America by the end of the 18th century.”
The first sentence doesn’t give a good direction for the paragraph. It states a fact but leaves the reader clueless about the fact’s relevance. The second sentence contextualizes the fact and lets the reader know what the rest of the paragraph will discuss.

, Create coherence for your essay by using transitional words that connect each paragraph to the one before it. Beginning paragraphs with words such as ""likewise"" and ""in contrast"" will allow your reader to follow your train of thought.Transitions help underline your essay’s overall organizational logic. For example, beginning a paragraph with something like “Despite the many points in its favor, Mystic Pizza also has several elements that keep it from being the best pizza in town” allows your reader to understand how this paragraph connects to what has come before.
Transitions can also be used inside paragraphs. They can help connect the ideas within a paragraph smoothly so your reader can follow them.
If you’re having a lot of trouble connecting your paragraphs, your organization may be off. Try the revision strategies elsewhere in this article to determine whether your paragraphs are in the best order.
The Writing Center at the University of Wisconsin - Madison has a handy list of transitional words and phrases, along with the type of transition they indicate., Include a restatement of your thesis using other words and summarize your essay's main points. To create a captivating conclusion, offer insights about the implications of your argument or findings for further thought or investigation.You can try returning to your original idea or theme and adding another layer of sophistication to it. Your conclusion can show how necessary your essay is to understanding something about the topic that readers would not have been prepared to understand before.
For some types of essays, a call to action or appeal to emotions can be quite helpful in a conclusion. Persuasive essays often use this technique.
Avoid hackneyed phrases like “In sum” or “In conclusion.” They come across as stiff and cliched on paper.

, It’s very common, and completely okay, for your argument to evolve as you write it. This allows your argument to achieve depth and richness. However, it can also mean that your essay ends up feeling disorganized. Reverse-outlining your essay once you’ve finished drafting it will help you determine what the argument looks like now, and what it needs to look like.You can reverse-outline on the computer or on a printed draft, whichever you find easier.
As you read through your essay, summarize the main idea (or ideas) of each paragraph in a few key words. You can write these on a separate sheet, on your printed draft, or as a comment in a word processing document.
Look at your key words. Do the ideas progress in a logical fashion? Or does your argument jump around?
If you’re having trouble summarizing the main idea of each paragraph, it’s a good sign that your paragraphs have too much going on. Try splitting your paragraphs up.

, If you’re having trouble organizing your paragraphs, print out your essay and cut up your essay by paragraphs. Try physically putting the paragraphs in a different order. Do things make better sense in a different structure?


You may also find with this technique that your topic sentences and transitions aren’t as strong as they could be. Ideally, your paragraphs should have only one way they could be organized for maximum effectiveness. If you can put your paragraphs in any order and the essay still kind of makes sense, you may not be building your argument effectively.

, Don’t commit yourself to your original outline. You may find after reverse-outlining that some paragraphs would make better sense elsewhere in your essay. Move things around, making changes to topic sentences and transitions where necessary.


For example, you might find that placing your least important argument at the beginning drains your essay of vitality. Experiment with the order of the sentences and paragraphs for heightened effect.

, It can be super painful, but sometimes, that beautiful paragraph you worked so hard on just doesn’t belong in your newly organized essay. Don’t get so married to your ideas that you can’t cut what needs to be cut for logic, flow, and argument.

, You may find that your essay abruptly changes direction or some of your paragraphs contain unnecessary sentences or information. Use a highlighter or pencil to mark places that don’t sound right, and then go back to correct them.

Add another body paragraph.,
Use more support.,
Seek help from a teacher or a librarian.",How to Fluff up a Paper to Make It Look Longer1," A well-researched paper is bound to have more content. Don’t be afraid to use outside sources to bolster your argument. Go to your school library or local library to search the stacks and online databases for sources relating to your topic.Jstor and Project Gutenberg are two good resources for academic writing. Oftentimes your school will allow you free access to these sites. Ask your teacher for help on finding sources.;
, Writing an outline lets your organize your arguments and ideas in a coherent way. Divide your outline into the sections your plan to use in your paper. For example, you might have one section entitled “Introduction,” followed by “First body paragraph, Second Body Paragraph, Third Body Paragraph,” and “Conclusion.”Put in the supporting evidence and quotes that you plan to use in your outline. Make sure to have lots of different possible examples to choose from.
Writing an outline helps you to see what sections are strong enough to be expanded on further for extra length.

, If you’re looking to fill more space in a constructive way, try adding a counterargument. Not only does expanding on a counterargument lengthen your paper, but it actually makes your paper stronger by showing that you are able to account for different perspectives.You can either weave counterargument into your pre-existing body paragraphs or add separate paragraphs to account for them. A good way to introduce a counterargument is with a sentence such as: “While some believe that eating a plant based diet is the key to health, others point to the French diet that is rich in cheese and dairy as an example of a different approach to a healthy lifestyle.”

, Don’t feel like you have to be locked into the typical five paragraph essay. After making your outline, see if you can add another short paragraph or two to elaborate on an existing point or add a completely new one.


If you’re stuck on coming up with an idea for a new paragraph, re-read some of your source materials for quotes that strike you as interesting. Once you’ve found a few, see if you can craft another argument around some of those examples.

, It never hurts to add in a few more quotes to back up your argument. This is why it is important when making an outline to add lots of different possible quotations to use in your paper. If you’re struggling to make a paper long enough, try adding one of those extra quotations is as extra support and then adding a few sentences of your own analysis after., Research librarians are great resources when it comes to writing papers. Schedule a meeting with a school librarian and you will leave the meeting with more sources than you’ll know what to do with.Your teacher will be more than happy to help if you’re having trouble with a paper. Don’t be shy! It’s their job to give you guidance.
You can also ask a friend to peer edit. Having a fresh set of eyes on your paper will let you see things in a new way.

Replace pronouns with more specific nouns.,
Be poetic.,
Add extra unnecessary words.",How to Fluff up a Paper to Make It Look Longer2," Look for places in your paper where specific nouns can be subsisted for pronouns such as “he,” “she,” “it” or “they.” Try to use people’s full name, proper nouns, and descriptive nouns in place of pronouns.Instead of saying ""He found it"", say ""Johnny found the apple.""
If you’re referring to a specific person, such as George Washington, use his first and last name throughout the entire paper instead of shortening to “Washington.”

, Use lots of flowery language. Adding lots of adverbs and adjectives will make your sentences longer and oftentimes will improve their quality.


Instead of saying “The Great Gatsby is an important work of fiction,” say “The Great Gatsby is a seminal work of literature that has influenced aspiring writers since its publication in the early twentieth century.”
Use the words really, very, and truly when possible. Don’t overdo it, though – your teacher is bound to notice too many adverbs.

, Nowadays, we often overlook certain articles, such as extra ""the""s or ""a""s and words like ""because"", ""that"", and ""so"". Add these, they'll definitely add some lines.


Instead of saying, ""We couldn't go to the house, Amy thought it was haunted."" Say ""We couldn't go to the house because Amy thought that it was haunted.""

Increase the spacing between lines.,
Change the size of the font.,
Add extra spaces after periods.,
Increase the margins.,
Change the font.,
Don’t use every one of these tricks.",How to Fluff up a Paper to Make It Look Longer3," Most papers are supposed to be double spaced, but it’s very difficult to tell the difference between 2.0 spacing and 2.2 spacing. Your teacher is not likely to measure the line spacing to make sure it’s exact, and using 2.1 or 2.2 spacing can go a long way towards making your paper a bit longer.To change the spacing in Microsoft word, go to the Format tab, then click on Paragraph.
Once in Paragraph, click on line spacing and change to “Multiple.” Then in the “At” tab write in 2.1 or 2.2.

, You can also change the font size just a bit to make words take up a bit more space on the page. Most teachers want papers written in size 12 font, but likely won’t notice if your font is instead 12.5., Adding two spaces instead of one after periods will make your paper longer, and it’s not a very obvious change.


Here is an example of a sentence with one space after the period: “The 20th century saw many changes. Not only were there two World Wars, but also the growth of industry and technology.”
This is the same sentence with two spaces after the period. The difference is barely noticeable: “The 20th century saw many changes. Not only were there two World Wars, but also the growth of industry and technology.”
You can also change the font size of the periods to 13 or 14. This goes for all forms of punctuation. Again, this trick is largely unnoticeable., Increasing the size of the margins to around 1.25 decreases the number of words per page. Having fewer words on a page makes your paper have more pages, and you don’t have to write anything extra.To increase the size of the margins, click on the Toolbox Icon and go to the section entitled “Document Margins.”
From there, set your margins to 1.25. This size is big enough to make a difference but small enough to not be too noticeable.

, If your teacher doesn’t require a specific font, there are some options outside of Times New Roman that will make your paper longer. A good choice is Bookman Old Style, which still appears formal but takes up more space. Don’t use something too obvious like Comic Sans.

, Your teacher will notice if the margins, font size, and spacing have all increased, plus the font is different and you’ve suddenly become a poet. When writing a paper, it’s best to put in the effort to make your paper meet the page requirement through thorough research and clear, effective writing. Only use one or two tricks to fluff up your paper if it becomes dire. Otherwise you risk getting caught by your teacher and having your grade lowered.

These key terms should act like a brief one to two word summary of the essay.Keep in mind good titles never state the obvious or contain generic terms or phrases. Titles like “Paper on 1950s China” or “Report on Shakespeare” are too general and do not give the reader a sense of the content of your paper. Avoid general and non specific terms like “society” “culture” “the world” or “mankind” in your title.

, This is the final part of the title that tells the reader where the content is located or what the setting of the essay will be. Depending on your topic, your source material may be another piece of writing, the name of a text, a geographic place or a person.For example, a paper about Mao’s Great Leap Forward in Communist China in the late 1950s may have a title that has a hook (catchy phrase), one or two key terms, and the source or location (1950s Communist China). A possible title could be: “The Failure of One, the Fall of Many: Mao’s Great Leap Forward in 1950’s Communist China”.

, Is your essay a straightforward, academic essay? Or is it a more free form, narrative essay? If your essay is about the Great Leap Forward in Communist China in the late 1950s, your title may not be a playful or humorous one. It may be more informative and to the point. But if your essay is about the development of Shakespearean comedy in Elizabethan times, you may have a less serious tone for your title. Match the tone of your title to the tone of your essay.For example, the title of an essay about the Great Leap Forward might be something simple, professional, and clear, such as: ""The Failure of the Great Leap Forward: China in the late 1950s"". An essay about Shakespearean comedy may be more playful, such as: ""Love's Labour Lost and Other Comedies.""

, You can also sum up the thesis for your essay in three words or less. Take out a piece of paper and write down the three words. Then, see if you can place commas or colons between them to create a title.For example, an essay about the Great Leap Forward in 1950s China may focus on the failed use of industries like steel and farming by Mao’s government and the resulting mass famine in China. Three words that sum up the paper may be: steel, land, famine. A possible title of the essay could be: “Steel, Land, and Famine: The Failure of the Great Leap Forward”.

, In a traditional, five paragraph essay, your introduction should include your thesis and the general ideas in your essay. Your conclusion should also restate your thesis and sum up your analysis. Both sections may be good places to find keywords that could lead to a strong title for your essay.Look for two to three keywords that are short, descriptive, and clear. Consider if the words fit together in some way, or how they are very different. For example, your introduction on 1950s China may have keywords like “industrialization” “collectivization” and “collapse”. A possible title for the essay could then be: “The Collapse of Collectivization in 1950s China”.
In an essay on the conventions of Shakespearean comedy, the tone of the essay may be less serious or rigid, and you can look for keywords that are playful or humorous. For example, your conclusion may have keywords like “lovers” “obstacles” and “improbable” or “supernatural”. A possible title for the essay could then be: “Lovers in an Improbable Situation: The Conventions of Shakespearean Comedy.”

, Using the description of an image will give your reader a visual that will then frame the rest of the essay. Think of a bold or striking image that can be summed up in one to three words.For example, a paper about a volcano could have the title: “The Day the Earth Bled: The Eruption of Mount Vesuvius”.

, A strong essay will use quotations and phrases from source material throughout. Read through the quotes used in your essay for ones that seem particularly strong or powerful. Look for quotes or phrases that sum up your essay as a whole or highlight a central theme or idea in your essay.For example, an essay on Shakespearean comedy may quote A Midsummer Night’s Dream, where a character named Theseus professes his love to his betrothed, the Amazonian queen Hippolyta. “Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword/ And won thy love doing thee injuries,/ But I will wed thee in another key,/With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.”A possible title for the essay may then be: “With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling: The Conventions of Shakespearean Comedy”.
Alternatively, you can look up a key quote or phrase that is not in your essay but reinforces central ideas or themes in your essay. Type keywords from your essay into a search engine, along with the word “quote” and see what comes up. You can then take a fragment of the quote and use it in your title.
For example, for an essay on Mao’s Great Leap Forward, you may use quotes from propaganda posters for the Great Leap Forward made by the Mao government, which are available online. A propaganda quote like “Brave the wind and the waves, everything has remarkable abilities” could be shortened to a title like: “Brave the wind and the waves: False Promises by Mao’s The Great Leap Forward”., Think of a common phrase or sentence, also known as a cliche, and reword it so it is specific to your essay for a catchy title. Use short cliches or familiar phrases that are one to three words long.An essay on Shakespearean comedy could use the cliche “laughter is the best medicine” and change it into “laughter is thy best medicine.” A possible title could be: “Laughter is Thy Best Medicine: The Conventions of Shakespearean Comedy”.

, Clever word play can give your title some punch and show that you are willing to be creative. Use an existing phrase and play around with replacing words in the phrase or adding a new spin to the phrase.For example, an essay about missionaries in West Africa during the colonial period could have a title that plays on two key words, such as: “Prophets or profits: The European Colonial Invasion of West Africa”.

Consider the “So what?” question.,
List the main ideas in your essay.,
Look for any themes you introduced in the first paragraph.,
Consider whether you can link your argument to a different context.,
Start with a small transition (optional).,
Briefly summarize some of the main points.,
Keep it short and sweet.,
Be sure to work your thesis statement, if you have one, into the conclusion in one way or another.,
Write authoritatively on your subject.,
End with a flourish.,
Avoid just restating your thesis.,
Resist the urge to quote.,
Don't use fluffy language.,
Keep new material out of the conclusion.,
Don't focus on a minor point or issue in the essay.",How to End an Essay," A helpful way to generate your conclusion can be to imagine that your reader has just asked you “So what?” about your argument. Why does what you’ve written matter? What can you say in your conclusion to help convince your readers that they should care about your ideas and argument?Asking yourself the “so what?” question as you write your essay can also help you dig below the surface of your ideas.;
, Having a sense of what your argument’s main ideas were will help you know what you need to include in the conclusion. You don’t have to cram every point and subpoint into the conclusion: just hit the important things.Knowing your essay’s focus will also help you avoid introducing any new information or topics in your conclusion.

, You can get a nice sense of closure by returning to the theme you opened with.See if you can take that theme a step further when you bring it back in the conclusion.For example, if you began your essay with the idea of humanity’s sense of smallness in the face of space’s vast expanses, you could return to that idea in the conclusion. However, you might expand this theme to include the idea that as human knowledge grows, space is actually becoming smaller.

, One helpful way to conclude an essay is to extend your discussion’s relevance to a broader “big picture” context. This helps your reader understand how they could apply the arguments you made to another topic, giving your essay a bigger sense of purpose.For example, you could extend an essay on “Orange is the New Black” to the American culture of imprisonment in general.

, This can be a cue to your reader that you're ending your essay, and that they need to pay attention. Though a lot of essays begin their last paragraph with a transition, you don't need to if you feel like it's clear enough that you are ending your essay. The transition can be very simple.


You should probably stay away from overused phrases such as “In conclusion,” “To summarize,” or “In closing.” Because they are used so often, they come across as cliched and stiff., Try taking the first sentences of each body paragraph (your topic sentences) and rewriting their main points in two or three sentences. This will reinforce your essay's argument, reminding the reader what you were talking about, or arguing for.


Avoid summarizing your points exactly as you wrote them. Your readers have already read your essay. They don’t have to be reminded of every single point you just made.

, There’s no hard and fast rule for how long your conclusion should be, but for many high school and college essays, a good rule of thumb is that your conclusion should be anywhere from 5 to 7 sentences long. Any less, and you probably haven't summarized your points enough; any more, and you're probably rambling on a bit too much.

, If you have a thesis, you should reference it as you end your essay, even if it's only in passing. Remember, your thesis is the main point of your essay, something you're arguing for. If someone who reads your conclusion still doesn't know what your thesis is, you haven't done a good-enough job of telling them.


Find a way to rework your thesis in an interesting way, using different language. Restating your thesis using the same words strikes the reader as lazy and doesn’t offer new insight into your argument.

, Sounding authoritative means using the right words (as opposed to just any old words), relying on solid evidence from other sources, and believing in your own ability to write.Don’t apologize for your ideas or use heavily qualifying language.For example, instead of saying ""That's why I think that Abraham Lincoln was the best American President in the 19th century,"" say ""That's why Abraham Lincoln was the best American President in the 19th century."" The reader already knows that if you write about Lincoln being the best President, you also believe it. Saying ""I think"" sounds like you're hedging and makes you sound less authoritative.
Another example: Don't apologize for your views. They're your ideas, so take ownership of them. Never say something like ""I may not be an expert"" or ""At least this is my opinion,""as this weakens your reliability.

, Your last sentence should be elegant, to the point, and provocative. This is easier said than done. But it all starts with illustrating the point of your essay. Ask yourself What is my essay about, and what am I saying? and then move on from there.End with a little bit of irony. Be playful with your last sentence and pose an ironic by-product of what you're talking about. Then, the end of your essay becomes especially provocative.
Make an appeal to emotions. Much of the time, essays are very rational, forgetting about emotions. That's why appealing to people's emotions can be a really powerful way to conclude an essay. Done in the right way, this will help the article have heart. Just make sure that your conclusion is in keeping with the tone of the rest of your essay.
Include a call to action (use sparingly). If your essay is truly about getting people to change, then including a call to action is a useful tool to rouse your base. But use it sparingly: In the wrong context (an expository essay, or an argumentative essay) it can be overkill.

, A common problem with many conclusions is that they simply restate the thesis and summarize what’s already been said. This doesn’t give your readers a compelling reason to read the conclusion -- they already know what it’s going to say.Instead, try to take your reader to the “next level” in your conclusion, or provide some further sophistication to your original ideas.

, There is usually no need to clog up the ending of your essay with quotes and analysis — that should have been what you were doing in your main paragraphs. The conclusion is the place where you tie everything together for your readers, not where you introduce new information., Don't use too many high-flying, two-dollar words in your conclusion. You want it to be readable and relatable, not rigid and boring. It’s much better to have clear, concise language than a meandering sentence stuffed with overlong words.Also don't use ""Firstly,"" ""Secondly,"" ""Thirdly,"" etc. to make/finish your points. Make it clear what you're saying and how many points you're making.

, Now is not the time to introduce new ideas or content. That takes the focus off your original argument and could confuse readers. Don’t jumble things up — relay simply where your essay has led and state what you have come to think after conducting the necessary analysis.

, The conclusion is not the time to nitpick with a small theme in your essay. In fact, it's the time to step back and focus on the big picture. Make sure your essay focuses on the heart of the essay, not one strand of hair.These words are not advanced ways to start a transition.

Use even brief windows of time before the exam to review course material.,
Select a few examples that will add dimension to key concepts and commit them to memory.,
Remember that the rest of the test might offer you helpful clues.",How to Fake an Answer to an Essay Question1," Focus on the information your instructor spent the bulk of his or her time covering in class and on course assignments. Teachers are likely to test on the material they find most important.


Take a few moments to familiarize yourself with a few key concepts from the units or topics covered since your last exam.
Avoid becoming bogged down in details when time is limited -- skim quickly through the material, then go back if you have extra time. Look for the ""big picture"" themes and topics, as these are likely to be helpful when writing an essay answer.
That being said, pay particular attention to recurring terms or specific jargon. If your instructor frequently refers to a specific term, changes are he or she finds it significant. Review frequently used jargon so you don't find yourself hung up on unfamiliar wording. You'll be disappointed later if you discover you really did know the material, but failed to recognize a key technical term or phrase!;
, Even if the examples you pick don't turn out to be directly relevant to the essay options your teacher provides, they may provide a useful tool for showing that you have been paying some attention in class.

, Most teachers will aim to test students on a variety of material, but common themes tend to repeat themselves. You likely can ""mine"" the multiple-choice or short-answer sections of the test for information to use in the essay:


Do you recognize names, dates, events, concepts, or ideas elsewhere in the test that might be relevant to the essay? Treat the rest of the test as a memory-jog for the essay.
Can you use an example stated elsewhere in the exam as an example in your essay?
Once you've finished the non-essay portion of the test, do you feel, based upon your quick review of key topics, like anything big is ""missing"" from the exam? Chances are that even if you find the language of the essay question confusing, the ""missing"" topic(s) are what the essay's meant to cover.

"
If your friend sent you the essay by email, you can edit it on screen or print it out.,
Read each sentence individually.,
Look for problems with grammar.,
Read and try to understand the content.,
Read the manuscript after your corrections.,
Make the necessary copies or save the document.,
Communicate!,
Check up and ask how they did in the end.,Onscreen editing will also help you see some things that don't crop up easily in a hard copy edit.",How to Edit a Friend's Essay," Before you do, increase the line spacing so there is space to write comments. If you print it, take out a pen or pencil. If you don't think you'll have enough space, get some extra lined paper. If the copy you were given is an actual printout (hard copy), make a photocopy or write all your suggestions on another sheet so they can read the original copy in the end. You can also use a highlighter pen, yellow is often good because it does not affect photocopying.;
, If you find a spelling error, circle it or write it down. Spelling is the easiest thing to notice in terms of errors. You can run spell check on a digital copy if unsure or you can look up unknown words in a dictionary. Remember that the spell-check on computers isn't perfect (e.g. they're, there, their).

, Punctuation is a good place to start. If your friend used a comma in the wrong place, for example, take note of it and explain it to them later. If you are not going to see them later or the essay is due before you can really talk to them about it, write why the comma is wrong and what to do about it. Other grammatical things to look for include misplaced words and confusing or run-on sentences and starting sentences with the word but. Again, a computer program or dictionary can help you locate these things if your friend missed them.

, Once you're finished with the grammar check and are positive that the essay is perfectly spelled and organized, read it again for sense! Look at your friend's reasoning and thesis statements. Do they make sense? Can you follow their arguments? Are any points off-topic or difficult to understand? Make notes about this! This part is absolutely the most important since content is usually what scores you the most points on writing assignments. The number one thing to remember about this is to never ""change"" your friend's writing. Even if it's tempting to put in a synonym you think sounds better or alter the order of a sentence, it is their work and it is in their own voice. If you truly think something they said is wrong/badly explained, perhaps underline it and tell them why it is cloudy or jumbled.

, Before you hastily send it away, read it over, check on your own corrections, and maybe add some compliments! You want your friend to feel like you're looking over their work and kindly nudging it in the right direction, not stabbing it to death with a red pen.


""Nice transitions!"" ""Fabulous intro!"" or ""Haha!"" at a funny part that you particularly liked can make all the difference in you and your friend's communication about their essay.

, For example, ""The Revolutionary War EDITED."" Attach both the original and the new to the email and send it to your friend.

, Perhaps you can talk on the phone or IM (outdated, but useful for fast and clear conversations) with them about what you recommend they do to improve their work. If you see them in person, have a talk about your corrections. This is important! If they don't understand what you meant by ""synonym wrong!"" they can't fix it and you edited it for nothing.

, If they got a good grade, they'll be grateful and your bond will be stronger. You'll also have become a better editor! If they didn't do so well, maybe you can look over what they got wrong with them.

Base your citation on the format where you found the poem.,
Choose a style based on your discipline or teacher's preference.",How to Quote Poetry in an Essay," When you're using a quotation in an essay, you can't just throw it out there without providing some introduction, with the exception of epigraphs. You need to provide context for the quote, even if it's just the author's name.For instance, you could introduce your quotation in this way: As Lord Byron wrote, ""....""
Epigraphs are short quotations that go at the beginning of a paper or heading, that sort of introduce your reader to the topic of your paper.;
, A short poetry quote is considered anything three lines or shorter. That's three lines of the poem, not three lines in your paragraph. When the quote is this short, you use slashes to indicate where the line breaks are.So if you're using the first two lines of Lord Byron's poem ""She Walks in Beauty,"" it would look like the following quotation: As Lord Byron writes in his poem ""She Walks in Beauty,"" ""She walks in beauty like the night / Of cloudless climes and starry skies.""Note that you add a spaces around the slash.

, When you are quoting four or more lines from a poem, you should use a block quote, which means you set the quote off from the rest of the text. Once you have your intro phrase, hit the return or enter key to start the quotation. Then, indent the whole quote by two spaces.When making a longer quote, it's better to introduce it with a full sentence and a colon rather than a phrase. Also, you don't use quotation marks with a block quote.

, For MLA style, you will need to maintain double spacing for your entire paper, including the lines from the poem you include. In Chicago style, you use single spacing for the actual block quote and double spacing for the area around the block quote and the rest of the paper.For MLA style, a long quote from Byron's poem would follow this format:
Lord Byron begins the poem ""She Walks in Beauty"" with these four lines:
            She walks in beauty like the night
            Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
            And all that's best of dark and bright
            Meet in her aspect and her eyes.

, If you've removed part of the quotation, you need to show that something is missing. The way you do that is with ellipses, which is just three dots in a row. You use the ellipses in place of what you've removed.For example, if you wanted to take ""in beauty"" out of the first line of Byron's poem, it would look like the following quotation: ""She walks ... like the night / Of cloudless climes and starry skies.""

, When you're performing literary analysis on a poem, you use quotations to back up the argument you're making about the writer. Otherwise, you don't need the quotation. Therefore, when you make a quotation, move on to talk about why you used it.For example, if you quoted the first two lines of Byron's poem, you could use it to talk about Byron's use of similes.

, At the end of the quotation, you'll use parentheses to enclose the citation. In a short quotation, the citation goes after the end quotation mark but before the period. In a long quotation, it goes after the period.For a short quote, use this format: As Lord Byron writes in his poem ""She Walks in Beauty,"" ""She walks in beauty like the night / Of cloudless climes and starry skies"" (citation).
Follow this example for a blockquote:
Lord Byron begins the poem ""She Walks in Beauty"" with these four lines:
            She walks in beauty like the night
            Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
            And all that's best of dark and bright
            Meet in her aspect and her eyes. (citation)

, If your entre paper is about the poem, then you do not need to include the author’s name in the in-text citations. However, if you are writing about two or more poems, then you will need to include the author’s name in the sentence or in-text citations. If you don't introduce the quote with the author's name, then you can place the name in the citation. It will follow the open parenthesis without a space as the beginning of the citation. Just use the last name of the author followed by the line numbers. If you did use the author’s name in a sentence, then just provide the line numbers.Add the name in like the following quote: The poem ""She Walks in Beauty"" begins with the following lines: ""She walks in beauty like the night / Of cloudless climes and starry skies"" (Byron 1-2).
If the poem is anonymous or uncredited, such as “I Eat My Peas with Honey,” then use a shortened form of the title: (""I Eat"" 1-2), The other part of the citation is to include the line numbers of the poem you cited. For instance, in the short quote example, the first two lines of the poem are cited, so you note that you used line one and two.Follow this example: The poem ""She Walks in Beauty"" begins with the following lines: ""She walks in beauty like the night / Of cloudless climes and starry skies"" (Byron 1-2).
If you skip a line, use a comma to separate the the numbers. For instance, if you use lines 1 and 3, it would look like this example: (Byron 1, 3).

, A citation usually begins with the author or editor's name. In this case, the author's full name is Lord George Gordon Byron. Start with the last name, followed by the first and middle. In this case, you'll include the ""Lord"" after his other names since that's how he's commonly known, but you don't usually include titles.The beginning of the citation would follow this format: Byron, George Gordon, Lord.
If the poem's author is anonymous, start with the title of the poem.

, The title of the poem comes next, as it is what MLA calls ""the title of source"" in the 8th edition. Put the title in quotation marks. Also, follow the title with a period before the end quotation mark.Continue the citation in this manner: Byron, George Gordon, Lord. ""She Walks in Beauty.""
Be sure to capitalize important words in the title.

, The container is where you found the poem. It could be a book, such as an anthology of poems. It could also be a website or even a scholarly journal. It doesn't matter. You just need to cite where you found the poem, usually using italics.The citation would continue in this way, since this poem is from the Poetry Foundation: Byron, George Gordon, Lord. ""She Walks in Beauty."" Poetry Foundation,


, Normally, you also add information like other contributors, the volume, and the issue number, if its applicable. If it's not, as it is in this case, you leave it out. Place commas in between the information if it is included.This particular citation has none of these attributes, so leave them blank.

, If the poem you used has a publisher, you add it next. In the case of a website, the publisher is sometimes the same as the website but not always. If it's the same, you only need to place it once. In other cases, you'll find the publisher on the back side of the title page.In this case, the publisher is the Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute.


Here's how the citation looks so far: Byron, George Gordon, Lord. ""She Walks in Beauty."" Poetry Foundation, Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute,

, Next, the citation uses the date. The date is the publication date, the year. You use a comma to separate it from the publisher. However, in the case of a website, you don't need to add a date. You can add the date you accessed it if you wish.If you were to add a date, it would look like the following citation: Byron, George Gordon, Lord. ""She Walks in Beauty."" Poetry Foundation, Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute, 2 August 2016,

, The location is the page numbers where you found the poem in the collection. For example, you may have found the poem on page numbers 66 to 68, which you'd write this way: pp. 66-68. However, in this case, the ""location"" is the web address where you found the information.Here's the final citation: Byron, George Gordon, Lord. ""She Walks in Beauty."" Poetry Foundation, Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute, www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43844.
Don't add ""http://"" or ""https://"" before the web address.

, As noted, you'll sometimes need to use other citation styles when quoting poetry. For example, though APA is generally used in the sciences, you may need to use APA style to quote poetry in some essays. For an in-text citation, the style is much the same as MLA.For example, with APA, the in-text citation would appear this way: ""She walks in beauty like the night / Of cloudless climes and starry skies"" (Byron 1-2).
Just like MLA, you'll use the author's name and line numbers. However, if the poem doesn't have line numbers, you can just use an abbreviation of the title: (Byron ""She Walks"").

, In APA, the date is given preference over the title because the style is used more often in the sciences. Therefore, more recent publications have more weight than older research. Of course, the same is not true for poetry, as older poetry has equal merit with contemporary poetry, but you still must give the date preference in the reference. If the source doesn't have a date, as is often the case with online documents, you'll use ""n.d."" for ""no date."" Otherwise, you'd use the year in the parentheses.For APA, use this format with the example from throughout this article: Byron, G. G. (1813). ""She Walks in Beauty."" Poetry Foundation. Retrieved from www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43844
Note that APA uses initials rather than full first and middle names. This structure is in place to discourage gender bias.

, Chicago is most often used in history and religion, though it can be used in other disciplines as well. It differs from MLA and APA in that you'll use a footnote rather than a typical in-text citation. A footnote places a number in the text that refers to a citation at the bottom of the page. You can insert a footnote with most word processing software.In this case, the footnote would look like the following example: 1. Byron, George Gordon, Lord, ""She Walks in Beauty,"" Poetry Foundation, accessed August 2, 2016, www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43844.
You can also add a publication date (""Last modified July 2, 2016,"") before the access date.

, Chicago's reference style is similar to its footnote style, with the exception that much of the punctuation changes. It is also more similar to MLA than it is to APA, as it focuses more on humanities than sciences.For Chicago, use this format: Byron, George Gordon, Lord. ""She Walks in Beauty."" Poetry Foundation. Accessed August 2, 2016. www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43844.
Once again, you can add a publication date (""Last modified July 2, 2016,"") before the access date if it has it.

, While the citation examples used here focus on website citations, you may find a poem in other places, such as an anthology. In that case, you use the citation style for an anthology, not a website., Generally, you will use the same style for all the professors in your discipline. If you're not sure which one to choose, ask your teacher, check your syllabus, or review your assignment. Most teachers will tell you which style you need to choose. Sometimes, one style is chosen for a whole school, in which case you need to check the student handbook or ask your teacher to determine the style.


If you need more information on these styles, review the MLA Handbook, Eighth Edition; The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th Edition; the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th Edition; or Purdue's Online Writing Lab (OWL), which has information on all three.

Pull apart the text of the essay question.,
Use your resulting list as an outline.,
Indicate that you've fully read the question.,
Budget your time carefully.",How to Fake an Answer to an Essay Question2," One of the most common mistakes students make when answering essay questions is failing to address each part of a question prompt.


What is the central topic of this essay? Jot down your best guess, even if you're unsure of the material.
What type of essay is the teacher requesting? Is your instructor asking you to compare and contrast two ideas, describe a given idea or process, or compose an opinion essay? Note this information so you can compose your essay accordingly.
If you see terms such as compare, contrast, apply, cause, and relate, your teacher is asking you to demonstrate how ideas are connected.

Prove, justify, evaluate, respond, assess, support, synthesize, analyze, or argue are all clues your teacher is asking for your interpretation of the material. Keep in mind, however, that even when you're asked to interpret--state your opinion--you'll need to back up your opinion with concrete evidence.Pay particular attention to adjectives. A history essay, for example, may ask students to describe the political, economic, and social impact of an event. List these adjectives and be sure you address all three.
Also note requests for specific numbers of examples. A biology essay might ask students to provide three examples of an evolutionary process. Note ""three examples"" and be sure you address this request -- even if you need to write that you only know two.

, Jot down your notes regarding each point on the list. You will likely find that considering one element on this list will jog your memory on other points.

, If you truly have no idea how to respond to an element in the essay question, acknowledge in writing that you've noticed what the teacher is requesting, state your best guess, and move on.

, Keep an eye on the clock to ensure that you don't spend too much time on one essay. In the event you run short on time, jot down the remaining elements from your outline and move on. Your instructor may grant partial credit even for incomplete ideas."

Beware anachronism.,
Write legibly, and proofread what you've written.",How to Fake an Answer to an Essay Question3," Generally speaking, the more you know, the more you recognize that most subjects are almost endlessly complex. If your essay is too sweeping in its claims, chances are it will serve as a red flag to your instructor that you don't really know what you're talking about.


Instead of absolute terms, use qualified statements. Rather than proclaiming something the ""greatest"" or the ""worst,"" try using ""among the best"" or ""perhaps some of the worst."" Using qualified statements helps you avoid sounding foolish if you're not quite sure whether an event really was the ""greatest,"" or an idea is, in fact, ""the worst"" of all time.Don't lose sight of the larger picture. You might not enjoy the current political climate, for example, but calling a particular politician or party ""the worst in history"" on your politics exam is more likely to elicit a chuckle or an eye-roll than admiration; your teacher knows people have been referring to various politicians and parties as ""the worst ever"" for hundreds of years.
Acknowledging that an issue or topic is highly complex can actually work in your favor. Write something like ""It would be impossible to fully discuss the complex nature of Topic X in a limited essay, so I will focus on Themes A and B."" Your teacher may be more likely to chalk up any omissions to the complicated nature of the subject -- which you've demonstrated you are aware of -- rather than you not knowing the material.

, These words are no substitute for content. You're better off stating what you do know clearly than annoying your teacher by forcing him or her to wade through extraneous fluff.

, Anachronism is the introduction of historically or chronologically inaccurate elements or ideas. Ideas about women's rights and privileges were very different in Jane Austen's time; accordingly, your English essay should engage Austen and her contemporaries on their own terms.

, Do what you can do well and at minimum you'll demonstrate respect -- and provide a moment of relief for your teacher as he or she wades through a classroom's worth of handwriting! Double-spacing your essay will help you keep things tidy and allow room to add any extra information that springs to mind as you're writing.Be wary of attempting to add length with large handwriting, fonts (if you're composing a take-home exam) or extra spacing. Your instructor will notice these common tricks.

Review the outline you've created and consider what you do know about the course material.,
Use the elements of the essay as windows to other aspects of course content.,
Emphasize the original question.",How to Fake an Answer to an Essay Question4," Chances are you've picked up some information while sitting in class, even if you feel unprepared for the exam.


Which elements might connect to information you do understand?
How might you compare what little you do know about a given essay topic to a topic you better understand?
What openings do you see for demonstrating your understanding of the wider subject, even if you're unclear on something specific your teacher seems to be asking?

, Without ignoring what the teacher is requesting, acknowledge the essay elements and then transition to material with which you're more comfortable.


Develop an analogy. Perhaps, for example, you recall studying the life cycle of the frog, but your essay question asks you about the life cycle of the salamander. You know they're both amphibians; perhaps your coverage of salamander larvae is a bit fuzzy, but if you can say they're similar to tadpoles and describe tadpole development, you can demonstrate you do have some knowledge of the broader subject.
Tailor your examples. Your history teacher might be asking about the effect of the Cold War on 1950s popular culture; maybe you only remember how the Cold War impacted government, but you can make a case for how government itself impacts popular culture. State your case with confidence.
Make use of transition words and phrases. Terms such as therefore, for this reason, it follows that, as a result, because, however, and consequently are tools you can use to direct your reader. These elements serve to highlight what information you are able to provide and may keep your teacher from becoming hung up on deficiencies elsewhere in the essay., Clearly acknowledge all elements of the essay question prompt in your introduction and conclusion. If you're forced to do a little wandering in the middle, at least you'll show your instructor that you understand what he or she was looking for -- even if you can't always provide it. Doing so may also strengthen the perceived connection between what you have written and the content of the question itself.

Look for the assumptions.,
Look for the tension between the spirit and the letter of the text.,
Consider the dynamic and static elements of meaning:- One way to approach the meanings of text is to realise that we construct meanings in our heads dynamically - they are subject to constant revision, extension, refutation, qualification or summary in our heads.,
Consider how the text is made irrelevant.,
Consider the individual elements of the text.,
Look for puns and words with double meaning.,
Hunt for overlooked explanations or definitions.,
Push back against the authority of the author.,
Embrace ambiguity, playfulness, and contradictions.,
Examine the text in another order.,
Resist Western cultural binaries.,
Apply deconstruction to any text.,
Distill your observations into a claim.",How to Deconstruct a Text," An article entitled 'how to deconstruct a text' likely assumes a text can be deconstructed, and also that that deconstruction can be described in a systematic way that applies to all texts similarly. Neither of these assumptions may be true. Look for what assumptions the writer makes that already bias the interpretation of the meanings the text discusses.;
, A text is rarely entirely successful in conveying the spirit of the writer, while the letter of the text is invariably ambiguous as to the intended meaning.
The spirit behind the title 'how to deconstruct a text' is one of helpfulness: yet despite this optimism, deconstruction can be a difficult concept to grasp, while 'how tos' are also notorious for being inadequate, incomplete, misleading - a one-size fits all solution that rarely fits even a single context adequately. There is potentially a direct contradiction and tension here between what the author intends and what the text ends up saying. Such disconnects can lead to misinterpretations, to a literal translation of the meaning, which one assumes is automatically a false interpretation. Such separation between the spirit of the text and the actual text itself are inevitable in any text, but revealing them empowers the reader and avoids the pitfall of a text literally falling into decay, into an almost eternal misinterpretation. Likewise, a text is itself an attempt to 'author' reality, and there is a tension that inevitably comes with that.

, A physical text on the other hand has a static character, even while the writer attempts to recreate the dynamic elements of a thought process. As a project to construct meaning, a sentence or paragraph must eventually end, while a thought process can potentially continue endlessly in developing or modifying meanings. A text constructs a reality, an author and even a reader that are inevitably fraudulent, because they are in many ways dead in comparison to that which they point to. In sum, people are alive, texts are dead, but a text gives the illusion of life, but something is inevitably lost in the process - deconstruction attempts to fill in this gap by making it clear how the text comes to life through the reader's interpretation and through the manipulations of the author.

, Imagine an alien landed on Earth. The mere fact of being an alien would bring great scrutiny and learning, even though the alien would look and talk exactly like us. By seeing how a text is made irrelevant, we turn the text into an alien object, and thereby bring to bear an intensified level of scrutiny. Disturb in order to discover. Rather than take the context of the text for granted, we seek to find the limits of meaning built into the text, the point at which it becomes alien to us, and in so doing, we discover something new about it.

, This is often the first step in deconstruction, but it can be misleading, as it suggests meaning is the sum of separate parts and not something more than the sum of the parts. Consider how the text uses different kinds of words, nouns, verbs, adverbs etc. A text that describes the world using verbs constructs a different kind of world (existential) than one that focuses on nouns (essentialist/positivist), or adjectives (relativist). Likewise, a text that uses verbs like 'appear', 'seem', or 'ponder' give a different sense of reality than one using verbs like 'is', 'creates', 'proves' etc. In the deconstruction project, every single word is a hypothesis about the world, not a statement of fact, and reflects as much about the author and even the reader than about the 'world out there'. Deconstruction aims to make these hypotheses visible.

, Read your text slowly and methodically. Do not assume that a first-glance reading will supply you with a text's meaning. Instead, resolve to dig deeply into every word or phrase. Circle any word that might have multiple meanings or that leads to a pun or joke. Reread any sentence with a double meaning and try to keep both meanings in your head simultaneously. Use your dictionary to guide you as you uncover the multiple meanings within a text. Ask yourself:


Does this word have any other definitions besides the standard, assumed definition? For example, the word ""start"" can mean ""to begin."" It can also mean ""to become startled."" The sentence ""He started when he heard the gun"" might mean that the man began an action at the gunshot (such as beginning a race). However, it might also mean that the man became startled and scared at the gunshot. Try to keep both meanings of ""start"" in your head while you read.
Is this word etymologically related to other words in the text? For example, the words ""inspiration"" and ""conspiracy"" are both related to the Latin root word ""spirae,"" meaning breath. Does this history help you find additional meaning in these words?
Does the word sound like another word or phrase that is entirely unrelated to it? For example, the word ""Russian"" is not etymologically related to ""rush in"" in any way. However, because these words sound a lot alike, a reader might connect them in surprising ways, leading to additional significance in a text.
Is this word used in a different way elsewhere in the text, and how might they be related? For example, perhaps the word ""art"" is used in one chapter to refer to a painting and ""Art"" is used in another chapter to refer to a person. How are ""art"" and ""Art"" alike? How are they different?

, Deconstructionism urges a reader to resist the general, common meaning of a text, also known as the ""privileged"" meaning of a text.Consider whether a word, phrase, or text might have alternative explanations that are ignored by many readers. Are there alternative or minority perspectives that have not been given their due? Try to expose unconventional ideas and possibilities as you read. Ask yourself:


What is unconventional or strange about the text? Are there any traditions that the text is flouting? These traditions might be literary (such as using an unconventional structure) or political (such as inhabiting a feminist perspective).How would this text be different if it had been narrated from another character's perspective? This is an especially good question to ask if the narrator is a white heterosexual man and there are minor characters who embody minority identities. What if this text had taken up the perspective of a woman, a person of color, or someone who is queer?What ideology is being supported by the text? Does the text seem to suppress any other ideologies? For example, perhaps the text anxiously supports Western imperialism. Is there anything the text leaves out in order to strengthen its imperialist position?What is the text's relationship to seemingly universal truths?Deconstruction resists the idea that there is one single Truth to explain life and language. Does the text resist these false truths as well? For example, one generally accepted truth is that ""people should follow their consciences."" Perhaps a text is arguing that people's consciences are flawed and that morality should be sought elsewhere.
What hierarchies exist in the text? Who has the power? Is there any way that the text overturns hierarchies? Could you overturn hierarchies through your reading?What words could the author have chosen but did not choose? Are there any gaps or fissures in the text that you can discern?, Resist the temptation to look to the author of a text as the singular expert on the meaning of a given text. Tell yourself that your own readings, ideas, translations, and even your misreadings are just as meaningful as the author's interpretation of her own work. The act of reading is creative, not passive: you should not defer to any single authoritative explanation for a text's meaning., Deconstruction resists the idea that language follows a straightforward formula as it creates meaning.Instead, language is strange, funny, disturbing, and paradoxical. Tell yourself that deconstruction does not involve finding the ""one true meaning"" of a work of literature. You might find that a text means two opposite things at the same time. This does not mean that the text is wrong or that you have misread the text: look at the text as presenting a multiplicity of truths. Expect to find jokes, playful puns, disturbing ideas, and paradoxes when you deconstruct a text.

, Texts are usually read from beginning to end. However, that kind of linear thinking might obscure other hidden meanings within the text, such as surprising connections, double-meanings, and puns. Consider disrupting a linear reading of a text by skimming through it backwards, jumping around from chapter to chapter, and reading certain phrases and sentences in isolation. Reading a text in a nonlinear fashion can bring it to life in new and unexpected ways., Deconstruction argues that language contains political claims that disguise their own politics: in other words, that seemingly ""straightforward"" language is a mask for pernicious and arbitrary power structures. One of the clearest ways these power dynamics play out in language is through a system of Western cultural binaries (or opposites) that create problematic hierarchies.Deconstruction can help make visible certain problematic invisible assumptions in language and culture. In order to deconstruct a text, learn how to get beyond a simplistic system of binaries that culture creates and that language might try to uphold. Try to see where there are shades of grey, where seeming opposites are actually very closely related, or where the ""superior"" side of the binary system might in fact be inferior. These binaries include the following:


Men vs. Women (or masculine vs. feminine)
Culture vs. Nature
Soul/Mind vs. Body
Reason vs. Emotion
White people vs. People of color
Adult vs. Child
""Good"" literature (like Shakespeare) vs. ""Bad"" literature (like a romance novel)

, If you are deconstructing a text for a school assignment, you will probably apply this method to a literary text such as a poem, play, short story, or novel. However, deconstruction can be applied to any text or any speech act. Movies, advertisements, political speeches, how-to articles, and billboards can all be deconstructed too. Look at the world around you as one made of deeply meaningful text that you have the power to decode if you take the time.

, If you are deconstructing a text as part of an assignment, you might have to write up your findings. This can be a difficult task because academic papers have to be clear, organized, and decisive, whereas a deconstructed text is confusing, ambiguous, paradoxical, and disordered. Nevertheless, you can still create a cohesive argument out of a deconstructed text. To do so, consider using the following sentence structures to begin to organize your thinking:


""Even though the text appears to argue X, my reading shows that the text also argues Y.""
""The text allows a reader to understand that the binaristic relationship between A and B is problematic in the following ways . . .""
""The text creates a surprising connection between P and Q through the use of puns and hidden jokes. This is meaningful because . . .""

Submit your essay.",How to Focus an Essay," Perhaps your teacher has assigned you a topic about which to write. If so, think about how you want to answer the essay prompt. If, for example, you must write about a character in Pride and Prejudice, pick which character you would like to discuss. If your essay topic is undefined, think about what you would like to research. What subject or theme interests you? For example, you could write about a favorite musician or a current event.


If your essay is part of an exam, read the question carefully. Underline the action words like “explain,” “compare,” “analyze.”Be sure you understand how you are supposed to prove your answer.
See if the essay prompt has multiple parts. For example, it could say, “First, discuss Mary’s emotions upon being rejected at the ball. Then compare her father’s behavior in this situation to his behavior towards Elizabeth’s engagement. Is he showing the same paternal instincts? How so?” For this question, you should answer the first part and then proceed to offer a comparison.

, Explore your chosen topic. Use the internet, academic journal search engines (like JSTOR or EBSCO), your library’s electronic card catalog, or newspapers. Keep track of your sources and the information you take from each source.Be sure to separate your facts so that you can cite your sources later.


You should not cite Wikipedia as a source. You can, however, use Wikipedia to find scientific sources for your topic. Look at the references section at the end of a Wikipedia article for links.

, Do you need to write a five paragraph essay or something longer? Depending upon the requirements for your essay, map out how you will tackle your theme. For example, divide your essay into sections like introduction with thesis statement, section 1, section 2, section 3, and conclusion. Identify your initial thesis statement. You can perfect the writing of your thesis statement after you draft your paper.Under each section, write your main arguments as bullet points.
Under each argument, use secondary bullet points to write out your supporting points and create footnote or in-text citations.
Include additional information that you think might be useful in an “Other” bullet point even if you don’t have a place for it. You might discard this information or find a use for it later.
For example, if you must write a five paragraph essay about housing at the Sochi Olympics, you might organize your outline by having paragraphs that provide the following information: I. Introduction to Sochi Olympics and housing II. Discussion of housing financing III. Analysis of contractors, laborers, and their schedules for completion IV. Media reaction to unfinished housing V. Conclusion and overall assessment of housing at Sochi Olympics. Under each paragraph you would have additional sub-points.

, If at any point in writing your essay, you get writer's block, try free-writing. Think about the topic and start writing everything that comes to mind. Your writing does not have to be perfect. Instead, focus on getting whatever thoughts you have onto the paper. You can make the prose beautiful later.

, You might have an initial thesis statement that you crafted while making your outline. Now take the time to determine specifically what you want to argue. Your thesis statement is the main idea, point, or argument you want to “sell” in your essay.The thesis statement is comprised of three parts: the main idea or subject of your paper, the specific claim you are making, and the reasons behind your claim. For the last point, consider why your thesis statement is relevant. What are you adding to scholarly knowledge on the topic?Your thesis statement is your opinion it is not a statement of fact.For example, ""Mr. Bennet's wife is Mrs. Bennet"" is an indisputable fact and not a thesis statement. Your opinion might be, ""By providing a time diary of Mr. Bennet's daily activities, I argue that he prefers to spend time with Elizabeth rather than Mrs. Bennet. Additional quotations work to prove that Mr. Bennet is intellectually attracted to more intelligent females. In this regard, he is a man living beyond his time.""
Your thesis statement is not a question.You can ask questions in an introduction to pique the readers' interest but you must state directly what you want to prove. For example, you cannot ask, ""Was the housing finished in time for the Sochi Olympics?"" Most people know it wasn't. Instead, theorize or investigate why it was not finished on time and produce your unique opinion on the underlying reasons.
Has someone proved the same thing previously or is your thought a well-established fact? If so, try to take a different angle on a topic. For example, instead of writing, ""Pride & Prejudice is a beloved book especially for young women,"" ask yourself why? What is it about this particular book that has captured generations of young women's imaginations? Is it the characters? Do the strong female leads help girls of the past and today to identify with the story?

, Looking at the sources you have gathered, do your sources support or disprove your thesis statement. It is okay to have some sources that disagree with you. You should be able to provide some support for your point as well, though., Based on the initial thesis statement you have formed, create multiple versions. Because your thesis statement is the ""selling point"" of your essay, you want to take time to make sure it clearly and strongly states what you want to convey. Use strong, declarative verbs. Avoid the use of ""I"" if possible. You can formulate your thesis as a two part statement with an introductory phrase and a conclusion statement.

, When reading your paper, underline the thesis statement.Keep it in mind as you read your essay. Do your paragraphs or section support or contradict your thesis statement?

, When starting an essay, it is good to have a catchy, declarative first sentence. For example, instead of writing: “I am going to talk about how cool ferrets are,” write “Ferrets are a unique member of the animal kingdom because they have interacted with humans for more than 3,000 years…”Avoid using “I” in your first sentence. You might also use a quotation from a book or another source (be sure to provide a citation).


The length of your introduction depends on the size of your entire essay. For example, a five page essay should have a short introduction with only a few paragraphs. If you are doing a longer paper, however, your introduction could be a few pages.It is often most effective to write your introduction after you have written the rest of your paper. While it is okay to write a draft of your introduction right away, you should edit your introduction later to reflect your paper's final appearance.

, Talk about the historical, theoretical, or social context of your work. For example, are you examining a novel's heroine in the context of 19th century gender norms? It will help your reader know what your mental framework is.


Your explanation of the context should also be focused. For instance, in a shorter essay, you do not need to give an exhaustive explanation of 19th century gender roles. You can, however, provide a few sentences or paragraphs (depending on your essay size) to ground the reader. Specify the gender dynamics that impact the character you are examining. For example, in the context of Pride and Prejudice, discuss gender politics of the upper middle class as this is the class to which the Bennets belong. You might discuss women's dowries and their lack of occupations and thus need to marry. Choose the most relevant points that will help your reader understand your argument more.

, In your introduction, discuss how you will answer your research question.For example, are you using certain authors to help make your point? Are you using your own ethnographic research? Perhaps, you are giving examples from a primary source, like a novel.

, Your readers need to understand where you are going in your essay. Telling what you will prove will help them follow your argument. Oftentimes, writers place the thesis statement towards the end of the introduction., When you are ending your introduction, state in one sentence what is coming next. This is particularly relevant for larger essays. For example, you could write,”The next section compares the natural habitats of ferrets and otters.” For a five paragraph essay, be sure the last sentence of the introductory paragraph does not leave the reader with questions that you will not answer in the essay.

, Based on your outline and the length of your essay, divide your main body into separate paragraphs or sections. Each section should tackle its own theme. Try to arrange your paragraphs in a logical sequence.For a five paragraph essay, each separate argument should have its own paragraph., Be sure to have clear introductory sentences in each paragraph. These sentences should show how your paragraph relates to the overall topic. They should help defend your thesis statement. Use strong, clearly written sentences for your opening.Your opening sentence acts as a paragraph preview. It should describe what you are going to say without revealing all the details., The middle sentences of your paragraph work to provide examples and supporting material for the main point.Your points should support the topic sentence of the paragraph. In other words, keep your sentences relevant to the theme of the paragraph. These sentences should attempt to describe ""how"" or ""why"" your points prove your thesis.Reread your supporting sentences aloud and ask yourself whether they relate to the topic sentence. If they do not, delete them. If they somewhat but not entirely relate, revise them.
Check for the logical order of your supporting sentences. They should follow one another in a way that makes your argument clear. If you skip around in your explanation, even topically relevant sentences will not help the reader.

, When making supporting points for each paragraph, use proper citations.If you incorporate quotations or paraphrase material, mention the page number of the source as well. Do not make statements without having facts to back up your assertions unless the essay is purely personal.

, Just as your first sentence in the paragraph is important, so is your last sentence. Finish the paragraph with another main point that defends the material in your paragraph and the thesis statement.Remember to stay relevant.

, When moving from paragraph to paragraph or from section to section, write transitional phrases. This will help your reader know how each section connects to the next. Avoid using too many of the same transitional words. Also do not start every new paragraph with a transitional word. You can put the word at the end of the sentence as well.


Transitional words could be “furthermore,” “nevertheless,” “additionally,” or “in contrast.”, If your essay is short, summarize what you have written in one paragraph. If your essay is longer, take three to four paragraphs to explain what you have argued. Describe how each section proved your overall thesis point. Do not rehash every detail but remind the reader what you have said.

, If you plan to continue working on the same or a similar theme, discuss what this essay will lead to. For example, if you wrote an essay on ferrets’ sleeping habits, perhaps now you will examine their daytime activities. Do not mention anything that is not relevant or related in some way to your present essay.


Do not mention your future plans in a homework or exam essay. This step is appropriate for academic essays.

, Just like the beginning of your essay should spark interest, your last sentence should leave the reader feeling like his time was well spent.Use a powerful declarative sentence to end your essay. For example, you could write: “Based on Mr. Bennet’s variant responses to Mary and Elizabeth’s behaviors, Mr. Bennet clearly favors his elder daughter.”

, When you finish your first draft, go through your main body paragraphs and identify the main points. Put these into an outline. Does the order make sense? Are your points specific enough? Remember, your job is not to state facts but to prove your opinion or interpretation of a situation or scientific problem. Do your points lead to a different conclusion? If so, that is not necessarily bad. Instead, rework your beginning to reflect your new findings.Revision is a healthy, normal part of the writing process.

, Cut and paste each section and regard it as its own mini essay. Does each paragraph work on its own? Are you proving something different in each section? Thinking of the entire paper, does this section contribute to the bigger argument? If you find the section does not help your argument, consider revising or deleting it., Check for spelling and grammatical mistakes. If using a computer, use your word processor’s spell check. If you have written your essay by hand, reread it slowly or read it aloud. You will catch more mistakes that way.


If possible, wait a day or two before doing a thorough proofreading. You tend to catch more mistakes when you are less tired.
Insert page numbers.
Printing typed essays is another good way to find mistakes. Sometimes we see more mistakes on printed copies.
Check for redundancies in language. Do you use the same verbs or transitional words all the time?

, If possible, request that a friend give you feedback. Oftentimes, another person can help you see if your work is truly focused. Ask her to identify what your main and supporting points are. If she does not know, you should revise your work to articulate your ideas better.

, Using the assigned style (e.g. MLA, APA, Chicago), create your bibliography. Include this section at the end of your essay. It is often permissible to put the bibliography in a smaller font. Check with your teacher for any guidelines.


It is helpful to collect your sources while you write. This way, if you have a “working bibliography,” it will only take a small time to proofread it before submission.

, If using a computer, print a final, error-free copy. Be sure to check every page and its content. If you see missing spaces, double check with your digital copy.

Pretend the topic is awesome.,
Think outside of the box.,
Use your own head.,
Don't fret.,
Write poetically.",How to Have Fun While Writing an Essay," Even if you don't like the topic, do all you can to get into it. For example, say that you're writing about the differences between polar bears and anglerfish. Don't just groan and say ""how boring."" Instead, think about it and consider how you can find some really neat new angles to explore. Say ""Cool, polar bears! I like those. I don't know much about anglerfish, but this should be cool--why are we being asked to compare a bear and a fish?"".;
, For the example given here, the topic would require you to write about the differences between the two species. However, stand back and ask yourself why do you need to analyze differences? It's a fish and a bear; what makes these two similar enough that you need to find the differences? It doesn't just need to be the opposite of your topic. Anything that sounds interesting to you that you can glean, think about. That should lead you back to your original prompt.

, Many essays will require you to use a set article or series of references for obtaining the facts, and you do need to cite your evidence. As such, you can't write it all from your head, but you can use your own opinions, backed up by evidence, to come up with really interesting new ways of perceiving the topic. If all of the information given is dry, stuffy, and known to even the kindergarten kids, use your own head and do some research that goes well beyond the set texts. Maybe you'll be able to combine the dry material with that interesting fact you read off the cover of a National Geography magazine in the doctor's office. Maybe that will lead to the vivid realization you needed to complete this essay.

, The teacher might say, 'five pages,' but if you legitimately cannot find enough interesting content for that last half a page--it's okay. Go back and read through what you've already written. You should probably fill it in for that grade, but don't worry about fillers. Maybe you can add in a nice tidbit of a fact, or a joke, or elaborate on a point. Even a graph or an infographic created by yourself can show your personal effort and add interest to the whole process (just be sure to make these things from scratch and not simply cut and paste them from somewhere else).

, Don't say, ""the dolphins eat fish."" Instead, shift your language to something more elegant and descriptive, such as: ""The sleek gray beasts dart around in the depths, searching out schools of tuna and salmon for their next meal."" You don't need to sound like a school textbook; think about engaging the reader, for the more fascinating your writing is, the better the mood you'll put the marker in.

For example:


Bloom Energy intends to develop smaller units for individual homes in the near future, but right now (beginning in 2010) big companies (including Google, Walmart, eBay and California's PG&E) have been trying out BloomEnergy electrical energy boxes installed with huge incentives from Federal and some U.S. state government subsidies. The ""Bloom Energy Server"" is commonly referred to as the ""Bloom Box"" and is a ""solid oxide fuel cell"" (SOFC) made by Bloom Energy, of Sunnyvale, California, that can use a wide variety of inputs (including liquid or gas as gaseous hydrocarbons produced from bio sources) to generate electricity on the site where it will be used using air and gas to react with special coatings on thin metal plates to produce electricity.

Draw an ocean scene on your background paper, as depicted in your sketch.,
Glue the background and side panels into your diorama.,
Add 3D objects to the bottom of your diorama for the mid-level of your ocean scene.",How to Make an Ocean Diorama for Earth Day2," It is easier to attach the paper to the back and sides of the diorama than to draw inside it. Cut out the background shape just inside the line so that it will fit inside easily.

, Cut them out and lay them aside.

, You may choose to draw geographic features, coral, seaweed or tidal lines. For extra definition, draw these features on colored construction paper and glue them onto the background.

, Use craft glue and smooth it into a thin layer with a popsicle stick. Press it gently into the inside of your box or tin and smooth it with your fingers.

, Your choices will depend upon what scene you are depicting. The following are some popular ocean diorama ideas:


Use green pipe cleaners for seaweed and pink or red pipe cleaners for coral. You can twist the pipe cleaners gently to indicate swaying seaweed in a tide or to form coral shapes. Curl the pipe cleaner slightly on the end, as though trying to make a stand for it. Then, use a layer of craft glue to affix the cleaner to the bottom of the diorama.
Gather rocks from a river bed or garden to use in a rocky ocean scene. Wash the rocks with soap and water, to help them stick to your surface better. After they are dry, put a layer of craft glue on the bottom of the rock and stick it inside your diorama. You can stack rocks, if you want.
Find small sea shells to glue on the diorama floor. You can collect tiny shells at a beach, or you may be able to find a small number of shells at a craft store in the beading section.
Put a layer of glue over the remaining floor of your diorama, using a paint brush. Drop layers of sand into the bottom to cover the glue. Shake off the remaining sand outside.

Find plastic fish, mammals or humans to use in your diorama.,
Make your own creatures, if you prefer.,
Hang plastic or cardboard creatures from the top of your diorama.,
Cover the top and sides of your diorama with a large piece of construction paper, if you have many pieces of thread poking through the top.,
Create a title for your Earth Day diorama.",How to Make an Ocean Diorama for Earth Day3," Some toy stores have a supply of aquatic creatures or action figures, such as a scuba diver, that you can easily place in a diorama. This will increase the ease with which your diorama is built.

, Draw fish, whales, crustaceans or people onto paper and cut them out. Trace the shape onto a thick piece of cardboard and cut the cardboard piece out with scissors or a utility knife.


Glue the image onto the cardboard. When it is dry, glue it onto the back of your diorama. As long as you use thick cardboard, it will create a 3D look to your scene.
If you are not very good at drawing creatures, then you can find them online. Search in the Images section of your search engine to find and print out animals you would like to use.

, Repeat the same process of making cardboard backed creatures, but glue an image on either side of the cardboard. Use a needle to poke a hole in the top of the cardboard creature, then poke the needle through the top of the diorama and tie a knot.


You can also hang plastic toys from the top of your diorama. Tie a piece of thread around them, thread the needle and poke the needle through the ceiling of the diorama.
Hanging parts of your ocean scene is a great way to create a lifelike foreground for your diorama. Things in the foreground can appear slightly larger and have some movement to them.

, Choose a color, like black, that will distract the viewer from your diorama.

, Write it on construction paper and cut it out or print it out on a word processing software program. Affix the title to the top or 1 of the front edges of your diorama.

Hire a professional for annual cleaning.,
Buy quality pellets.,
Store your pellets properly.,
Clean off the glass.,
Clean the outside of the stove.",How to Maintain Pellet Stoves1," Before the heating season, hire a professional to inspect your stove. They will inspect all the parts but also clear out ash in parts difficult for you to handle, such as the vents and chimneys. This is important to prevent chimney fires and smoke leaking from the stove.If your stove is newer, check your service contract. Your supplier can perform maintenance for you.;
, The pellets you can use as fuel in your stove come in various grades. While your stove will run on lower-grade material, better pellets are more efficient and produce less ash. In the long run, good fuel saves you money since it does less damage to your stove over time.An example of premium fuel is softwood pellets with less than .5% ash in them.
When burning pellets, buy a small bag of pellets and try them out before you purchase more. Watch them go through your stove to make sure they don’t crumble and clog it.

, Put your fuel in a location sealed and safe from the elements. Pellets that are exposed to the air and soil absorb water and stick inside your stove. Most pellets are fine when raised off the ground and kept in the manufacturer’s packaging. Cover up any damaged areas on that packaging with waterproof tape or plastic.When your stove is not in use, remove any pellets so they don’t stick to the hopper.

, The glass covers part of the inside of the stove, allowing you to view the fire. When the stove is cool, take a specialized glass cleaner for pellet stoves and wipe it over the glass with a soft cloth.Never scrape the glass. Doing this can damage and weaken it.
During the heating season, turn off the stove and wait for the glass to cool before cleaning it.

, Soap and water are enough to take care of the stove’s outside unless it is made of cast iron. Choose soap that isn’t abrasive and add a little vinegar if desired. Vinegar on a rag works for steel piping as well, but wipe down black surfaces with a dry cloth when you’re done in order to avoid streaks. For cast iron stoves, use your brush and vacuum."

Reuse plastic bags.,
Write on the back of your paper.,
Switch to compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs!,
Recycle!,
ShamWOW!,
Don't just ""turn off""...unplug!,
Don't leave the water on!,
Use more tap than bottled water.",How to Make Small Changes to Help the Environment," After you go shopping, grocery or apparel, you usually end up with a lot of bags. Gather them all up, stuff all of them inside one bag, and keep it under you sink, or in your closet, wherever! Then next time when you take Spot out for a walk, and he poops on the grass, just grab a couple of plastic bags to put it in!;
, Next time you write something down in a notebook, write it on the back of a used paper. Don't waste a new page. You can also place old paper (with only one side used) facing up in the printer, so you can use the back of the used paper instead of buying tons of printer paper each year. Environmentally and wallet friendly!

, Those regular bulbs you buy ARE NOT helping! The twisty bulbs called CFL's last longer, and use less energy, so you can spend a little less on light bulbs and electricity to make up for the higher price.

, Just keep a small tub somewhere in your home for used paper, at least. Then you can either drop it off at a recycling center when it gets full, or at a local school! Many schools have outside recycling dumpsters that you can use. It helps out the schools, because they get money back for all that they (and you) recycled. Helping a school and the environment? Nice.

, Buy a few ShamWows. They can be used to dry off your hands, body and even dry your hair. They also help with spills. So instead of using costly paper towels each month, or using up time, electricity, and money with a hair dryer, use a ShamWOW! (or a chamois...)

, People think just ""turning off"" appliances helps the light bill. Truth is, appliances still use power when they are plugged in. When you go on more than 2 day trips, try unplugging a few lamps, TVs, and other appliances. Your wallet will thank you.

, When brushing your teeth, turn the water on to wet/rinse the toothbrush, but as soon as the toothbrush leaves the water flow, turn it off! Every 3 minutes of running water = approx. a gallon. That gallon could have been used for a more needed purpose, such as for a kid in Africa who doesn't have clean drinking water! You can also try to reduce your showering time.

, If you do use bottled water, when the bottle is empty, refill it with tap water. CLEAN tap water, that is.

Find a way to make your day care germ-free through eco-friendly cleaning.",How to Make Your Day Care More Eco Friendly1," Refrain from using chemicals as much as possible.


Use alternatives to cleaning with chlorine bleach. Peroxide-based bleach, quaternary ammonia, and borax are all safer options for the environment and the children.
One multi-purpose green cleaner is ionized acidic water from a water ionizer. When made at 2.7 pH, ionized acidic water has been lab tested and proven to kill E.Coli and staph bacteria on contact. It is safe and effective on plastic toys, countertops, floors, glass, toilets, door handles and even on the skin so no gloves or masks are needed. You can make it for pennies on the gallon by hooking a water ionizer up to your tap and filling a plastic spray bottle with it.
Refrain from buying aerosol spray cans. Instead, create your own air fresheners using essential oils and baking soda.
Create your own cleansing products from ingredients you can trust rather than purchasing cleaners full of chemicals.
Mix ingredients such as vinegar, borax, mild detergent, antibacterial essential oil and water to make products such as window cleaner, mold and mildew remover, carpet spot cleaner and all-purpose cleaner.;

Empty the ash drawer or trap.,
Check the burn pot.,
Scrape off any ash on the insides.,
Clear the heat exchangers.,
Take care of the hopper and auger.",How to Maintain Pellet Stoves2," When starting a new fire and once or twice a week after that, pull out the ash pan. This sits behind the fire chamber and collects ash. Most stoves can remain operational while you do this. Tip the pan over a garbage bag and shake out all the ash. For whatever ash that doesn’t come off the drawer, use an ash vacuum cleaner.Never use your household vacuum cleaner to clean the stove. The ash will damage it.

, The burn pot is the bowl where the burning pellets sit. It has vents that provide airflow to keep the pellets lit. Look for any buildup of ash. If there’s a thick, brown substance or pieces of hardened ash called clinkers, remove them before use. Use an ash vacuum to remove loose ash, then use an ash brush to scrape off the hardened ash before it melts.Melted clinkers block the air vents and cause less efficient heating and more ash buildup.

, Inspect the rest of the stove. If you see any spots where the ash has gotten loose and begun to stick, use the specialized vacuum cleaner and ash tool to keep it clean. This includes using a chimney brush to clean the pipes.

, These are a series of tubes in the firebox that bring in fresh air and bring heat out of the stove. Depending on the stove, these should be freshened anywhere from every day to every month. Scrape off any soot with a wire brush. Be sure to get any clinkers before they melt.If your stove has a specialized cleaning rod tool, use this to scrape the heat exchangers.

, These parts feed pellets to the combustion chamber. Check these for accumulated pellet material. Use the vacuum cleaner then scrape out any excess with a sharp tool such as a screwdriver. Leftover sawdust or other pellet material creates a blockage that starves the stove of fuel."

Lubricate motors and fans.,
Check gasket seals.,
Replace stove glass.,
Remove the switches.",How to Maintain Pellet Stoves3," These parts keep the parts of the stove moving and circulating air and heat. It is possible to remove these parts by taking out the gaskets in order to vacuum loose ash, but at the very least some pellet stoves benefit from lubrication. Find the oil ports on the parts and apply no more than a couple of drops of all purpose or sewing machine oil., Take a dollar bill or piece of paper and stick it halfway into the fire chamber door. Close the door and pull on the paper. There should be a little resistance. Repeat this around the rest of the door and the ash pan and hopper doors if your stove has them. If the door becomes too loose or too tight, you’ll need to undo and replace the gaskets before they ruin the door’s seal.To remove the gasket, take off the door and lay it on a soft surface. Pull out the gasket, clean the groove with a wire brush, then replace the gasket with cement.
Check online or at a pellet stove retailer for replacement gaskets.

, The glass on the fire chamber should not break. It may etch, brown, or get scratched during cleaning, so you may replace it to view the fire clearly. Loosen the fasteners, take out the old glass, and replace it with new glass. Tighten the fasteners only a little in order to allow the glass space to expand during heating.


Stove glass is expensive. You’ll have to get it from a glass dealer.

, Switches that control the heat and pellet feeding are inside the stove. If your stove doesn’t shut off at the right time or feed pellets, replace the heat temperature and pressure-sensing switches. Unscrew the switches and disconnect them from the wires. Take the switches to a pellet stove supplier and have them give you an exact match as a replacement. Rewire the switches and secure them with screws.

Learn a lot about electrical wiring or find a good electrician, preferably familiar with solar power or at least very smart, to install all the parts of a power system for you.,
Choose some appliances.",How to Live Sustainably With Solar Energy (Solar Photovoltaic / P.V. Electric Power)," Solar power generally has a high up-front (capital) cost and--if it works--saves money over time (low operating cost). If you estimate that your solar project will cost a large part of your monthly income, or more, make a budget for your overall expenses and project expenses to make sure the project won't cause great financial hardship even if for some unknown reason it turns out to be a total loss.


Solar energy can save a lot of money compared to crude or inefficiently delivered or used sources of energy such as lamp oil. It can also make you a lot of money by helping you read and learn to be more productive, or work with power tools rather than hand tools. Don't take these savings and additional income into account in deciding whether you can afford solar energy, since something might go wrong. But, once you find you can afford the system, take them into account to decide whether it would be a good idea, bearing in mind they may not turn out exactly as you expected.;
, A stand-alone solar-powered device, such as a solar lantern, rechargeable lamp, or dedicated cell phone charger, is individually cheaper, more portable, does not require skilled installation, and, being self-contained, is less likely to require repair. A system with separate components (which may be bought as a kit chosen to work well together) is cheaper and more effective in the long run because it allows many devices to share a common pool of the expensive solar cells and batteries, and because there are many more suppliers competing on quality and price for ordinary appliances and large solar energy components than on individual stand-alone solar gadgets.


Some standalone devices incorporate a few functions, such as a lantern, radio, and cell-phone charging outlet.
If you don't have any experience with solar energy, try a simple, low-powered but good quality standalone device such as a lantern to see how you like it and understand the basic principles of operation.
If crime is a problem in your area, bear in mind that a stand-alone device--part or all of which must often be at a window or outside to charge--is a more tempting target for a petty thief, but a more-valuable system (or components such as panels) could be vulnerable to organized thieves.

Solar cells, organized as and protected in solar panels. These are the flat devices that convert light into electricity. The cells generally produce a constant voltage, but current varying continually with the amount of light; the panels' voltage and wattage (power output, under good conditions) depends on how the cells are arranged in them. This uneven power is not very useful for operating other devices on its own, and could even damage them, so it should be fed to a....

Charge controller. A charge controller is a system of electronic components that smooths out the flow of electricity from the solar panels to, and regulates the discharge of electricity for use from a...

Battery. A battery is a set of galvanic cells which stores electricity. (Colloquially, the term can refer to a single cell, such as an AA battery, or a set of many, such as a 9-volt battery or car battery; a solar-power system usually uses multiple cells for increased voltage more practical for the other components to handle.) A solar power system uses rechargeable batteries for a store of energy to avoid interruptions and to provide electricity when sun is not available or a lot of energy, stored over time, is needed for a short time. Power can be drawn directly from the batteries (or, better, through the charge controller, which regulates their discharge to protect them). But it can be converted from usually low-voltage direct current from the batteries into higher-voltage (usually 120 or 240 volt) alternating current suitable for mass-market, typically inexpensive and good, appliances with an...

Inverter. An ""inverter"" is a system of electronic components that converts direct current into alternating current, and typically incorporates a system to raise the voltage, too. An inverter may be combined with a charge controller as a single unit. From the inverter (if not directly from the batteries or charge controller), power flows to the...

Your system will be most versatile and inexpensive to expand if the voltage and connector type is that generally used for appliances in your area.

In case any of this goes wrong, you'll be glad you had...

Circuit breakers or, less conveniently, fuses and other fail-safe devices such as thermal overload protection in major components such as the charge controller or fuse box. These cut off power or even sacrifice themselves to help prevent electrical problems from escalating into fires. If consumable devices such as fuses are used, make sure spares are on hand and available.

, There are trade-offs involved.


Simplicity. A single unit or all-inclusive kit with detailed instructions would be good if additional components or good technicians are not readily available in your area.
Service life. Although all quality solar equipment should be fairly long-lived, extra-long-lasting equipment, like simple equipment, is well suited to inaccessible areas where getting things, rather than just their own cost, is a major cost or difficulty. (This problem can be mitigated by keeping a stock of spare parts that do not go bad on their own, such as light bulbs or outlets, but that doesn't work for parts that decay whether or not used, such as batteries.)

If you are in a relatively inaccessible area, a return policy or warranty is not a great substitute for consistent high quality often indicated by a good reputation, because getting the ""free"" service or replacement will be difficult.


Durability. If you don't live in a sturdy, weather-sealed house, or will leave an entire device out to charge, make sure all components are appropriately protected against moisture or exposure to weather with seals and, where appropriate, drain holes. (This is easiest with more-integrated components or standalone devices.) If your area has a crime problem, check that exterior components in particular, including a standalone device itself or its removable charging panel if considered valuable in your area, can be mounted securely somewhere relatively inaccessible (such as a high roof) and are made of tough, vandal-resistant components (for instance, having extra-strong glass or clear plastic over panels).
Capacity. Bigger, more expensive system components can make, store and deliver more electricity. Adding more power to a particular task often has diminishing returns: for instance, bigger light bulbs make a more pleasing ambience though they may not make simple tasks much more efficient. But more power also lets one do new and very useful additional kinds of tasks, such as operate a computer, power tools or even a Microwave.
Efficiency. More efficient appliances do more with a given amount of electricity. Sunlight itself is free, but the solar power equipment with which to process makes each unit of energy cost overall significantly more than that provided by most electric utilities, so efficiency is important.

, The cheaper parts, such as the batteries, should have enough capacity to make full use of the more-expensive parts, such as the solar cells. If you're buying an all-in-one device, check that the compromises its components reflect are reasonable: any missing capabilities or reduced durability should be acceptable and compensated for with a significantly lower price and/or (if convenience is important) weight.


Avoid vendor lock-in.Make sure major system components follow design and compatibility standards not limited by any particular manufacturer. For instance, they should work at voltages and with connection types many charge controllers and appliances accept.

, There are several types of solar cells that vary in efficiency per unit area and tendency to decay over time. But, unless you're buying so many that having enough space for them is a concern, it's generally more important that the assembled panels be durable (since they will be out in the rain), have a good price per watt (rate of electricity production).


Check that the solar panel on an all-in-one device has sufficient capacity. Because solar panels are expensive manufacturers may skimp on them. A single day's charging should suffice for all you might want to do with the device in a day, such as run a light for four hours and also, if the device has a phone charger attached, charge the phone once.

, Their capacity is measured in watt-hours; for instance, a 100 watt-hour battery can accept 5 watts for 20 hours to charge it (or a little more, due to losses) and then release 25 watts for four hours for use. Large systems often use multiple batteries in parallel. There are many different kinds, with markedly different characteristics -- unlike with solar panels, this isn't just a matter of power per unit of size or money. The battery should be at least big enough to hold a full day's charge from the solar panels; more, if you want to be able to miss a sunny day and still use the system or device fully. Batteries should not be charged too fast; check that the batteries over which the energy from your solar panels will be spread can handle their maximum charging rate.


Lead-acid batteries are inexpensive for their capacity and durable but not suitable for portable devices because they are filled with dangerous acid. Some need to be ""topped off"" with water from time to time.
Don't use ordinary car (""starting"") batteries. Deep-cycle batteries, some of which are used for trolling motors and RVs, are the kind of lead-acid battery to use for solar power, since they are built for repeated substantial discharge rather than brief large engine-starting bursts only.
Sealed lead-acid ""gel cell"" batteries are sealed, with the acid inside contained within material to reduce hazards even if they do break. They are inexpensive for their capacity, though not quite so inexpensive as regular lead-acid batteries. They are also relatively heavy compared to non-lead-acid batteries.
Lead-acid batteries can be damaged by excessive discharging, overcharging, or leaving in the discharged state. The charge controller should prevent overcharging and over-deep discharging; portable devices should be recharged promptly after use.

Most batteries should be recharged promptly after any use. Nickel-cadmium batteries, which are obsolete for most uses, are the kind that was important to discharge before recharging.


Nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries are sealed, durable, and relatively safe generally. They are more expensive and lighter than lead-acid per unit of energy stored, so they are good for portable devices. They are available in standard ""AAA"", ""AA"", ""C"" and ""D"" sizes, so, if you have a solar power system, you don't need portable solar-powered gadgets too, just a much-cheaper charger and batteries.

Most NiMH batteries run down on their own within a month even if not used; ""low-self-discharge"" ones take a year or more to.
Check that standard-size rechargeable batteries bigger than AA, such as C and D size, have commensurately larger capacity ratings of several thousand mAH or are cheap and sufficient for your needs. Some are AA cells in larger cases.


Lithium-ion batteries are very light and expensive for their capacity, and mainly suited to expensive portable devices like laptops.

, The charge controller should be compatible with the particular chemistry (lead-acid, gel cell, NiMH, etc.), capacity, and number of batteries you're using. You may want one that is suitable for the batteries you now have, and a few more also, because the charge controller is relatively inexpensive and durable and room to grow is convenient.


Some important features are protection against overcharging, deep discharge, and excessive rate of charge and discharge.
It's generally safe to assume that an all-in-one device has an acceptable general type of charge controller and that the other components can't charge or discharge the battery too quickly, but deep discharge protection is important for a device with a lead acid (including gel cell) battery.

, Check the waveform type it produces; ""true sine wave"" (a smooth wave, like a mechanical generator makes) is better for most devices, particularly sensitive electronics, than ""modified sine wave"", which risks damaging some; no other waveform is appropriate. The capacity should suffice for everything you might want to run from it at once; generous capacity is relatively inexpensive and not harmful.

, Electricity is complicated, so even if you're doing a solar-power project yourself, it's best to run your plans by someone knowledgeable first.

,


Lamps: Fluorescent tubes or compact fluorescents are efficient, inexpensive, long-lived and powerful. LEDs are too, and physically durable but very expensive in high capacity so they are best for flashlights, lanterns and similarly small lights. Make the best use of them with reflectors and prismatic diffusers, not shades.
Computer: A laptop is generally best because it and its screen consumes very little power. An old, cheap one can is not very expensive, and can run basic software just fine. (Its own battery may go bad with age, but that doesn't matter if it's just being left plugged in.)

Laptops are not very well cooled -- clean the vents regularly.
If computers and Internet connections are uncommon in your area, you could Set up an Internet Cafe.


Power tools: rechargeable ones (charge their batteries from your power system) use little power and their charging process does not draw power very fast, making them particularly good for a small solar power system.
TV: If you must have one, get an LCD TV for low power consumption.

Use less fuel for transport.,
Eat greener food.,
Buy smart.,
Use proper waste management.,
Wear the right clothing.,
Avoid toxins and chemicals.,
Learn about how your happiness and well-being are interconnected with other people and the natural environment.",How to Live a Greener Life," This is the first, and probably the most important step. You should read up on the subject of environmentalism, and how your personal carbon footprint can affect global pollution levels. There are plenty of resources available online, and you can visit your local library for books on related topics.;
, The most effective way to cut down on your carbon emissions is to conserve on energy in your home. Install energy-efficient light bulbs, turn lights off when they aren’t in use, make sure your walls and floors are properly insulated and windows are fully sealed, and keep your energy consumption to a minimum. You will save energy and money at the same time.

, Every drop of tap water you use consumes energy. Remember, it needs to be transported, filtered, and purified (even before it reaches your tap). It might just be water, but a lot of fossil fuel is consumed in processing it. In some places, water itself is scarce. You can turn the tap off while brushing your teeth, switch to more efficient washers and dryers, and collect rainwater for use in your garden.

, If a hybrid car is not an option at the moment, you can take other steps; walking or biking to work, or whenever you have to travel a short distance. If your work place is too far for a daily bicycle commute, consider using mass transit. You can carpool with a friend or coworker if that works. For long trips, consider the fuel efficiency of your different options.

, Eating is one thing everyone has in common, everywhere in the world. But did you know that eating the type of food can make an impact in the environment? The food industry contributes substantial carbon emissions in the process of shipping their products around the world. When you eat seasonal, local, and organic food, you help to conserve the environment – as well as improve your own health.

, Instead of buying brand new wooden furniture for your home, you can search for good used furniture online. You can even visit garage sales, where you might find exactly what you need. Think before making a purchase, no matter how big or small it is. Buying grocery items in bulk can save money and conserve on energy and packing materials. Also, be sure to buy high-quality products that will last for a long time and not just wind up in a landfill a year from now. Whenever possible, buy products that have a fair trade label. That means that people were paid fairly for their work and usually ensures environmental care as well. Shopping online is another good way to conserve on fuel. When you receive a purchase through the mail, the amount of fuel used to ship that purchase is nowhere near the amount of fuel you would have used to drive to a store and buy it offline. Furthermore, you can also save a considerable amount of time and money by shopping online, and many online stores offer free shipping.

, Years ago, many considered waste management to be the main environmental issue of concern. As long as one reduced, recycled, and reused, one was a friend of the environment. Things are not that simple these days, but waste conservation is still a big part of living green. It takes a lot of energy to process and dispose of waste, whether it’s recycled or dumped in a landfill. So conserving on waste is important, even if you do recycle. You should also compost your biodegradable waste materials.

, Your choice of clothing can make a considerable impact on the environment. One of the most heavily sprayed crops across the globe is cotton. Chemicals which are used as insecticides harm the environment, and harm people’s health. Fortunately, there are other alternative fabrics available in the market; such as organic cotton, hemp, bamboo, and flax. Try to find and purchase clothing that uses these natural and nontoxic materials. Wearing such clothing is also better for your health.

, If you look carefully at many of the products you use every day, such as cleaning and personal care products, you might be quite surprised at the harmful chemicals they are made from. Use products made from natural and nontoxic ingredients. They aren’t hard to find – even Amazon has an entire section dedicated to green products. And what's more, by shopping at Amazon you can find nontoxic and environmentally friendly products more easily, while also saving money and conserving resources by doing your shopping online.

, You can increase your happiness and it doesn't have to cost the earth. This is called sustainable happiness.

One of the most basic methods for improving is, of course, recycling.,
Avoid utilizing plastic bags if at all possible.,
Electrical use is the biggest household energy consumer.,
You can actually grow food from scraps.,
Eat locally!",How to Improve the Environment," Plastic items with every number of resin identification code is recyclable, but varies from location to location.;
, Reusable bags (such as cloth bags) are an alternative, and after 6-10 uses, you make up for the energy used to make it. After your reusable bag is ineffectual, it can be given to the Grateful Thread.

, Even when electronics are not in use, they still require energy, so shut down your computer(s) every night. It takes all of 5 seconds.

, Instead of waste ending up in landfills, they can be used to provide more food. Carrot tops (with the greens), garlic, green onions, and potatoes all work. Pineapples can be grown from tops as well, but requires 2 years to produce fruit.

, The fuel needed to transport food is a huge contributor to carbon emissions.

,
Be an eco-tourist.",How to Help Save the Rainforest," Awareness, above everything else, is crucial to saving rainforests. And you cannot make others aware unless you understand the problem thoroughly. There are many excellent resources for this. Visit your local bookstore, buy books about rainforests, and write to the authors. Watch nature documentaries about rainforests. And above all, read about rainforests online. Mongabay is an excellent web resource for this.;
, Reuse water whenever you can - for example, collect rainwater for water plants (rainwater harvesting is also an excellent way of keeping your bills low!). Do not be wasteful when you water the lawn or wash your car. And cut down your consumption of meat, and exotic foods, for reasons explained below.

, If you research your food, you may be surprised to learn that meat and dairy are not essential for good health - in fact, factory farming practices cause great harm to your body. Although well-balanced vegan diets tend to have minimal impact on the environment, make a start by reducing the consumption of meat and buying your meat locally (or from nearby producers). Even the United Nations has published a report that the meat industry is causing great harm to ecosystems. Firstly, they use too much water - more than 100 times as compared to crops. Secondly, cattle need grain as well, and this is often cultivated by clearing forests. Thus, meat production affects rainforests in more ways than one.

, Eat less exotic food. For one, exotic fruits and other products are often sourced from countries with tropical climates, and this demand is satisfied by clearing rainforests for their cultivation. Secondly, if you buy locally, you are not only helping the local economy but also greatly reducing the carbon footprint of the food.

,, These are often cultivated in developing countries by clearing rainforests. To meet increasing demand, more rainforests are cleared. Besides, this, companies that produce them often exploit and underpay farm labor - and these people have to supplement their needs with resources from the rainforest.

, Palm oil is one of the gravest threats to rainforests today - especially to rainforests in Southeast Asia. Palm oil is used in a large number of food products and cosmetics, although alternatives exist. Palm oil can be labeled as 'vegetable oil' and the law does not require for their source to be identified. Please research online about companies that use palm oil in their products, boycott them, spread awareness about them.

,, If you are considering a vacation and have some money to spend, consider a trip to a rainforest reserve. Not only will you be educating yourself, but you will also be supporting the economy there, and providing locals with an incentive for protecting their rainforest. Please also find out what countries have policies that are harming rainforests, boycott them, and let them know why they won't be having you as a tourist.

, This can be achieved by storing information on USBs, CDs, and hard drives, thus eliminating the need for printing information on large quantities of paper. More paper means that more trees have to be destroyed in order to satisfy this need.

, This depletes the planet's natural resources which are very limited.

, Electrical energy depletes the earth's natural supply of coal and water which is needed to generate large amounts of electricity.

, This increases the amount of poisonous emissions released into the atmosphere. Convert garden refuse into compost instead. This can be used as fertilizer to enrich the plants and flowers.

,


Pay attention to packaging before you purchase and strive to buy products with less packaging.

,


Children respond well to learning about sustainable happiness - showing them how their happiness and well-being are interconnected with other people and the natural environment.

, This greatly depletes the oxygen content in the atmosphere.

, This to a large extent, will reduce poisonous carbon monoxide emissions released into the atmosphere.

, This may cost more, but will in the long term reduce the need for tables, stands or other wooden products and desktops.

, This will purify the air and at the same time add beauty and value to your home.

Elect a governing board.",How to Set up a Home Owners Association," When choosing a group to form the association, it may be best to start with a smaller number of people who will be responsible for actually setting up the legal entity and talking with neighbors about the benefits of forming and joining an HOA. However, before setting up the actual HOA, it is important that you generate support from most, if not all, of the neighbors.


You should choose a convenient time and place to hold the initial HOA meetings so that all of the core group members can attend. You can consider having each of the members host a meeting at their home, condo, or duplex.
During the initial meeting, discuss why you are interested in starting an HOA.
Before your second meeting, members should research local and state laws to ensure that HOAs are permitted in your community.
You should also discuss the best ways to convince others to join the HOA. For example, you can circulate a survey asking everyone what changes and/or services that they would like to see in their community or complex.
You can use the survey responses as a guide to developing a plan for the HOA.;
, Once the core members have established a basic outline of what the HOA would provide, you should host information sessions for all of the neighbors. This allows people to ask questions of the core members and voice their concerns about the HOA. It also allows people to discuss how they want to interact with the HOA and provide suggestions and input on desired services., You should use the information meetings to try and “sell” the idea of an HOA to your neighbors. Explain how membership dues will be used to provide specific benefits to the community, such as landscaping to beautify the neighborhood and increase property values. If you live in a duplex or condo, an HOA might help pay collective bills and save for building repairs. You should also discuss how the HOA can pool community resources to provide benefits that families could not afford on their own, such as a new playground.

, Consider preparing different tiers of HOA dues. For example, if everyone in the neighborhood or complex wants to build a pool for community use, plan out how much money that would take and the cost to each member. You should also provide lower cost options and specifically detail what services the HOA would provide., When starting a new HOA, you will most likely need to make the organization voluntary, at least in the beginning. By making the organization voluntary, families will not feel “trapped” by the organization and may be more likely to join. As the HOA demonstrates its benefits to the community or complex, more homeowners, condo owners, and duplex owners may be willing to join and participate.


A mandatory association requires all homeowners, condo owners, and duplex owners in a certain community to join the HOA. HOA membership would actually be linked to the sale of one’s home, condo, or duplex., After you have a majority of property owners in your neighborhood willing to participate in an HOA, you should determine what services the HOA will provide to its members. You may have already compiled a list of desired services during your informational sessions. When deciding which services you want to offer you can consider the following:


High speed internet.
Satellite TV.
Garbage pick up.
Snow removal.
Landscaping., As a way to maintain property values and create a consistent and pleasing appearance of the area, HOAs often place restrictions on what can be done on the outside of owners’ properties. For example, an HOA may restrict owners from painting their house certain colors, such as hot pink. Some potential restrictions could include the following:


Requirements to mow the lawn every week in the fall and spring and every other week in the summer.
Limits on what color owners can paint the exterior of their home.
Requirements as to where visitors can park.
Required maintenance for backyards.
Limitations on decorations., In addition to landscaping or other services meant to beautify the neighborhood, some HOAs build structures for the benefits of its members. This can be a costly undertaking but can provide long-term benefits and increase property values. These structures may be more or less desirable depending on whether HOA members have access to these types of amenities in the community already. Some examples of structures that HOAs can build and maintain include:


Neighborhood swimming pools.
Clubhouse.
Playground.
Picnic areas., After deciding which services and amenities that the HOA wants to provide, you should create a budget. Those who are helping to set up the HOA must determine the necessary expenses and costs of operating the HOA, as well as some reserve funds to guard against any unforeseen costs. Once a yearly budget is determined, you can then divide that amount by the number of homeowners participating in the HOA and then divide the total by 12 in order to calculate the monthly dues amount for each participant.


Once you have calculated the monthly amount, you should hold a meeting to discuss the budget plan.
Some members may think the amount is too high and you can decide what services to drop in order to reduce the overall monthly dues.
The goal of the budget is to determine the amount of money that it will take to keep the property in good condition and have enough money in reserve to pay for unforeseen costs, such as repairs., Once the pledged HOA members agree to the monthly fee amount, you should determine a timetable that sets forth when fees are due, how they should be paid, and the consequences for late payments. While the HOA is not yet a formal legal entity at this stage, it is important that everyone knows and accepts their responsibilities before going through the process of forming a business.


You should also elect someone who is responsible for collecting dues, preparing the budget, and handling the accounting matters for the HOA. This person will become the HOA’s treasurer., When deciding to form an HOA and even after the HOA is up and running, it is important to involve as many people as possible in sharing the burden of running the HOA. By establishing committees to conduct the business of the HOA, you ensure that multiple people are getting a say in how the HOA is run. Committees may be divided into 2 major categories:


Internal affairs committees include fund raising, publicity, bylaws and social events.
Neighborhood affairs committees include housing conditions, traffic safety, law enforcement/neighborhood relations, neighborhood maintenance, economic development and community services.

, When creating an HOA it is important that you review state law and local ordinances to determine what legal requirements that you must meet. You should begin by reviewing your state’s property codes. You can review most state’s laws online.Once you have located the appropriate law, do a key word search for “homeowners association.”


States may have laws that govern the way that HOAs must be formed. For example, Texas requires that a three-person committee must be formed in order to petition to form an HOA., A limited liability company is a legal business entity that allows for flexible management of the company and also limits liability for all members, if the LLC is sued or goes bankrupt. Each state has different laws regarding the formation of an LLC so it is important that you carefully review your state’s laws and follow its requirements. The LLC is usually created by the initial property developer. However, anyone can ultimately create the HOA so long as they comply with state law. Therefore, not every member of the neighborhood or complex has to be named in the LLC documents. Anyone can file this paperwork. Whoever creates the LLC will be ultimately responsible for its business. While the homeowners, condo owners, and duplex owners will be bound by HOA rules, they will not be responsible for any business liabilities. Generally, to form an LLC you must:


Choose a business name.
Apply for a federal tax number.
Choose a registered agent in the state.
Draft and file the Articles of Organization.
Pay any required fees.

, Most states will require that you file your LLC’s governing documents when you register your LLC with the state. Typically, you will be required to draft and file Articles of Organization. This document provides the state with basic information about the LLC, such as:


The business name and address.
The registered agent’s name and address.
The names of the organizers of the LLC.
Basic information about management structure.
A description of the purpose of the LLC.

, In addition to the Articles of Incorporation, you should draft bylaws for your HOA. This document will outline how the business of the LLC should be conducted. For example, your bylaws should outline how often the HOA’s board will meet, how member’s will vote on the HOA’s rules and regulations, and how the HOA’s board will be elected., You should also create a separate document that outlines all of the services that the HOA will provide as well as the restrictions that HOA members must follow. This document should also specify the procedures that will be followed if someone fails to meet their obligations as a member of the HOA. For example, if a person fails to pay their dues, the rules should specify any late fees that will be assessed and at what point the late fees become applicable., The governing board of the HOA will be responsible for managing all aspects of the HOA, including paying taxes, enforcing the HOA’s rules and regulations, and preparing financial reports.When deciding which individuals to vote onto the board, consider the following:


Choose someone who has an attention to detail and is willing to focus on the needs of the HOA.
Choose someone who you believe will enforce the rules and regulations consistently.
Choose someone who you believe is honest and will treat all members fairly.
Choose someone who would be willing to seek out expert advice, if warranted.
Choose someone who will listen to multiple points of view while making a decision."

Not all indulgences are bad – but a big part of living green is being aware of how your choices impact the world around you., Try to buy products that minimize plastic wrap. As a general rule: if a piece of plastic is flimsy and does not hold its shape, then it almost certainly cannot be recycled at your local center.Buy food in bulk! Look for a local wholesale grocery store that features bulk food bins. You can purchase grains, flours, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and other staples by the pound, no plastic packaging necessary.

In other words, your carbon footprint is a measure of the environmental impact your life has. To live an environmentally friendly life that doesn’t contribute to global warming, you want to have the smallest carbon footprint possible.


The idea is to have a neutral or zero carbon footprint.
Of all the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide accounts for up to 26 percent of them,which is why people are concerned with reducing their carbon footprint.;
, Almost everything we do that contributes to global warming is related to fossil fuel consumption. These can be direct uses of fossil fuels, like riding in a gasoline-powered car, or indirect contributions to greenhouse gases, such as eating fruits or vegetables that had to be shipped from far way to reach your table.


Most of the top contributors to our carbon footprints come from the indirect use of coal, natural gas, and oil, including: meat consumption,electricity consumption, personal commuting (such as driving and flying), commercial transportation (like trucks, ships and planes), and using plastic.

, Since greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, knowing your carbon footprint can tell you just how much your lifestyle is contributing to global warming and climate change. Use one of the many calculators available to determine the impact your lifestyle is having.

, Personal vehicles like cars are responsible for about one-fifth of emissions in the United States.Choose an alternative method of getting around if you want to make a dent in your own carbon footprint and reduce your contributions to global warming. Instead of taking the car or getting a ride to the park, school, your friend’s house, or anywhere else, try:


Walking or jogging.
Riding your bike or skateboarding.
Rollerblading.

, While trains and buses often run on fossil fuels, they produce less pollution and take less energy to run than the multiple personal vehicles they replace. Next time you have to get around town and it’s too far to walk or bike, take the bus or other public transportation instead of asking for a ride.

, Kids who aren’t close enough to walk but don’t have bus service can organize carpools with the parents of friends who go to the same school. Instead of four parents each driving individual cars to get kids to school, parents can take turns every day or week picking up and dropping off all the kids, meaning there are three fewer cars on the road.


Suggest carpooling with friends for other activities as well, like sports practices and games, after-school activities, lessons, and social events.

, Driving a car that doesn’t run on gasoline or diesel can drastically reduce your carbon footprint, because it will reduce your fossil fuel use and emissions, and reduce the emissions created by the production, processing, and distribution of the fuel.Hybrid and electric cars are typically more expensive than their traditional counterparts, so this may not be an option for many families.
Be aware that if the electricity you use comes from a fossil fuel, driving a car that’s charged with that electricity may not reduce your carbon footprint.

, When you leave a room and there’s nobody else in the room, turn off the lights. This goes for shutting off electronics too, such as the television, radio, computer, and other devices.

, When you leave your house for the day to go to school, unplug all the electronics that won’t be used throughout the day. Many devices still draw power even when they are turned off.This includes:


Clocks.
Televisions and radios.
Computers.
Phone chargers.
Microwaves and other appliances with clocks.

, Shut off the taps when you are brushing your teeth, soaping your hands in the sink, washing dishes in the sink, and when you’re lathering up in the shower. Also, use less hot water when you are showering or washing dishes, as it takes a lot of energy to heat water.

, When your house is being heated or cooled in summer or winter, make sure you close all doors behind you, and don’t leave windows open. Hot air or cold air will escape quickly, and your furnace or air conditioner will have to work harder and use more energy to maintain a consistent temperature.

, In the winter, open your blinds during the day to allow solar energy to help heat your home. Close them again when the sun sets to keep cold air from seeping in. In summer, keep your drapes and curtains drawn during the day so that solar energy doesn’t heat your home further.

, The majority of the electricity generated in the United States comes from fossil fuels,so by using less energy, you can reduce your carbon footprint. Instead of watching TV, playing on the computer, or playing video games, try:


Reading.
Playing outside.
Playing board games.
Spending time with friends in person.

, There are many positive environmental ways you can change chore time, including running the dishwasher and washing machine only when there’s a full load, washing clothes with cold water, and hanging clothes to dry instead of running the dryer.


Ask the rest of your family to adopt these practices too.

, Mature trees consume about 48 pounds of carbon dioxide every year, which they convert into the oxygen that you breathe. Furthermore, trees planted around your house create shade and windbreakers that reduce the need for air-conditioning in summer and heating in winter.Planting deciduous trees will provide you with shade in summer, and then when they lose their leaves in the fall, they allow natural heat from the sun to warm your home.

, The farther your food has to travel to get to your table, the bigger your carbon footprint will be. Although vegetables are lower on the list than meats and dairy in terms of greenhouse gas generation,they do still have to travel to the markets where you purchase them, and that requires fossil fuels. By growing your own garden, you’ll both reduce your greenhouse gases contributions and you’ll be adding plants to the planet that consume carbon dioxide.

, You’ve all heard the saying “Reduce Reuse Recycle,” but you may not have realized that this mantra can seriously reduce your carbon footprint! Recycling is an energy-intensive process, but it’s still better than having to produce a container from scratch. Reusing is even better, because it reduces waste, cuts out the energy needed for recycling, and reduces your consumption.


Practice reusing by upcycling old containers, clothes, and household items. For instance, collect tin cans to make a bottle holder for your parents as a gift.
Recycle cans, bottles, jars, tetra packs, containers, and anything else your local recycling facility accepts.
Reuse and refill things like ink cartridges and pens.
Instead of buying a new soap bottle every time, refill the one you have.
Shop in thrift stores instead of buying new clothes and housewares.

, The amount of energy and fuel it takes to transport organic matter to a waste facility (if your community doesn’t have composting) will contribute to your carbon footprint. On top of that, organic matter doesn’t properly break down in that sort of environment, so you are much better off composting yourself. Not only will you reduce the amount of waste you send to landfills, but you’ll also have homemade soil to plant and fertilize your garden.

, Paper products contribute to global warming in the sense that their production requires fossil fuels, and the trees that would have captured carbon dioxide are no longer there to do so. You can reduce your paper use by making a few simple changes, such as:


Not printing emails you don’t have to.
Using the library or reading e-books instead of buying printed books.
Getting e-bills and asking that stores don’t print off receipts for you.
Asking you parents to buy recycled paper products, like facial tissues, bathroom tissues, and writing and printing paper.
Scanning books instead of photocopying them.
Sending e-cards instead of paper cards.

, Most municipalities provide perfectly safe drinking water, so there’s usually no need to buy bottled water in America. But consumers love this convenient and portable product, even though it takes three liters of water to produce one liter of bottled water, and millions of barrels of oil are needed to manufacture the bottles, caps, and packaging required to meet the demands of American consumers alone.If your parents buy bottled water, ask them to stop. Even if they don’t, you can opt to use a reusable glass or metal canteen that you refill with tap or filtered water.

, The majority of packaging used in North America has more to do with advertising and gimmicks than it does product preservation or consumer safety. Because most of that packaging is plastic, fossil fuels have been used to create it, and lots of it cannot be recycled. By refusing to buy products that have excessive packaging, you will reduce your carbon footprint and tell businesses that their methods are not acceptable.

, Sometimes, there are things that you just can’t do on your own without the help of the people you love. Ask your parents to help you make a difference by implementing some new family policies and practices.


Ask your parents to adjust the thermostat by a few degrees so the furnace or air conditioner doesn’t have to work quite as hard.
Explain to your parents that CFLs (compact fluorescent lamps) will use 70 percent less energy than incandescent bulbs, which will save both energy and money.Remind your parents to remember their reusable mugs when they grab coffee to go.

, Most cities and towns have local farmers markets, and going with your friends and family can be a great way to support your local community, teach everyone the importance of shopping locally (so that less greenhouse gases are used transporting food to your table), and find fresh and delicious produce for your meals.


Remember to take your reusable shopping bags to the farmers market as well as the grocery store.

, The packaging used to wrap fruits, vegetables, and premade meals is often plastic, and plastic requires fossil fuels. It might take some getting used to, but it’s possible to leave the grocery store without any excess packaging. Remember, cooking can be time consuming, so offer to help your parents with preparation of meals that use fresh ingredients. This will save them time, help teach you to cook, and encourage your parents to buy fresh more often.


Buy whatever you can in bulk instead of prepackaged portions, such as grains, flours, pastas, and spices.
Buy loose produce, such as individual carrots, instead of pre-bagged fruits and vegetables.

, Meat and dairy production account for an estimated 18 percent of global emissions, and cutting these items from your diet completely would cut your food-related carbon footprint in half.Encouraging your parents to eat less meat and dairy is an excellent step toward reducing your carbon footprint.

Recycle.,
Pick up litter.,
Inform and motivate others.,
Don't throw away old things.,
Compost.",How to Help the World Be a Cleaner Place," Recycle everything you can, not just the soda cans that give you money. Sure, a little extra money is handy, but go the extra mile and collect everything: old paper, bottles, even batteries.;
, Go to a popular park or street and pick up litter. Sort out the recyclables from the refuse, and be sure to wear gloves; you never know where the trash has been.

, This can be as simple as telling a friend, or as ambitious as starting a local group, or even a worldwide organization.

, Things like clothes and old equipment can be donated. Old bottles and egg cartons can be made into neat crafts. Moldy food cans be used to make compost.

, As mentioned above, old and half-eaten food can be good fertilizer for a local garden. Just be sure of what is in the foods. Be sure to include grass and lawn clippings and to turn your pile over.

Favor green appliances.,
Look into renewable energy sources.,
Get rid of your lawn.,
Rethink your heating and cooling solutions.,
Compost at home.",How to Live Green2," Make the more sustainable choice, where cost allows. You may not be able to switch out all of your household goods at once, but you can certainly begin to move in a greener direction. Set your intention and move gradually toward your goal.Switch out incandescent light bulbs for energy-saving bulbs. Try using dim lights at night. Install solar-powered lamps in your yard or garden to replace any traditional grid- or battery-powered lights.
Buy low-energy appliances. Replace your dishwasher, your clothes washer, your drying machine, your refrigerator, etc. Find a version of each appliance that allows for a low electricity flow, or features a low-heat option, or even runs off the grid.

, Consider putting solar panels on your roof. Some areas offer financial incentives for switching to solar, and you may find that the long-term savings are well worth the immediate cost of a switch. Consider going off-grid. Alternately, you can feed the extra power that you produce back into the wider power grid.

, If you live in an area that is not naturally lush and wet, then you are probably using a lot of water to keep that lawn looking fresh in your yard. The world is wracked with water shortages, particularly in dry regions and many developing nations. Try replanting the area with native vegetation that is not so water-intensive.


Consider filling your yard with gravel, sand, or tanbark. Make a rock garden or build a patio!

, Explore passive heating and cooling systems that utilize good airflow and thermal retention to keep your home at a comfortable temperature. Install programmable thermostats that switch off once your home temperature reaches a preset standard level. In the winter, wear layers and trap heat. In the summer, strip down and open the windows!


Install insulation and double-glazed windows to minimize heat loss from your house. Detect heating loss using a thermal imager. Try to optimize the heat retention and airflow of your house so that the space requires as little electrical climate support as possible.
Make sure that all of your windows open, and install openable windows to replace those that don't. Use fans to keep the air moving throughout your home.
Install tankless water heaters. Depending on where you live, it may make sense to use geothermal or solar energy to heat your water.

, Build a compost heap or invest in a commercial composter. If your area doesn't have any sort of municipal composting infrastructure in place, then you can take the initiative to turn your organic food waste back into rich, healthy soil.

Reduce your carbon footprint.,
Save electricity.,
Use less water.,
Avoid burning fossil fuels for transportation.,
Go paperless.",How to Live Green3," Your carbon footprint is your impact on the earth's atmosphere measured in the CO2 emissions intrinsic to your lifestyle. Become aware of the various ""externalities"" that lie beyond every choice you make. Think about the story behind your stuff: the various complex factors that have gone into the production, distribution, and sale of every single commercial product that you consume.Remember that you don't need to bring your carbon footprint to absolutely zero to make a difference. Ever little bit helps.

, There are a number of small steps that you can take to use less electricity in your everyday life. Turn off the lights when you leave a room. Do not leave appliances plugged in and running unless you absolutely need to do so. Remember that electricity is a luxury.


Open the windows. Use fresh air and sunlight for a free, natural source of cooling, heating, and light. Consider whether you truly need the lights and the A/C on during the day.
Avoid leaving devices plugged in when you aren't using them. Turn your computer to sleep or hibernate mode when you don't need it on.

, Don't let the tap run, keep showers short, and try to avoid unnecessary consumption. Practice the ""if it's yellow, let it mellow"" rule. Generally aim to be conscious of how much water you are using.



Collect rainwater for watering gardens and lawns. Install timers on sprinklers to limit water usage. Put in water-less urinals.

, Try walking, bicycling, or taking public transportation. Carpool with friends, family, and coworkers, when possible. If you must own your own vehicle, then explore the possibility of hybrid-electric cars and scooters that allow you to burn less.


Consider using Internet-based ride-sharing networks to match with strangers who are seeking or offering rides. Try https://rideshare.org/, Zimride, or Craigslist Rideshare.Adjust your expectations. Many methods of transportation are much slower and less immediately convenient than driving a car. This does not mean that you cannot find value in them. Do your work or read a book on the train; look at your bicycle commute as a workout; use a carpool to connect with your coworkers outside of the office.

, The Internet has made it much easier to avoid using paper for everyday tasks. Challenge yourself to switch to digital solutions for your bills, receipts, and correspondence. Pay bills online and ask for digital receipts in shops.


Communicate over the Internet. Use email, e-cards, and social media to keep in touch with people. Physical correspondence holds a certain nostalgia for many people, but it is not the greenest way.
Change your newspaper and magazine subscriptions from print to electronic. This way, you can get all of the content with none of the waste.

Write a volunteer policy.,
Demonstrate the benefits of volunteering.,
Describe the work clearly.,
Address concerns about qualifications or time commitment.,
Adjust your message for different demographics.",How to Recruit Volunteers1," A small organization might be able to function without one, but most organizations prefer to have a document written up. Keep it short and simple so staff and volunteer can refer to it easily. This is not the first document potential volunteers will see, but it will help you narrow in on your goals and strategy for using volunteers. Cover the following topics:A job description for each volunteer position
Who oversees recruitment, training, and leadership for volunteers
Application forms, interviewing process, and criminal background check for potential volunteers, if necessary.
How much volunteers can be reimbursed for transportation or other expenses;
, In all your recruitment materials, begin by stressing the value of the volunteers' service. Describe the positive impact a volunteer working for your organization can achieve. Mention valuable training or work experience that could go on a volunteer's resume or college application. If there is a possibility of a volunteer advancing into a role with more responsibility or becoming a paid staff member, include this in the recruitment material.

, Name the most specific role possible. Informative terms such as ""volunteer food server"" or ""volunteer beds & shower coordinator"" are more likely to attract results than a general term such as ""shelter volunteer.""If the role is unusual or specialized, describe the specific skills you're looking for.

, Make required experience (or lack of requirements) clear on your recruitment materials, so no one assumes he is unqualified.Reassure potential recruits that training will be provided, or that there is work to be done that does not require any specialized skills. Let people know that the minimum amount of time commitment required, whether that's ""just one day"" or ""only two hours a week.""

, Appeal to a diverse swathe of people, especially if the volunteer service involves interactions with community members. Come up with strategies to overcome additional cultural barriers that may prevent certain demographics from responding.You may include these in all your mass recruitment messages, or create multiple versions that you use for different audiences.


Give senior citizens the opportunity to use advanced or specialized skills, and supply reading materials with large, easily read text.
Translate your message in areas with a high non-English-speaking population.
If a selection process is involved, make it clear that the form is used to match your skills to the right opportunity, not to exclude certain groups.

"
"
Approach people individually.,
Use the internet.,
Reach out to local companies.,
Spread the word through newspapers, radio, and television.,
Create posters and flyers.,
Attend local events.,
Look to local organizations.",How to Recruit Volunteers2," Face-to-face, one-on-one recruitment usually has the highest rate of success. This is not often practical as the only recruitment strategy, due to the high time commitment per volunteer, but it's a great strategy to use on friends, family members, neighbors, and coworkers.

, Post recruitment messages on sites such as Idealist.org, VolunteerMatch.org, or Craigslist. If your organization maintains a social media presence, hook new volunteers by posting inspiring or funny images and stories related to your work., Most large, and even some smaller, companies encourage their employees to volunteer individually and in groups. The employees may even become long-term volunteers after staffing a one-time event.

, A short advertising slot on a local radio or television station can be an affordable way to spread the message. In the local newspapers, offering to write an article about your organization's work or recent success story can be more effective than paying for advertisement space., Include positive stories and photographs depicting your organization's work, along with your contact information. Make these the size of a standard sheet of paper, since some bulletin boards do not allow larger materials. Display these in community centers and local businesses, with permission.


A local copy shop may volunteer their services to you for a good cause, or give you a discount.
Posters may work best when your organization is already somewhat known. They also circulate for a longer time than most advertisements, which makes them useful if you'll still be needing new volunteers weeks from now., Ask permission to set up a table at local events, such as parades or job fairs. Keep the table staffed with one or two people qualified to answer questions, and provide printed materials for people to take with them.

, Community centers, religious organizations, schools, and youth organizations are all excellent places to spread the word about volunteering. Ask leaders in these communities to make an announcement on your behalf, or to arrange a time when you can come in and make a presentation. Many schools now have a community service requirement that must be fulfilled in order to graduate.


Provide printed materials to pass out during announcements and presentations.

"
"
Reply to applicants within 24 hours.,
Evaluate potential volunteers.,
Host a meeting with free food.,
Consider a contract.,
Give volunteers flexibility with time and skill sets.,
Ask volunteers to spread the word.",How to Recruit Volunteers3," No matter which method a potential volunteer uses to contact you, always respond within 24 hours. The longer it takes you to get back to someone, the less likely they are to remain interested.

, Even if you are desperate for help, a ""warm body"" or ""butt in a chair"" won't solve your problems. Use people who are genuinely committed to helping. While not all volunteer positions require a screening process, consider treating it more like a job application when recruiting for the following roles:


Volunteers who interact with community members will be seen as representatives of your organization and should match your organization's values. Criminal background checks are recommended if they will be interacting with vulnerable populations.
Volunteers who will be operating machinery or handling money should undergo a criminal background check and receive supervised training.

, Invite people interested in volunteering to an orientation and ""meet the team"" gathering with food included. One of the best ways to make a good first impression is to give your applicants a free meal or snacks., If you are looking for committed, long-term volunteers, you may wish to have them sign a contract before they begin, committing them to a certain length of time. The goal is not to punish an unpaid volunteer if they leave, but to make it clear that it is the volunteer's responsibility to recruit her replacement.If a volunteer is not certain about their commitment yet, allow her to show up to one or two sessions before making a decision.

, Allow volunteers to set their own hours, within the limits of your program. If you discover that a volunteer has a skill your organization could use, give him the chance to use it even if this is not part of your original plan. For example, a volunteer may help update your organization's website or play music at your organization's social gathering.

, Your first batch of volunteers can transform into a powerful recruiting tool. When the next volunteer project comes up, ask your current and former volunteers to spread the word to their friends and community members with similar interests. Thank each volunteer for her service individually if possible, to build commitment and positive associations with your organization.

Put a plan in place as to how you will provide childcare.,
Plan an informal care session.,
Plan a more formal set up.,
Ask parents to remain responsible for feeding, diaper changes, and medication.,
Have someone come in to care for the kids, such as a nanny or a babysitter or more.,
Organize things for the kids to do.",How to Organize Childcare for a Community Event," How complicated this needs to be will depend on the amount of people coming and any need to meet local regulations. It will also depend on things such as which parents are prepared to help out by caring for kids, costs,


Find out what, if any, regulations will apply to caring for a large group of kids for a few hours.;
, If there aren't too many kids involved, and you can place the kids somewhere where they can be under the watchful eye of everyone without getting in the way, consider a blanket under a tree with toys and books approach. Anyone can drop by and spend time with the kids and everyone is responsible for watching them from a short distance.

, Where the activities taking place will keep everyone distracted or where it's not appropriate to have the kids close by, set up a parental co-operative. This can consist of either people who put their hands to do just childcare, or you can plan the care on a rotational basis, where parents take turns to spend a half hour or so each watching the kids as a whole, and interacting with them.

, That way you don't need to keep an eye on things that are a little more complex to strategize and coordinate.

, Pay them a small amount and take donations from parents in the amounts that they can afford. Keep the prices as low as possible.


In this case, if the babysitter or nanny is happy, you might consider offering one lunch or afternoon tea as part of sweetening the deal. Keep the food very simple (sandwiches, cupcakes, fruit, and water) and ask parents to supply information about any allergies.

, If possible, have older kids do things that contribute to the community event, such as putting plants into containers, mixing soil, making designs for signs, talking about what is happening with one another, etc. If it's related to nature or the environment, take them on a nature walk or have them sketch the local wildlife.

Understand Why People Volunteer


Volunteers are unpaid for their efforts, but that doesn't mean they volunteer expecting nothing in return at all.,
Get to Know Your Volunteers


Talk to them about why they volunteer for you and ask them if they've had any issues that have made the experience less rewarding.,
How's the Morale?,
Contact any volunteers who have decided to stop assisting you


Often the best feedback you can get is from former volunteers who decided to leave.,
Make sure you understand what your volunteers do day-to-day


Do you attend meetings with them?,
Show your appreciation to volunteers


One of the most valuable things you can give anyone volunteering for you is your time.",How to Retain Volunteers,"
People give up their time to volunteer for many important reasons. Often the main motivator is a social one - they may wish to meet new people or to make new friends. Many are hoping to learn new skills. No matter what the motivator, your volunteers hope it's something they may enjoy, and they want to feel good about what they are doing with their time. If your volunteers' experiences are mainly negative, they will not be keen to continue.;
, You may have volunteers who have been assisting you for many years. They may have some valuable ideas about how their volunteering role can be improved.
Be open to any feedback you receive and always genuinely thank people who take the time to give feedback.

,


Often volunteering can seem thankless, but if your volunteers efforts continually go unnoticed - or worse still, they receive constant criticism from other volunteers - they are more likely to quit.
Contact new and experienced volunteers alike and sincerely thank them for their efforts. Seek feedback on how they are enjoying the role. Are there any issues standing in the way of your volunteers getting their job done? Are there any problems between volunteers you can assist to smooth over?

, Don't be surprised if they tell you that no-one contacted them to say goodbye or thank them - you may be the first person who has asked them why they finished up.
Asking former volunteers: ""Why did you leave?"" is a reasonable question, but a better question could be: ""Can you tell me about the aspects of volunteering for us that perhaps, you didn't enjoy? If there was anything we could improve on, or change, what would you recommend?"" Who knows - if things have changed and this volunteer feels 'heard', they may even agree to start assisting again.

, Do you understand what their responsibilities are? Is it something you could do yourself? If you can, make time to spend a couple of hours or even a day, working with your volunteers so that you can see the role through their eyes. This will give you invaluable insight into what your volunteers do for you.

, Always smile and personally thank them whenever you see them.
Think about writing personalized thank you notes and recognising extra effort.
You could also think about hosting a special volunteer breakfast or dinner, asking for nominations for ""Volunteer of the Month"" based on exceptional service and dedication.
Think about a monthly raffle based on the hours of service your volunteers work - they get 5 tickets for the draw for every 5 hours they volunteer, 10 tickets for 10 hours, and so on. The prize doesn't have to be expensive, but it is a nice way to recognise extra effort.

"
"
Divide the work into sets of specific tasks.,
Give clear instructions about the task, highlighting any unusual or difficult points, and making your expectations apparent.,
Assign teams to work on the tasks.,
Give name tags so that people can identify each other.

,
Allow for scheduled, short breaks, and make sure that people have access to water, snacks, and a bathroom during these times.

,
Have a way to contact you, such as a phone number or a walkie-talkie.

,
Praise and encourage your volunteer teams while they are working on their tasks.,
Acknowledge and reward your volunteers' efforts when the event is done.",How to Organize Volunteers,"




For example, if your team is setting up an outdoor concert, the tasks might include setting up the tent, arranging chairs, testing the sound equipment, and ushering guests.

;
, You may also want to include troubleshooting tips.




For example, you might specify that chairs need to be set up in columns of ten, with a meter-wide walkway, and that it needs to be done by 4:00 pm.
It helps to explain the importance of the task in the context of the event.



, You can have people sign up, or ask ahead of time about relevant skills.

,,,, If a group is struggling, gently offer constructive advice, or send a volunteer in from another team to help.

, You may even want to have a ""shout-out"" to them during the event. If your volunteers are part of an ongoing effort, send out encouraging emails or postcards on a regular basis. After all, they are donating their time and effort to your cause!

"
"
Choose an appropriate program.,
Make sure you have time to dedicate to the cause.,
Learn your mission and focus on it.,
Interact with locals, program participants, and other volunteers frequently.,
Think of new ideas to improve situations.,
Keep an open mind and learn.,
Enjoy the experience.",How to Stand Out As a Successful Volunteer," There are myriad of volunteer programs, both at home and abroad, available for you to choose from. Select the one which fits your skills and field of interest the most.


If you have been a sport enthusiast throughout your life, getting into a volunteer abroad program as a sports mentor just makes sense. Similarly, if teaching is your “thing”, go for a teaching program. Playing a role that suits you is the best way to volunteer successfully.;
, This is particularly important when volunteering abroad, because of the time commitment involved when you're unlikely to be able to work. Most of the people who plan to volunteer are either students in their gap year or professionals taking a sabbatical.


If your volunteering involves travel, make sure that everything is planned and booked in advance. If you have decided to go through a placement agency, make sure you have completed the registration process with them in advance. This will give you enough time to prepare yourself for the journey and the task ahead.
If your volunteering is on a local basis, make a schedule for how much you plan to help, and stick to it. For many, volunteerism activities often take a back-seat to work and other commitments; while this is understandable, a sure-fire way to stand out is to keep any commitment you make to the program.

, Every volunteer program has a mission, and the most passionate volunteers live and breath it during their volunteering time. Make sure you read whatever documents the program offers about their goals, understand as much as you can about how the program is run, and attend any workshops or orientations that are on offer. The more you understand and can ""get behind"" the mission of the organization, the better a volunteer you will be.

,  “You can have brilliant ideas, but if you can’t get them across, your ideas won’t get you anywhere”, said Lee LaCocca. This goes to show the importance of an effective communication in any field; even volunteering. Whether you're working abroad or with programs that have a local focus, interacting with the people who benefit from your efforts can keep you clued into the aspects of the project that matter them, informed about recent events in the community/field, and dedicated to the cause. Interacting with program participants and other volunteers can help you feel dedicated, motivated, and inspired. It can also help you find solutions to problems that you wouldn't otherwise see, from an outsider's point of view.


As a volunteer, you should build rapport and communicate regularly with the people in the program as well as the locals out in the city. This will not only help you understand the issues and the facts properly, but also make the locals more comfortable interacting with you, and help them open up with you to share things, which they otherwise might not.

, Fresh ideas, innovations, improvisations….. all of these are very important and key ingredients for the recipe of becoming an extraordinary and stand out volunteer. Always stay two steps ahead. Think of how to do any task in a different and more efficient manner. Give out suggestions and be the front runner in performing your tasks well. This will make you noticeable amongst other volunteers.


When you're looking for new ideas, it may help to talk openly with the program participants or others affected by the volunteer organization. Rather than assuming you know a better way to tackle the task, ask them what matters to them in that area. Be open to their ideas and use their feedback to brainstorm new solutions to whatever problem is on your plate.

, The first rule for a volunteer program is to be open minded and flexible. Whatever kind of volunteerism you're participating in, you have an opportunity to learn. If you're working with locals in a community abroad, it's a great chance to learn about their culture and customs and how other people live. If you're working on a project in your own community, it's a chance to connect with others and gather different points of view about problems you've only considered from your own outlook in the past. If you're working on nature conservation or ecological issues, it's a chance to learn about the environment and how we affect it. Open your mind up to whatever the experience has to show you.


This can be particularly hard with a volunteer abroad program. Remember that you are not on a luxury holiday. While the living arrangements should be safe, they may not be the most comfortable. Volunteering abroad is a significant experience for many; learn as much as you can during your project. Focus not only the work you do while on the project, but also learn about the culture, traditions, and lifestyle of the natives. Adjusting to the change is the key here.

, The best volunteers tend to enjoy what they're doing. It makes sense: if you have fun while you're working, or if you're inspired by the work you're doing, you'll just perform it better. Try to make time to connect with and enjoy the aspects of the program that give you the biggest positive feeling. Your enjoyment will show in how you interact with others on the program and in what kind of job you do there.


If you're volunteering abroad, make the best of your trip. During your volunteer stint, you will get breaks from the programs; try to make the best utilization of that time. Try to explore the city and nearby destinations as much as possible to learn about the history and people.

Volunteer at a local charity or organization.,
Participate in a holiday fundraiser.,
Support a holiday event in your community.,
Take the time to do something for someone else.",How to Practice Giving Throughout the Holiday Season1," One way you can practice giving during the holidays is to volunteer your time at a local charity or organization. Many charities will have events for the holidays, whether it’s serving a holiday meal at the local homeless shelter or giving out gifts at a local children’s hospital. Search for a local charity or organization and sign up to volunteer so you can give the gift of your time to a worthy cause.You may also try to get friends or family to volunteer with you. Enlist your loved ones to get into the giving spirit by sharing volunteer information with them.;
, You can also donate your time by participating in a holiday fundraiser. Search for holiday fundraisers online where you can donate your skills or talents to a worthy cause. Perhaps you find a local fundraiser that needs artists to create work for auction or that needs someone to run a social media campaign. Think about how you can give your skills and time to a worthy cause.You may participate in a holiday fundraiser for a worthy cause online, such as sharing an online donation fund for the children’s hospital. Or you can participate in a local fundraiser, such as silent auction to buy supplies for refugees overseas.

, Another way you can donate your time is to support a holiday-themed event in your area or community. Giving your time to a community event is a good way to bond with your neighbors and pass along the holiday spirit in your community.For example, perhaps there is a holiday feast planned for refugee families in your community. You could then prepare food for the event or volunteer your time to serve food at the event. Or maybe there is a choir celebration at a church in your area. You could then bring your family to the celebration and be part of the audience.

, This could be something as simple as helping your elderly neighbor shovel their driveway or bringing over cookies to a family next door. You could also help a family member with a task, such as assisting them with chores around the house or yard work. Giving your time to help someone out can be a great way to get into the spirit of the holidays.You can also help people out at school, such as assisting a friend with an assignment they’re struggling with. Or you could offer to help a teacher put up decorations in the classroom.
Help others out at work by getting coffee for everyone in the office on a snowy, early morning. Or you could assist a coworker with a project they are struggling with.

"
Give out thoughtful gifts at the office.,
Create a custom gift for a loved one.,
Hand out gifts to people in your community.,
Give a monetary donation to a charity or organization.,
Make the gift giving affordable.",How to Practice Giving Throughout the Holiday Season2," Another way to practice giving throughout the holiday season is to give out thoughtful gifts to coworkers at the office. Rather than give out expensive gifts that are not personal, such as an expensive box of chocolates or gift cards, try to come up with gifts that will be meaningful to each person. You may make a list of coworkers you are buying for and come up with small, thoughtful gifts they will enjoy.For example, maybe you have a coworker who loves anime. You may then find an anime themed mug to give them as a gift during the holidays. Or you may get a poster of their favorite anime character as a gift that they can then put on their office wall.

, To show those you love how much they mean to you during the holidays, make a custom gift for each and every one of them. Making customs gifts can be a fun way to get creative and come up with one-of-a-kind presents. Make a list of loved ones and then come up with custom gifts to suit their tastes as well as their needs.For example, maybe you have a loved one who is often stressed and overworked. You may then make them custom bath bombs in calming scents or custom bath salts.
You could also make a custom photo collage for a more personal gift for a friend or make an hanging origami piece as decoration for a friend’s room.

, To celebrate the season of giving, hand out gifts to those you know well and those you only know in passing in your community. Be generous with your giving and prepare gifts for people in your community who are less fortunate or who do not have close family nearby. You may then package the gifts and go door to door handing them out as a way to spread good cheer to others.You may opt for edible gifts, such as homemade cookies. Keep in mind some people may have dietary restrictions so you may want to try to find out who does and who doesn’t before you hand out homemade food as gifts.
If you have a child at home, you may ask them if they want to help you hand out the gifts. Doing this together can teach them the value of giving to others less fortunate and giving to those in their community.

, Another way you can give a gift to others is to donate money to a worthy cause. Your monetary donation can then help others further themselves and have a better holiday season. You may donate money to a local homeless shelter, to a charity for refugees overseas, or to a sick children charity.


Another way you can maximize your donation is to offer to match any money raised by friends or family for a charity. For example, perhaps a friend is raising money for a homeless shelter. You may then encourage others to donate money by promising to match whatever amount is raised for the shelter within a certain timeframe.

, Though you may want to splurge on gifts for everyone on your list, you may want to consider your budget and how much you can spend. Budgeting your gifts based on your income can ensure you have enough money to get something for everyone on your list. Finding a personal gift that is inexpensive may be more meaningful than spending too much on a gift that is generic.For example, you may budget out $50 for the four people on your list. You may then go shopping with this budget and challenge yourself to find the most personal gifts within this price limit.
You could also go in on a gift with other family members or friends so you can all afford to get the person a big gift that they will love.

"
"
Compliment a friend or loved one.,
Pay for a stranger's meal.,
Reach out to a long lost friend or relative.",How to Practice Giving Throughout the Holiday Season3," This holiday season, take the time to make someone feel good by complimenting them. You may compliment a friend on their bubbly personality and care for others. Or you may compliment a family member on their cooking skills or their problem solving skills. Spread joy by giving out meaningful compliments to those around you.For example, you may say to a friend, ""I really appreciate how upbeat and positive you are. I think its great that you are so bubbly."" Or you may say to a relative, ""This meal you have prepared is really top notch. I appreciate the love and care you put into your cooking.""

, Pick up a stranger's check at your local diner or quietly pay a stranger's bill while you are out for dinner. Paying for a stranger's meal can brighten up their day and give them the gift of kindness. They may then be inspired to pay it forward and pick up someone else's check in the future.If you are looking for a more affordable way to give out kindness, you may pay for a stranger's coffee at your local coffee shop instead. Or you may tell the cashier that you'll leave money for the next person's coffee so they get a nice surprise when they walk up to the cashier to pay for their beverage.

, Sometimes a simple phone call or email can be an act of kindness, especially to a friend or relative that you have not spoken to in a long time. Think about any people in your life that you have drifted away from or haven't spoken to in years. Reach out to them and give them a friendly call, letter, or email to let them know you are thinking of them. They may be pleasantly surprised to hear from you and be touched by your act of kindness in reaching out.For example, you may write to a long lost friend, ""I know we haven't spoken in years, but I just wanted to write and let you know I'm thinking about you this holiday season. Hope you're well and sending you all the best.""
Or you may call a relative and say, ""I know we haven't talked in a long time after that fight, but I just wanted to reach out and see how you're doing. I miss our talks and hope we can chat sometime soon.""

"
Find your own joy.,
Get your life in order.,
Aim for improving your own life, not perfecting it.",How to Make a Positive Impact on the Lives of Others1," If you want to try to make others happy, then you'll need to start with yourself. What makes you happy? What brings you joy? Thinking about these questions will help you start to figure out how you can spread happiness to others.


Make a list of the times you've been happiest in your life. It may help for you to go through a photo-book for this. Pay attention to the photos where you look happiest or at peace: What were you doing then? Who were you with?
Do you still manage to find time to engage in these activities? If not, try to make it a priority to set time aside for you to do things that truly make you feel happy.
Even if you don't have the time to go on long off-trail runs every weekend like you used to, for example, perhaps you can manage to fit in a jog around your local park once or twice or week. You may be surprised at how quickly you start to perk up after returning to the activity you once loved so much.;
, It's hard to help others effectively if your own life is a mess. If you really want to make a positive impact on the world, you'll be better at it if you aren't too distracted by your own problems.


Maybe you'd like to help people who are unemployed find meaningful work that provides them with a steady income. If you struggle to keep a job, though, you won't be able to offer much in the way of advice, and you certainly won't be taken seriously.
However, you shouldn't give up on this goal just because you haven't (yet!) held down one good-paying job for a long stretch of time. Indeed, once you manage to figure things out, you'll be in an excellent position to help others who are in positions like yours.
You will truly be able to understand their situation and will be able to offer solid, proven advice once you manage to overcome your own obstacles.

, While one of the first steps towards helping others is helping yourself, be careful not to put off the start of your new plan for too long. You will never be perfectly happy, perfectly content, perfecting employed, etc.


If you wait for the time to be perfect (and for you to be perfect) before you begin to try to make your mark on the world, you'll never get started.
Maybe you aren't yet in a position to be a career counselor, but perhaps you can work to provide people who are homeless with interview outfits.

"
"
Identify your skills and talents.If you're trying to figure out how you can make a positive impact on the world, you should know as much about yourself as possible.,
Think about how you work best.,
Be honest about what you truly enjoy.,
Identify the causes that are important to you.As your plan begins to take shape, you should think about what your passions are.,
Decide how much time you can devote to helping others.",How to Make a Positive Impact on the Lives of Others2," How would you answer the question “What are you really good at?”


For example, are you a meticulous organizer? Are you a natural at public speaking? Are you a skilled reader and writer? Do you know how to program computers? Are you a soccer star?
Think broadly when answering these questions, and don't rule out anything that seems silly or frivolous.
For example, maybe you're really good at doing complicated nail art, which you think is a useless hobby. However, nursing homes and retirement communities often look for volunteers to provide residents with manicures.

, Just as you should know what you're good at, you should think about the type of environment you work best in.Answering the following practical questions can help you figure out where and how to help others.


Do you thrive in an outdoor setting? Do you avoid the elements at all costs, and thus prefer an office-setting? Are you perhaps a bit of recluse, and so prefer to work remotely?

, Beyond knowing what you are good at doing, you should also think about whether or not you enjoy doing what you're good at. To be able to consistently help others, you want to avoid boredom and burn-out. Doing what you are both good at and enjoy can help protect against this.


For example, you may be a great writer, and if so, this could serve you well in your quest to help others. However, if you hate writing, then there's little chance that you'll be able to sustain a commitment to teaching others to write. Surely there are other things you're also good at that you enjoy a bit more.

,


What causes move you? Are you an animal-lover who would rather interact with non-human creatures than people? Are you a strong advocate of women's rights? Are you passionate about school reform?
Try to identify the causes that either warm your heart or get your blood boiling. Either way, you'll know that you've chosen to commit yourself to something that matters to you.

, Outline all of your current time commitments (work, school, family, etc.) in order to identify open windows of time that you can devote to volunteering or doing good deeds.


Be careful not to make overly ambitious promises about the amount of time you can devote to volunteering or working for others.
For example, if you promise the local shelter that you can help them out fifteen hours a week, they'll depend upon you being there, but after a few weeks you may be burnt out. You need to allow yourself some downtime.
You should, however, make helping others an actual priority that gets written into your schedule and that you take as seriously as any other commitment like work.

"
"
Identify ways that you can help right now.,
Look for the little ways to help.,
Look to the future.,
Count your blessings.",How to Make a Positive Impact on the Lives of Others3," In this noble quest to positively impact the world, it's easy to always look far down the road and overlook the opportunities you have to help others right now. Think about how you can improve someone's life today.


You may be very busy and think you don't have much time to spare, but you can still find little ways to help others.
For example, you can set your alarm just a few minutes earlier than normal and scrape the ice off your neighbor's car before you head off to work.
If you're in school, you can offer to organize a study group before a big exam or offer to share notes with your classmate who has been out with the flu for two weeks.

, Make a resolution to perform good deeds every day. The best way to do this is to look for little ways to spread joy and/or help others. For example:


Hold doors open for the people, making sure to do it with a welcoming smile.
Let someone who looks to be in a hurry move in front of you while waiting at the grocery store.
Buy a pack of diapers for the new parents across the street (even if you don't know them).
Spend a few minutes cutting coupons from the newspaper so that you can pick up some extra groceries, and then donate them to your local food pantry.
Sincerely ask those who serve you (your waiters and waitresses, check-out clerks, gas station attendants, etc.) how they are doing.
Even though these are fairly small gestures, they can still have a big impact on others.

, You'll continue to find ways to make positive changes in others' lives on a daily basis, no matter how small. However, don't forget to think bigger and longer-term as well.


For example, do you want to be a philanthropist or work for a non-profit someday? Would you like to work for Doctors Without Borders? Do you want to make sure that all children have (beyond) adequate learning materials at school?
Depending upon your longer-term goals, you may need to spend some of your time now developing and sharpening your skills and acquiring the requisite knowledge.
This might mean that you'll need to enroll in particular course of study, obtain an internship or even change career paths.
As a result, some of the time you have open to volunteer right now will be reduced, but you'll be making yourself into a better instrument for the world in the long-run.

, Think about what you appreciate in your life, and then think about ways that you can spread those good things to others.


For example, are you in a fulfilling career today because of the educational advantages you had as a child? If so, then perhaps a good way for you to both express your gratitude and help others would be to focus on helping school children get the books they need.
Alternatively, you could volunteer to tutor a couple of times a week in an economically disadvantaged school district.
The basic idea is to identify the ways in which you've been helped or blessed and in turn find ways to pay it forward to others.

Clean out your pantry.,
Go shopping.,
Select your items in food groups.,
Have a few treats in store.,
Keep a few quick packet mixes for cakes, muffins and pancakes.,
Have milk on hand.,
Keep an eye on use-by dates and discard products that go beyond these.",How to Stock a Vegetarian Pantry," If you are changing to a vegetarian diet, or even if you are simply updating an existing impoverished vegetarian pantry, it is time for a good clean out. Remove all out-dated food, any food with unsuitable animal-derived products (ovo-lacto vegetarians can keep more foods than vegans) and remove anything that lacks labels but you aren't quite sure what it is. Wipe down all the shelves and allow to dry.;
, It is always a good idea to stock a new pantry with as many fresh items as possible at the same time, so that the items date together. If you are simply restocking, keep items that are still plenty in date but note them. Make sure to write a list of the items that you need, so that you are not overwhelmed by choices or forgetful as to what you need.

, A vegetarian pantry that is stocked with the basics should contain:



Grain products: rice (especially brown, arborio, jasmine, basmati and sweet), millet, couscous, quinoa, kasha, wild rice (aquatic grass), buckwheat, barley, polenta, and whole grain flours.







Pasta and noodles: pasta made from grain products (e.g., wheat pasta, rice pasta), noodles (e.g., udon, buckwheat etc.). Try to avoid quick-cook noodles; these tend to have a lot of the healthy nutrients removed and are often high in trans-fats.







Legumes: dried legumes (peas, split peas, lentils, puy lentils, chickpeas/garbanzo, kidney beans, pinto beans etc.), tins/cans of legumes, shelf-stored tofu.







Instant mixes for veggie burgers, falafels, etc. Try to prefer organic options and low sodium.







Vegetables and fruits: There are various ways of storing these in the pantry:






Tins/cans of fruit in natural syrup, tins/cans of some vegetables. Try to avoid sourcing a lot of your fruit and veggies in this way because canned varieties lose nutrients, have high sodium, and can leach chemicals from the can soldering/composition into the food over time. Always choose cans that are free from dents, and be sure to check use-by dates.






Preserved fruit and vegetables. Follow the instructions carefully if you make your own at home.
Dehydrated fruits and veggies can also be kept in the pantry for reconstitution.






Dried fruit. A must for both eating and cooking with. Apricots, peaches, pears, apple, nectarines etc. are all great choices. Beware of added sugar; dried pineapple, strawberries, paw-paw, kiwifruit etc. often have considerable added sugar.







Nuts and seeds: Nuts and seeds should be eaten quickly to ensure that they remain fresh. Only purchase small amounts at a time. It is handy to always have on hand walnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, cashews, pecans and sesame seeds. Peanuts are a personal choice given modern allergy problems. Nut and seed butters are also very useful to keep on hand; consider tahini, peanut butter, cashew nut butter, almond butter etc. Some require refrigeration on opening.







Flavourings: There are a number of key flavourings that no vegetarian pantry should be without. These include:






Nutritional yeast






Bragg amino acid, soy sauce, shoyu, tamari; look for low sodium options.






Vegetable broth/stock cubes, liquid or powder - check ingredients carefully!
Cheese sauce or cheese substitute sauces in packets; packet soups
Seasoned vegetable salt (there are numerous good brands around)


Concentrated liquid stock or flavouring derived from vegetable, herb and spice sources (a few drops will do each use)
Curry powder
Seasonings such as herbs, spices, salt, pepper etc. Dry your fresh herbs for seeing the winter through
Seaweed products for seasoning, including dulse
Flavoured vinegars, dressings
Sweeteners such as raw and organic sugar, stevia, rice syrup, agave syrup, honey, maple syrup, xylitol etc. Select whatever suits your needs, preferences, and dietary requirements.

, It is useful to have some treats on stand-by for guests, children and the munchies. Good products include dark chocolate, soy chocolate, chickpea crisps, wasabi peas, sugar-free cookies (sweetened with alternatives), microwave popcorn and raw kernels, etc.

, Prefer organic and low-sugar versions where possible. It isn't always possible to be a saint and make your own baked goods from scratch; having these packaged possibilities still allows you to add fresh fruit, macadamia oil in place of saturated fats and you have the choice of using eggs or not. This is far better than resorting to store-bought goodies.

, It is always handy to have some shelf milk on hand for times when you run out and guests arrive. Depending on your needs, you can purchase dairy, soy, nut, grain and other milks that can be shelf-stored. Flavoured milks are also handy, including chocolate, vanilla and strawberry.

, They might seem all right, but once stale, items never taste quite as fresh. They also do not provide the same nutrients as fresher, in-date items. Circulate goods at the back of the pantry and bring them to the front at least monthly, if not more often. It's easy to forget about items you can't see, and the less you waste the happier your wallet will be.

Show the student where each body part is located by pointing it out and saying its name.,
Say the name of a body part out loud and ask the student to move it.,
Ask students to match images of different body parts to their names.,
Play the ""Simon Says"" game.,
Sing songs that help students learn about anatomy.,
Put some music on that the students enjoy and ask them to dance by moving specific parts of their body.,
Tickle the students on different parts of their body and ask them if it tickles.",How to Learn Body Parts for Preschool2," Ask the student to point and repeat the name.

, The movement creates a link between the child's mind and body because the name is processed from thought into action, which increases the chances of retaining the name in the child's memory.

, This will help the child learn how the name of each body part is spelled.

, In this game, you ask the students to perform different tasks involving parts of their body. For example, you could ask them to touch their nose or lift their leg. Explain the game to the students and make sure you say, ""Simon says"" when you want them to do something otherwise they will not do it (this is the main rule of the game).

, 1 of the most popularly used songs is James Weldon Johnson's ""Dem Bones"" (also known as ""Dry Bones"" and ""Dem Dry Bones""), which describes how different parts of the body are connected to each other. Here are some more songs you may want to sing with the children.


The Bone Dance"" by Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus.
The Bone Bounce"" by Lucy Jensen.
The Parts of You and Me"" by The Little Blue Globe Band (Toddler World TV)
The Bone Song"" by Animaniacs (this song describes the importance of each body part in relation to the rest of the body).

, Dancing is a fun way for children to learn preschool anatomy.

, Then ask the students to name which parts of their body are ticklish - preferable places are the sides, belly, armpits, collar and knees.

Though it may not be worth it for you to go back to high school to become a baker, if you’re still in high school, you should finish the course.While you’re in high school, you should take home economics, cooking, or other baking-related elective courses to help you get a head start on your passion and career.;
, A technical or culinary school can help you improve your craft, learn more techniques, and to find your niche as a baker. These programs typically last from 1 to 2 years and they will give you an education in nutrition, health, and mathematics, among other relevant subjects. If this sounds like the best path for you, look into programs in your area that offer a reasonable financial package and take your studies seriously.You shouldn’t look at this experience as slowing you down from being a real baker. You can even begin working as an apprentice or trainee in your area while being in school, if you can make the time commitment for both.
If you want to be a high end pastry chef, for example, then you should get trained at the best program you can afford. This kind of work is highly specialized and extra training will give you the edge you need to get noticed and hired., You can be a trainee at a local store or supermarket, where you’ll learn more basic cooking skills, like how to bake a variety of cookies, or you can become an apprentice at an artisan bakery, where you’ll learn more complicated skills, like how to bake cakes. This training typically takes 1-3 years, and you may be able to find an apprenticeship for aspiring bakers at a bakery in your area. Of course, it always helps to have some connections, or to have worked at a bakery or local store in some capacity so you have a leg up when looking for work as a baker.


It’s common for bakers to start out as an apprentice or a trainee in a bakery or grocery store, working on learning the basics of baking, icing, and decorating.
As you work as an apprentice or trainee, you’ll also learn topics such as basic sanitation procedures and nutrition.
If you begin your training or apprenticeship in a manufacturing facility, then you will also learn how to operate industrial-sized blending and mixing machines for producing baked goods.
You can also look into becoming a baker’s assistant if you have the experience and determination to do so.

, Though you don’t need to make this decision as soon as you begin your training or apprenticeship, it helps to have an idea of the type of baking you’re most interested in. You can be an in-store, plant, or craft baker. Being a craft baker requires the most skill, and you can also work your way up to becoming successful in this field by starting off at a store or a plant. Here’s what else you should know about choosing what type of baker you want to be:Plant or commercial bakers most often work in manufacturing facilities that make baked goods at high speeds. If you choose this route, you’ll need to learn to use high-volume industrial machines, ovens, and conveyors, and you must carefully follow instructions and schedules. There’s definitely less room for creativity in commercial baking than in craft baking.
In store or retail bakers most commonly work in specialty shops, bakeries, or grocery stores. They produce a smaller volume of baked goods for people to buy or to eat directly in the store. They may even take orders from customer, prepare special-order goods, and, depending on where they work, they may even serve the customers themselves.
Some retail bakers even own their own shops. In this case, they’ll need to not only make a variety of breads, pastries, pies, and cupcakes, but they’ll also have to hire, train, and supervise staff, as well as budget their supplies, set their prices, and manage daily production.

, Though you don’t have to get certified to become a true baker, certification can help show that you have the knowledge and skills to work at a retail baking establishment. It can help you catch the attention of bakeries where you want to work, and it can help you stand out from the rest of the candidates. There are different areas of specialization that you can get certified in, which include management, retail sales, baking sanitation, and staff training. To become certified, you must meet a series of requirements, which are based on both your experience and your education, before taking an exam to prove your competence.


There are different levels of certification based on your level of experience. For example, to be a certified journey baker, you don’t need any formal education, but you do need 1 year of work experience. To be a certified baker, you need to have 4 years of work experience, and to call yourself a certified master baker, you’ll need 8 years of work experience, along with 30 hours of professional development training and 30 hours of sanitation coursework.

, Being detail-oriented is an incredibly important part of the job, even if you’re working as a commercial baker. You’ll need to closely monitor your baked goods to make sure that they don’t burn while being cooked to perfection. If you bake cupcakes or cakes, then you’ll need to have an eye for detail in order to decorate those cakes and cupcakes to perfection. You’ll also need an eye for detail in order to follow recipes and cooking instructions to perfection, or to tweak those recipes thoughtfully if you’re trying out something slightly different.You’ll also need an eye for detail if you’re taking orders from customers so you know exactly what they want.

, Though you may think that creativity may be the last skill you need when it comes to being a baker, in fact, you may need to use your creative faculties to succeed in your career. If you work as a craft baker and create your own recipes, you may need your creativity to try something different, so you can keep your customers interested in your goods. You may also need your creativity if you’re missing a certain ingredient or two while still needing to cook a certain baked good or pastry, or if you want to fix a recipe where something has already gone wrong. Sometimes, the most important part of your job will lie in improvising, and you’ll need your creativity to make things work.Of course, if you don’t work for yourself, you shouldn’t spend all day experimenting, or you’ll have an unhappy boss and many confused customers. However, if you have the means and the green light, then being creative can lead to some of your best discoveries.

, You may think that bakers work in isolation, perfecting their craft as they make delicious treats. However, people skills are actually vital for most bakers. If you work in a retail store where you have to interact with customers, then you’ll need to have people skills in order to talk to customers, take their orders, and keep them happy with your store and your products. As you move further along in your career, you may have people working under you or you may even own your own bakery. If that’s the case, then you’ll definitely need those people skills in order to train, or even to supervise or hire your employees.


Even if you don’t have anyone working under you, it’s likely that you’ll be baking along with several other bakers. Being able to get along with your coworkers will make for a more pleasant work environment, and will make your work easier and more enjoyable.

, Having a strong grasp of basic math is essential to being a great baker because you’ll need to understand math, especially fractions, in order to mix recipes, weigh your ingredients, or adjust your recipes to fit a given quantity. If you didn’t get formal math training in a high school or certification program, then it’s important to brush up on basic math on your own. Having these skills can make or break a recipe, and you don’t want to end up ruining a batch of croissants because you didn’t know how to multiply fractions.If you were never an ace at math, don’t worry about it. You don’t need to learn calculus or trigonometry to make delicious baked goods. You should, however, learn how to add, subtract, or multiply numbers with ease.

, Though many bakers typically work a 40-hour workweek, they don’t normally work the 9-5 shift. In fact, many of them get up as early as two o’clock in the morning in order to prepare their baked goods for the morning shift. They’ll need to be morning people in order to get the job done, and sleeping in or getting tired in the morning is not an option, because this will be the most important time of your day. If you want to be a baker, then you have to be prepared to get up early to start preparing your recipes, mixing your ingredients, and making sure that your baked goods are cooked to perfection.The good news is, since your working day will start early, it will tend to wrap up earlier than the evening. Some bakers are done working by the early or late afternoon.

, Being a baker is about more than just cooking. When you go on the job, you will be required to complete a number of tasks, which will vary a bit depending on the type of baker you are and your place of employment. However, many aspects of the job are true for any baker. Here are some of the things you’ll be expected to do:Prepare your equipment for baking
Weigh and measure ingredients for cooking
Combine the ingredients in mixers or blenders
Knead, roll, cut, and shape your dough
Place the shaped dough on sheets, molds, or pans
Set the oven temperature
Place your items in grills or ovens
Observe your goods as they cook
Apply toppings, icing, or glaze when your goods have cooked

, Baking is very time-sensitive, both in managing the time it takes to make each baked good, and in delivering your products to customers in a timely manner. Many bakers are often under pressure to create delicious goods while also producing them rapidly, especially when they have a large customer base. In order to succeed as a baker, you’ll have to be able to perform well in a time crunch.One way to make it easier for yourself to perform well in a time crunch is to make sure that your work station and recipe information are organized. That way, you won’t waste time looking for something you misplaced.
Bakers have a higher rate of injuries than people in other professions because of the heavy and often hot equipment that they work with. You’ll need to wear protective clothing and keep your cool while being on the job in order to stay safe. You can let a time crunch affect your safety.

, In order to be a baker, you must have both physical strength and stamina. You’ll need strength in order to carry the ingredients and equipment you’ll be using, such as heavy bags of flour, large baking equipment, and cooked baked goods. You’ll also need to have physical stamina because most bakers rarely sit down. You’ll spend most of the day on your feet while you prepare recipes, package your goods, check on your goods while they’re baking, or when you monitor your employees or chat with customers.Being physically fit is an important part of the job. It’s important that you get your exercise and eat well to stay prepared for the daily rigors of the job.

, In addition to waking up early, many bakers have a work schedule that is far from typical. Because baked goods are high in demand during holidays, many bakers will be expected to work on Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, or other holidays when people typically order more baked goods. They may also be required to work more on weekends, since bakeries are often at their most busy during these times. If they work at a commercial bakery that bakes continuously, then they may be required to work late in the evenings and on weekends.


This doesn’t mean that bakers work more than the average employee, but it does mean that they work different hours. In fact, 1 in 3 bakers worked part-time in 2012."

Select your pie dish.,
Place your freshly prepared pastry in the pie dish according to the recipe's instructions.,
Chill the pastry base for half an hour in the freezer to firm it.,
Dock the dough by piercing the base with a fork in several places to allow airflow and prevent bubbles.,
Place one of the following over the pastry base, cutting the covering wide enough to make sure it covers the edges as well:









Baking paper (parchment) or greaseproof (wax) paper TIP: ‘Scrunch’ the paper up a few times before using – this makes it more pliable and able to mold into the bottom angle (and sides of a fluted tin).,
Place dried beans, dry rice, dry lentils or pie weights on top of the covering.,
Place the pie dish in an oven at the temperature and for the length of time suggested by the recipe.,
Remove the dish from the oven and allow the pastry to cool for 3-5 minutes.,
Add filling and bake the pie for the time recommended by your recipe.,
Finished.








",How to Blind Bake," Tin or glass pie dishes are most common.






;
, To achieve a snug fit, gently drop the pie dish onto the kitchen bench a few times to help the pastry settle into the edges.








, Cover the dish with a clean tea towel or greaseproof paper. This firming assists in stopping the pastry from shrinking during baking.








, Don't overdo it, though; too many holes will let the filling leak through the crust.








,
Coffee filter (unbleached)
Aluminum foil (vented tent) -- make a ""breathing"" crust shield)

, This prevents the pastry base from rising through air bubbles, which would leave it uneven and weakened. For easier clean-up, place the beans in an oven bag or a cheesecloth satchel tied with kitchen twine.








, If there is no suggested temperature, or you are making this up as you go, heat the oven to medium heat (approx. 200ºC/400ºF) and bake the base for approximately 15 minutes, (less for a pastry containing sugar). Keep an eye on its progress; the key colour to watch for is a light golden brown.








, At this stage, some chefs apply an egg wash to the crust to prevent it from absorbing moisture from the filling. To do this, cook the pastry for a little less time in Step 7. Pop the glazed base back into the oven for a 2-minute bake to set the egg wash. Remove once again and allow 1 minute for cooling before adding the filling.








, If you are not following a recipe, reduce the heat for the last baking (180ºC/350ºF). Because the base and edges are baked by now, the pastry will continue to brown while you leave the whole pie in the oven. To allay this, make sure the filling will bake quickly (sometimes you will need to precook it to get the baking time down enough) and cover the edges of the pastry with a foil ring.

Decide on the book’s size.,
Determine how many pages your book will be.,
Choose a binding.,
Decide whether you want to draw or use premade, printable designs.,
Develop a theme.",How to Make a Coloring Book for Young Children1," The most convenient dimensions for your book are 8.5 x 11”, or standard size copy paper. Most commercially-made coloring books fit those proportions, so children are already accustomed to the size. Also, if you’re stumped coming up with your own illustrations, you’ll have the option of printing new designs off of the internet and adding them to your book later.;
, If your theme is the seasons, a natural number of pages would be four. Make the decision now, however, regarding page length because once the binding process begins, adding or taking away pages could become trickier.


Opting for fewer pages might be better given the shorter attention span of young children.

, The quickest and simplest way to bind your finished book together is with a row of staples. For a more finished look, though, you might want to use liquid glue. Or, you could use a hole puncher and create three holes in the area to be bound along the left margin of the book (one near the top of the pages, one in the middle and one near the bottom). Then, you could thread twine or decorative ribbon through the holes, bring together the ends and tie them into a bow or knot.


Binding the book after you’ve created your hand drawn illustrations makes more sense. That way you’re not struggling to fit your drawings in on the smaller surface of a pre-bound page.

, With drawn designs you can literally add a personal, loving touch to the book. Not all of us are accomplished artists, however. So if you choose to use prefabricated, printable designs take the time to locate pictures that really reflect your children's’ personalities.


A quick web search will unearth numerous websites that offer free, printable children’s coloring book illustrations.

, Does your daughter love ponies? Or are spaceships more her style? Choosing a theme for the book can help narrow down the endless possibilities out there. Also, keeping a common theme going can inspire the creation of various designs within the same category. For example, if the theme is superheroes, you can make up all types of crazy characters and draw them in different ways. Cartoonish, realistic, etc.

Develop an understanding of what children are expected to learn about shapes before they advance to kindergarten from preschool.",How to Learn Shapes in Preschool1," Most preschools teach the following skills to match kindergarten admission requirements.


Shapes recognition: the ability to recognize and name shapes such as square, triangle, rectangle and circle.
Matching shapes: know which category a shape belongs to or match objects according to their shapes.
Draw shapes: if the student cannot draw a shape without guidance he or she should at least be able to copy it.;

Heat a frying pan and add 1 tablespoon of oil.,
After 2 minutes, when the vegetables are just starting to soften, add the tomato wedges.

,
Add the chickpeas, chili-lime preserve, and water (or stock).,
Simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the water or stock is almost gone.,
Serve.",How to Make Chilli Lime Chickpeas," When the oil is hot, add the onion, celery and capsicum. Saute for about 1 minute and then add garlic. Stir well to avoid burning.;
,, Stir well. You can add a lid, but it's not essential.


Avoid crushing the chickpeas. If they fall in half, it's no problem, but the texture of whole chickpeas is more desirable.







, You will want the consistency of a sauce: not too soupy and not too dry. If you find that it has dried out a little, or you had to wait for something else to cook, add a little more water, as it will soon be absorbed.

, Rice is a good accompaniment, but cumin roast potatoes really make it a meal.

Develop a healthy routine.,
Create short lessons.,
Get support.",How to Homeschool a Preschooler1," Developing a routine for your child is fundamental. Routines instill security, structure, and self-discipline in your child. Create a schedule for your child. The schedule should outline times for waking up, eating, learning, napping, playing, and sleeping. You can also include things you need to accomplish like chores, prepping for meals, and cleaning.You should dedicate at least 30 minutes to each of these activities. For example, 30 minutes for making breakfast, 30 minutes for eating, and 30 minutes for learning. Of course, adjust the schedule to your and your child's needs. It may take longer to prep a meal, for example.
Be sure to schedule times for daily reading. These times can be in the morning when your child first wakes up, or at night before bedtime.;
, Children have short attention spans. Develop short 30-minute sessions that are broken down into 10-minute intervals. For example, if you have a speech and language lesson planned, set aside 10 minutes for practicing the ABC’s, 10 minutes for reading a book, and 10 minutes for naming animals. You can plan two 30-minute sessions per day, i.e., a session for the morning and a session for the afternoon.Depending on your child’s age, these lessons can be shorter or longer. For example, if your child is younger, like 2 or 3, try out 20-minute lesson plans. If your child starts to become frustrated or bored, perhaps ending the lesson early is a good idea.

, When developing your child’s lesson plans and activities, remember that there are resources out there to help you. For example, you can join a homeschool co-op in your local community or online. These co-ops are great for getting feedback and advice from other parents who homeschool their children, especially if you are a first-timer.There are also local homeschool expos you can attend. These expos are usually regional, so plan ahead so you and your child can attend. Expos offer exhibitions, speakers, and workshops for you or your child to attend."

Grab a permanent marker and paper.,
Draw bold and simple designs.,
Fashion a front and back cover.",How to Make a Coloring Book for Young Children2," Black permanent markers are the most durable for this task. The lines they make can always easily be seen even through the heaviest crayon or colored marker strokes. Further, they are the only permanent markers capable of withstanding multiple erasings. This is important if your child will be using colored pencils on the project.


Make sure you place an impermeable surface behind your drawing page, something like cardboard or several sheets of thick scrap paper. Otherwise, the marker might bleed through onto the following pages or onto your writing surface.

, Avoid outlines with lots of small, delicate details. Children under the age of six are still struggling to develop their fine motor skills, which include holding a pencil or crayon and coloring.So make your images relatively simple, with widely spaced, ample-sized areas for kids to color within the lines.

, Here’s where you can truly add a special effects. Think of a name for your book and begin drawing out designs. You might wish to add glitter or use colored markers to add a splash of color to the final product.


Utilize a heavier paper like construction paper for this task, which will add more stability to the book.
When naming your book, think about calling it after your child. This adds yet another level of personalization to the project.

Bring together your designs.,
Start the binding process.,
Pick up the sheets in order and press them together.,
Pressed the closed booklet together to set the glue.,
Allow the glue to dry completely before use.",How to Make a Coloring Book for Young Children3," On a flat surface, lay out the pages of your book in the order you want them to appear. Don’t forget your front and back cover pages. Add them in the appropriate places.

, If using glue, begin with the back cover. Draw a thin line of liquid glue along the left side of the back cover page. Repeat this process on the next pages, working in reverse order. Continue this process until all sheets, except for the front cover, have been glued. Do not put glue on the front cover page.

, Now start from the beginning of your book with the front cover. Pick it up and place it over the first page of the coloring book. Repeat this process for the remaining pages. Try to align the pages as evenly as possible when you join them together this way for a finished look.

, Using your fingers, squeeze the left binding firmly multiple times across the bound left edge. To aid in the adhesion process, you might want to set a few heavy books on top of your coloring book while it glue dries.

, If you’re using glue to bind your book, give it sufficient time to dry (1-2 hours) before turning your little artist loose. Otherwise, the pages will start to come apart and wet glue will get everywhere.

Use paper to make different shapes and ask the students to use the shapes to make different objects.,
Ask students to make specific things from different shape-cuts.,
Make a figure out of shapes.,
Cut different shapes out of paper.,
Have the preschool students search through magazines that have a lot of images and ask them to identify shapes within the images.

,
Arrange a school trip to a museum or art gallery and ask the children to name different shapes that they see during the trip.,
Tell the students to draw different shapes on the floor (you may want to place a large sheet of paper on the floor to draw on or use chalk so the shapes can be erased later).,
Give the child toy shapes to play with.",How to Learn Shapes in Preschool2," Many children enjoy this activity because they like to make things they like such as trees or houses.

, For example, you can ask them to make an ice-cream cone using a triangle as the base and a circle as the scoop on top.

, You can use the circle as the head, a triangle as the body and rectangles for the limbs. Then ask the students to use shapes in a similar manner to make figures of their favorite friends.

, Then ask the students to match the shapes to the papers that they were cut out from.

,, You can even walk a group of students around the school campus so they will learn about shapes that surround them in everyday life.

, Ask the students to step inside different shapes. (This method can also be used to teach other methods in preschool mathematics such as the names of numbers by drawing the numbers instead.)

, This will help the child understand how each shape can be used. For example, squares and rectangles can be used as building blocks, whereas circles can be used as wheels or balls.

Do puzzles together.,
Play with Legos.,
Use colored blocks.",How to Homeschool a Preschooler2," Cognitive development skills are important skills to master. These skills include learning and problem solving. Puzzles are a great way to teach your child problem solving skills. Buy an age-appropriate puzzle and help your child figure out how the pieces fit together. As you put the puzzle together, talk to your child about what you see. For example, ""This is a pig. Where will the pig fit in the puzzle?""

, Legos are another great way to develop problem solving skills, like how things build on top of each other. Show your child how the Legos fit together first. Then ask them to repeat what you just did. As your child plays with the legos, ask them to identify the colors of the Legos as they put them together., Colored blocks are a great way to teach your child cognitive skills, like learning to match shapes. Ask your child to organize the blocks by shape or by color. You can practice by showing your child how to organize the blocks based on shape or color first. Then, ask your child to repeat the process. You can also ask your child to name the shapes as they group them together."
"
Teach your child the ABC's.,
Name animals or parts of the body.,
Teach your child to count to 20.",How to Homeschool a Preschooler3," Speech and language skills are important for your child’s development. You can start developing these skills by teaching your child the basic ABC’s. Your child should be able to recognize letters (upper and lower case), their sounds, and be able to identify them. You can start by pasting images of the letters to a big poster board. You can also paste images of things that start with the letter. For example, for the letter C you can paste an image of a cat next to the letter. You can even add a physical component by asking your child to meow like a cat., By naming animals and parts of the body, you can develop your child's language skills, as well as their science skills. Associate each part of the body or an animal with a specific letter. For example, ""L"" is for ""Leg,"" and have them point to their leg. Do this for all major body parts, like their nose, mouth, hands, and feet.

, You can do this by creating a board, like the one for the ABC’s. Next to each number, you can use physical objects to represent their amounts. For example, you can glue 3 pennies next to the number three, or glue 4 macaroni noodles next to the number 4.Also teach your child how to recognize different amounts, like, for example, that 4 is more than 3. Do this by counting each amount and explaining to them which is more and which is less. For example, count each penny one by one, then count each macaroni one by one. Direct their attention to the fact that because there is one more macaroni, 4 is bigger than 3.

"
Create an emotion board.,
Have your child choose their own outfits.,
Play Simon Says.",How to Homeschool a Preschooler4," Encourage positive emotional development by asking your child to describe their feelings. You can do this by creating an emotion board with attachable faces expressing different emotions that your child can stick to the board. Tell your child that at any time throughout the day they can choose to put a face on the chart describing how they feel.


Validate your child's feelings by reflecting their emotions back to them; your tone of voice is very important when doing this exercise. For example, if your child is excited or happy tell them in an excited tone with a smile, “That made you very happy!”, Teach independence by encouraging your child to choose their own outfits. Also encourage your child to dress themselves once they have chosen an outfit.


You can also encourage independence by teaching your child how to clean up after themselves. After you have finished each activity, practice putting things back in their designated places.
You can even have your child help you clean the dishes after you have finished eating. Or, have them participate in doing the daily chores, like picking up dirty clothes and putting them in the hamper.

, Teach your child to follow instructions by playing Simon Says. You can also develop your child's instructional skills by having them practice waiting and taking turns. Board games, like Chutes and Ladders and Candy Land, are a great way to practice patience, understanding instructions, and waiting to take turns."

Paint and draw.,
Cut shapes.,
Play sports.,
Schedule playtime.",How to Homeschool a Preschooler5," Include activities in your lesson plan that help your child develop their fine motor skills, i.e., holding objects and hand-eye coordination. Activities that develop fine motor skills are drawing, scribbling and painting. It is also important to teach your child how to hold an object the right way, as well. Teach your child how to hold a pencil or a paintbrush in their hand.

, You can also develop your child's hand-eye coordination by cutting shapes along lines. Draw lines on colored paper for your child to follow and cut along. You can also draw circles, squares, and triangles for your child to cut.If your child is younger, use child safety scissors to cut the shapes.

, You can develop your child's fine motor skills by teaching them to kick and throw balls. This is a fun activity to do outside, and to teach your child the importance of exercise. Kick the ball back and forth with your child. You can also set up cones, similar to a soccer goal, and have your child kick the ball between the cones.

, Playtime is just as important as lesson time. Playtime offers your child an unstructured setting where they can develop a sense of independence, explore their interests, and develop confidence. Playtime also promotes creativity, which is essential for developing intellectual capacities.The amount of playtime your child gets should proportional to the amount of time your child spends learning. For example, if you have an hour of lessons planned, make sure your child gets at least 30 minutes, if not an hour, of playtime each day.

Go the park regularly.,
Join a playgroup.,
Visit the library.",How to Homeschool a Preschooler6," You also want to develop your child’s social skills. Go to the park regularly so that your child can interact with other children. You can try going to different parks each week or every two weeks so that your child can interact with children from diverse backgrounds.

, A playgroup is a regular, relaxed meeting for groups of children while their parents socialize. It is a great way for children to learn new ways to play, and for parents to meet others in their community and make new friends. Try to meet with a playgroup at least twice a month.You can find playgroups through your community, religious institution, and local daycare centers.

, Visiting the library is a great opportunity for your child to meet other children and to practice their reading and listening skills. Libraries usually have scheduled reading times for children, as well as monthly and weekly activities for your child to participate in. Contact your local library for a schedule of reading times and weekly activities your child can participate in.

Teach counting.,
Introduce the numbers themselves.,
Discuss each individual number.,
Incorporate images.,
Engage the sense of touch.,
Show children how to write their numbers.,
Emphasize the importance of the sequence of numbers.,
Teach the concept of “counting on.” Once children understand numbers and their sequence, you can begin to have them count from any number, not just from the number 1.,
Play basic number games.,
Sing counting songs.,
Use picture books.,
Ask “how many?” as often as possible.,
Emphasize the relationship between numbers and quantities.,
Introduce ten frames.,
Practice comparing numbers.",How to Introduce Numbers to Kindergartners," Teach children to count from one to ten; most can remember the ten numbers fairly easily and learn to recite them, like a song or rhyme. Practice this basic skill at every opportunity.


Many children learn best when they are using their sense of touch. Let children touch the items they have been counting. This will help them develop a sense for numbers.;
, To begin, write the numbers, from one to ten, on the board or on a piece of paper. Say each number out loud, and point as you count in order. This practice connects the counting skill with a visual image of each number.


You can also use number cards. Lift a number up, say its name out loud, and then ask each child to find the same number in his or her set of cards. Have each child practice saying its name.

, Starting with the number 1, devote some time to teaching each number. Write both the number and the word; illustrate its meaning by showing one cube, one finger, or one of some other item. Then move on to the number 2.


Try not to move on until you are sure that each child understands. It’s best to master these numbers one at a time.

, Many children learn best when they can visualize a concept. For each number, write the number itself and a drawing that represents it. If you teach the number 2, for example, draw two eyes, two apples, or two flowers.


Dice, dominoes, and cards with dots or points may also work well.
For best results, try letting the children draw the visuals themselves.

, Using beans, cubes, or other tangible items may help children grasp these concepts. When you teach the number 3, for example, have each child count out three of something, touching the items one at a time.

, When you discuss a particular number, teach children how to write it correctly. Let them try to write the numbers themselves.


Be creative and entertaining! Tell the children that the number 1 has a skinny line for a body and then a forward slash for a big nose. A little bit of silliness and fun goes a long way to cementing the numbers into a child’s memory.

, The sequence of numbers is crucial. Start teaching this concept by drawing a number line on the board or on paper: a straight line in which the numbers appear at regular intervals from left to right.


Help children understand sequencing by having them sort number cards into the appropriate order, or by counting incorrectly and letting them point out your mistakes.

, Illustrate this concept with cards or other materials: if a child has a pile of 5 cards and adds 2, it would be more efficient for the child not to have to start counting the first 5 cards again. Instead, he or she can continue to count two more: “six, seven.” Later, this concept will form the foundation of addition.

, Once you’ve introduced the basic concepts of counting and number sequence, you can reinforce them with number games. There are an almost infinite number of possibilities. To begin with, try:


building a tower of cubes. Select a certain number or a number you are currently discussing, and create of tower made of that many cubes.
create stairs. Using cubes, make towers and sort them by size. First a single cube, then, next door, two cubes together, then, next to that, three cubes. This will help reinforce sequencing and the connection to physical size and amounts.
playing board games. Many board games require children to recognize the number of dots shown on the dice and then count the appropriate spaces to move forward.

, Basic counting songs and rhymes help children remember numbers and their sequence.

, There are a huge number of counting and number books available for preschoolers and kindergartners. Choose some with bright colors and beautiful pictures.

, Whenever counting comes up naturally, ask children to do it for you. How many plates do you need to set the table? How many books did you take from the shelf? How many pieces of candy do you have?

, Play games the require children to understand the relationship between numbers and their corresponding quantities. For example, have children count out a certain number of beans; then ask them to add some or take some away. Have them figure out the new number and tell you if it is more or less.

, Make a rectangle made up of 10 smaller squares (two rows of five). Draw dots or color in sections of the rectangle to correspond with particular numbers.

, Explain that the numbers get bigger moving from 1 to 10. Using beans, cubes, or some other material, make two groups on a table or desk, one to the left and one to the right. Let children tell you which side has more; then have them count to get the exact number. Note that the number is higher than the number for the other side.


You can also use this technique to teach the concept of equality. Sometimes, make the two groups equal – five beans in each group, ten cubes in each group, or whatever. Let children discover this, and explain what it means.

Have your child visit.",How to Find a Good Preschool," Ideally, you should start searching for a preschool for your child nine to 12 months before you expect her to start. This will ensure that you have time to make the right selection and that there will be an opening at the school by the time your child is ready to start.Be prepared to be put on a wait list. This is very common with preschools.
If you live in an area where preschool admission is highly competitive, like New York City or Los Angeles, you will have to start searching even earlier.
If you didn't start searching early and you need a preschool at the last minute, you may still have some options. Call around to see if any of the preschools in your area have openings, but don't neglect to vet them properly just because you're in a hurry.;
, There are lots of different public and private preschool options out there, so the right choice for you will largely depend on what is available in your area and your own personal preferences. Don't rule either option out without doing some research first, as both options have their advantages and both can provide your child with a quality education.Private preschools may offer smaller class sizes and more individualized attention, but this is not always the case. They may also have more flexibility when it comes to curriculum and teaching methods.
Public preschools may be much more affordable, but this is not guaranteed. They are often attached to or affiliated with the local elementary school, which means their teaching philosophy is likely to be similar to that of the entire public school district.

, While you may be focusing all of your attention on things like curriculum and policies, it's important to think about practical considerations as well. In order for a preschool to be the right choice for you and your child, it needs to be convenient and affordable.Make sure to choose a preschool that is in a convenient location for you. Some parents prefer to choose a location that is very close to home or work, while others don't mind driving a little further.
Make sure the schedule will work for you as well. It is important to know that you will be able to pick up and drop off your child at times that are convenient. Depending on your schedule, you may also need a preschool that offers some flexibility.
Before you choose a preschool, you need to make sure that your family can reasonably afford it. Costs for preschools vary dramatically depending on where you live, what type of program you are looking at, and whether your child will attend full-time or part-time., Talk to some of your friends or neighbors with children. These are going to be trusted people who can tell you about their experiences with schools in your area, which can help you make a more informed decision.Look for online reviews as well. Other parents may have written about their experience with the preschool/teacher. If many of the reviews are favorable, it is a good indicator that you have found a good school.
Don't rule out a preschool just because of one somewhat negative review. It is possible that the parent who wrote it had a personal issue with a member of the staff or made unreasonable requests.

, Preschools must be licensed by the state they operate in, so check your state's or county's department of social services website to confirm that the facility is properly licensed. A school that is not properly licensed may not adhere to basic health and safety requirements.To make sure that a preschool meets more than just the bare minimum standards, check for accreditation by The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). Schools that are approved by this organization meet strict standards regarding curriculum, classroom environment, and teaching qualifications.
The NAEYC is also a great resource to use if you have no idea what's available in your area. You can find a complete list of accredited preschool programs on their website.Once you have narrowed down your search, you can contact the preschool's licensing agency to find out if there have been any complaints against them., Every child is different, so it's extremely important to think about what your child enjoys and what she needs to learn in order to be prepared for kindergarten. For example, some children may need help learning basic literacy skills, while others may need to practice socialization.If your child has shown an interest in a specific activity, whether it is art or sports, look for a program that will allow her to explore that area more fully.
Also consider whether your child enjoys being around large groups or whether she does better with smaller groups.

, There are many different preschool teaching philosophies out there, and the right one for you is entirely a matter of preference. In order to choose the best fit for your child, it's important to have a basic understanding of some of the most common schools of thought.Montessori programs believe in allowing children to learn individually at their own pace. These programs typically focus on hands-on learning experiences, practical life skills, and learning about cultural diversity.
Waldorf programs focus of group activities that foster creativity and curiosity about the world. These programs aim to enrich the spirit, soul, and body of each child.
High Scope programs believe in providing active involvement to children in a variety of development areas. These programs typically have more structured curricula than other programs, but children are encouraged to make their own decisions about how they want to learn.
Bank Street programs embrace children's individual learning styles and paces. These programs typically encourage children to work in groups, but allow them to choose their own activities.

, No matter which teaching philosophy you prefer, it is important to find out how the facility implements that philosophy. They should be able to clearly articulate the philosophy and explain how various activities fit within the goals of that philosophy.The most important thing to consider is whether your child will be exposed to a variety of age-appropriate educational activities. The curriculum should not be too rigorous for your child's age, but it should encourage growth and exploration.Find out if the curriculum is adapted for children who learn faster or slower than average.Worksheets should be used rarely if at all, as these are typically too rigorous for preschool-age children., You will not be able to completely assess a preschool curriculum without reviewing a daily schedule. This should give you an idea of whether or not the facility will offer your child a wide variety of activities that will keep her engaged and encourage different kinds of development.The schedule should include both indoor and outdoor play.
The schedule should include a combination of organized activity and free play.
The schedule should include a combination of individual, group, and one-on-one activities.
Kids should have the opportunity to develop their gross and fine motor skills, so look for activities that will engage these skills.Opportunities to play pretend should be incorporated into the schedule, as these are very important in helping children with language development., Once you decide that a preschool is of interest to you, it is very important to find out more about their staff. These people will be working with your child every day, so it's important to know who they are.Find out what kind of educational background the teachers have. A Child Development Associate (CDA) credential is a minimum requirement for teachers, but a bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Development is preferable.Find out how high the turnover rate is. Constant change is not good for kids and is probably a sign that the facility is not run well.
Don't be afraid to ask for references. A good preschool will provide you with quality references for its teachers., Ask the preschool what they do to encourage parental involvement. A good preschool should allow you to stop by and participate in your child's learning from time to time.It's also important that you stay informed. Ask the school how they notify parents about things like changes in staffing or curriculum.

, While a preschool should not be administering tests to your child, the staff should be paying close attention to her ability to perform activities and provide you with feedback on her progress.Ask the preschool what their policy is for assessments, how often they share this information with parents, and what format it is in.
You may also want to ask if there will be opportunities for you to sit down with your child's teacher to get more feedback about her progress.

, It's important to understand how much one-on-one attention your child will be getting at preschool, so be sure to ask how many adults will be with each class and what each person's background is. Your state may have guidelines for student to teacher ratios, but your child may benefit from an even smaller group size, depending on her needs and preferences.If your child is three, look for preschools that have groups of no more than 14 students, with at least two adults.
If your child is four or five, look for preschools that have groups of no more than 16 students, with at least two adults.

, When searching for a preschool, don't be afraid to ask lots of specific questions. A good preschool should have clearly defined policies in place. If you are not comfortable with any of the policies, the preschool may not be the right fit for you.Find out what the disciplinary procedure is and make sure you are comfortable with it. It is extremely important that the preschool's philosophy on discipline is at least similar to your own.
Potty-training is required by some facilities, so be sure to ask what the rules are.
Find out about details like pick-up and drop-off policies, food policies, and sick policies. These are practical considerations that you will need to keep in mind when deciding whether or not the preschool is a good fit., Once you have chosen a few different schools that you are interested in, contact them to arrange for a visit. While you are there, meet with as many members of the staff as possible, including the director, the teachers, and the assistant teachers.This is your chance to interview the facility and get a good impression of the program, so don't skip this step.

, In addition to knowing about the staff's training and certifications, it's important to actually observe the way that they interact with the children at the preschool. They should be friendly and engaging and the children should seem to enjoy interacting with them.Make sure they appear to enjoy their jobs. Dissatisfied or overly stressed teachers are not likely to be effective.
Teachers should be down at the kids' level frequently. This fosters better relationship development.Be aware of how teachers discipline children and make note of whether or not your observations are in line with the school's policy.

, When you visit a preschool, make note of how the place makes you feel. If you have a bad impression of it for any reason, your child may feel the same way.The space should feel warm, friendly, and inviting.
There should be plenty of space for running around and playing.
There should be lots of engaging, age-appropriate toys.
Original art on the walls is a good sign that the school encourages creative activities. If all of the artwork is unique, this indicates that children are given the opportunity to choose their own projects based on their interests.Kids should be free to play with toys as they choose and should not have to ask an adult., A preschool should be a safe environment for children, so be extra aware of anything that looks less than safe. Look out for any potential safety hazards, including:Sharp edges on furniture
Broken furniture or toys
Exposed electrical outlets
Hazardous materials like cleaning chemicals within the reach of children

, Your child is the one who will be spending a lot of her time at the preschool, so it is important that she feel comfortable there. Once you have decided that you approve of a specific preschool, contact the school about arranging a time when your child can visit.A good preschool should allow your visiting child the opportunity to engage in activities and interact with the other children.
Pay attention to your child's reaction to the preschool. If she doesn't seem happy, ask her to tell you what she didn't like.
Make sure the preschool meets all of your criteria before you bring your child to see it. It would be very disappointing for her if she loved the place but couldn't go there because it was over budget.

Make sure that all students have strong letter recognition skills.,
Teach children that writing goes from left to right by demonstrating on a chalk or white board.

,
Assess each child's writing level by providing a short sentence for the kids to copy.,
Create a word wall with common sight words that children commonly need to use in writing.,
Integrate kindergarten writing activities with drawing or painting.,
Mesh your writing instruction with phonics instruction.,
Use a handwriting copybook or worksheets throughout the year.,
Have students keep a writing journal.,
Take a mid-year assessment to determine how to develop kindergarten writing skills for the rest of the year.",How to Develop Kindergarten Writing Skills," You cannot teach kindergarten writing to children who struggle with letter recognition. It's okay if they write some letters backwards, as long as they know what all letters look like.;
,, As children advance, begin writing short paragraphs or stories for the kids to copy daily.

, This will appeal to students with a natural writing ability, since they know they are spelling and using the words correctly in their writing.

, Kids enjoy being creative, and being able to write about something that they created will help them relate personally to the writing.


Have them draw anything they want and write a sentence or words describing the picture. For young kindergartners, don't focus on capitalization or punctuation until later in the year.
Provide a question or fun idea for the kids to draw about, then have them write a sentence or words that describe the picture.

, As kids begin to remember all the letter sounds, they can start trying to spell words on their own. This helps them write independently and advance from using only a few letters in their writing to creating words, although many will be misspelled.

, The repetition will insure that kids know proper pencil direction when writing letters and understand how to write upper- and lower-case letters on lined paper.

, Encourage kindergartners to write in their journals daily, using a prompt you provide or their own idea. There are writing journals available that have a large blank space on top for an illustration and lined paper beneath for a sentence or story.

, This will let you know if students are ready to move onto the minor mechanics of writing, such as adding periods and capitalization, or if they still need help organizing and writing down ideas.

Prepare some music for some sing-a-longs.",How to Choose Entertainment for Preschoolers on Long Trips," Generally, preschoolers are becoming very independent, and many will want to pick out their own toys. However, most preschoolers do not always have the best sense of judgement and may want to take their talking toys, or toys with a million pieces, or watercolors that are too messy to be used during travel. Help your preschooler choose by picking out a pile of toys and activities; five per hour is a good rule. 
, Start looking through your child's playroom or cabinets and remember to ditch a toy if it meets any of the following criteria:

It's made up of many small pieces. Avoid toys that have more than three small pieces to go with it. Many small pieces are hard to keep track of and easily lost.
It's noisy. Fellow passengers do not appreciate noise, so skip the electronic toys and any other toy that make noise, except tablets and movies (as long as you bring headphones).
It can easily roll away. Balls and cars with wheels would not be a good idea.
It's large. Pack lightly. No large dump trucks or hardcover books!

, Set out three toys at a time and tell your child to pick one of them and place them in their backpack. Once your child is finished, put away the remaining toys and call yourself done.

Try to do this a few days before you leave. Even though you can't make your child fully forget them, hiding them away for a few days before the trip will ensure your child isn't totally bored of them.

, Be sure to do this while your child is away at preschool or asleep in bed! Walk around your house and look for toys that may work for more entertainment; look for three toys per hour, for half of your trip. Keep this a secret until your child becomes really bored of their backpack., You just want to avoid anything too messy, but a coloring book and crayons should work. Alternatively, you can try Magic Ink or Crayola Color Wonder materials. It is a great way to scribble out energy. Plus, no mess will be made because it only works on special paper., These are great for preschoolers! They're cheap, small, portable, and fun to do. Now, they are safe because your child is finally a preschooler. Try to find your child's favorite character when looking for Play Packs and searching at your local Dollar Tree., The sky is the limit! Read to your child, or work on reading together. Make a visit to the library a couple days before your trip to find plenty of books for your trip (paperbacks are the best because they are lighter)., Bring along movies to watch in the car, or download them onto an iPad or other tablet. Also, download your child's favorite games on a portable device and be sure that it is fully charged!, They are fun to twist, and you can challenge your preschooler to create different shapes., Toys like this are a fun way to ""create"" without mess, and they can be used over and over again. They're also a good size and shape to hold even if you're a preschooler stuck in a car seat., Nothing passes the time like tunes, especially if you're game to sing along with your preschooler. Make a few playlists of their favorite preschool songs, including a lively one and a more quiet one for when they feel sleepy."

Encourage your child to keep reading.",How to Help Your Child With Reading," The alphabet is the bare bones of reading. In order to understand books, stories, sentences, or even words, you must first understand the letters of the alphabet. Teaching your child the alphabet will help her learn to recognize letters and sound them out so that she can later build them together to make words.Use tactile learning tools. Buy a set of three-inch foam letters and/or blocks with letters of the alphabet to play with.
As your child plays, tell her what each letter sounds like. Then ask her to try and reproduce the sound.
You can gradually advance to having your child identify which letter makes a sound that you speak. ""Quiz"" her by showing her three letters and asking, for example, which one makes the ""ah"" sound.
In addition to recognizing the appearance of a written letter, teach your child the sound each letter makes.
Work on one letter at a time, or break it into small groups of letters. For example, one day you might work on A through D, the next day E through H, and so on.;
, Vowels are the next step to progress to after learning the basic alphabet. They're a little easier to learn than consonants since there are only A, E, I, O, U, and Y. One easy way to teach vowels is to print out vowel workbook pages from a phonics website, or purchase a similar book at your local bookstore. These workbook pages typically show pictures and words, and often help break down the parts of a word. Matching the word with its corresponding image might help your child better understand the meanings of words.


You can find free vowel workbook pages online at websites like http://www.schoolexpress.com/fws/cat.php?id=2483.
Show your child pictures and say the word each image depicts.
Ask your child which vowel makes the sound for that word.For example, when you show a picture of a cat and say ""cat,"" ask your child to identify which vowel makes the ""a"" sound., Once your child has gotten the hang of vowels, you're ready to move on to consonants. Consonants can be trickier, in part because there are so many more of them. They also have more complex sounds when paired together, which can be difficult for a child to learn. Start with what's easiest and most frequently encountered, then work your way through the rest of the alphabet's consonants.Start with ""m,"" ""r,"" and ""v,"" as these consonants only make one sound each and may be the easiest to learn first.
Move on to consonants with a high rate of frequency in most basic words: ""n,"" ""r,"" ""s,"" and ""t."" These letters will be encountered very frequently, so it will be easy to show your child plenty of examples.
Move on to learning the consonants in your child's first name. She'll probably be familiar with how to pronounce her name already (depending on her age), and this can help teach her how to spell her own name as well.
From there, you can tackle the remaining consonants in alphabetical order. Be sure to review the letters you've already taught just to reinforce them from earlier.

, After your child has gotten the hang of vowels and consonants, it's time to put them all together. Forming words can be difficult, even if your child has mastered the component letters. Be patient and help your child along by moving slowly and teaching her each individual sound of a word.Point to a word or give your child an index card with a short, simple word written on it.
Ask her to sound the word out slowly, stressing the vowels and consonants in that word.
Once she's sounded the word out, ask her to say it fast. Then repeat the sounding out and fast spoken word process once or twice to reinforce it.
If your child struggles with a word, break it down into its components and ask her what word rhymes with each part of the problem word. For example, show her how ""cat"" is composed of a hard ""kuh"" sound, followed by ""æ"" (the ""a"" sound in ""bat,"" ""mat,"" etc.), followed by a hard ""t.""
Write out the rhymed word below each component of the problem word with the relevant parts underlined. Then ask her to put the sounds together to sound out the new (problem) word.
Start with short, simple words until your child gets the hang of it. As she progresses, you can advance to increasingly long or complex words and sounds.

, Now that your child is learning simple words, you may want to teach her some basic phonics rules as you proceed to more complex words. Your child may be confused why certain letters are silent, for example, or why letters paired together can produce new and unique sounds. Again, be patient, and help your child work through these new and complex words by teaching her the basics of word and sound relationships.The rules don't always work. While they work most of the time there are many exceptions, so it's important to be aware of the fact that a rule may not always apply.
Every syllable in every word needs at least one vowel. Otherwise, words would be unpronounceable.
Some vowels are silent, like the letter ""e"" in ""lake"" or ""bike.""
""C"" makes a soft ""s"" sound when it's followed by ""e,"" ""i,"" or ""y."" For example, ""city"" and ""center"" are both pronounced with a soft ""s.""
""G"" makes a soft ""j"" sound when it's followed by ""e,"" ""i,"" or ""y."" For example, ""gem"" and ""gymnastics"" both have a soft ""j"" instead of a hard ""g.""
Two consonants can be joined together to form a new sound together. For example, ""ch,"" ""sh,"" ""th,"" ""ph,"" and ""wh"" all have distinct sounds that are different from either component's sound.

, It's important that you push your child to continue learning without making things too difficult for her. Once she's ready to start reading short sentences, you should choose easy books that are engaging and fun for kids.


Find out what your child is interested in, then try looking for books that match that subject area. For example, if your child likes animals, you might look for story books about animals who work together and have educational adventures.
If your child doesn't have very many developed interests yet, you can look for general interest books for kids. Try rhyming books and simple stories about other kids, as these might be easier for your child to relate to.
Don't try to have your child read a book meant for kids in junior high school if she's still in elementary school. Pushing your child to read books that are too advanced will only frustrate and discourage her.
Dr. Seuss books make an excellent introduction to reading for both boys and girls. The stories are easy to follow and the word play makes it fun to rhyme and play with sound.Younger girls (ages three to five years old) might enjoy books like My Name is Not Isabella: Just How Big Can a Little Girl Dream? (by Jennifer Fosberry), Being Bella: Discovering How to be Proud of Your Best (by Cheryl Zuzo), The Princess Knight (by Cornelia Funke), and I Like Myself (by Karen Beaumont).
As she gets older (around elementary school age), your daughter might enjoy books like Sally Jean, Bicycle Queen (by Cari Best), Winners Never Quit (by Mia Hamm), and Not All Princesses Dress in Pink (by Jane Yolen and Heidi E. Y. Stemple).
Boys ages four to eight might enjoy books like Good Night, Good Knight (by Shelley Moore Thomas), Daniel's Mystery Egg (by Alma Flor Ada), and Arthur Writes a Story (by Marc Brown)., Reading out loud is important. Your child may have a hard time grasping the sounds a word makes, or understanding how words relate when strung together. By having your child read out loud, you can help her along the way as much as she needs.Reading out loud can help you correct your child if she makes a mistake or struggles with a word.
By having her read out loud, you can also make your child's reading practice a bonding experience. Ask her to read to you as though you don't know the story, and ask questions along the way.
You might ask questions like, ""So where is she going?"" or ""How did that happen? Why do you think he did that?""

, This is a simple technique that can help your child as she scans the page from one word to the next. Running your finger under the words will help her string words together, and over time she'll be able to do it on her own.Moving your finger under the words while your child sounds them out can help your child visually see that the words connect to carry the story along.
If your child loses her place while sounding out a word, your finger on the page can also help her remember where she left off.
As she advances, you can encourage her to use her own finger along the page instead of having you do it.

, As your child reads out loud, she might get confused by a word in the sentence. Help her work through the word, but don't just pick up after that word. By having her go back and re-read the whole sentence with the new and troublesome word, you'll help reinforce the lesson she just learned and contextualize it within that sentence.Any time your child pauses in mid-sentence and is confused by a word, help her work through the word and then have her re-read the entire sentence.
Ask questions after she completes the sentence to ""quiz"" her on whether she understood the meanings of the words she just read.
If your child isn't understanding the meanings of words in a sentence, slow down and work back through that sentence until she understands each part. Then have her re-read the whole sentence again and explain in her own words what happened.

, As your child works through short, simple sentences, she may understand the sounds and the appearance of words without fully grasping the meanings of those words. It's important that you teach her the meanings of words so that she can process information quickly and efficiently. Otherwise your child might simply be memorizing familiar words without knowing how to use them or interpret them.Explain what words mean. Don't just do this during reading lessons, but in general conversations or while watching TV/movies as well.
Ask questions about the passages your child reads. Say things like, ""What's happening now?"" or ""What happened when he did that?""
You can also ask questions about characters and places in the passages your child is reading.Talk about the things you and your child see and do everyday. Teach her new words based on things you encounter/experience, and continue to quiz her on the meanings of words she's already familiar with.

, Even if your child is reading simple words, sentences, and short books on her own, it's important that you still read to her when she's not working on her own books. You can read from more complex books that she is not yet capable of reading on her own to show her what the next stages of reading will bring.Reading to your child can help her cultivate an interest in reading and a desire to learn.
Show her how each word has its own sound, and each sound can be put together to make sentences, paragraphs, and whole books.
Start with short, simple books aimed at young children.
As your child develops an interest in reading, you may want to incorporate longer, more complex (but still age-appropriate) texts.

, Flash cards are an excellent learning tool. When your child is learning letters and words, flash cards can help her visualize what she's trying to sound out. You can even draw a picture of the object/animal/etc. that corresponds to the word on the card to help further cement the associations being learned between words and objects.Flash cards can help your child learn the association between a visual letter or word's representation and the corresponding sounds/meanings.
Flash cards let you quiz your child, focus on repetition, and start a pile of words she struggles with.

, Some parents may feel that it's helpful to scold a child who isn't grasping the words she's read. However, psychologists generally agree that support during at-home reading is more important than giving assignments or scolding negative performances. Work to correct any mistakes your child is making, but then celebrate her victory even more once she gets the words right.Praise your child whenever she completes a series of words, sentences, or pages.
Celebrate landmark accomplishments (like her first full paragraph, her first full page, etc.) with something fun and special. You might have an ice cream party with your child, or take a trip to the zoo to reward your child for her achievements.
Remember that it's okay to fail or to not always be the best. It's just as true of reading as it is for sports or athletics.
Reading should ultimately be a fun and exciting learning experience for your child. Don't be hard on your child if she makes mistakes; just help her learn from the experience and become a better reader through continued practice.

, One of the best ways you can encourage your child to become an active reader is by encouraging her to keep reading. Help her find things she's interested in and seek out books that relate to that topic.


Have your child sign up for a library card. It will open up more opportunities for reading and may get your child excited about learning.
Take your child to book stores. Browse the children's section with her and help her find something that she's really excited about, then buy it and read it with her.

Notice how they follow directions.,
Test their ability to sit still.,
Assess their motor skills.,
Observe cooperative play.,
Assess their emotional readiness.,
Make sure they are fully toilet trained.,
Check the cutoff date.,
Look up the school’s expectations.,
Screen your child.,
Get an outside opinion.,
Follow your instinct.,
Reinforce learning at home.,
Communicate with the teacher.,
Be open to repeating a grade.",How to Decide if You Should Hold Your Child Back from Kindergarten," Kindergarten children need to be able to follow 2-3 directions at a time. For example, their teacher may say, “Take some buttons and glue them onto the paper.” Give your child some 2-step directions and see how they do. They should be able to complete the task with little or no difficulty.A child may not be ready if they need multiple reminders, need prompts, or go to you between each step.;
, A child should be able to sit still for ten minutes at a time. They should be able to remain seated for stories and for group activities. Staying seated means not needing to get up or be distracted by other things going on.Take your child to storytime at the library and notice if they are able to make it through the time without too much wiggling.

, Children in kindergarten will be expected to have certain skills. In terms of activity, your child should be able to run, jump, and throw a ball. Classroom activities may require your child to hold a crayon or cut with scissors.Your child may need to be able to put on and take off their own jacket, clasp buttons, and unpack their school bag.Observe your child performing these tasks and notice if they struggle or have any difficulty with them.
Kids who struggle with motor tasks may benefit from occupational therapy.

, Your child should have an awareness of other children and how to get along with them. For example, children in kindergarten should be able to play with another child, share, and take turns.If conflict arises, they should know not to hit or hurt the other child. They should have some age-appropriate friendship skills.

Notice how your child plays and interacts with others their age. Take them to a playground or play group and observe their skills.

, Children should have some emotional skills prior to starting kindergarten.For example, they should be able to handle not getting their way without throwing a tantrum. They should be able to get through the school day without meltdowns and tantrums. If your child is clingy, they might need some practice being away from you for a few hours at a time.

Your child should be able to regulate their behavior without disrupting the class. Even if they have strong emotions, they will have some coping skills and learn to move through them without disrupting the class.

, Children in kindergarten should not have accidents or problems using the toilet. Your child should be able to self-monitor their bathroom needs and take care of them appropriately without help. They should be able to flush the toilet, wipe, and wash their hands on their own.By kindergarten, children should not have accidents or need extra clothes for toileting problems.

, Depending on where you live, the kindergarten cutoff date can vary quite a bit. Call the school district or search for your state or territory’s age requirement.For example, if your family just moved, double check the age requirement if you’ve moved to a new state because it might differ significantly.

, Find out whether kindergarten is full-day or half-day. Look into any requirements children must fulfill before attending kindergarten. Then, look at what skills they will learn through the year. Some kindergartens are immediately academic while others take a softer approach to learning and play.Call the school district or ask to speak with a kindergarten teacher in order to get a better grasp of how things are run and what you and your child might expect.

, Many schools offer or require a kindergarten readiness test. These assessments are for children ages 4-6 and are given the year before kindergarten or the first few weeks of class. They measure academic, social, and developmental readiness. These tests aren’t standardized and don’t require the child to write. Instead, they focus on asking the child questions and observing them in tasks.If your school district does not offer kindergarten screenings, request one or seek a screening from an outside source or educational center.

, Talk to your child’s nanny, babysitter, daycare provider, or preschool teacher about where they stand. Ask how your child compares to other children their age and if they have comparable skills. Consider any remarks that your child may be too socially or academically immature for kindergarten.For example, if you get reports that your child struggles to share or that they throw frequent tantrums, it might be a consideration toward their kindergarten enrollment.

, Ultimately, the decision lies with you and what you think is best for your child. If you think your child is ready, go for it! If you have some doubts, consider those. Make a decision you think will benefit your child both now and in the long run.Consider your child’s skills, the information you have, and your own feelings.

, Before kindergarten starts, call the teacher and ask what skills you should work on with your child. Once kindergarten starts, keep in touch with the teacher and continue to ask what skills need to be developed. If your child is struggling with something, reinforce it at home.For example, if your child has trouble following multi-step directions, get in the habit of giving directions at home.

, If you decide to put your child into kindergarten, talk to their teacher before class begins and throughout the year. Let them know of your concerns and that you’d like to be kept up-to-date on how your child is doing. They might contact you within the first few weeks of school and let you know your child’s progress and trajectory.

For example, say, “I considered holding my child back this year due to their social skills and motor skills. Please let me know how they are doing and whether they should continue with the school year.”

, If you’re on the fence, enroll your child in kindergarten. Keep an open mind, especially at the beginning of the year. If your child is struggling or could use some one-on-one help, pull them out or have them repeat kindergarten.If your child begins class and is pulled out, work on specific skills to help them succeed the next year.

Have a Place for Everything.,
Contain It.,

Make Clear What the Jobs Are and How to Do Them.,
Establish a Clean-up Signal.,
A Clean Classroom is Everyone's Responsibility at All Times.,
Have Patience.,
Give positive feedback.",How to Create an Efficient Kindergarten Classroom Clean Up," Clean-up is simpler if every object has a designated area. In addition, there are zones for each kind of material: the art area, block area, book area, sensory table, drama loft, science area. Clean-up is easier if objects do not generally go wandering throughout the room.;
, Make containers easy to manage containers, such as see-through plastic boxes that allow students easily find what they need without rummaging through a dozen boxes.

, Make it extremely clear where everything goes. Label both with words and with pictures--kindergartners are developing reading skills.

, Avoid the temptation to put too many materials out at once. Doing so may create so much of a mess that the students can become overwhelmed before even giving clean-up a try.

, Don't assume the students know how to clean up at all--some may not ever have had this responsibility at home. Go over these explicitly with the students. The rules of clean-up at ""free play"" or ""exploration time"" should be made very clear. A rotating job chart can be very useful in fair job distributions.

, To let children know that clean-up time is approaching, it's important to pick an easily identifiable signal to use near the end of the work time: flipping the lights, a song, holding up one hand and using the other to cover your mouth, using a clapping pattern. Have your students practice responding to the signal.

, Emphasize that everyone needs to help keep a tidy workspace, not just at free play.

, Kindergartners usually have a lot of difficulty with tidiness. It's real work, often done when one is tired, usually not a lot of fun, and quite honestly, most young students do not really overtly care a lot about. So have patience and compassion yourself.

, The tell the children they did a good job, which will give them motivation to clean up again in the future.

Create an environment that stimulates creativity.,
Exhibit an attitude that promotes creativity in preschool.,
Conduct activities that help children develop creativity.,
Avoid things that are proven to stifle creativity.",How to Develop Creativity in Preschool,"


Display art and craft projects at children's eye-level.
Stock the classroom with a wide variety of materials for creative play, including clay, paint, colored pencils, sand, pails, shovels, molds, stamps, stickers, putty, play dough, chalk, crayons, markers, construction paper, pipe cleaners, games, puzzles, books, blocks, string, Styrofoam and more.
Expose children to diversity in the classroom by using decorative objects, learning materials and preschool curriculum lessons that are representative of cultures and ways of life from all over the world.
Decorate with a variety of novel, whimsical and unexpected objects to spark children's imaginations.;
, Studies show that this is a critical factor in regards to fostering a child's creativity. The type of attitude that is most conducive to bringing out creativity in children has the following characteristics:


Present problems with multiple solutions, as opposed to 1 ""right"" answer. A preschool curriculum for developing creativity should include open-ended problems with the potential for many creative solutions. For example, rather than ask what color an object is, ask how many objects can be found for a color.
Allow flexibility in interpreting instructions, as opposed to an enforcing strict methodology. For example, rather than tell preschoolers how to complete a project in step-by-step format, give them all of the project materials and ask them to figure out how to put it together.
Encourage imaginative play. Preschool curriculum should not be regimented, but instead should allow children to create their own play games and follow their impulses.
Maintain an attitude of non-judgment. The critical examination of a child's ideas should be encouraged, no matter how far out or unrealistic those ideas may seem. Additionally, original and creative ideas should be acknowledged with positive regard.
Praise the creativity and methods used during the execution of a task, as opposed to praising only the completed project.
Ask a lot of questions. Probe preschoolers for explanations as they engage in creative play, and encourage them to elaborate.
Provide choices. Encourage children to provide input about what they want to do and how they want to do it.

,


Brainstorming games are a great way to bring out creativity in children. Some examples of brainstorming games include: telling children to describe what they would do if they were in a different time/place, asking them to tell a story using only gestures and taking turns building a story - 1 sentence at a time, per student.
Art projects should be an integral part of the preschool curriculum - not just considered recess or play time. Allow children to choose from the classroom stock of materials, and to have free creative reign when engaging in art time.

,


Reward systems. Studies show that, when children expect to earn rewards for ""correct"" answers or ""good"" behavior, they actually modify their behavior in a way that restricts their ability to think creatively and uniquely.
Expectations. Letting children know before they complete a project that they will be judged or graded for their work limits creativity in preschool settings.
Observation. When children are being watched as they work, they are less likely to express uninhibited creativity.
Certain toys. Talking dolls and toys that talk or sing to you are good for learning once a week, but that is all. Otherwise children will not play or think of how to use the toy, they just listen and this can teach, but should only be used once a week.
Only CD players. Yes, use these once a week, but not every day. You should be playing instruments, not just pushing a button.

Focus your presentation.,
Less is more.,
Decide whether to use media or not.,
Practice.,
Visualize success.,
Dress appropriately.,
Deal with the jitters.,
Engage the audience.,
Give an engaging performance.,
Treat your presentation as a story.,
Talk more slowly.,
Have a killer closing.",How to Give a Presentation," Having a long, rambling presentation that is hard to follow is not going to win you any audience interest. You need to make sure that your presentation is clear and focused and that any asides you throw into it are there to back up the main point.It's best to have 1 main thesis statement or overarching theme and 3 main points that back-up or flesh-out your main theme. Any more than that and your audience is going to start losing interest. This means that any facts and information that are a part of your presentation should back up these 3 main points and overarching theme.
For example: If you're giving a presentation about 17th century alchemy, bringing up the history of alchemy is fine (and probably necessary), but don't mire your audience in its history instead of focusing alchemy in the 17th century. Your 3 points could be something like ""alchemy in public opinion,"" ""famous 17th century alchemists,"" and ""the legacy of 17th century alchemy."";
, You don't want to overwhelm your audience with information and important points. Even if they're interested in your topic they'll starting spacing out and then you've lost them. You need to stick to your 3 points and overall point and you need to make sure that you only use the information that you need to support and clarify those points.


Pick your very best supporting facts, information, or quotes for your presentation. Don't bury your audience in information.

, It isn't always necessary to use a powerpoint, or visual representation, especially if you're already an engaging speaker and have interesting subject matter. In fact, a lot of times, using visual media simply distracts from the focal point, that is the presentation.


Make sure you're using media to enhance your presentation and not to drown it out. The presentation is key. Anything else is just accessorizing.
For example: to get back to 17th century alchemy, to back up your information about alchemy in the public opinion, you might want to show images from public pamphlets about the dangers of alchemy and see what people of the time period had to say about it and see what the more famous alchemists had to say about it.
Also, you want to make sure that you pick a medium that you are comfortable in and thorough in knowledge. If you don't know a thing about powerpoint, maybe consider writing your main points on a white board, or passing out handouts with your main points and evidence on them.

, This is one that for some reason, lack of time perhaps, people neglect to do and it is absolutely key to giving a good presentation. Running through the presentation before the actual event gives you time work out any kinks or problems with your notes and with your technology and makes the presentation itself go more smoothly.


A good tip is to film yourself or audiotape of yourself giving your practice presentation so you can see what distracting verbal and physical tics you have, so that you can work on eliminating them before the presentation itself. (Verbs tics would be things like ""um..."" and ""uh..."" and using ""like"" inappropriately; physical tics are things like shifting your weight from foot to foot or messing with your hair.)
Just remember that rehearsals usually run about 20% shorter than your actual presentation, so take that into account if you're running on a time limit.

, It may seem like a silly thing to do, but visualizing a successful presentation can actually help you achieve a successful presentation. You'll be more inclined towards success if you've been prepping your brain for it. So beforehand, sit somewhere quietly for a few minutes and picture the presentation going well., You want to dress for success. Wearing nicer clothes can help get you into the mindset of giving a good presentation. You also want to be comfortable, however, so you should try to find a reasonable medium between dressing super snazzy and dressing comfortably.


For example, if you aren't comfortable wearing heels, don't wear them just for the presentation. You'll be distracted by your discomfort and that will come across in the presentation. There are plenty of good shoe choices that have no or a low heel.
Clean, nice slacks or a skirt and nice, button-down shirt in neutral colors are always good choices for presentation wear. You also don't particularly want your clothing choice to distract from the presentation, so perhaps avoid that brilliant hot pink shirt.

, Pretty much everyone gets nervous about presenting, even when it isn't in front of a bunch of people. That's okay. All you have to do is mask the fact that you're nervous, since you won't be able to avoid the jitters themselves.Before the presentation, clench and unclench your hands several times to deal with the adrenaline and then take 3 deep, slow breaths.
Call up a smile, even if you feel like hurling. You can trick your brain into thinking that you're less anxious than you actually are and you'll also be able to hide your nervousness from your audience.

, One way to make your presentation memorable and interesting is to interact with your audience. Don't act like there's a wall between you and your audience, engage them in the material. Talk directly to them, not at them or at the back wall, but to your audience.


Make eye contact with your audience. Don't stare at one particular person, but section up the room and make eye contact with someone in each section on a rotational basis.
Ask questions of your audience and take questions during your presentation. This will make it more of a conversation and therefore more interesting.
Tell an amusing anecdote to illustrate your point. From the above examples about 17th century alchemy, you could find an amusing alchemical anecdote from the time period, or you could talk about your own forays into alchemy.

, Giving an engaging performance isn't the exact same thing as engaging your audience (although, hopefully, your performance will engage your audience). It simply means that you make the performance itself interesting and dynamic.Move around, but make your movements deliberate. Don't nervously shift your feet (in fact, it's a good idea to imagine that your feet are nailed to the floor except for those times you deliberately choose to move).
Use your vocal inflections to create a more dynamic presentation. Vary your voice as you're talking. Nobody (ever) wants to sit there and listen to someone drone on and on in dull monotone, no matter how interesting the material (think Professor Binns from Harry Potter; that's what you don't want).
Try to create a balance between rehearsed and spontaneous. Spontaneous, on the spot, movement and asides can be great as long as you are really comfortable, otherwise they can sidetrack your presentation and make it rambling. Mess around with spontaneous and rehearsed when you're practicing and you'll get a feel for it.

, To get your audience's interest you'll need to connect them with the material on an emotional level and the best way to do that is to think of your presentation like a story you're telling.Quickly introduce your topic and don't assume that your audience is familiar with all the terms, especially if your topic is one that isn't widely known.
Figuring out why you want (or have to) give this presentation will help you work with an overarching story/theme. Maybe you want to pass the class. Maybe you're convincing people to give you money or join you in a philanthropic endeavor or act for a social or political reason. Channel that desire into your presentation. You're answering the question of why they would want to pass you or why they would want to fund you. That's the story you're telling.

, One of the most frequent things that people do to sabotage their own presentation is talking way too quickly and so many people make this mistake. They get nervous and they whip through their presentation, leaving the audience gasping at the tidal wave of information. Don't do this.


Have water with you and take a sip when you feel you're going too fast.
If you have a friend in the class or meeting, arrange with them beforehand that they will let you know with a signal whether you're talking too quickly. Look over their way occasionally and check your progress.
If you find that you're running out of time and you haven't finished, simply drop or summarize your leftover material. Acknowledge the leftover material as something that can be discussed later or in the Q&A.

, The beginning and the closing of a presentation are the parts that people tend to remember, so you want to make sure that you end with a punch to the gut (figuratively speaking; don't hit your audience). You'll need to reiterate those 3 most important points and make sure the listener knows why they should care about your topic.


Make it clear what the listeners now know and why it is important that they have this new information.
Conclude with examples or stories about your main point and take home message. You might want a slide which summarizes your presentation. For example, you might conclude with a story about the nature of alchemy in the modern era (perhaps in a film) to show its malleable nature.

Use the Internet to investigate local school options.,
Compare locations and travel time to your home.,
Visit each of the choices for kindergarten schools during an open house.,
Study the current students and teachers closely.,
Search for a school that gives its children the opportunity to actively participate in learning.,
Find a kindergarten with a low child-to-teacher ratio.,
Look at the walls of the room during your visit.,
Ask the teachers what the children learn every day.,
Verify the school's policy on helping children who are both ahead of the rest of the class and those who need a little extra help.,
Talk to parents whose children either attended the school in the past or attend the school now.,
Check to see if there is an after-school program your child can participate in, especially if you work full time.,
Think about the future.,
Choose a school with an absolute zero-tolerance policy.,
Ask the school what its discipline policies are.",How to Choose a Kindergarten," View the school's websites, and read parents' unbiased reviews wherever available. Ensure that the websites are current; if the sites are not up-to-date, it may be an indicator that the schools might not pay attention to your child either.;
, Remember that you may have to provide transportation or have your child ride a bus to the school every weekday, twice per day. If the school is far, or inconvenient, you need to determine if the benefit outweighs the trouble.

, Most schools offer this just before enrollment time, and it's a chance to view the school. If a school you're interested in doesn't have an open house, ask the office to provide someone to take you on a guided tour. A school that won't allow you to see it operate should be avoided.

, Generally speaking, a good kindergarten will have happy, engaged staff and children who are energetic and participatory. If the mood of the school is upbeat, it's a good sign that the school is a viable choice. If it seems like no one wants to be there, your child shouldn't be either.

, The best options will allow the students to play while learning, with materials and each other. Make sure that the teachers have a varied curriculum to follow that includes pretend play, reading, painting, puzzles, and so on. Any school that expects children to sit stationary for a long time should be left out.

, This allows teachers to give attention to individual children several times each day. The hands-on time will likely be your child's favorite part of the day and will help nurture his or her love for learning by making them feel special.

, The artwork and writings of the children should be prominently displayed. This helps to give the children pride in their work, and kindergartens that don't should be avoided.

, Learning numbers, alphabet, beginning science such as nature exploration, frequent reading, and computers should all be included in daily activities of the school you select. There should also be a minimum of 1 hour for a recess-like break, outside whenever possible, which gives your child an opportunity to recharge.

, The children in the classroom will learn at a very different rate, and you will need to make sure that no matter where your child lands on the learning curve that he or she will be taken care of appropriately by the teachers.

, Ask them how satisfied they are, what they like best and worst about the school, and for positive and negative aspects to pay particular attention to.

, Many schools offer this option, and you will need to review what types of activities are available and what the cost is. Look for schools that continue to engage the children with academics as opposed to simple babysitting.

, Ask what the kids are doing in more advanced grades as this will be a glimpse into your child's future. Make sure the older children are adequately challenged, that future classrooms are teaching appropriate math and reading skills, and that both children and teachers are still happy.

, Find out how the school addresses issues such as bullying or discrimination. While most schools will give you a canned response, don't be shy about asking questions or providing hypothetical, what-would-you-do-if scenarios. These issues can start at a very young age, and you will want to make sure your child is protected appropriately from the start.

, Make sure it has clear rules and regulations for students to follow, and that they are rules you can and will follow at home for consistency. Ask the teachers and the principal how the rules are enforced and what the penalties are for violating them.

Understand the basics of phonics.,
Learn that there are approximately 44 sounds based on the English alphabet.,
Understand the general themes of instruction for beginning readers in preschool.,
Look for certain instructional basics in a phonics program.,
Look for phonics programs that can be purchased online.",How to Choose a Preschool Phonics Program," Before you choose a specific phonics program, review the basics of phonics, including terminology. Teaching preschoolers phonics begins with the alphabet.


Select alphabet flashcards of upper and lowercase letters. Preschoolers can interact with instructors using flashcards.
Choose clear graphic charts of the alphabet for your preschoolers. These should include upper and lowercase letters.
Try alphabet wheels. Children spin the wheel to match the letter to a picture that begins with that letter.;
, These are called phonemes.


Distinguish that, of these sounds, there are about 70 common spellings associated with them.
Apply letters used to represent these sounds, either singularly or in groups. These are called graphemes.
Note that a phonogram is a letter and sound combination that has more than 1 grapheme or phoneme.

, The basics of phonics instruction include alphabet sounds, short and long vowels, consonants, blends (which refers to how clustered consonants make sounds when blended together), and vowel and consonant digraphs (2 consonants or vowels that when blended make 1 sound. For example, the letters ph, sh or th).

,


Choose a program that teaches vowel sounds before any whole words are introduced to the child. For example, pronunciations of both short and long vowels are taught (a,e,i,o,u).
Look for a program that concentrates on the consonant sounds before whole words are taught.
Check that the 44 phonic sounds and 70 common ways of spelling these sounds (called phonograms) are part of the program.
Make sure at least 1 short vowel sound and several consonants are introduced to the child prior to teaching whole word sounds. For example, the short vowel of ""a"" would be taught along with the sound of ""c"" or ""p"" before forming the words ""cat"" and pat.""
Look for a program that includes blending letters. An example of this would be teaching the sound of ""ch"" before a word like ""chat.""
Choose a program that includes incremental steps. This means that the program focuses on learning rules and practicing those steps before moving to another step. This is particularly important for beginning readers in preschool.

, Popular programs include Hooked on Phonics, International Phonics, Jolly Phonics, Letterland, Alphaphonics and Rocketphonics. Many programs can be downloaded, with costs varying between $200 to $500 USD. Each phonics program has several mediums of learning.


Choose workbook sets. These sets allow children to view, match and color letters and pictures. Look for workbook sets with a focus on pre-K, early readers.
Focus on a comprehensive preschool program involving worksheets, posters games and teacher guides. Use a comprehensive program as a stand-alone start to the alphabet and phonics for preschoolers, or as supplemental material for other phonics programs.
Choose programs that incorporate workbooks and flashcards with more sensory-based mediums, such as CDs with songs and videos featuring phonic-based games.

Stay calm.,
Be audible.Project your voice to the back of the room to make sure everyone can hear you.,
Dress the part.Some group presentations require little in the way of wardrobe adjustments.,
Use your hands to emphasize key points.For instance, when insisting that the internet is “the greatest tool” in the hands of today’s historians, lightly bring your hand down on the lectern when you intone each of the three words.,
Use props.,
Use a story in your presentation.Listing fact after fact in a dry way can bore both you and your audience.,
Adopt a conversational style.,
End with a strong conclusion.",How to Give a Group Presentation1," If you can interact with your classmates before going to present, you will feel more at ease during the presentation. Look directly out and over the heads of the audience at a point toward the center rear of the classroom in which you’re speaking. Get into the presentation and try to enjoy it.


Pretending to be calm can actually make you calm. Don’t engage in nervous habits like pacing back and forth while presenting, shifting your weight about, blinking constantly, or rubbing your face or the back of your neck.;
, Don’t mumble or speak into your notes or the computer. If you want to emphasize something, raise your voice. Use a lower volume when adding intensity., Other times -- if you’re a group presenting for a business class, for instance -- you’ll want to dress professionally. Men should wear a black, navy, or gray suit, a blue or white dress shirt, and a matching tie. Women have more options: a dress with a sweater over it, or a blouse and matching suit are good option.


Whatever your gender, choose muted earth tones and avoid transparent or mesh-like material.Avoid brightly colored clothes and energetic patterns like polka dots or plaid.

, This will give you a stage presence and drive home the main points you’re explaining.

, If possible, introduce props to illustrate your points. For instance, you could bring a small piece of amethyst or quartz if presenting on rock formations and pass it around the class.

, Open your presentation with a story to foreground how important your topic is. For instance, if your presentation is on bicycle safety, you could present a story about someone who was hit by car but survived because he was wearing a helmet.


People love stories, and your presentation will be more memorable if you incorporate a story into your presentation.

, By the time you present, you should feel confident about the whole presentation. Smile! Don’t stare at your notes during the entire time you’re presenting. Glance at them briefly and try to maximize the time you spend looking out at the audience.Keep your body language open by keeping your hands at your sides or in front of you. Don’t cross your arms.

, Summarize your main points. For instance, if you presented about the dangers of drunk driving, you could list the main points of your presentation in a few simple sentences by explaining, “Drunk driving is extremely costly. Not only could you hurt or kill yourself or someone else, but you might crash your car and end up in prison. Don’t let that happen to you.” Thank the audience for listening and allow the next group to present."
"
Listen to other group presentations.By hearing other presentations -- both solo presenters and group presenters -- you’ll get a sense of what works.,
Be familiar with your audience.Who is going to hear the speech?,
Adopt the right tone.Avoid slang and informal language.,
Incorporate visuals.,
Draft your notes.You should not try to remember exactly what you’re going to say during your presentation.,
Practice several times.After each member of the group has drafted their part of the presentation, meet with each other to practice the presentation.,
Adjust each part of the presentation as needed.",How to Give a Group Presentation2," When listening to public speakers, note their timing, emphasis, and word choice. Borrow from their presentations to craft your own style.


The Toastmasters (http://www.toastmasters.org/) are an international group which encourages people to improve their public speaking skills. Find a club near you to meet seasoned presenters who can give you advice and answer your presentation-related questions.
If your group is presenting during a second round after an initial day of presentations, listen to what your fellow presenters do. Analyze their presentations and try to incorporate their strong points into your own presentation.

, How many people will be in the audience? What do they know? What might they want to know? Tailor your group presentation around these questions. Thinking ahead about these and other questions will ensure your group presentation is a success.


For instance, if you’re presenting about how to drill an oil well to a group of oil industry insiders, you’ll be able to use a lot of highly technical terminology with them in your presentation. If you’re talking to a group of high-school students about the same topic, you’ll need to use more simplistic language and glaze over some of the specific processes.

, Keep your presentation professional and formal. Don’t introduce each section of the presentation with some banter like, “Hi, how is everyone?” This will break up the flow of the presentation and detract valuable presentation time from your group., There are a number of ways to incorporate visuals into your presentation, but the easiest way is to use PowerPoint. PowerPoint is a program which helps you create a digital slideshow with your computer and a digital projector.


PowerPoint presentations work best when you adopt a minimalistic approach.Do not attempt to jam a bunch of text into a single slide. Instead, use several slides, each with a high-quality image and a single point or sentence.
Don’t use a digital slideshow to replace your presentation. You or your group should always be the focus during the presentation. The slideshow is only there to support what you’re explaining.

, Instead, each member of your group should write a few main points on some note cards and consult them during their part of the presentation.


How much or how little you need written on your note cards depends on you. Some people might need an entire sentence to start them off talking about a given topic. Others might need to see just one word and will be able to launch into the next part of their presentation.
The number and style of the notes each group member utilizes depends on their memory and the amount of time they spent practicing.

, If possible, practice in front of a group of family or friends. Deliver your presentation just as you intend to in class.


If you didn’t feel comfortable with your portion of the presentation, practice it one more time either in front of the test audience or at home. Use your practice time as a chance to work out potential kinks.

, Solicit feedback from your test audience and from your fellow group members. Ask if anything was confusing or needed more explanation. Incorporate changes regarding your visuals, props, and speaking speed (as well as your content) into the final presentation where appropriate.


If the presentation is much too short, revise it to add more material. If your presentation if too long, revise it by eliminating unnecessary material.Don’t guess how long each member of your group is speaking for. Use a stop watch to measure each group member’s time and the overall time for the group.
Group members whose presentation times are too short should be made to lengthen them, and group members whose presentation times are too long should be made to shorten them. If the overall presentation time falls within the correct parameters, however, you group could consider allowing one person to speak for longer than another if both group members feel comfortable doing so.

"
"
Select your group or teammates.,
Conduct preliminary research.If you are unsure what the content of each section should be, conduct some preliminary research.,
Divide your presentation into logical sections.,
Assign each section to an individual in the group.The easiest way to figure out which person should present which section is to ask people what they want to do.,
Figure out how long each person should speak.,
Collaborate with your group.Ensure that everyone understands the goals of both the overall project and each specific group member’s task.Gather with your fellow group members as soon as possible after receiving or selecting your group’s overall topic and divvying up the subtopics.,
Conduct research specific to your section of the presentation.Make suggestions to your fellow group members regarding sources which might help them with their particular portion of the presentation.,
Check back with your group periodically.",How to Give a Group Presentation3," If possible, select members of your group who are hardworking and have excellent speaking skills. Do not choose to work with people who are lazy or who will probably not do their part. Remember, your group is only as strong as its weakest member, and you will be evaluated as a group, not as individuals.

, For instance, if you and your fellow group members know nothing about bats, each of you should take a day or two to look broadly at the subject of bats. Use the time to think about what a logical structure for your presentation might be. Maybe you’ll conclude that your presentation sections consist of an intro, a section on life cycle, a section on feeding habits, a section on their sonar abilities, and a section on habitat, then a conclusion.

, A standard presentation model involves crafting a presentation with an introduction, one or two middle sections, and a conclusion.This structure is highly flexible. For instance, if you have four group members, you can divide the middle section into two equal parts. If you have five people in your group, you can divide the middle section of the presentation into three parts.

, When everyone works on a section which they chose willingly, you will all feel good about researching and writing your selected section.


If you and another person both want to research and present on a given section of the presentation, try to come to a compromise. Flip a coin or try rock-paper-scissors to decide who gets to do it.

, When you’re working with a group, everyone needs to speak for an equal amount of time. To figure out how long each person should speak, divide the total time you have by the number of members in your group. Try to keep your presentation within the allotted time.For instance, if you have twenty minutes to present and you have four people in your group, you will each speak for five minutes.

, Together, brainstorm what each part should be about and how it contributes to the overall structure of the presentation. Each group member should explain what they envision their part will consist of.


If you or another group member has doubts about the focus of a particular part, express them openly to your fellow group member. For instance, you could say, “I think your ideas are basically on target, but have you considered adding ____ into your section of the presentation?”
To stay on target, your group should draft a statement of purpose along the lines of, “Out presentation is about the importance of bats to the local ecosystem.”Each part of the presentation should then be oriented toward developing on that statement. This way, you avoid several mini-presentations on individual aspects of bats such as their life cycle, habitats, and so on.

, If you come across info which could aid another member of your group, share it with them. Follow up on suggestions you receive and gather the information you’ll need to draft your presentation.


Magazines, newspapers, encyclopedias, and the internet are all useful sources of information. Ensure your sources are credible, however, before using them.

, You should touch base with your fellow group members at least once each week to ensure everyone is still on track. Use email, phone calls, text messaging, and face-to-face meeting to keep the group in regular contact. If anyone needs help or if your group thinks a certain part needs to be refocused, work closely with each member of your team so that everyone knows what is being changed.

Acknowledge that there are developmental, emotional, and social aspects and requirements about preschool readiness.,
Ask yourself some developmental questions:


Is your child potty-trained, or started with it?,
Ask yourself some emotional questions:


Can your child be away from you for a prolonged time?,
Ask yourself some social questions:


Is your child agreeable with taking turns and sharing with others?,
Avoid making preschool a single-person decision at all costs.,
Ask your child's pediatrician.,
Sit down with your significant other.,
Inquire opinions from other family members.",How to Decide if a Child Is Ready for Preschool,";
, Some preschools require children to be fully potty-trained, while others may accept those whom are still continuing.
Is your child able to focus on an activity for a period? Many arts and crafts projects may take at least 10 minutes or children may be sitting in a circle listening to the leader.
How is your child's stimulation level? To a child, being in an environment with all sorts of puzzles and other learning toys, other kids, and the involvement in activities may be either lots of pressure or a positive breeze. Children with a very high stimulation level may have a difficult time listening or paying attention to simple rules or requests, while children with a very low stimulation level may not want to join or participate in activities as much or find certain stuff not appealing., Most to all preschools are four hours a day, whether it is Monday through Friday or certain days of the week.
Can you be away from your child for a prolonged time? Nursing a child since birth and seeing them go to school, even if it's preschool, is a huge emotional deal to parents as well. With your child in another place without you, you have to be strong inside as well. Children will pick up their parents' emotions very quickly, positive and negative.

, It's not a requirement, but practicing one-on-one with them by sharing food, sharing crayons, or taking turns with puzzles are perfect suggestions to increase these skills.
How much interaction does your child have with kids their own age? Play dates, taking your child to the park or playground, and infant daycare are all great starters before your child enters preschool.
How much adult interaction does your child have? Children act very differently around family members, your friends, and in public places, such as restaurants.

, You may see that your child is ready for preschool, but it is always good to get a second or several opinions.

, Your child's pediatrician may give you insight concerning your child's developmental areas, even information that you don't know about. They can also give you advice on how they perceive developments and offer advice on how to improve them.

, This is the most personal decision agreement or opinion concerning preschool. If one of you isn't comfortable with the idea or believe the child is not ready, do not force it on them to change their mind. Talk it out and think of ways to improve the cons.

, Children will act different around their own mother and around their grandmother.

Think back to the last time you were under pressure to perform in front of a crowd.,
Understand the difference between an impromptu versus an unprepared presentation.,
Please with threes.,
Get off on the right foot.,
Grab your listeners’ attention right away by beginning with the issue about which you are asked to speak.,
Keep it going.,
Plan to cover no more than three points in the body of your presentation.,
Tell them in broader detail what you just outlined.,
Bring it to a close.,
Burn this basic presentation structure into your mind.",How to Give a Powerful Presentation when You Have Little Time to Prepare," When is the last time someone asked you for a “brief update” on the status of an upcoming project in “about an hour”? Did you ever stand up in the heat of a membership meeting where negativity prevailed and asked members to consider a more positive stance on an issue? Use these scenarios to help you realize that you are capable of “thinking on your feet”. A well-prepared presentation is possible at the last minute. Take the initiative and be willing to make impromptu presentations. It only takes a little practice, and you can apply these on-the-spot presentation principles whether you speak informally to five people or give a formal speech to fifth.


Note that the more you prepare yourself ahead of time to give impromptu presentations, the more you will be the one looked to to keep everyone else informed.;
, The idea of preparing yourself for an impromptu presentation may seem like a contradiction. Impromptu presentations do not mean you do not prepare. Even if you only have five minutes, you can put an effective presentation together with prior “general preparation”. When you expect to give an impromptu presentation at any time, you become ready to do so at a moment’s notice.


Sear the basic structure of a presentation into your memory and volunteer to give speeches on the spot. The more you practice giving impromptu presentations, the more comfortable you become doing so. Just as people trained to respond to emergencies at a moment’s notice, you will be able to respond with a solid presentation at a moment’s notice.

, Otherwise called the ""rule of threes"", this means that you create a presentation using a speech structure that consists of three main components: an opening, a body, and a closing. Manage these three major parts of a presentation and your speech will be organized every time.

, Develop an attention-grabbing opening. On short notice, few people expect you to be witty or humorous. Typically, last-minute presenters are expected to address a specific issue or concern. Implement the following techniques, however, and you just might come across as witty and instantly engaging in spite of your last-minute performance.

, You can do this by asking a question that directly reflects back to the topic. For example, if you are asked to present the status of a project, begin your presentation with the question, “One of our current projects is Project You-Name-It. Just where do we currently stand at this point with Project You-Name-It, and are we on track for our end goal?” Miracle of miracles! This is exactly what everyone in the room is there to find out so you immediately have their attention. You also buy yourself a few more seconds to figure out what you need to tell them.

, The body of your presentation – whether it takes five minutes or fifty minutes to present – should then answer the question posed in your opening. You have valuable information to give to the attendees and you have their attention.

, People best retain up to three pieces of information so list those three project points to the group up front. For example, (1) “This is where we stand,” (2) “These are our budget concerns,” and (3) “This is the proposed process we will implement to move the project forward.”

, If you are up-to-date with your project, you should already know this information and can expand upon it. The last statement in the body of your speech should then summarize the three points you just explained. You could say, “In summary, where things stand include Points One, Two, and Three. And we will overcome these concerns and move the project forward by doing actions a, b, and c”.

, The final part of the three-part presentation structure is a summary and closing statement. Start a powerful closing statement by addressing the opening question. This brings the presentation full circle and sums up why everyone is listening. Then ask whether you answered all concerns, and field questions. Finish your presentation by calling the group to action or reaffirming everyone’s commitment to the project. Examples might include, “With the status I just presented, I ask that you continue your commitment to move forward with the project,” or “With the concerns I addressed, I ask that you designate another person to help with the task at hand.” These steps reaffirm the commitment of the group members or of management.

, When called upon to speak, you will be able to create a well-prepared impromptu presentation. You can apply this presentation structure to almost any speech you give.

Thank everyone involved.",How to Conduct a Panel Discussion," Ideally, the topic of discussion should be important to enough people that you can involve people with significantly different interests or backgrounds.However, avoid the trap of making a topic so general or vague that the discussion becomes unfocused.If you are having difficulty balancing these goals, remember the topic does not need to be divisive. Some panels are created to offer advice or information, and these do not always have competing points of view on display.;
, A panel of three to five people usually creates the most interesting discussion.Look for well-informed people from a variety of backgrounds. For instance, a member of the public involved in the issue, someone with experience working with the issue in a business or nonprofit, and an academic who has studied the issue. Create a panel with variation in age, gender, and ethnicity as well, as a person's personal background can have a significant effect on his perspective.


Inviting at least four people may be safest, in case someone cancels at the last minute.
Invite these people several weeks in advance at a minimum, to allow them adequate time to prepare, and to give yourself time to find alternatives if one of them turns the offer down.

, Select an additional person not participating in the panel discussion, to serve as a moderator. Ideally, she should already have experience moderating panels. Select someone who understands the topic well enough to follow the discussion, and who is skilled in social situations. The moderator's main purpose is to keep the panelists focused on the audience, keep the discussion running smoothly, and help out the panelists when they stall., Individual chairs will make the participants appear closer to the audience than a solid table, encouraging audience participation.Arranging the seats in a slight circle, still mostly facing the audience, may help the panelists discuss the topic with each other. Include small tables or stands for holding notes, and provide a glass of water for each participant. Unless the room seats thirty people or fewer, provide at least one microphone for each two participants, and a personal microphone for the moderator.


Consider seating the moderator in the middle of the panelists to help him address and guide each panelist efficiently. Keeping the moderator at a podium off to one side may make his job more difficult.

, Make sure all of the participants know why the panel has been assembled well in advance, so they have time to prepare. Your panel may be trying to present practical solutions to a problem, host a complex, abstract discussion, or provide information on a topic. Let the panelists know whether the panel is a basic introduction to the topic, or whether they can expect the audience to be fairly well-informed and looking for more advanced advice or nuanced perspectives.

, For most panels, especially those taking place at a conference or other larger event, 45–60 minutes is the recommended length of time.If the panel is a standalone event, or if it covers a particularly important and popular topic, a 90 minute panel may be appropriate.


If possible, ask participants to stick around for some time after the session, so audience members can talk in person.

, The main focus of the panel should always be a discussion. However, if one of the panel's main goals is providing information, this may be a useful way to precede the discussion.Have each panelist provide an explanation of the topic, or her argument concerning the topic, lasting no more than ten minutes per person.


This method may require more preparation time for the panelists as a group, as each panelist should build off the previous argument, rather than cover the same ground.

, Unless absolutely necessary for the topic, avoid PowerPoint presentations and slides. They tend to slow down the discussion, keep audience involvement low, and often bore the listeners. Use a small number of slides, and only when information or diagrams need to be presented that cannot easily be explained in words alone.


If a panelist asks for permission to create a presentation, suggest he bring in ""show and tell"" items instead to pass around the audience during discussion.

, Try to come up with several open-ended questions, which the panelists can take in a direction best suited to the course of the discussion and their expertise.A few more specific questions directed at an individual panelist are also acceptable, but try to divide these among the panelists fairly evenly. Anticipate questions audience members might ask, and include these as well. Arrange these in rough order of most to least importance, as you should provide more questions than you expect to get through. Try to keep each question tied into the last however, avoiding a sudden change of topic.


Have the moderator or another person not on the panel look over your questions and suggest edits or additional questions.
If you are having trouble coming up with questions, ask each panelist individually what he would like to ask the other panelists. Include the best of these questions in your list.

, Determine how much time you will set aside for questions; typically, this constitutes half the panel's length or more. Use the last 20–30 minutes for audience questions and discussion, or 15 minutes if time is short or you have a more lecture-focused panel format., Have the panelists meet in person or attend a conference call together, a week or more in advance of the panel. Describe the format of the panel to them, and give them a chance to talk briefly. They may briefly determine who should field questions on which topic, but don't give them the specific questions in advance. The discussion should be original, not rehearsed., The closer the panel is to the audience member, the more energetic and involved the atmosphere will feel. Consider offering small ""freebies"" if people move to the front rows, such as buttons or candy., Use only one or two sentences to introduce the panel topic, since most audience members present are likely familiar with the basic idea. Introduce each participant briefly, mentioning only a couple relevant facts about her experience or involvement related to the topic. Avoid going into a complete biography; the introduction of all participants should take no more than ten minutes total., Get the audience invested in the panel by asking for their involvement right away. A simple, quick way to do this is to begin by asking for a rough poll of their opinion related to the topic, using a show of hands or applause.Alternatively, poll the audience on their level of knowledge of the topic. The results should help you keep the panel focused on topics most relevant to the audience.

, Start going through the questions in the prearranged order, but don't hesitate to adjust this order if the discussion moved in a different, interesting direction. Divide questions among the participants, aiming them at the person most knowledgeable on the topic. Give other panelists a short amount of time to respond, then move on to the next question.


Don't have every panelist weigh in on every question. Let the panelists respond naturally, when they have something to say, or prompt someone who is knowledgeable on the topic if the discussion is faltering.

, You may deviate from the prepared questions whenever you think it will benefit from the discussion. In particular, press a panelist with a followup question if you think his answer is unsatisfying. Try rephrasing the original question, or ideally, come up with a more nuanced question that ties the last response to another discussion point or a previous statement.

, You may look at an actual clock offstage or on the opposite wall, if one is clearly visible. Otherwise, have someone stand at the back of the room with visible signs saying ""10 min,"" ""5 min,"" and ""1 min"", holding these up as appropriate when you are nearing the end of a section.

, When a panelist is going on too long, or going off topic, politely return the discussion to the correct point. When she pauses for breath, jump in with a phrase similar to one of the following. You may choose to let panelists know beforehand what phrases you'll be using to bring them back on track.


""You have an interesting point, but let's hear more about ___""
""Let's see what (other panelist) has to say on that topic, especially how it relates to __.""

, Let the audience know how you plan to recruit question, for instance by calling on raised hands or inviting them to wait in line at a microphone. Listen to each question in turn, repeat it clearly so everyone in the room can hear, then refer it to a panelist who appears interested.


Have a couple backup questions ready to ask yourself, or have an assistant in the audience ask, in case no one is brave enough to ask first question.If an audience member is taking up too much time, politely interrupt to say ""So your question is ___, is that right?"" or ""I'm sorry, we need to keep things moving. What is your question?""
Let people know when you only have enough time for two or three more questions.

, Thank the panelists, the hosts and organizers of the event, and the audience members. Let the audience members know the location and topic of an upcoming event, if you are at a symposium or conference.

Get over your pre-speech jitters.It may be easier said than done, but a key aspect of all successful presenters is their ability to get past negative feelings prior to the presentation.,
Plan a script beforehand.Although any creative presenter will leave themselves enough room to improvise, a successful presentation will almost always come with a tightly scripted plan to fall back on.,
Speak slowly.,
Offer a conversational style of presentation.Although you'll want to have a clear idea of where you've been and where you're going during your presentation, it's a good idea to ultimately keep your tone of voice casual.,
Practice.Practice and preparation will be your best aids when it comes to a strong presentation.,
Use assertive body language.In an in-person presentation, your body is a method of expression like your voice.,
Dress to suit your presentation.Your audience well gather a lot based on the way you present yourself physically.,
Keep your visuals simple.,
Include funny images to keep your audience engaged.Even if your audience is interested in the subject itself, chances are they are looking for entertainment as well as information.,
Create handouts.Handouts offer a visual boost for your audience to hold onto.,
Move around your stage.In addition to assertive body language, you should make yourself into a moving target for your audience.,
Begin your presentation with an attention-grabber.An attention-grabber is something that will interest your audience in the project at hand, regardless of their prior experience of the subject.,
Encourage audience participation.Your audience is a living, breathing entity.,
Quiz your audience.,
Survey your audience's opinion.By catching up on what your audience thinks or feels towards a subject partway into the presentation, you offer the possibility of turning your project into an open forum for discussion.,
Bring food.,
Be passionate about your project.",How to Creatively Present a Project," Nervousness is a tough thing to overcome if you struggle with it, but it can be significantly lessened so long as you minimize potential stressors. Make sure you get ample sleep and preparation in advance of your presentation date. Give yourself the time you need to feel confident about your project.


Meditating for a few minutes before your presentation may help ease the strain as well.;
, Think of your presentation as a verbal essay and organize it into sections.


You can have your script on your podium or at hand. It's good to have it close by in case you slip up and need to pick up again.
You should take efforts to properly time out your presentation beforehand. Always try to shoot under your recommended time limit.

, Keeping your pace of speech slow and steady may not be the first thing you think of when it comes to a creative presentation.Slow speaking in of itself may not be creative, but it offers your creativity to come out more smoothly. Creativity can manifest itself with improvised remarks and quips in your speech, but these can only happen if you're giving your brain enough time to process everything. If you simply slow down the rate at which you speak, you'll have an easier time controlling what comes out of your mouth.


Time yourself reading through your speech at a normal rate. After that, time yourself again and try to read through the speech in 120% of the time. Making an explicit goal of slower speech as you practice will train you to a better pace when it comes time to perform.
This is especially important if you have a tendency for nervousness during a presentation.

, People don't like it when it sounds like you're reading off a script. If you give the false impression that you're improvising your speech as you go along, your audience will be more engaged. This conversational style comes with confidence, and confidence comes with preparation.


If you were having an enlightening talk with someone prior to the speech, you can take a quick note of that and work it into your speech's subject somehow.
Record yourself talking to someone casually. From there, listen to the ways you naturally inflect your voice. You can use inflections and changes in volume creatively in a presentation setting.
Don't mistake a casual style with pure improvising. The best presenters know how to funnel real information through this casual tone, but always know to stay on topic.

, Practice in the mirror, and regulate your tone of voice as best suits the topic at hand. As you rehearse it, you'll begin to see new ways to spruce up your presentation. Fresh insights are a welcome side-effect of practice.


Practicing in different areas will make sure you don't keep too accustomed to one setting. Chances are you won't have much time to prepare in the actual venue you'll be presenting in, so you need to be ready to perform regardless of the area.

, If people are engaged by the way you present yourself physically, they'll be more engaged by what you have to say. Like an actor, you can use your body creatively to express a point. Your movements should be casual and fluid. Holding true to some of these will have a tangible benefit on your presentation:


Outstretch your arms for points of emphasis.
Scan your eye contact throughout the crowd.
Maintain a tall posture. Try to take up as much physical space as you can while you're on stage.

, If your manner of dress is neatly-kept, whatever you have to say will be taken more seriously by your audience. Dressing well should be seen to encompass basic hygiene and hair as well. Take extra time in your morning to make sure you work out the kinks in your appearance. Dressing well may have a noticeable effect on your confidence as well.


Don't take too much creative license with your dress. Most venues have set expectations for what should be worn. Intentionally breaking free of those norms might make you look like a clown.

, Chances are, your audience will only have a few seconds to focus on each of your visuals before you start talking or another slide hits.If you keep your images simple, you'll allow your major points to be digested without distracting your audience with less important details. Any minutiae you include in a presentation should be communicated orally.


A colourful pie chart is a great way to express proportions.
Although you shouldn't take too much license with the way you present things, the use of colour is a simple way to make your presentation more creative.

, A funny image helps displace the sense of formality in a presentation. Although humour isn't suitable for all subjects (like genocide) it can be used to your benefit if you think your audience might get bored otherwise.


Related internet memes can be incorporated into a presentation, so long as they're relatively appropriate. Remember to keep your prospective audience's age in mind if you use humour.
If you thought of something offhandedly witty while you prepared your presentation, it may be worthwhile to illustrate it visually somehow. Clip art is available online for virtually every possible situation.

, Whether it's a summary of the points you'd like to get across the most, or an introduction to your material, handouts are recommended if your presentation is fairly text-heavy. Text translates onto a handout much better than a slide presentation.

, The act of covering the space of your stage will make you more interesting to look at.


Pace yourself back and forth across the stage. Don't walk too fast, however. Pacing is usually associated with nervousness. Keep your strides confident, and put effort into making your posture tall as you walk.

, You want to keep your opening lines as accessible as possible. You could open up your presentation with something that entertains. Examples include telling jokes, expressing the importance of your subject, or using a poetic description to get to the heart of your subject.Ask a broad question that anyone could relate to. For example, if your presentation is about mortgage rates, you can ask ""Who has ever had issues finding a house they both loved and were able to afford?""
Telling a story is a great way of getting your audience involved, even if they have no prior interest in the subject your project is about., Take advantage of that fact. Audience members may get restless if they're left idle for too long. Although you should remain the focal point of attention for the most part, it' a good idea to encourage some participation on your audience's part. You should tell your audience that you welcome questions and comments. Stop in key sections of your speech and ask people what they think.


Stop your presentation after making a big point. Give some information and then ask your audience what their take on the info is. You may be surprised by some of the answers.

, Quizzing your audience turns the presentation into something of a game for everyone involved. People enjoy a sense of friendly competition, and if they know they're going to have to put their knowledge to the test at some point, they'll be all the more likely to stay focused.


You can digitize your audience's quiz-taking with quiz apps. Certain apps will send multiple choice questions to your audience's phones where they can answer within 30 seconds of a question being introduced., Getting fresh insights from people who may be hearing about your subject for the first time adds an organic quality to your presentation. This will make the event more interesting for all involved-- including you.

, Food is a quick way to the hearts of your audience. Offering them something to snack on while they take in your presentation will relax them and ease worries they might have that you're taking up their time. While donuts and muffins are a welcome standard in this regard, you may have better luck if the food you give your audience helps their brain function. Nuts and fruits are perfect for snacking on, and a good portion of your audience should still take you up on the food offer.Putting up a table of stuff at the back of the room will allow people to get what they want without interfering with your presentation.

, Above all, a successful presentation depends on a strong sense of passion from the presenter. At the end of the day, an attentive audience can tell whether or not a presenter is truly engaged with the material he's talking about. If you have the passion for it, making the material interesting will be simple by comparison.

Learn about the pacing of Montessori education.,
Examine the role of student motivation.,
Reflect on the role of teachers.",How to Choose a Montessori Preschool1," One of the most distinctive components of Montessori education, preschool and beyond, is that it doesn't require all students to move at the same pace. It doesn't require mastery of specific skills or information at specific times.


Instead, in Montessori education, children set their own pace.They learn at a rate that is comfortable to them, taking more time on things they find challenging and less on things that come easily.;
, Unlike traditional schools, Montessori preschools allow students to focus their studies using the approaches that interest and stimulate them most.While Montessori schools to have several ""areas of knowledge"" that all students will gain experience in, such as math, science, and language, how the students choose to learn about each of these is up to them.

, Teachers in Montessori preschools should act as guides and facilitators of learning.Their job is not to act as the ultimate source of knowledge, but instead a guide to help children as they learn things themselves.


This means that Montessori teachers seldom, if ever, lecture or recite information. Instead, they work with students individually or in small groups as they explore topics.

"
"
Find out if the students choose their own work.,
Scrutinize the role of testing.,
Look for an emphasis on hands on learning.,
See how long the work periods are.",How to Choose a Montessori Preschool2," When evaluating a Montessori preschool, the most important thing to determine is whether children choose their own tasks.Children should always be allowed to choose from a variety of different activities.If children are assigned specific tasks and aren't allowed to choose other options, this is not a true Montessori preschool and should be avoided.

, Testing, if present in the curriculum at all, should play a minimal role in any Montessori school, especially at the preschool level.This is in large part because a true Montessori education doesn't involve grades at any age level.Instead, children are assessed based on portfolios of work and classroom observation.
Successful children are those who are happy and learning to the best of their abilities. Grades are considered an unnecessary form of external reward/punishment. Student motivation should be independent of such incentives.

, In Montessori preschools, students don't sit around filling out worksheets or reciting memorized information. Instead, there is an emphasis on learning by doing.For example, children learn music by using instruments. They learning cooking by using actual ingredients and kitchen tools to make food. They learn foreign languages by speaking them. Math is learned through activities and games., In a Montessori school, work periods should always be about two to three uninterrupted hours.The reason for this is that children need uninterrupted, unstructured time to focus on a topic that interests them. Dr. Montessori found that this was the amount of time necessary for children to really immerse themselves in a topic.
Some schools will force children into ""circle time"" or give a snack break after as little as an hour. This is inappropriate in Montessori education.

"
"
Check whether a school is accredited.,
Learn about the teachers.,
Scrutinize the Head of School.,
Evaluate the classroom environment.,
Talk to other parents.",How to Choose a Montessori Preschool3," Many parents who are strong believers in Montessori education will only send their children to preschools that are accredited by one of the major Montessori education organizations. This accreditation means a school lives up the crucial principles of the Montessori philosophy.The American Montessori Society (AMS) is the most widely recognized accreditation organization in the US.The Association Montessori International (AMI) performs a similar service both in the US and worldwide., In evaluating a Montessori preschool, it is important to learn about the teachers working there. You should look into the following:How long have the teachers been there? Ideally, you want to find a school where many of the teachers have been working there for a long time. This suggests teachers are satisfied and reasonably paid.
What are their credentials? Choose a preschool where teachers have attended face-to-face Montessori training schools. The best of these schools have teachers interact using actual educational materials and do a minimum year-long internship. Online programs typically lack such requirements.
How do the teachers behave toward students? Montessori preschool teachers should speak softly and at eye level to the children in their care., The Head of School in a Montessori preschool should also be well qualified and experienced. You should scrutinize this person's credentials and experience closely. Similar to evaluating the teachers, you should ask:How long has this person served in this leadership role? What did he or she do prior to this?
Is this person well trained in the Montessori method?

, The classroom environment is crucial to a successful Montessori program. Have a close look at the classroom to ensure it is adequate for your child's needs.If possible, you should observe a classroom session. There should be observation windows for every classroom.If there are not, or if you are not allowed to observe some class time, this should raise a red flag.
Look at classroom equipment and make sure it is adequate and age appropriate. There should be a variety of well-made and attractive learning materials, and enough of them for the number of children in the classroom.
Scrutinize the cleanliness of the classroom. It should be neat and orderly and show signs of recent cleaning. The room should be decorated with natural items, such as plants and seashells.Ask about or observe the teacher-to-child ratio. Montessori education requires a lot of one-on-one attention. The more teachers, the better.
Observe whether the children seem happy and relaxed. A Montessori classroom should be a pleasant, enjoyable place to be, not a place of drudgery or anxiety.

, Before settling on a school, talk to other parents about their experience with the school.Ask parents if they are satisfied and if they have been invited to participate. Parental participation is common in Montessori preschools.

"
"
Start early.,
Consider your needs.,
Research the cost.,
Look into scholarship opportunities.,
Choose the best option you can afford.",How to Choose a Montessori Preschool4," It should be clear by now that choosing a Montessori school requires a lot of research and planning. Preschool programs often fill up well in advance. So, start your research early and when you've made your decision, alert the school the right away.Generally, it's a good idea to to start your research and preparations a year before you plan on starting your child in preschool.
The sooner your start your research, the more options you will have.

, In addition to evaluating whether the Montessori approach is right for your child and assessing the individual schools based on how well they employ this approach, you should also consider other needs you and your child may have. For example:Consider your work schedule, commute, and geographic location. How far are you willing to drive? Which school's schedules fit with your own?
Do you need full time childcare from the preschool, or are you looking for a part-time experience?
Does the school meet your child's language needs? For example, if your child speaks Spanish at home, can the school accommodate this? Do you want your child to learn a specific second-language? If so, does the school teach it?

, The cost of Montessori preschool varies a great deal from one school to the next. Look into how much each school you are considering costs, as this will probably impact your choice.


A year of Montessori schooling can cost as little as a thousand dollars or as much as 14 thousand.On average, a year of Montessori school for children aged three to six is between five and eight thousand, depending on how many hours per day your child will attend. For infants and toddlers, the average ranges between three and nine thousand dollars.

, Some Montessori preschools offer grants, scholarships, or discounted tuition for families in need of assistance.Look into what options might be offered by those in your area.


Check the websites of preschools you are considering. If you don't find any information there, ask the Head of School what assistance the preschool might be able to offer.
The National Association of Independent Schools also offers financial aid to some families, and provides other resources for funding your child's preschool education as well. You can apply for aid via their website. Have your most recent tax document and pay stubs ready., Once you've determined that Montessori preschool is right for your child, researched the schools, and looked at pricing and other logistics, the final step is to select the best school you can afford.


You might find it helpful to create a ranked list of preschools, starting with the school you would most like to send your child to. Then, note the cost of each, taking into account any scholarships or grants you might be eligible for. Finally, choose the school highest on the list that you are able to afford.

Research your topic.,
Organize.,
Use strong images.,
Practice.,
Deal with your stress.,
Look presentable.,
Keep eye contact.,
Speak clearly.,
Engage your audience.,
Answer questions at the end of the presentation.,
Learn from your experience.,
Listen to presentations.",How to Become a Good Presenter," It’s important to spend enough time collecting and confirming information in order to speak with confidence and knowledge.;
, Organize the main points in the most appropriate order for the topic you’re presenting. Avoid writing complete sentences or paragraphs and prepare note cards to help you elaborate on the information presented.

, Your images don't need to be all charts and tons of text. Use a few graphics or images that will catch your audience's interest and remind you of what you want to talk about., Do not memorize written texts. Try to understand the topic to the best of your ability so you can communicate it well during the presentation and meet the time limit. Practice for a friend or a family member and get their feedback on your presentation skills.

, It’s common to be stressed before a presentation, try picturing yourself impressing the audience. Also, it’s important to relax before the presentation and think about nothing but how to make the most out of it.

, Dress well for the presentation, usually a formal outfit is preferred to show the level of professionalism. Appearance says a lot about someone’s personality and confidence.

, Do scanning the room technique by keeping an eye contact with as many people as you can.

, Speak in a loud and clear voice to get your presentation through to the audience even the ones sitting further away.

, Some useful ways to do that are sharing a funny yet tasteful story, or pose a question to see how much they know about the subject you’re about to discuss.

, Make sure you listen to the questions carefully, ask for clarifications if needed and repeat the question to the rest of the audience to give you more time to think about the answer. If you don’t know the answer for a question be honest and say that you will look into it since you don’t know the answer in the meantime.

, Ask your employers or professors for their feedback to be able to identify your strengths and weaknesses and help you improve for next time.

, Once you’re done presenting you should take the time to listen to other presentations to benefit from presenters’ skills.

"
Prepare yourself to know what a preschool curriculum should include by reading other books about preschool curriculum.",How to Build Your Own Preschool Curriculum1," Also remember the following when planning curriculum:


Large group time. There should be time for the whole class or group to have time to talk, interact, sing, and do activities with each other. Put time for this (15-45 minutes) in the curriculum each day.
Small group time. There should be time each day (15-45 minutes) of time spent with small groups: 4-5 children doing art projects together, playing games, going through centers, talking, playing, and singing. Provide time for this each day as well.
Independent time. There should be time for the teacher to work with each child independently for 5 minutes each day.
Quiet activities. Naptime, story time, circle time, and writing or coloring are all examples of quiet time that should be in your curriculum or schedule each day. Provide 40-60 minutes of this each day.
Active activities. These are very important for health, fitness, learning, and preventing behavior problems. Provide time for recess, active games, and action songs each day for at least 90 minutes.
Transitions. The time children come in in the morning, dismissal, lunch preparation, nap preparation, snack preparation, moving to different activities, and extra time all should be considered. How are you going to teach children during these times?
Everything should move from simple to complex. That means that they may make sets and learn about two numbers before addition. Make sure that your whole curriculum does this.
The curriculum should support the whole child. How will the child grow physically, emotionally, socially, and intellectually? Make sure that the arts don't go over academics, and that there is enough room in the curriculum for the child to be fully supported.
Free play is a vital part of preschool. Through free play, children learn how to share, take turns, and cooperate. Language is fostered and self-esteem is fostered. Free play prevents behavior problems, can teach children academic skills, and teaches responsibility and caring for toys. Therefore, at least one hour out of every four hours that children are there should be free play.;

Start with a piece of paper and write down all of your ideas for ""Arrival."",
Go on to ""Circle Time."",
Start thinking about centers.,
Another way to plan a curriculum for preschoolers is to take a calendar and write down the main objects that you are going to teach each week.,
Look at the following lists of objects to teach children.",How to Build Your Own Preschool Curriculum2," Here are some to get you started: make letters or animals out of Play-Dough, color a picture, have free play with toys, play in the sensory table, look at books, join in taking care of baby dolls, do puzzles, identify and find plastic shapes, search for everything in the classroom that begins with one letter, sit and sing along to with a CD.

, Here are some more ideas: talk about the month, day and year and mark it on a calendar. Look out the window or watch a weather report to decide on the weather, dress a doll or stuffed animal in what they would need to wear depending on the weather and sing a welcome song together. Count, sing the ABC song, review shapes and colors, and introduce all of the centers. Read a story, classroom rules, or teach children an action poem.

, What will you teach in the Language Center? Will the children learn a letter and trace it, write it in the sand, do puzzles about it, or design on an Etch-A -Sketch? Learning about numbers and shapes is a good ideas. Design shapes on a pegboard. Count small objects. Measure the length of the classroom or measure a pencil with paper clips. Explore making butter for a farm week in The World Center. Type your name in the Myself Center. Play on an online learning website such as www.abcmouse.com or www.beyondthebackpack.com.

, Make sure that it covers what children need to learn for Kindergarten and that it is practical information and objects. Ask yourself: ""Why do children need to learn this?"" and ""How will this help them in life?""

, This is a great list to stick to, though there may be other things that you find that children should learn. In Reading/Language Arts teach: the alphabet, left to right, sight words, memory, same and different, how to take care of books, and how to write. Don't worry about formal writing. Just let children draw pictures or write down something about their day. In Math teach: numbers and counting, shapes, measurement, comparing, sizes, addition, subtraction, patterns, money and telling time. In The World teach: animals and their habitats, seasons, weather, days of the week, months of the year, dates, years, plants, space, water, magnets, holidays, playground safety, animal safety, swimming and bicycle safety, and home and stranger safety, and the scientific method. In Myself teach each child's name, phone number, address, family, friends, pets, school, birthday, body parts, and emotions.

"
"
This is for Monday.,
Move on to the snacks and meals.,
Label your next section: ""Centers."",
Continue with this same format for Math, The World, Myself, and Music.,
For music, think about what songs you will sing and what instruments you will introduce to the children.,
For the sensory table center, try to pick an idea that reinforces your teaching objects.,
Provide an online learning site to play on for the day.,
Provide an idea that uses few objects and is quick for each day.",How to Build Your Own Preschool Curriculum3," Go onto all of the days of the week Monday-Friday using this format. Start a paper that says: ""Arrival."" Write down all of the ideas that you may have for the arrival time. Could children play in the different centers? Will you plan on a ABC tracing cards and puzzles activity?


Continue onto ""Circle time."" How should teachers have calendar and weather? What songs will you sing? What story will you read? What activity should they conduct? What will you review?

, What will the children eat? Remember all five food groups is important, all lunches should be healthy. See your school board or board of health. It is also a good idea to have snacks reinforce other parts of the curriculum. Have apples when learning about the fall. Eat circle crackers or orange oranges.

, These are some great and centers that you should include: Reading/Language Arts, Math, The World (simple science and social studies), Myself (all about the child's personal information, name, family, etc.), Art, Music, Sensory Table, and Technology.


Think about what you want to start with for language arts or reading. Will you teach the alphabet or sight words? Provide two activities to teach the day's object. Pick out an idea from your brainstorming list.

, For art, come up with a project that reinforces one of the day's objects. Be careful not to provide samples and to not choose a craft that needs a lot of step-by-step directions. You want to encourage creativity, not stifle it.

, Will you play a game that asks children to see if the music is loud or soft or slow or fast? Try to write down at least four options.

, Read How To Make A Sensory Table to find some great sensory table ideas. Pick one sensory table idea to use each week or every 5 days.

, Make sure that you have read How To Test An Online Learning Site For Preschoolers before choosing to write down the site. You can also repeat websites for each day because young children love repetition and teaching them to navigate a different site each day could be chaos and they may not actually get a lot out of the website. Use a learning website that reinforces the objects you are using in your curriculum.

, Maybe you could suggest that you teach a new rhyme or blow bubbles. Write down an activity idea for each day. This activity should be no longer than 5 minutes and use no more than 2 supplies to do. It is also a good idea to not have to clean-up very much-less than a minute.

"
"
Consider what format you would like to use to write your curriculum.,
Organize your curriculum.,
On each day, start with ""Arrival"" and go through your list of curriculum ideas.,
Hire professionals.,
When working with those you have hired, always check on what they are doing to be sure that they are doing what you are okay with and always ask them what you can do better so that you can have the best-selling curriculum ever!",How to Build Your Own Preschool Curriculum4," An online website for you to plan books and curriculums is ideal. Or, you could type this curriculum on you computer using Microsoft Word or any other typing place you may have.

, Label each page by days. There should be 180 days or more, because 180 days is how long school last normally. If you live in a country that uses a different number of days in the school year, use this number instead.

, Be sure to use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Be sure to include lots of details, to make each step as clear as possible.


Another way to be sure that your curriculum is clear is to add pictures of the activities and snacks, crafts, and games.

, Hire a writer if you are not the best writer and hire an artist to draw pictures for you. Always hire an editor to catch any mistakes and make your curriculum better.

,


Talk to your editor or artist and ask them about printing the book in color. Color is appealing to the eye and may make drawings more clear.

Try mind mapping.,
Discuss things in a group.,
Plot out your research.",How to Do a Project1," To brainstorm ideas for your project, make a mind map to stimulate new thoughts. Use a plain piece of paper, poster board, or whiteboard for your mind map and write the goal of your project in the middle. Write down related topics, subtopics, and relevant concepts around the goal, and branch out from them to create and follow different tangents.For instance, if your goal is to “provide a comprehensive account of the history of the fur trade in North America”, subtopics and tangents could include “relations with Natives”, “history of European fashion”, and “the cultural significance of fur”.;
, If you are doing a group project, brainstorming things together will allow each group member to feed off of the ideas of others and gain new insight. Schedule a brainstorming session in a quiet place with few distractions. If you are working on a project on your own, group discussion with friends or colleagues can help you gain new perspective on the topic you’re covering. Remember to include everybody in any decision-making. , Plan out the process of your research by using the gap filling brainstorming technique. To do this, identify where you are starting from in terms of your knowledge and resources (i.e. Point A), and identify where you want go with your project (Point B). Make a list of all of the things missing between Point A and Point B and make a plan for filling in this gap.For instance, if Point A is starting a project about electric cars with limited knowledge on the topic, and Point B is completing a PowerPoint presentation about them, you can fill the gap by conducting research (online and in a library), outlining the history, technology, and possible future of electric cars, and procuring pictures and news articles about them.

A well-positioned infographic can also boast a high return on investment (ROI).;
, Plan to tell a story and use both graphics and statistics to illustrate it.


Avoid messages that are too sales-focused. “Buy our product” is not a good message to tell. “How our product improves quality of life” is a better choice.
Remember that non-profits, universities and individuals can benefit from infographics, in addition to companies. For example, perhaps you want to impress upon a high school PE class the benefits of exercising regularly. Showing them statistics of successful people and their high rates of exercise in infographic form, may be a better way than telling them.

, Choose between gathering your own data or finding reliable data from other sources. The following are good places to find statistics if you can’t collect them yourself:


Use Google’s public data crawler at https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory Search for the data you need to use Google’s familiar search bar.
Visit Chartsbin.com. You can access tables and charts filled with statistics from around the world, such as hunger, marriage, crime and disease numbers.Try StatPlanet for more worldwide statistics.
Go to government agencies, such as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics or the EPA to get reliable statistics.
Read trade journals and scientific studies to get other types of study-based data.
Make sure to source your statistics at the bottom of each graphic section. Use the most trustworthy sources that you can find.

, Even if you gather your data from journals and online sources, you should create a data series with 3 to 6 different info series. You can either give this info to your graphic designer or upload it into a template.

, Draw a crude sketch of how you would like to separate your data. You will have a better idea of the template or style that will work best if you place several images, statistics and headings in on a standard piece of computer paper., If you want a fully customized infographic, your best bet is to hire someone who can produce it. You can pay between $50 and $100 per hour to hire a graphic designer, so make sure to adjust your budget accordingly.


If you want to use your final infographic to increase web traffic or improve social media content, then you should hire a graphic designer. You are more likely to produce a viral infographic if the designer has experience with this marketing tool.

, Create an account at visual.ly and ask for a consultation. Review the high-quality projects that the company has produced in the past on the main visual.ly website.

, Free and subscription based websites allow you to create visual tools that can be downloaded or imbedded. Try Infoactive.co or piktochart.com.


Piktochart.com is available for $29 per month. Infoactive.co and easel.ly are currently in beta testing and may require a monthly subscription in the future.Choose a marketing person to upload your data chart and logo, if you have difficulty learning new software programs. Easel.ly is supposed to be the easiest infographic tool to learn.

,, These sites help you create an infographic based on a chronological timeline of events. Upload your photos to use as illustrations., This is an infographic that communicates one message with one to two sub-parts.

, Tackle several detailed subtitles or sub messages.

, Most websites and mobile devices process vertical images better. This leads vertical infographics to be tweeted and passed on up to 30 percent more., Don’t try to save space by making the font smaller. Use a big font that is easy to read, so that it catches the reader’s eye.


Consider using a number in your headline. One search engine optimization site says that 36 percent of Twitter users prefer headlines with numbers in them.

, Consult a typographer or a graphic designer if you are unsure which font will work best.

, You should have several people editing and proofing the final product before it goes out. Since this project uses different layouts, it can be harder to spot mistakes.

, If you want people to find your website, then make sure your logo, website and social media URLs are prominent in your infographic. If you have a general message that you want to go viral, you can skip this step., If you rely on Instagram or photography for business, choose photos over illustrations. Use between one and six photographs.


Make sure to leave plenty of room to separate the images and add text.

, People are drawn to visuals, so draw the conclusions in graphics, rather than text. For a more advanced infographic, use a background that ties each graphic together, such as a roadmap with signposts, a label or a tree.


Using custom illustrations can increase the popularity of your infographic by up to 50 percent."

Find up to date material.",How to Do a Project2," Completing a successful project requires a significant amount of time and work, which means evaluating your priorities and planning your course of action. Schedule specific research time and plan daily, weekly, or monthly targets for your progress (e.g. completing a detailed project outline by the first week).Keep track of your schedule with a smartphone app such as Schedule Planner, a free iphone app that organizes your tasks and deadlines., When looking up books, news articles, or websites, always look for the credentials of the author or creator of a text. Search for the name of the writer(s) to see if they have already been published, or cited in the work of others. Avoid anonymously-written text or any sensational writing that may be geared towards attracting readers rather than conveying facts., When researching a topic, check the date of publication of all of the reference materials that you use. Current information is always ideal, but it is imperative to find the most recent data in dynamic fields such as the sciences. Historical texts, on the other hand, would be an exception."

Once you grow more familiar with the material, make a statement that you can argue for as a project goal. Ask yourself if the thesis statement needs to be researched, and make sure that it is only expressing one main idea., Fight the inclination to save the writing step of your project until after your research is complete. Start writing notes from the beginning of the process to help you engage with the material you’re studying and to record ideas as they come to you. Writing in the early stage of research will also give you content to get feedback on from family, friends, group project co-members, or from a project supervisor., Make your project stand out by adding dynamic elements to it. Wherever possible, add auditory, visual, or tactile components to the project material to make it more interesting and accessible. Different approaches to the project will add new dimension to the topic covered.Add an auditory component like a taped interview or recorded radio broadcast to liven up the project.
Add visual aides like charts, pictures, and maps to enhance the project.
Add a tactile part to your project, like a short video.

Do your homework.,
Localize it.,
Rehearse.,
Plant seeds of terror.,
Seat your audience.,
Build rapport with your listeners.,
Act nervous and scared.,
Break down and tell the story.,
End it with a bang.",How to Tell Scary Stories," Go to the library or search online for the scariest stories you can find. Pick out 5-10 stories that have spooking potential.


The more realistic and recent the story, the scarier it'll be when you tell it. That way, the listeners can relate.
Urban legends make excellent scary stories. The danger with using an urban legend, however, is that some of your listeners may have heard variations of it, thus ruining the effect.;
, Change the details so that it seems as though the story took place nearby, and recently. Weave fact with fiction. If the story took place in a canning factory, but you know there's a pecan factory in your town, switch out that detail (if you can do so without changing the story too much). If you can tie the story to someone you know, even better. Since your local conditions are unique, some of the stories will lend themselves better to this step than others. If rain is a critical detail in the story, for example, don't use it if you're camping in the desert. You should be able to narrow it down to 2-3 stories at this point.

, Practice telling the stories you've chosen and pay attention to which one feels the most natural. Tell it the same way you'd tell the story about that time your cousin tried to swallow a whole hot dog (minus the humor). Don't over-dramatize. Don't use words you wouldn't normally use. You want it to sound as if you're telling the story reluctantly, like it makes you uncomfortable, but you'll tell it if they twist your arm...

, Way before you tell the story (like the day before, or that morning), find a way to casually mention a few details that are relevant to the story. If you drive by the pecan factory, for example, ask your friends if they've ever been there. If you come across anything mysterious or unusual while your future listeners are around, try to think of a way you can tie it into your story and improvise! Let's say you find a squirrel skeleton and your story is about a serial killer. Perhaps that serial killer had an appetite for squirrels...? If you want to be really proactive, set things up. Draw a strange symbol on a rock with red chalk, or cut claw marks into fabrics.


Tweak the setting in the story to match the one you're in. If you noticed a huge tree next to a river, for instance, you can have one of the victims in your story cling to (coincidentally) a large tree next to a river as she flees from a ghost. Ideally, some of your listeners will remember having seen this tree, and will shudder when you mention it in the story. If it's a foggy night, make it a foggy night in your story.

, Make them sit around you, facing you.You must be able to look everyone on the face.

, The more they know and trust you, the easier it'll be to scare 'em. If you're the type to pull practical jokes often, it'll be much harder to establish credibility!

, When the time draws near to tell the story, start pretending to be anxious. Be a little quieter than usual. Get the chills here and there, and rub your upper arms as if to warm yourself. Look suddenly behind you, or at the distance, as if you just saw something. Keep doing this kind of stuff subtly until someone notices. At first, brush it off as if it's nothing, but keep up the act. Eventually, you'll....


Tell the story in a slow, quiet yet audible voice. Change your tone constantly.

, After saying you ""don't want to talk about it,"" act as though you're too spooked to keep this to yourself, and you can't hold it in anymore. Again, don't be overly dramatic. You want to come off as uncomfortable, worried, reluctant. Hopefully by now, your listeners are both curious and concerned. Ask for a blanket to wrap around yourself (because you keep getting the chills, because you're so, so terrified) and start telling your story.

, This is, for some, the best part. The last sentence of your story - the punchline, if you will - should be yelled suddenly, with you lunging forward at your listeners and scaring the life out of them. Note, however, that this step will make it very clear that your story was told solely for horrifying effect, and challenge your future storytelling reputation. If you want your listeners to turn in their beds at night, end the story as quietly and uncomfortably as you started it. Throw in a little chill for maximum effect.


Look each member of the audience in the eye. Make sure your face doesn't reveal that you're going to scare them. Wait and build up your story and come upon the scary part loudly or yell when they're least suspecting.

Educate yourself.,
Support an anti-poverty organization.,
Volunteer.,
Locate where the need is in your community.,
Support laws and bills help alleviate poverty.,
Donate.",How to Fight Global Poverty," Talk to various organizations and learn where the bulk of their money goes to. Find out how the economics of poverty to work out and how trade between countries plays into alleviating or making worse the poverty.


You'll need to learn how your own government functions with providing aid and where that money goes to and how it is used. Often, the rich countries that provide ""aid"" actually limit market access to the poverty-stricken countries and put stipulations on the aid packages that the aid-receiving countries must use over-priced services and goods from the donor countries.Learning how aid works and how the economics of poverty work, will help you to determine the organizations that are worthiest of your support.
Sometimes it is more effective to show your support for a particular bill, such as the Global Food and Security Act in the U.S. Check out the Legislation page of borgenproject.org to see which anti-poverty bills are currently going through the House of Representatives and Senate.;
, There are a huge amount of organizations, non-profits, and Non-Government Organizations seeking to eliminate poverty. The best organizations tend to be the ones that support economic development and self-sufficiency in the developing country rather than simply pouring money and over-priced products in where they will do little good.


Give money directly to those who need it. Groups like Give Directlyor Kivahelp you give money directly to those who need it most in places like Kenya and Uganda. The program has allowed people who otherwise wouldn't have been able to, to buy a motorcycle to use as a taxi or to buy a mill and go into the corn grinding business. The idea is that the money reaches those who need it without jumping through the hoops of charities, who might or might not be providing the right aid and opportunities.An organization like Mercy Corpsfocuses on emergency response in countries in various states of upheaval. These types of countries are ripe for challenging the status quo and building resilience to future upheavals. The importance of emergency response in making emergencies not quite so disastrous can be seen in the U.S. with Hurricane Katrina, in the Philippines, in Japan with the earthquake.
The empowerment of women is extremely important in alleviating poverty. This needs to happen through education and access to reproductive independence. Educated women tend to have fewer children, with fewer mis-timed or unintended births. As women are often children's earliest teachers, they can pass on their education and provide a groundwork for children in their communities.Empowering local communities rather than simply providing clothing or food, helps these communities to grow and become self-reliant, which in turn reduces the poverty in the community. Empowering local people means access to education, to health care, and to opportunities., There are tons of ways to volunteer on the global scale. You can give your money or your time to organizations that are helping fight against global poverty. By volunteering, you will be going beyond just supporting worthy causes to actually fighting for them.


Hold a fundraiser for an organization of your choice. Fundraising will help raise both money and awareness and will give you a way to help.
If you're interested in sponsoring a child to provide education and food, then worldvision.org may be your best bet. Other common charities are Heifer International (give a goat, cow or another animal to a family in need), Doctors Without Borders (provide medical services for free wherever they are needed), and SOS Children's Villages (help find families for orphaned children and support those living with AIDs).
You can actually work abroad or in your own community on alleviating poverty. Contact the organization of your choice and see what opportunities they have for helping hands on with alleviating poverty.

, You can do this by contacting your local social service department or religious/charity organization. Find out what you can do to help locally and what is needed.


Support local homeless shelters.Give time and/or money to your local shelters to make sure they survive. A lot of shelters have been moved out of the city areas where they are most needed because they are ""unsightly.""Volunteer at local shelters and soup kitchens. This will give you a chance to meet the people who use them, thus giving poverty a face and a voice and discuss with them what they need.

, Pay attention to the laws and bills being enacted in your local area, or country. Weigh in against laws that seek to punish the poor, simply for being poor.


Support a living wage and basic labor protections for workers so that people can afford to live off their earnings, rather than being forced to two-three minimum wage jobs that barely feed them and their families.
Contact your local Senator or Representative by phone or mail and tell them you want increased spending on anti-poverty measures (there is a wikiHow for how to contact your Senators and Representatives. You can find their public address and phone numbers by typing in your area code on www.Congress.org). A phone call will only take 15 seconds and you won't be asked any questions. Elected leaders want to give what people in their constituency want, so if enough people call wanting more spending on anti-poverty measures, then Congressmen will endorse bills that accomplish that.

, Donations, especially monetary donations, to certain local organizations will make a huge difference in fighting poverty in your community. Most organizations that work to alleviate poverty have tight budgets and little funding and they need all the help they can get from community members.


Give your time to your charity organizations. Help in a soup kitchen or food bank particularly during holidays.
Donate toys and clothes to a food bank. Make sure that the clothes and toys are in decent condition and aren't stained or ripped.
Donate food. Food banks need nutritious, non-perishable foods like meals in a can, peanut butter, canned meats, canned fruit and veggies.Also donate unopened spices. Spices are too expensive for most people who are homeless or poverty-stricken, but they can make all the difference in making a meal taste better.

Make an inventory of the skills you can contribute.,
Find a way to reach the rural areas.,
Establish contact with the village head or the tribal head.,
If you are training them to manufacture products, you need to train them to:


form cooperatives societies and collectively market their produce their wares in the urban and semi urban markets
eliminate middlemen
avoid internal competition.

,
Do not worry about financing to set up cottage industry.",How to Fight Against Poverty in Developing Countries as an Individual," The skills you can impart in rural areas depending on your expertise are:

]

Metalsmithing 
Plumbing
Carpentry
Simple accounts & admin work (like maintaining books, filing, muster, basic computer skills )
Earthenware and pottery
Cycle, Car & bike repair
Stitching & embroidery
Making, Preserving & packing food items (snacks, pickles, sauce, fruit drinks, meat,fish,eggs,etc.)
Nursing & Midwifery.
Weaving
Beehive, poultry, piggery,& animal husbandry
Computer literacy - Computer literacy is an ongoing program in many villages, community centers are not only equipped with computers, but also with internet. All they need is individuals with skills who can do the imparting. Otherwise also village administration will be too happy to provide them.


All these skills will have application in their village itself, and products can be sold in the nearby rural areas. Apart from this, there are development agencies working on the projects in the rural areas, which would be happy to absorb locally available semiskilled work force. Every backward rural village in Asia & Africa has development projects financed by the local community, state government, national government, or international aid agencies. Apart from these, there are many religious agencies which are also financing development projects. Employment opportunities are galore, but for want of skilled work force locally, outsiders are being recruited.;
, If you are in Asia, or Africa, you just need to travel 100 to 150 miles (160 to 240 km) to reach backward rural areas. There are community places like schools, or community centers. Which you can use for unpacking, overnight stay, bath and changeover needs.

, These are the people who will be naturally interested in the welfare of the people in their village, and they are also in the position to influence the villagers and organize the imparting programs. These people generally take care of the needs & comforts of the trainers also.


You might be wondering, ""Individually, will I be able to convince the village or tribal head for this?"" You don’t need to convince them, they are in fact waiting for enthusiastic people like you, and they will either organize programs for you or fit you in the ongoing programs.

,, This is not your headache, once you impart the skills, there are local micro finance entities that will not only finance these people to set up cottage industry, they will also actively help in marketing the produce and collect their repayments.

Decide whether or not you really want to do this.,
Stop using anything that will be traceable back to you.,
Watch out for little things that may give you away.,
Decide on a death method.,
Do it.,
Eliminate all contact with people from your old life.,
Come up with an alternate identity.,
Make a fake ID.,
Go somewhere you'll be unknown.,
Work under the table.,
Lay low.",How to Fake Your Own Death," Faking your death is against the law almost everywhere. Does your situation really warrant a death-fake? Can you just move away? Are you being melodramatic? Are there any alternatives? You should only do this if you keep feeling that faking your own death is the only way to start over or escape, and you have no viable alternatives.


Understand the implications of faking your own death. You'll be able to have no contact with any friends or relatives. If you decide to let them in on it, they'll most likely call the police or betray you in the end. If you must let anyone know, try an understanding friend who will - for whatever reason - never rat you out to the police, family or general public.;
, Understand that you cannot use email accounts, memberships, cell-phones, or any other personal details from your old life, after you have faked your own death. This is probably the trickiest of all things to get sorted before you actually do the deed.


Since money is necessary to start your new life, gradually withdraw cash from an account leading up to your fake death, and leave behind things like credit cards and other documents. Clearing it completely may arouse suspicion. However, if you're in a hurry, draw out a massive amount, but leave a little behind to erase suspicion.

, Avoiding acting fishy beforehand. Also, remember not to use personal laptops, computers or mobile phones (unless you can change the sim card) afterwards; these can be used to trace you once you're gone. Plus, people might notice that they're missing.

, Suicide is probably the easiest bet. While it may be hard for loved ones to stomach, if it's obvious your ""death"" is a suicide, innocent people won't be accused of your ""murder"". Also, suicide is a more open and shut case: chances are, people will be less searching of CCTV footage and personal records etc if they know you ""killed"" yourself, rather than mysteriously disappearing.

Pick a ""suicide method"" that means there is no body to be found, or failing that, where it would be very difficult to find. A common one might include jumping off a bridge, and leaving a note that implies you're about to go through with it. The ""body"" may not be found easily, were it actually there, so police will be less suspicious when there isn't one.

, Plant a note for your ""suicide"" before disappearing. Travel out of the city as far as you can, and start again with a new identity. Be free.

, Unfortunately, most people who've faked their own deaths screw up this part of the process by cashing in on the insurance check they hoped to get, or getting a speeding ticket. If you want to get away with it, you've got to disappear completely.


Start by hiding out for a few weeks somewhere close by, like a cheap flophouse hotel for a few weeks to lay low. Load up on groceries and hide out watching detective shows on TV while the police decide to give up on finding you. When you have to go out, wear a disguise.
Eventually, you'll have to start making your way elsewhere so you can go about the process of finding your new life.

, Who do you want to be, now that the old you is dead? A suave gambler and poet from South Carolina, who decided to forego his family's tuna cannery inheritance and move to Australia to work on cars? A small town bartender who had to move to the bright lights of LA? Decide who you'll want to be, and start working on:



Your new name. Practice signing it, saying it, and introducing yourself with your new name. Make it awesome. Jackson Saint-Bloodrock? Pleased to meet you.

Your new style. How will you craft your new image? Get clothes that are different from your old way of dressing and that will mask the new you people might see in the old you. Dress in such a way that you'd be able to walk past your own mother on the street, and she'll never notice you. Grow a beard, shave your head, change your hair color, embrace leather, do whatever you need to do to cultivate a completely different style.

Your story. What will you tell people about yourself? How will you introduce yourself? How can you get away with masking your old identity when you meet new people?

, Once you've gotten your new identity hammered out and you're using to introducing yourself as Horace McGillicutty, find or consider crafting your own fake documents that will let you start your new life.

, Flying will likely be out of the question, unless you've got some great forged documents, but try making your way somewhere far off by hitchhiking safely or taking the bus on the cheap.

, Declaring taxes will be difficult, so working under the table and staying on the move will keep you relatively safe. Consider working migrant labors, heading West and checking out farm labor or other contract work that'll be easier get away with under the table. Mushroom picking in Oregon or California can be lucrative, as well as de-tassling in Indiana and peach-picking in Georgia. Move around and see the country.

, Becoming a public figure probably isn't the best idea. Get ready to live a quiet and simple life, socializing little and maintaining a mysterious mist around yourself. When people start to get to close to you, it's time to move on.


Stay away from tourist locations and landmarks; there will be cameras everywhere that may pick up your image. Moreover, there is an increased chance that some of those vacationers once knew you.
Wear a hoodie drawn over your forehead if you don't want to be seen clearly.

Make an effort to make a good first impression.,
Stay on point.,
Interact with the audience.,
Call them to action.",How to Actively Engage Your Audience During a Presentation," Identifying an audience is the first step in engaging them, so take initiative to locate the details. Consider the following questions:


How many participants will there be? This will help in accurate planning later on.
What do these participants do? In other words - are they students, if so at what level? Employees? What are their job functions?
Why will the audience be attending? Is their attendance required or is it optional? If optional, what is their motivation for being there?;
, Go a bit further, take the initiative to meet with or research your audience. Some suggestions of information to uncover includes:


What are these individuals' responsibilities?
What is important to these individuals?
What isn't important to these individuals?
What are current trends in their roles or industries?
What are common problems they may want to resolve?

, WIIFT stands for ""What's in it for them?"" and understanding and appealing to this is important part of the engagement process. To be successful, learn to look for the connections:


How can the presentation's content be adjusted to address the answers the questions in step 2?
How can the presentation's content be phrased to appeal to the audience's desires or interests?
In what ways is the presentation's content relevant to these individuals?

, Now that connections have been identified, build a case for why your presentation content is relevant to your audience, the next step is to build it in.


Use the research process to build rapport with the audience. Be vocal about your experience - audiences always appreciate the fact that an instructor/presenter has taken the time to consider their point of view. What are their job functions?
Change examples to reflect situations that would actually occur in the audience's day-to-day experiences.
Look for opportunities to be less general and more specific to the audience's experiences and desires.

, Thinking the presentation is a relevant presentation and creating a relevant presentation are two different concepts.


Ask a representative to review the presentation and give feedback on what could be improved and/or modified.
Be sure to integrate these changes, and practice running through the presentation.

, It is important to make a good first impression while delivering presentations or communicating.


Be sure to open in a captivating manner. Use an exclamatory statement, ask the audience to envision something or ask them a thought-provoking question.
Be confident in the opening statement or introduction in order to establish credibility for the duration of time with the audience.

, Going off on tangents can dilute the poignancy of communication. After having spent so much time preparing points, ensure to stick to the plan and execute on a prepared agenda.


Doing so will help the meeting/session end on time and ensure that all prepared points can be covered.
Allowing attendees to control the presentation's direction can deteriorate your credibility and poignancy, also negatively impacting engagement.

, As a reality exercise, try asking someone to shout the first word that comes to mind when the word ""lecture"" is said. It is equated with the word ""boring"" in most cases, so make sure delivery is interesting and not a lecture!


Maintain consistent eye contact with all audience members.
Use body language.
Control and use the room throughout.
Avoid rigid stances, folding hands or hands in the pockets.
Ask questions when the answer is already known. It will generate a consistent response that allows the audience to be included in the facilitation process. This will also help create smooth transitions from topic to topic.
Use technology, media, games or other interaction generating tools to help.

, Primacy and recency effects mean that learners are more likely to remember the first and last parts of a presentation than they are the content that falls in the middle. Therefore, it's important to develop an excellent closing. An excellent closing may consist of:


A summary of the concepts covered.
Additional reminders of why this information is relevant to the learner.
A ""call to action"", meaning an invitation to take action and apply this information versus just forgetting it as soon as they leave the room.

Learn how to build a shelter.,
Make an exit plan that minimizes expense and luggage.,

Keep other people in mind.",How to Drop out of Society," Often dropping “off the grid” is romanticized and made to sound more fun and viable than it actually is. If you’re dissatisfied with society, capitalism, or social relationships, there may be ways to change your environment other than dropping out of society.


If a life problem or struggle is making you want to drop out of society, get help in some other way first.
Just moving to another city might provide the change in environment that you need to be happy.
If your job is unfulfilling or meaningless, consider quitting and trying to find more fulfilling work before you drop out of society.
If you’d like to spend more time in nature, you don’t necessarily need to drop out of society. If you can take time off from your job, take a month and go backpacking and hiking, and see if that resolves your need to be away from civilization for a time.;
, Before you quit your job and pack up to live in the woods for good, do it for a trial period. This will give you time and experience to evaluate if this is really the right decision.For example, if you’d like to drop out of society and live in the woods, find a place where you can legally live for a season, such as the North Maine Woods.Take supplies with you: fishing and camping supplies, dried food, and a canoe. Try to live as if you had retreated from society, with as little interpersonal contact as you desire.

, If you’re living in a remote area without a job or income, you’ll soon run out of money. You’ll need to sustain yourself off the land, and what you can hunt, grow, and build yourself.This lifestyle is off-putting to many people, due to the difficulty of having to provide everything for yourself.


Alternately, you may be able to generate a small income even while living off the grid. For example, you could find ways to profit through selling meat, vegetables, and canned goods.

, Buy some books about how to survive in the wilderness. The wilderness section of the local bookstore or library will help you. In addition to wilderness skills, you’ll need to understand the essentials of survival (food, water, shelter) and plan to ensure all of these.


Understand how to forage and hunt for your own food in a remote environment.
Figure out what you’ll need to do in the case of dangerous weather (flooding, lightning strike, blizzard) while you’re in the wilderness.

, You’re not going to be able to drop out of society in a place like the city, so do some planning and figure out where you’re going to go. Go somewhere with a low population and a ready food source—whether fertile ground that can be planted with a garden, or a nearby stream to catch fish in.


Large amounts of vegetation and animal population are good indicators of a natural environment that can support life.
Make sure that you have a constant and nearby water source. This could be a river or stream, a natural spring, or a lake. Water is the most important element for survival, and you’ll need to use it on a daily basis, so make sure the water is clean and plentiful.
Research the types of wildlife that you can expect in whatever location you choose to live in. For example, if you’re in a forest, are you likely to encounter bears?

, It’s important to know how to survive outside of society before you drop out, especially if you’re going to be living in a harsh or remote area. Start by learning how to use basic weapons and tools: a knife, and a shovel, rake, and hoe.You’ll likely need to make serious changes to your diet. Living remotely, you’ll need to sustain yourself, and this can be done through eating animal proteins and foraging, or growing vegetables in a small garden.You should also look into learning how to preserve (dry or pickle) meat and vegetables, so you will have enough food to survive during winter months.

, Unless you’re planning to live in an already-existing “off the grid” house or rent a cabin, you’ll likely need to build your own housing. You can either purchase construction materials before you leave society, or use natural materials (trees, etc.) found in the woods.Consider that your accommodation will also need to be repaired and renovated from time to time. You’ll need to have money saved up to invest in these expenses.You should also have a plan in place for finding land to live on. The most legal method is to find a cheap, remote plot of land and purchase it.If you would prefer not to own land, or plan to move around frequently, you may find yourself living illegally on National Forest or private property.

, Use cash to take public transportation out to the wilderness if you don’t want to own and maintain a car. You’ll want to have your “off the grid” living situation set up before you leave, so that you’re not carrying luggage or construction supplies when you leave.


Don’t burn your bridges when you leave. Notify family and close friends where you’ll be, quit your job, and end your apartment lease.

, Living without electricity is one of the most challenging aspects of dropping out of society. However, if you have a large enough wilderness abode and you decide that you’d like to have a source of energy, you can purchase a small generator. Remote houses also often have solar panels, or devices to harness wind or water energy.If you decide to live without a generator or other means of electricity, plan to rise when the sun does and go to bed when it sets.Without electricity, you’ll need to cook using only fire, or plan to eat the majority of your food (especially vegetables) raw.

, Some individuals who live off the grid opt to use a bucket as a bathroom, or to dig a latrine in the woods.Waste should always be kept far from food, and downhill from living quarters.


Depending on your budget, you could purchase a composting toilet (which turns waste into compost) for around $1,000 at Amazon or a large hardware store.
Sanitation also includes water purification, as drinking unclean water can lead to giardia infection or other, more serious, health problems. Always boil water before drinking it, or purchase sanitation tablets or a sanitizing water-strainer.

, Even if you’re living completely “off the grid” and away from human contact, you’ll still need a way to communicate in dire situations. If you spend a year and a half in the wild and decide you don’t want to spend an indefinite amount of time there, you might want to call and ask for help getting out of your current location.Additionally, if a medical emergency arises, you might need society to help you and help you quickly.
Even on your training trips, bring your satellite phone. You might get in a dangerous situation more quickly than you think.

, If you have close friends or family, it will be hard on them if you vanish overnight. Especially if you plan to live in an area without electricity or access to a postal route, you will need to figure out how to maintain communication—or alternately, how to


If you’re dropping out of society, only do so after thinking hard about the consequences for yourself and others.

Realize that excess choice imprisons you.,
Do your research.,
Use stores that make quality choices for you.,
Be happy with what you have and with what you choose.,
Don't keep up with the Joneses.,
Value time.",How to Downsize Your Choices," When there are too many things or services to choose from, you can become so overwhelmed that you feel trapped. You can easily make decisions that are based on quantity and other people's opinions or persuasiveness over real need and utility. Moreover, you become a slave to goods and services when you've chosen too many:


What about those gym memberships you've never used?
What about all those electric gadgets in your kitchen that either get forgotten (but take up space) or require a lot of cleaning effort to keep them in working order? Has the sheer amount of these gadgets made your life easier or simply more enslaved to using them because you have them, whether or not they're really helping you?;
, Before you go to purchase goods or services, or before you choose which university to attend, which job to take, which club to join, do some background research. Go online, ask people who are in-the-know, read books, etc., and seek the answers that resonate best with your needs. If there are doubts, listen to those because they're probably choice-sorting doubts that can allow you to drop those choices. Whittle your research down to a maximum of 5 to 6 choices and no more, then go and test them out in the store.

, Some stores are renowned for only providing a small range of quality merchandise that their buyers are happy to put forward as the best items in their range. This cuts out all the choices which may or may not be cheaper or more expensive but are liable to be less reliable or worth investing in, and that simply add to the confusion.

, Longing for more things when the things you already have are doing a perfectly fine job will fill you with a sense of uneasiness. And worrying that you might not have made the best choice from the things you have chosen is a constant state of second-guessing yourself. The happiest way to be is the one in which you accept that the things in your life that are already working are adequate and don't need upgrading, fixing, extending, or decorating.

, So what if they own the latest car, computer, games machine? Do they appear happier or simply more besotted and less time free? There is a point of diminishing returns and maybe the Joneses have reached it and you just can't see it. Ignore their boasting; it could just be that they'd like to see you as trapped as they're feeling.

, New things and new must-do's can soon turn into time sappers. Reading instructions, locating all the pieces, finding where you need to go, etc., are all time-sucking, let alone when you get deeply entrenched in using you new gadgets. If the new item or experience isn't adding anything to your life but threatens to take away time, don't add it.

Make a comparison sheet of Republican and Democratic values.,
Consider third parties.",How to Find Your Political Standpoint," Before embarking on a quest to find your political stance, it is important to understand your system of government, on both a local and federal level. Consult books, scholarly journals, reputable web publications, or other reliable sources to reinforce your knowledge of your own political system.Take the time to learn about the different branches of government, the organization of the government as a whole, and how things function within that system., The way you were raised can affect your knowledge of, and engagement with, politics.If your family does not typically discuss political issues, stimulate the dialogue to get some insight on what their political leanings are. Make sure to convey that your interest is one of genuine curiosity by approaching the topic as neutrally as possible, and by highlighting your own quest for political direction (e.g. ""I’m exploring my own political beliefs. Would you mind sharing a bit about your own political beliefs with me?""). Follow with questions like:


""How long have you supported your political party?""
""What platform(s) won you over with this party?""
""Have your political beliefs changed over time?""
""What issues matter to you the most?""

, Make a point to learn the history of major political parties to gain a better understanding of what they really stand for. For example, most major European and North American political parties emerged in the 19th century as groups of individuals organized to gain and exert political power.Over time, the platforms (or values) of each party have shifted in response to cultural and political issues of the day. Understanding how each political party in your nation originated and evolved is key to understanding whether or not you agree with their positions on important issues., The number of major political parties varies by nation, but as a general rule most parties fall somewhere between liberal and conservative ideologies. Learn what these belief structures represent to get a better sense of your own political sensibilities. Liberal parties support a belief that government should guarantee equality, provide for its citizens, and alleviate social problems.Conservative parties emphasize personal liberty, free markets, strong national defense, and limited government interference.Also referred to as ""left-wing"" and ""right-wing,"" these contrasting ideologies differ greatly on many key issues. For example:


Gun control: Liberals often advocate for stricter gun control laws and believe it is the government's role to protect citizens, while Conservatives emphasize the right for citizens to bear arms and protect themselves.Same-sex marriage: Liberals support equal marriage rights for everyone regardless of sexual orientation, while Conservatives generally oppose same-sex marriage.The death penalty: Liberals typically view capital punishment as inhumane and want to abolish it, while Conservatives believe the death penalty is an important element of the justice system and a fitting punishment for murderers., If you have any questions about current government policies or procedures, address them directly to your elected officials using contact information available online.Use any such opportunity to ask questions that break through the veil of election time slogans and promises; if you notice that a particular issue seems to have been overlooked by a party or politician, tackle it head on with a question like, “I haven’t heard you comment on this particular issue so far. Will you please clarify your stance on it and plans for addressing it in the near future?”


Radio talks shows, candidate forums and debates, civic or town hall meetings, and web chats may also present opportunities to address political candidates and elected representatives directly., Staying abreast of political happenings is an excellent way to form your own opinions on the subject. Watch the news, read newspapers, and consult other non-partisan sources on a regular basis. In addition, look into one of the many apps available that can help you keep track of the ever-changing political landscape., There are quizzes available online that claim to assess the political typology of an individual based on their answers to a series of questions.Complete a few of these quizzes and compare the results to see if they are consistent. While the results of the quiz may not be infallible, the process of completing the quiz can encourage you to contemplate certain issues on a deeper level than you have in the past.

, Examine the rhetoric and platforms of political figures in the media as closely as possible.Watch televised debates and interviews, read newspaper articles, and consult reliable online sources to keep up with news on different political parties and issues.Take note of your gut reactions and what rings true to you by asking yourself:


Do you agree/disagree with this person/political party?
Do you think this politician is trustworthy?
Do the things that this person says make sense to you, or not?

, Your health is an issue of great importance, so consider your beliefs and priorities in this area when determining your political stance. As a general rule, Conservatives support private health care, distributed by the market with minimal government interference, and believe that anyone who is capable of paying for their own health care should do so.Liberals believe that healthcare is a basic right that should be distributed to all citizens by the government.Liberals generally also support the legalization of physician-assisted suicide and abortion, while Conservatives oppose both with the belief that they devalue the sanctity of human life., Education is a topic of great importance that you should think about carefully, whether you have children or simply have strong opinions about the educational system. Left-wing parties believe in the public school system, and feel that the government should direct more money towards improving these schools. Right wing parties tend to support a more privatized education system, where scholarships may be awarded to students for private or charter schools (public schools operating independently);the idea is that competition created by this scholarship or school voucher system will improve the quality of education., Left-wing and right-wing ideas about taxation and welfare are vastly different- the former supports higher taxes and a larger government to provide for the less fortunate, while the latter supports lower taxes and a small government.The left-wing also supports higher taxation of people with larger incomes. Consider your beliefs on this very divisive issue, as a citizen and taxpayer, to further evaluate your overall public stance.

, Liberal and Conservative beliefs differ greatly on environmental issues, particularly on the subject of climate change. Liberals believe that global warming is the result of excessive burning of fossil fuels and support laws to reduce carbon emissions; along the same lines, they believe that the government should subsidize programs to find alternative energy sources. Many Conservatives dismiss the notion that humans can have that effect on the climate and oppose laws to reduce emissions.Do some research to better understand the science behind these issues, which will allow you to assess your own beliefs about them. Consult sources like:


Newspaper and scholarly journal articles
Reputable websites
Documentary films on the topic

, The structure of US government is complex, so try reading up on it to gain a better understanding before choosing a political party to support. Give extra attention to the history of major political parties; the US is essentially a two party system, so getting acquainted with the background and evolution of the Republican and Democratic parties is a good idea.Keep abreast of current issues that the parties clash on (e.g. gun control, immigration laws, etc.).

, As a general rule, Republican platforms are based on Conservative beliefs, while Democratic platforms reflect Liberal ideology.Nonetheless, the best way to understand where each party falls on important issues is to research and organize information in a clear way; since Democrats and Republicans tend to fall on opposite ends of most issues, this kind of comparison works well. Try starting with a basic ""for"" and ""against"" list, with information like:


Republicans: For lower taxes, smaller government, the death penalty, free market health care; against long-term welfare, gun control, same-sex marriage
Democrats: For higher taxes, larger government, gun control, welfare (including long-term welfare); against privatized health care and education, the death penalty

, While the Democratic and Republican parties have dominated the United States political system since the mid-1800s, 52 other parties exist. While third parties are often regarded as a wasted vote, they have held their own in the US with the support of citizens who are unsatisfied with the country's two dominant parties.The most active third parties in the US are:


The Libertarian Party: the third largest political party in government; promotes reduced government involvementThe Green Party: a party focused primarily on environmental and social justice issuesThe Reform Party: a moderate, centrist, populist partyConstitution Party: a party advocating renewed allegiance to the founding documents of the United States (i.e. the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights)"

On 19. June 2009 the BBC announced that now officially a billion people go hungry. That's about one of seven people on earth. Each year die about 8.8 million people, mostly children, from starvation, representing a death every 6 seconds. , Reducing your carbon and greenhouse gas emissions will not only make your personal living space more sustainable but it will also save you money in both the short- and long-term. Global warming is occurring more rapidly than it was originally expected to -- only forty years ago,the big worry was global cooling.

The great nations must work together positively for the good of all people. They must settle their conflicts peacefully. They must refrain from threatening each other with war. Because the threat of war could be a poker game that develops unpredictably.

, Only happy people can build up a happy world. Only positive people have the strength to go a long way up to the end. Only strong people can not be deterred by difficulties. Only clever people recognize the way in which they can achieve their goals. Only wise people live in the right balance of health, activity, and rest so that they do not consume their energy, but grow by the work for a happy world in their own inner happiness.

, This is called a force-field analysis which is one of many ways to evaluate the theory and realize the theory's potential while eliminating the interference of emotion.;
,


Total column one ""Pros (Benefits)"" and you see 43 out of a possible 50 rating

So then = 43 ÷ 50 = 0.86 or 86% .
The pros form a strong argument for busing the students to other schools.


Total column two ""Cons/Costs (Downsides)"" and you see 42 out of a possible 50 rating

The cons form a strong argument against busing the students to other schools.
The pros for closing the schools very narrowly outweigh the cons of this particular situation.


There is not clear decision to be made. It would be easier to not do the closing and busing. You could make a decision in this case by flipping a coin because there is no defined advantage for either pro or con.

Make the return of the information as easy as possible.,
Analyze the results of the survey.,
Develop your learnings and implement them.",How to Create a Survey," Simply put, what do you hope to gain from your survey? The questions you ask all need to point back to this essential idea.


For example, say that you're an employer and you want to figure out whether your employees are happy. The survey questions you ask, either directly or indirectly, need to address the happiness of your workers. You could ask them directly, ""On a scale of 1 to 10, how happy are you at work?"" or you could formulate a more indirect question, like ""True or False: I wake up every day feeling like my work has a purpose.""
After you've designed all your survey questions, it might be helpful to go through each question and ask yourself how each one is helping you accomplish the goal of the survey.Any question that doesn't give you essential information about your survey objective should be removed.;
, If your goal is to figure out whether your employees are happy, you want an honest answer. In fact, with surveys, you always want honest answers. But it can be tough to get an honest answer if your employees feel like they could lose something — respect, standing, etc. — by being honest. Think about whether or not you need to tweak your survey in order to get honest results.With an employee happiness survey, for example, you might want to give respondents the option of completing it anonymously.

, Some options include telephone surveys, face-to-face interviews, surveys by mail, and Internet questionnaires. Each survey method has advantages and disadvantages, which should be weighed against the budget, available personnel and other considerations.


In general, face-to-face interviews, although they are costly and time-consuming, deliver the most representative results and finest granularity in responses.On the other hand, online questionnaires sometimes come with significant biases, but they are the easiest and cheapest surveys to administer.
If you're only going to rely on one form of survey, such as an online questionnaire, consider surveying more people to make up for possible biases. For the cleanest results, you might want to administer several different kinds of surveys.

, A survey that involves one or two respondents will tell you something about each one of the respondents, but it will not provide much accurate information about trends. In order to figure out how many people you should survey, you'll need two pieces of information:


The size of your population. What population do you want to understand? If you want to understand happiness at your company, your population is the size of your company. If you want to study adoption of condom usage in Uganda, your population is the size of Uganda, or roughly 35 million.
The certainty that your results are accurate. With survey accuracy, people talk about two ideas: margin of error and confidence interval. Margin of error is the degree of uncertainty you have in the results of your survey. Confidence interval is the degree of certainty you have that the survey samples the population accurately.

, Once you've answered the above questions — what population am I targeting? and how accurate do I need to be in my results? — you can start thinking about how many people you'll need to survey in order to get the desired results. In the table below, select your target population on the left, then select your margin of error to estimate how many surveys you'll need. As a general rule, the more surveys you give, the lower your margin of error will be.

, How well do you know your respondents? Is the purpose of your survey to gather data on ideas you already know or explore new ideas? If you're gathering data about ideas you already know, you probably want to lean on structured questions. If you're gathering new ideas entirely, you probably want to lean unstructured questions.



Structured questions ask a question and then provide answer choices below. An example of a structured question would be:
(1) ""What is your favorite online activity?""
(a) Chatting/IM
(b) Social Networking
(c) Knowledge Sharing/Forums
(d) Shopping/Ecommerce

Unstructured questions remove predetermined answers from the equation. Instead of leading the respondent in a particular direction by giving him or her answers to choose from, unstructured questions encourage the respondent to develop a very personal answer. An example of an unstructured question would be:
(2) ""Talk about your first experience stepping into an Apple Store.""
Answer:

, The downside of a structured question is that it's often not very specific. The downside of an unstructured question is that it's hard to analyze the response and/or put it into a spreadsheet. Enter the partially structured question. The partially structured question softens the downsides of each:
(3) ""How would you describe your attitude toward paying for music? Select all that apply.""
(__) I never pay for music
(__) As a rule, I pay for music I listen to
(__) I often download music illegally
(__) I seldom download music illegally
(__) I could be enticed to pay for music if I got more in exchange
(__) There is nothing that could entice me to pay for music
(__) I feel bad for musicians who are trying to earn a living wage
(__) I don't feel bad for musicians who are trying to earn a living wage

, This is a subset of the structured question. It seeks to answer how respondents would rate their experience on a scale. Your scale can be numbered or have a more sophisticated rubric:
(4) ""The Brooklyn Zoo is fun for both children and adults.""
(a) Strongly Disagree
(b) Disagree
(c) Agree
(d) Strongly Agree

, A Ranking question does a better job than a Rating question at get people's opinions about a given topic. An example of a Ranking question might be something like:
(5) ""In the space provided below, rank the brands you trust the most, with '1' being the most trustworthy and '5' being the least trustworthy.""
(a) ___ McDonald's
(b) ___ Google
(c) ___ Walmart
(d) ___ Costco
(e) ___ Apple

, It can be helpful to include options like ""Other,"" ""None of the Above,"" etc. at the end of your answer set. These options usually make the responses more accurate. Without a catch-all phrase, a respondent who doesn't find the answer that applies to them is forced to choose an inaccurate answer in order to complete the question.

, Once you've decided what type(s) of survey(s) you'll be using, you want to give thought to how you'll give all your respondents the questions.


The internet has made online questionnaires very simple to design and send. Services like Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, and others offer surveys that are easy to make and free.
If you are going to distribute telephone surveys or want to conduct face-to-face surveys, expect to shell out money. The data that you gather is usually more representative, but it comes at a price. You can often hire professional contractors to conduct the survey for you.

, Including postage on a mail survey makes the return of the survey much more likely. Distributing the survey at inconvenient times will discourage participation. A group kept after work or at the end of a long day may give you information slanted by a fatigue or resentment.

, If your data didn't come to you bundled in a single location, now might be the time to gather it. Excel is a great tool for just this. Use excel to run formulas, create charts, and analyze the data. In short, figure out what the respondents had to say.

, Now ask yourself why. Why are your employees unhappy, for example? The answer might have be embedded inside some of your answers. If it's not, you might be able to create a new survey to help you answer those burning questions. Then, when you've figured out the why — my employees are unhappy because they aren't getting enough perks — you can implement and iterate on your new strategy.

Volunteer your time.,
Share your other talents.",How to Change the World As an Individual1," Take a good look at what you're good at and what you enjoy. By focusing on your skills and passions, you'll be more effective in your attempts to improve the world. If you’re unsure of where your talent lies, try asking others or taking a personality or career test online.You can also consider your past work experiences to help you determine what you might enjoy doing. For example, if you enjoy working with people, then you might want to consider jobs and volunteer opportunities that will provide lots of social interaction.;
, Helping professions are those that have a direct impact on people’s lives. To join a helping profession, you may need to return to school for some additional training. Consider your interests to determine if a helping profession is right for you. Some helping professions you might consider include: Social work
Teaching
Occupational therapy
Counseling
Art therapy

, If your skills and/or talents are not in a helping profession, you can still have a career that will serve the greater good. Non-profit organizations hire employees to do many of the same things that for-profit businesses do, such as bookkeeping, customer service, and publicity.


If you want to work for a non-profit organization, then try searching for jobs with non-profit organizations that you believe in.

, Keep in mind that you do not have to work for a non-profit organization to make a difference. Instead, you can volunteer at a non-profit organization for a few hours a week. Consider what type of organization you would like to volunteer at, and then look for an organization in your city or community where you can volunteer your time.


Sites like Volunteer Match allow you to input your location and your interests to find volunteer options that are both interesting and near to you.For instance, if you’re interested in animals you can volunteer at your local ASPCA. Or if you enjoy teaching, you can volunteer to tutor children in your spare time.

, Whether you sew a dress for a Make A Wish patient, or you write a hit song to raise awareness about a social issue, your talents can make a difference for one or many.Think about how you could use your other talents to make a difference.


For example, if you’re a good writer, start a blog on sites like Blogger or Word Press to help spread information.
If you’re a gifted musician, you could write socially conscious songs that you can post on YouTube and share through various social media outlets.

, Chances are, if you start chasing someone who's just pulled a crime on another, they may try to vacate the area if they're not stupid enough to try and stand and defend themselves. When this happens, you need to know all the possible routes the could take and where you can head them off and where you can keep at them without losing them.

, At least, not too much. You're trying to be better than the criminal, that means you should deal with them in a rational manner. If you catch up to them, don't start beating them to a bloody pulp, deal enough to let them know that they didn't get away with breaking the law, and they can expect the same if they try again.

, Vigilantes don't work like in movies. Simply watching a marathon of Batman, V For Vendetta, etc movies isn't going to prepare you for real life scenarios. In movies, the skills and abilities of such characters are greatly exaggerated. Once you confront a criminal, the only difference between you and him is mindset and physical ability. Chances are, you can get hurt, possibly killed if you try and follow your favourite fictional superhero's footsteps.

, Simply hunting bad guys with your two fists isn't going to get you far if your target pulls out a knife or gun on you. Make sure to keep it exclusively non-lethal, yet concealable. Civilian tasers are a natural choice, if not available, telescopic batons are also very practical and effective. Your options are not limited to these two of course, but keep in mind your weapon's requirements.

, You need to be at your physical peak, jog, sprint, take up martial arts, as much as you can cram into your system. It'll mean the difference between life and death during a confrontation.

, Chances are, the person you just saved would be questioned by the police about your appearance. Masks are rather conspicuous, apparel like hoodies and brimmed hats are as effective as they are discardable.

, Your close friends may feel the same way about the adequacy of authority and be willing to fight crime alongside you. The more members you have, the better it is, but make sure you are all well co-ordinated and they accept the leader's authority.

Vote in elections.,
Post about important issues and causes on social media.,
Practice random acts of kindness.,
Donate items you don’t need.",How to Change the World As an Individual2," Although a single vote is unlikely to affect the outcome of an election, voting is still important.It gives you the opportunity to take part in democracy and make your choices known. If you are old enough to vote, then make sure that you participate in your local, state, and national elections.


If you want to have a bigger impact on elections, then you might consider starting a grassroots campaign to educate people about a new law or candidate.

, If you are good at utilizing social media sites like Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram, you can always post relevant information about your cause and how people can get involved. For example, you can use Facebook to promote your local dog shelter, or use Twitter to voice your opinion on the current presidential race.


You can also try starting a blog to raise awareness about issues and causes. For example, if you are a talented writer who cares about the environment, you can use Blog Spot to write about endangered species and how people can help. Or if your talent lies in art or photography, you can use Instagram to promote your cause.

, Many religions and faiths are built on the principle that rehabilitation of mankind can be achieved through pure and holy deeds. This is not to say that your act has to be a religious one, it simply means that it should come from the most wholesome and moral place in your heart. Be kind, just for the sake of being kind, without expectation of anything in return. One single act can result in many more.For instance, leave a bouquet of flowers at the hospital and allow the nurses to give them to a patient who could really use them. Or leave random sticky notes on the bathroom mirror offering kind words (like “you matter”) to strangers.Or you can try allowing someone to cut in front of you at the grocery store, or paying for someone’s morning coffee to demonstrate selflessness., Donate items in your home that you no longer use, but that may be of use to others. This can be anything from furniture, shoes, clothing, electronics, and more. Make sure items are in working condition, contain all pieces, or are free of rips and stains.You can donate through your local church, agencies like the Salvation Army, or even through online donation groups through Facebook or Yahoo.

Work for environmental change.,
Donate money.,
Learn as much as you can.,
Share your books and other sources of information.",How to Change the World As an Individual3," You can’t solve the world’s environmental problems on your own, but you can do your part to improve the health of the environment. Little changes and efforts can add up to big changes over time. Some things you can do to help include:Switch to CFL lightbulbs to cut your energy costs and reduce energy usage.
Cut down on your gas emissions, such as by riding your bike to work or getting a gas efficient vehicle.
Reduce the amount of water you use, such as by taking shorter showers.
Participate in local cleanup efforts, such as a local river cleanup or just pick up litter during walks.

, There are thousands of charities worldwide that can always benefit from financial help. Whether it’s a well-known charity like the American Red Cross, or a lesser-known charity like the Native American Heritage Association, your money will go towards helping many people across the nation or the world.


Try a site like Charity Navigator to help you find charities that support causes in which you are interested.There are also lists online of fake charities, as well as the best and worst charities to donate to.Always do your homework to make sure your money is going to a reputable agency.

, Build up your knowledge base so that you can share your wisdom and try to help others. Learn about a variety of topics, and then delve deeper into the ones that grab your interest. The more you know about the world, the more you can affect change.


Look around you for inspiration. For example, if you're part of the LGBTQIA community, you might educate yourself on laws to help with the equal rights push.
Read from multiple sides of an issue. For example, if you're a feminist, don't limit yourself to only feminist blogs. Looking at the opposite side of the argument (e.g. ableism, trans exclusion) will help you strengthen your understanding and be the best you can be.

, Not everyone has access to books and other informative materials. Recycle any books, articles, and videos that have taught you interesting, and insightful information. You can do this through social media or in person.


Try programs like Bookcrossing, in which you share great books instead of putting them away on shelves."

Determine what's important to you.,
Look for problems in infrastructure.,
Strive to self-sustaining pursuits.,
Learn from entrepreneurs.,
Volunteer.,
Involve your friends and family.,
Spread awareness.,
Evaluate charities.,
Donate to a few causes you feel strongly about.,
Reconsider charities each year.",How to Become a Philanthropist," There are a variety of different reasons you may want to become a philanthropist. People also have different outcomes they hope to achieve through giving to charity. Think about what's important to you and why before diving into the world of philanthropy.


What are you reasons for giving? Are you giving out of religious belief, tradition, a sense of moral duty, or for some other reason? Spend some time consider the underlying moral beliefs driving your desire to become a philanthropist. This can help motivate you to donate time and money.What is your expected outcome? Do you want to help others in need? Do you want to cure a given disease? Think about how you can help and why you want to help.There are a litany of charities that need money help. Determining what's important to you and where you would like to focus your attention is an important first step to becoming a philanthropist.;
, Many people believe being a philanthropist is simply throwing money at a cause. This is not the case. Good philanthropists look for underlying problems in infrastructure and seek to change them. A creative, problem-solving spirit can help you in your pursuit.


Say you want to improve access to medical care. The most obvious way to do so would be by building more hospitals. However, there may be problems you don't see preventing people from accessing health care. For example, maybe in certain regions there's no way to access a hospital. How could you combat this problem? You could help roads in rural areas of the country. You could increase access to public transportation. You could develop digital software to help diagnose issues remotely. There are many ways you can look into innovating existing systems to help solve problems at their core.In addition to donating time and money to charity, look for ways to change underlying power systems. Give money to politicians and political campaigns that support a particular cause. Try to start letter writing and phone call campaigns to address problems with how resources are allocated to poor communities.

, You should always be looking for ways to make charity more self-sustainable. It's not enough to just blindly throw money at a cause. You have to look at the underlying issues creating problems in the world.


For example, say your goal is to combat poverty. You could donate to soup kitchens and homeless shelters. However, a more sustainable pursuit might be to invest in education. This can help people foster employable skill sets.
Try to start an organization that is designed to help underprivileged people achieve career skills that make employable. Enlist the help of teachers, for example, to start no cost vocational programs in a low income community., Philanthropists can learn a lot from entrepreneurs. As the best philanthropic endeavors or longterm, self-sustaining pursuits, there's much to be gained from having an entrepreneurial spirit as well as a charitable one.


Both business people and philanthropists spend a lot of time brainstorming and problem solving. They also both working with and motivating others. It might not be a bad idea to read a few self-help books written by powerful men and women. These kinds of books can teach you to think in an entrepreneurial manner that will help with philanthropic pursuits.Innovation is key to philanthropy. You will have to be constantly looking for new ways to solve problems. It might not be a bad idea to reach out to a CEO or businessperson and ask him or her for advice on how to foster an entrepreneurial attitude., Most people associate philanthropy with giving money. However, donating your time to valuable causes is just as important. In addition to donating time, make sure you donate your money to charity.


Look for opportunities to volunteer. You can find volunteer opportunities online or you can also watch for fliers and signs in your local community asking for help.Try to get involved in a certain organization for more than just a one time thing. While it's great to ring bells for the Salvation Army around Christmastime, remember that most non-profit and charitable organizations need help year round. See if any organizations have programs where volunteers are trained and assigned work year round. See where volunteers are needed. There may be a particular area where volunteers are lacking. Ask an organization you care about where they need extra help and volunteer your services., Teaching others about the important of charity is vital to the philanthropic lifestyle. Teach your friends and family members about the causes in which your invested. Invite them to help volunteer at events, give money to charity, and educate themselves and others about causes that matter. Use things like social media to your advantage. Post articles and links to the charities encouraging others to give to your cause and educate themselves about it., In addition to donating time to a cause, try to spread awareness as well. Oftentimes, causes can benefit from public awareness campaigns. This can lead to more people donating money to worthy causes.


Think about creative ways to spread awareness. Incorporating social media can often have a phenomenal effect on public awareness. The ALS ice bucket challenge, for example, was an incredibly popular social media campaign in which participants dumped a bucket of ice water on their heads to help raise money for research into a disease known as ALS, which attacks nerve cells and leaves sufferers paralyzed. The challenge was widely successful, raising millions for charity and making more aware of ALS., Not all charities are created equal. When making decisions about donating time and money, spend some time figuring out what organizations are most effective.


You want to support causes that make a real impact. Determine which charities make a real impact and which do not. Look for tangible outcomes and real life outcomes. Solid charities will give you a breakdown of where the money goes. For example, look into how much is spent on charitable causes and how much simply goes back into the organization.Look for verifiable impact. That is, how many people does the charity actually help? What kind of services do they provide? A trustworthy charity will be able to provide real statistics rather than feel good anecdotes alone., It can sometimes make more sense to go deep rather than wide. That is, donate more to a smaller amount of organizations. Your money will go further and you'll have more of an impact. Focus on a handful of worthwhile organizations rather than donating a small amount of money to one or two causes., Reevaluate your cause each year. Charities are subject to change and this is sometimes for the worse. Reevaluate where you're donating your money each year. Watch for changes in infrastructure in existing charitable organizations that may change how your money is being spent. Stay up to date on news articles about existing charities and pay attention to the board of directors. Changes in power could lead to an organizations adjusting its values in a way you dislike."

Take out your diary, a notebook, or a journal.,
Live in the moment.,
Be thankful for everything you have.,
Radiate a caring attitude.,
Help others see that letting go is healthy.,
Offer a helping hand.,
Spend time with people you love.,
Practice the joy of giving to others.,
Take time to relax.,
Be your authentic self.,
Realise that when you are content and at peace, you make others content as well.",How to Bring Peace to the World Through You," List down all of the bad and good qualities you consider form part of who you are. List down the ways in which you feel you might do well to improve. Highlight the good qualities and talents that are already obvious. Do both lists with humility and a certainty that improvement is always possible in every respect.


Keep these lists. From time to time you can read them and decide how your project to keep improving the best within you is going.;
, Remember the phrase ""the present is called present, as it is a gift indeed"". The present moment does not cause the trouble; troubles rest in the past or form while worrying about future. It is in carrying the burdens from past matters and forming the anxiety about possible future hardships that unhappiness grows. The best approach for the present is to concentrate on your breathing, the fact of being right now, and to tell yourself that things will be okay; these will help you to stay present all the time.

, This means acknowledging such important parts of your life, such as your health, your family, your friends, your tasks, your mind, your strengths and your existence. Aim to see what is good in your life and be thankful that you are here now. Even be thankful for the struggles that show you your strengths and the possibilities of what could be when you reach the other side. Help others to see the value of gratitude and the realization that what they have is worthwhile.

, Smile at others and bring brightness into their lives. Share genuine goodwill and kind spirit to those you meet and to those you spend time with. Your determination to care and to bring a happy spirit into other people's lives will encourage greater peace around you.


Realise that when you are living in the moment, you are alive and actually happy. You behave nicely with others as a result. Hence, your positive behavior wells up into your surrounds, instilling happiness in the the people you interact with.

, Don't try to control things, mess with people's lives or offer your opinions out of place. Let things be, observe more and don't allow the toxic messages of negative people to reside in your head. Whether such persons rule your mind or not is a personal choice but peace comes from not letting other people determine your course in life, so let go of their demands and expectations. Give others the hope they need that letting go is a good deed, not an impossibility, by sharing your stories of strength.

, When another person is down, lost or experiencing tough times, reach out to them and let them know that they're not alone. Everyone is connected in one way or another and good deeds come back to you when you least expect it. People's goodwill builds a healthier and happier community and communities that join together make for a better, stronger world.

, Recognize how much they have to offer you—kindness, support, a listening ear, and love. Think of love as an action, and do things that demonstrate your constant, unconditional love.


It's okay not to be around people who bring you down. Their bad moods are not your responsibility, and you don't need to stay with someone who drags you down.

, Generosity will improve others' lives and your mood. Find ways to give to others—from something as small as a smile or a back rub to something even bigger. Let the little things add up.

, Balancing your life is important, and time spent resting and enjoying yourself is important to maintain your mental health. Set aside time each day to do things you love, either by yourself or with people who make you feel relaxed.

, Stay true to who you are, and work on loving yourself with all your quirks and foibles. Accept your identity (feminine, nerdy, bisexual) and your body (chubby, freckled, disabled, nearsighted). Rather than trying to minimize your faults, work on celebrating yourself and being the best possible version of you.

, If this keeps passing on and on, the entire world would be a happy place, bringing peace to it. World peace comes from you.

Use large fonts throughout your presentation.,
Try to add as many pictures and animations to your slides as possible.,
Draw charts, tables and blocks whenever you need to explain a concept in detail.,
When you deliver your PowerPoint presentation, make sure you talk to the audience with the intention to explain your topic to them - not just to read what is written in the slides and finish off with the presentation.,
A wonderful way to make your presentation interesting is to involve the audience in your presentation.",How to Deliver Effective PowerPoint Presentations," It is OK even if you include only two three major points on each slide - but make sure the points are clearly visible to your audience. On the right you can see an example of a slide with large fonts.;
, You can even add pictures when they are not very much required! This is because pictures and animations make the slides interesting - and they make your audience want to look at the slides. If you were being shown a PowerPoint presentation, wouldn't you get bored if there was only text everywhere? The same is the case with your audience. You can gain access to loads of free pictures by clicking on the ""ClipArt"" option under the Insert tab in PowerPoint. You can animate text and pictures using the ""Custom Animation"" option under the Animations tab in PowerPoint.

, This way, you will able to make your presentations more interesting as people don't like reading through lots of text to grasp a concept. You can insert special charts using the ""Smart Art"" option under the Insert tab in PowerPoint. You can similarly use the ""Table"" option under the Insert tab to insert a table.

, Use the points on the slides as markers that tell you which direction you should proceed in but don't only read out those points. Let the points give you ideas which you can explain in detail as you talk to the audience. Talk to the audience as if you were talking to a friend - with the intention to make them understand what you are saying.

, As you talk, ask your audience some questions. For example, if you are talking about designing a website, ask your audience - ""Which website do you visit the most? What do you like about this site?"" The audience will then feel more involved and interested and you will be able to get your point across in an even better way.

Recognize that it's okay not to be a full-time activist.,
Research your desired issue.,
Pay attention to intersectionality.,
Speak up on social media.,
Consider your audience.,
Don't feed the trolls.,
Recognize that you will be called out at some point.,
Put your health first.",How to Become a Social Media Activist," Activism is stressful, emotionally taxing work. You may have a job, children, a disability, et cetera, that limit the amount of time you can devote to a cause. You may only be able to act anonymously, because speaking publicly (e.g. coming out as bisexual) could cause you to lose your job or familial support.;
, It's best to spend lots of time reading and listening before you start speaking—especially (but not exclusively) if this is an issue in which you have privilege (for example, a white woman fighting racism or a smaller fat person fighting sizeism). Be sure to educate yourself from multiple perspectives so you can form a nuanced standpoint.


Read first and foremost from the people who experience the issue.
Find where marginalized people disagree on different topics. Why do they feel this way? How do you feel?

, Particularly in feminism, activists care about multiple manners. You can't fight classism without a reasonable understanding of ableism; you can't fight racism without a decent knowledge of gender roles, et cetera. Focus on your issue, but remember you're here to help all people with that issue, and make sure that when stepping up you aren't treading on someone else's toes.

, Social media allows you to reach other people and make them think. Link to well-written works that helped you understand. Use logic to point out holes in bigotry and injustice. Internet activism is about slowly opening people's minds to new ideas.


You may want to share it with your in-person friends, or start an anonymous account for safety/comfort reasons. Either way is okay.

, A trans woman deeply discussing gender performativity in a group of feminist academics will speak and behave differently than a trans woman educating cis people on basic manners. Pay attention to the language you use, and the patience at your disposal. Privileged and uninitiated people are naturally going to take some time to understand.


Educating people can be exhausting work. Take good care of your physical and emotional health.
If someone clearly doesn't understand well, and you don't have the energy to deal with them, feel free to suggest they ask someone else. (Offer them a link where they can go read about it, or tell them to try a search engine.)

, If you're a feminist or other controversial type of activist, expect people to attack you. They want attention, and it's best not to make it clear that this behavior is not the way to get it. Block, report, and ignore. Here are a few telltale things they do:


Insult you
Ask ridiculous ""trick questions""
Pretend to be a member of a group they're not (e.g. ""I'm totally a black guy and I feel that you're racist against whites, you're an *insert slur* p.s. white men are sexy"")
Contradict themselves
Claim to be the paragon of logic or reason
Add that they're just curious (not trolling)

, You will do something problematic, and someone will tell you so. This is okay. You are learning—everyone is—and nobody hates you. The most graceful way to handle it is to say ""I'm sorry that I hurt people, and I'll research a little more so I can be confident I won't do it again."" It's that easy.


Calling others out can be scary. Be sure not to lash out at the person who called you out—they mean well.
Respond the way you'd like others to respond when you call them out regarding your cause.

, Activism can take a large emotional toll, especially if you have a mental illness or other stressful issues in your life. If activism is hurting you too much, shut down the computer. You cannot fix the world's problems yourself, and you are not Atlas—you cannot hold the weight of the world on your shoulders.


Remember, when you take better care of yourself, you'll be better able to handle the challenges that life throws at you.
If you feel persistently sad, irritable, tired, or anxious, ask a doctor to be screened for mental health issues such as depression.
Consider the starfish philosophy—you can't save every single beached starfish, but when you throw one back into the sea, it makes a difference to that one. Whether you can see it or not, you've changed several people's lives for the better.

, Creating ideas is much easier than getting other people to believe they have a stake or vested interest in what you’re asking them to be a part of.

, Epiphanies and profoundly moving personal experiences can go a long way in helping the audience to understand what you’re saying. Similarly, help your audience comprehend what you are saying, so that they can reach their own epiphanies.

, Don’t just make it pretty. Organize and display your content so that everything is clear.

, Your presentations should be designed to best suit your audience, not you. The presentation is another way to convey your concepts to your audience, not another way to remind yourself what to say and do.

, Sometimes we get wrapped up in charts and graphs. Presentations began as a fire and a storyteller who had the best position. The audience stared into the fire and imagined the story while the storyteller spoke.


You can even make “campfires” behind people, so the audience can start imagining.
It’s important to practice and know how to tell a story. You could have your company practice that regularly, telling stories in a circle. Try to have most of the stories be memories and experiences that have happened to the person telling them. It’s a memory they have. No written script.
Remember that, at some level, everything is a story. Advertising is often the story of “where this came from” and “what it can do for the customer."" Even global warming is a story, of things that have happened and things that may happen.

, Whenever multiple concepts or objects are presented, it is best to designate one as “the important one right now”, and animate the “important status” changing as time passes.


There are 5 basic attributes you can use to single one object from others; Size, Shape, Shade, Color, and Proximity.

Size, the object can be larger than others.
Shape, the object can be a different shape (a square among triangles).
Shade, one is brighter/darker, or the others are partially transparent.
Proximity, one object is further away from the others.


Similarly you can use a different color or stylize a portion of a body of text to emphasize a specific portion.0

, Western conventions dictate that text is read from left to right, top to bottom. By default any group of symbols or shapes will be perceived in this order, unless you do something to establish a different order to your audience. You can use a series of arrows, or size. Typically the largest object is perceived as the most important, and recognized first, with the next largest object going second. Create your content with the assumption that everything will be viewed in a top to bottom, left to right order.

, Audiences need a hierarchy of information; Slide Title, Point Title, Point Content. A common method of establishing hierarchy is using Text Font, Size, and Location. Changing the Size and Proximity of objects also modifies their meaning.

, Visualize, or create, a 5x5 grid. Using this basic grid, you can group your content into various quadrants, creating a variety of spatial relationships for your slide content. The most important content should occupy the largest number of squares. Using an underlying grid consistently lends a sense of order to your slides, even if their layouts are not identical.


It’s recommended that you design your grid to mimic the 16:9 screen size.

, White space is empty space in your slide. It is important to provide your audience with visual breathing room, and not pack too much into one slide.


White space can be any color, depending on what the background color/pattern for your presentation is.

, Measure the diagonal length of your computer screen. If your screen is 15 inches (38.1 cm), move 15 feet (4.6 m) away from your screen and see if you can read your slide. You can also try viewing your slides at 66%.


One technique is to divide the oldest audience member’s age by 2 and use that font.

, When selecting photos, choose photos that are not cheesy or clichéd, but feel unique. Your photos should look like they belong together, with the same general color palette and style.


Use photos with real people, that are not exaggerating their facial/body language, nor are they faceless or vague silhouettes or computer generated mannequins.

, The Rule of Thirds is fairly simple. Draw two lines vertically and two horizontally, dividing your image into 3 columns and 3 rows. Places where two lines meet are significant points in the image and should be areas of importance and aesthetic.


Don’t be afraid to crop and resize your image to move content into a good spatial position, and remember that the largest object or person should be the most important.

Slow moving video (the Ken Burns type) can help create a feeling of nostalgia or even the passage of time.
Fast moving video (quick cuts) can help create a sense of excitement, energy, or surprise.

Consider the amazing advantages of open source.,
Choose software shared under an open source license.,
Learn to code using open source programming languages.,
Switch to an open source operating system.",How to Become an Open Source Enthusiast1," These include more freedom, flexibility, reliability, privacy, support and more. Weigh the pros and cons of free and open source versus proprietary software.

Most open source projects are shared freely. Office 365 Home costs around 100 dollars per year. Considering the fact that Office is very widely supported and powerful, it's not too expensive for what you're getting. The thing is, if you compare Office to something like LibreOffice, you'll find that they are fairly similar feature-wise. The one difference being that LibreOffice is free.
Consider the extensibility of open source software. As an extension to its open nature, open source software can be modified to meet your exact needs. This can be especially useful in business environments. If you need a feature that isn't included with the package, write it yourself! While Apple products might be clean, intuitive and stable, they aren't incredibly extensible. Open source software, on the other hand, is highly extensible, and occasionally hackable to their core.
Remember that privacy is always important. If a company states that their software is using a high level of encryption, you can't be certain that they haven't also placed security backdoors within the code to aid law enforcement or provide third parties with sensitive data. Only when the software is open source can you be absolutely sure your privacy is being upheld with the utter most care.
Think about security. With the considerably large communities actively developing some of the major open source projects, you can rest assured that most security flaws will be weeded out quickly.;
, There are millions of open source projects online. In fact, Github, a popular Git repository hosting service, passed ten million repositories back in 2013!There's a wide variety of open source software to choose from.Using open source software comes with many advantages.

If you're looking for an open mobile phone operating system, try Android, LineageOS (forked from CyanogenMod after being discontinued), Sailfish OS or Ubuntu Touch.
Try running an open source operating system on your laptop or desktop computer like Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Fedora instead of Windows or MacOS.
Install the OpenOffice package or LibreOffice suite instead of Office 365. Install GIMP rather than Photoshop.
Adopt Inkscape contrary to Adobe Illustrator.
You can replace Chrome and Microsoft Edge by Embracing Firefox.

, Start with scripting languages like Perl and Python, web development using PHP, or database management using the popular language MySQL!

, While Windows and MacOS are considered standard, they also fall under the category of proprietary software. Open source operating systems plant all of the advantages of open source software at the heart of your system. By using these OSes, you can rest assured that vast communities of developers are working to make it better.


Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions, making it a viable choice. Ubuntu uses the Unity interface and is based on Debian. Ubuntu is also the most widely supported. There are also plenty of derivatives of Ubuntu, such as elementaryOS and Linux Mint.
openSUSE is another popular Linux distribution coming from Germany promoting use of Linux everywhere. This OS is a great choice for desktop users and developers.
For more experienced users, Arch Linux is a great choice. Arch is a lightweight Linux distribution that follows a ""keep it simple"" philosophy, handing you a minimal system and giving you the ability to configure it to however you like.

Become an activist.,
Introduce others to open source software.,
Help others get started with free software.,
Join online open source communities.,
Talk about open source software on social media.",How to Become an Open Source Enthusiast2," People don't usually like change. This can really limit the spread of open source software. Try to convince your friends and family to switch. Explain why you believe it'll work better for them., Everyone uses proprietary software, and everyone knows how to use it. Getting your friends to switch can and will be difficult. Try and explain the many advantages of open source software. In the beginning, many of the people you talk to will probably be confused, since switching from something that works to something that seems foreign might not make sense at first. Switching isn't something that happens quickly. Over time, things will begin to feel more natural., At first, they will probably find things difficult as open source software has a reputation of being unintuitive. If they're finding things hard, help them out. You have the power to help them coast into open source culture., Surrounding yourself with people who share the same passion about open source may be a good idea. Moodle is probably the most popular platform to get supported at, rather than other communities on Reddit and Stack Overflow.


Many open source projects have their own forums and online communities. As there are many choices of applications and programs in the world of open source, there you will find people with the same beliefs as you.

, Share your opinions about certain open applications with your friends on Facebook and followers on Twitter. The Internet is your friend when it comes to promoting your beliefs. Try and reach out to others online and introduce them to free software."

Find an open source project that you want to contribute to.,
Determine how you can help.,
Offer feedback on the project.,
Contribute your time as a developer.,
Try translating the user interface or documentation into another language.,
Answer user questions.,
Become an activist.,
Donate.",How to Become an Open Source Enthusiast3," There's a variety of open source projects that could use your help. You should try and find one where you would have a meaningful way of contributing. It also might be a good idea to choose one in particular that could use more volunteers.

If you're stuck, try checking the Trending Repositories page on Github.

, You don't have to be a programmer to contribute to free software. Open source projects are powered by people volunteering their time and effort. There are a number of ways you could help out. If you have something to offer, your work will almost always be welcomed.

, Free software, just like any form of software, thrives on feedback. Without it, the project could be pulled away from the interest of the user. Tell developers what you like and don't like about their software. If you're offering critical feedback, provide them with a way to make it better. Try and request features you think would improve the software as well., Contributing code is probably the best way to contribute to an open source project. If you are familiar with the language used to write the software you're interested in, try forking the program, make your modifications and open a pull request., Have you found an open source project that hasn't yet or is in the process of being translated into your first language or another language you know? Translating is a great way to contribute to a project without doing any programming., People will always have questions, and someone will always need to be there to answer them. Try taking up this role and help confused users. If these users don't find solutions to their problems, they could find themselves discouraged. Stack Exchange is a great place to start. With its vast network of questions-and-answers websites, you will almost certainly find people in need of help.

Most open source projects also have dedicated forums where users can ask questions and get answers. There, you will find more people asking questions specific to what you're skilled with.

, Promoting the open source project you're interested in is a simple but effective way to push it forward. Share your opinion on social media and help spread the word., The majority of open source projects are funded by donations. Without them, finding money would be particularly more difficult. Donating is an easy and great way of supporting your favorite project."

Create a layout that is easy on the eyes.,
Use bullet points.,
Use visuals like charts and graphs.,
Use speaker notes and avoid reading from the slides.,
Confidence is key - Be positive.",How to Create a Visually Effective Powerpoint Presentation,";
, Typically, layouts that look distracting and too loud look amateur. Allow the content of your presentation to impress your audience.

, Bullet points are easy to read and understand. They will help you convey your key points. Try to limit each slide to 1 key message and no more than 6 bullet points.

, People are visual creatures. They illustrate your key message and break up the monotony of a completely text filled presentation. Use only highly effective charts and graphs and do not overload. do not use too many bells and whistles that make other visuals less effective.

, Your presentation should be communication with your audience. Know the material well enough (adequate practice) to be able to speak confidently and address any unexpected questions or interruptions.

, The impression you leave with your audience is a major part of your presentation.

Summarize the main purpose or idea of your PowerPoint in your title slide.

,
Use the appropriate size for the text.,
Instead of citing your sources all on one slide, cite the sources you referenced as you present them throughout the PowerPoint presentation.,
Try not to use pictures as a background.,
Use graphs and tables to show your information often, but not too often.

,
Use short sentences and phrases, keep your text short.,
Only use animations for emphasis.,
If you use slide transitions, stick to only one.,
Look over the presentation at least five times.",How to Create an Effective PowerPoint," Choose an interesting angle for your talk.;
,,,, Choose text that is large and clear to see. Make sure that it is visible from the back of the room you'll be presenting in. It should be clear, easy to read and not blending into the background used.

,


The references can even be placed below the slide, making them easily findable should you send the slides to people by email.

, They make it hard to read the text.


If you feel you must use a picture as a background, use a transparency behind your text so it is easy to read, and have your text and your transparency contrasting colors. To do this, right click the text box, click on format placeholder, and change the fill to a color and make it transparent. (Around 70-80% transparency works well)
On the other hand, pictures in the background catch the reader's attention and makes your presentation look professional. However, make sure that the words contrast with the background. Also, find large pictures that aren't blurry. Try searching up vector.

,, Remember the 5 by 5 rule. Five bullets with less than 5 words each. Please, no long paragraphs or slide long quotes!

, Don't over-exaggerate your animations, slide-ins work really well for bullets.

, Don't try to mix it up because then it will look sloppy. Note: just because you should stick to one slide transition does not mean that you should only stick to one animation.

, Look for mistakes and do touch-ups. Best of all, read it through as if you were giving the presentation and see how it all pulls together.

You never want to work on the master data file in case something gets corrupted during the analysis process. A program such as Excel allows you organize all of your data into an easily searchable spreadsheet. You can add filters to your data to make it easier to copy and paste discrete datasets between files.Take care when transferring data into the master spreadsheet. It is easy to accidentally copy and paste into the wrong columns or rows.
In case something does happen to the data, you can always go back to the original master file.;
, If you are working with survey data that has written responses, you will need to code the data into numerical form before you can analyze it.You may have to develop your own coding system for responses based on the information you have received and the questions you are trying to answer with your data.


Code Yes and No responses as 0’s and 1’s, respectively.

, As you start collecting data, start thinking about the best way to group everything. If you’re working with human subjects or responses, you’ll need to give each person a number or letter code to protect confidentiality.It may be easiest to keep all of your groups on separate sheets within one document, completely separate documents, or different columns/rows within the same sheet.
Talk to others who have done similar data analysis to get an idea of how best to organize your data.
For example: If you want to know differences between males and females, you would want to make sure all of the male data was grouped together and all of the female data was grouped together.

, When organizing data, there can be a lot of copying and pasting between files. Periodically check the master file against the data you have organized to make sure that numbers haven’t been mixed up or placed in the wrong columns.If you have to manually enter data, make sure to double-check everything that gets entered.

, A t-test is a very common statistical test used to compare the means (averages) of samples. A one-sample t-test is used to test that the average sample is statistically significant from a known value. A two-sample t-test is used to test that two groups have statistically different means.One sample t-tests are generally used in physics and product manufacturing: you know the value that your sample should have so you compare the average that you get to that known value.Two sample t-tests are commonly used in the biomedical and clinical fields.

, An ANOVA (analysis of variance) is very commonly used in the biomedical fields to compare means of multiple groups. ANOVAs are a very powerful tool for finding differences when you are looking at many comparisons.


A one-way ANOVA can be used to compare the means of multiple groups to one control group. For example, if you had one control group and three test groups, you would use a one-way ANOVA to compare all of the means and see if any are different.A two-way ANOVA is used to compare the means of multiple groups with multiple variables. For example, if you wanted to know if both genotype and sex of an organism affected your data, you would run a two-way ANOVA against the control groups., A linear regression test looks at the variation of the independent variable and tests to see whether that variation is causing the variation seen in the dependent variable.This test is used when you want to measure the strength of association between two variables.
For example, if you wanted to test the relationship between your heart rate and the speed you move on a treadmill, you would use a linear regression.

, If you want to compare the relationship of two different groups to the same variable, you can use an ANCOVA (analysis of covariance). An ANCOVA allows you to control for the variation you might see from the independent variable between two groups.For example, if you wanted to test to see if males and females had different resting heart rates at different temperatures you would use an ANCOVA. You would make two regression lines (one for females and one for males) of heart rate vs temperature. Then you would use an ANCOVA to compare the two lines to see if they were different.

, The tests presented are not an exhaustive list of tests available. These are some of the more common tests used, but there are many variations and more complex tests that may be better for your data. When planning your experiments, do a thorough search to decide which tests to use.


There are some helpful charts and articles online to assist you in choosing a test based on the data you are collecting.Look at articles from the NIH and universities or online statistics books for more information.

, Never lose focus of the study and stick to the research design and defined variables. A good research strategy involves running well designed experiments and collecting the right amount of data to answer the research question.


Before you begin collecting data, you should know exactly how many samples you are going to collect in each group and what statistical tests you will run.

, Statistics can get very complicated very quickly, especially with large datasets. Before you begin the experiment, discuss everything with a statistician. They can help you figure out what tests are appropriate for analyzing your data and how many samples you will need in each group to have the proper power to run your tests.It is also a good idea to meet with them again after the data has been collected. They can help you analyze the data and make sure everything has been done properly.
Ask them about the proper size of your study, what types of statistical tests will help you answer your research questions, and what the limitations of the tests are.
Remember, a statistical test simply tells you the probability of an outcome occurring or not occurring. You must be careful not to confuse statistical significance with clinical significance or physiological relevance., Once the data has been collected and prepared, you can start to run all of the tests you decided to run before the experiment began. Programs specific for analyzing data should be used for this process. These tests are complex and it is much easier to run them using a program such as SAS, R, or GraphPad Prism.


SAS and R require some programming experience. You may need to consult someone trained to use these programs or take a course to become proficient in their use.

, There are many software programs that allow you to turn your data into nice graphs. Statistical analysis programs also have graphing capabilities that produce publication quality figures. Transfer your data into one of these programs and make them into a graph.Commonly used programs are GraphPad Prism and R.

, When presenting data, it is important to label everything clearly so people can easily interpret what the graph is telling them. All axes need to be labeled with an easy-to-read font at a size large enough to read without squinting.If you have multiple datasets on a single graph, make sure they are all properly labeled.

, On the figures that have significant differences between groups, you want to indicate that directly on the figure. Draw a line between the two groups that are significantly different and place an asterisk above the line.


Make sure the figure legend explains what the asterisk means, what statistical test was used, and what the actual p-value of the test was.

, If you have multiple graphs of data that are similar, group them together into one figure. It will help you understand the data if you can look at all of the similar data at the same time. It is easier to see trends and draw conclusions about your data.


Many programs have graph editors that also allow you to make layouts of multiple graphs.
Make sure all of the graphs have the same font sizes and use the same symbols between datasets.

, The figure legend allows anyone looking at your data to understand what exactly is being presented in the graph. The legend should tell the reader how many replicates are within each group and what statistical tests were used to analyze the data.Details about the statistics should be included in the legend as well: z-scores, t-scores, p-values, degrees of freedom, etc.

Figure out what question you want answered.,
Secure funding if needed.,
Pick your team.,
Find a location.,
Locate a guide if possible.,
Think up questions for interview.,
Select interviewees.,
Conduct interviews.,
Complete your analysis.,
Bring it all together.",How to Conduct an Ethnography," This is the most important step when conducting an ethnography. You need to make sure that your question, or research findings, can be applied to more than one community. You also need to make sure that by answering your question, someone will benefit from the knowledge. Basically, for whom is this research for, and how will they benefit from this research? An example of this would be: how does working with your family effect efficiency in the workplace in the United States?;
, Doing qualitative research can be very costly so it would be helpful if you were able to get funding from a university or other research firms by the means of a grant. A grant is money given to a group of people for the sole purpose of research. The grant could be used for airfare, transportation, food or an archaeological dig to name a few examples.

, In most cases, you will be working with different people to better understand the community that you are studying. When picking team members, it is important to pick people who work well with people, since anthropology is the study of people. It is also important to remember to pick people who show passion towards your chosen topic.

, Even though this question will probably be answered in the first step, it is important to narrow down where you want to conduct your research. You need to look at what cities/villages you want to target and stick to those places. You also need to think about why you have chosen these cities/villages, and what the significance of interviewing people from these places is.

, It is difficult to be in a new place, and to be seen as an outsider. This is precisely why it is so important to contact someone who lives in the city/village that you are going to study. They will be able to take you to the ""prime"" locations for interviews, and will also be able to help with language barriers if there are any.

, It is important to always link each question back to the overall research question. It is also important to make a list of questions, and stick to that list throughout the whole interview process. Changing questions to fit the answers of some interviewees can lead to bias in the data. The research process should be made as scientific as possible, therefore we need the questions to be kept as constants. Some examples of questions would be: How long have you been working with said family member? What members of your family do you work with? How is your relationship with that family member?

, When selecting interviewees, you have to keep in mind the biases that the person may have.For that reason, it would be wise to interview different people with different situations (example: different genders, ages, socio-economic status, religion, etc.) By doing this, you will be getting a wider range of answers. It should also be noted that there is no set number of people that you should interview, usually anthropologists say that they interview people until they stop hearing new things, or if the people they are interviewing all start giving the same information.

, This is where you will be collecting all the data for your research. It is critical to remember to be culturally sensitive to all those that you interview. Some tips for interviewing would be to have a recorder and record all that is happening. Another thing would be to take notes of your immediate surroundings and of the person you are interviewing.

, After getting all the data, it is time to sit down and analyze what you have. Again, it is important to take your data and tie it back to your overall ""big picture"" question. Even if your data shows the opposite of what you thought or predicted, it is your responsibility to present all the data in an unbiased manner.

, Now is the time that you take all of your findings and putting it together. When writing an ethnography, it is important to keep all of your field notes handy. You will want to write down everything that you saw, that you felt, how it impacted you or the people you were surrounded by. It is also important to present to data in a way that can be understood by many.

Prepare the final draft.",How to Conduct Academic Research," In some classes, students are told to find a topic; this means the exercise is for the purpose of learning the research process. In other situations, the required topic is clearly indicated from the class, your own work, or your professional needs. Your topic can be aroused from a sense of curiosity, hunch and interest over a particular perceived problem that you feel needed to be filled in the gap of knowledge.;
,


Primary research means doing original research, meaning that this knowledge doesn't appear in any other paper. You might be reading through original treaties, newspaper articles, or authentic letters from authors or statesmen. You might be conducting scientific, medical or engineering experiments.
Secondary research, the focus of this wikiHow article, means reading other experts' published papers to learn something new about your topic, to survey what others have said and written about it, to reach a conclusion about your ideas on the topic.

, Any academic research should lead to a written report (""research paper"") which may be a class assignment, a work task, or even a published article. Determine in advance how much total time you have for this work, and make a rough work schedule.


A work schedule must include the following major steps: 1. Finding and reading sources. 2. Collecting notes from sources. 3. Preparing a rough draft. 4. Revising the draft and incorporating source material and citations. 5. Preparing a final draft in the required format (MLA, APA, Turabian, etc.)
The research scope means knowing how much of your broad subject you will deal with. Since you probably aren't writing a book or dissertation (100 or more pages), you must limit your reading and study to a particular focused aspect of the subject. This requires thinking about what specifically you want to cover. your academic research scope should not be too broad (in that it covered more than the required areas) and not too narrow (in that it does not meet the substantial requirement of a research scope).

, This is a question that will guide you in your reading. It will turn into a thesis statement later. This question reminds you of what you want to find and read, what you are considering. It is not about a fact (""When did the French first arrive in Britain?""-- 1066 AD), but about an idea or opinion (""What did the French arrival in Britain do to the structure of the existing legal system?). The research questions should written in a way that will be represented in your hypothesis. It should be the basis in which your hypothesis stands.

, This is the heart of doing research. With the internet, there is more useful (and useless) information available than ever in the history of human inquiry. There is also plenty of material NOT available on the internet.


You might be required to use a certain number and type of resource. These could include: books, magazines or journals, encyclopedias (probably not Wikipedia), reference books, newspapers, letters, interviews, blogs, etc.
You might need an academic (school or university) library. They do contain information and sources not generally or easily available on the internet, and reference librarians who can help you. Find your nearest library and determine how to get access privileges.

, Begin locating material to read: chapters, paragraphs, sections, sentences that cover your topic. Remember that you can't read everything on the topic. You also can't include every word you read in your paper. This is background reading for you to learn about your question.

, Focus on your research question and find information that illuminates it, explains, describes, analyzes, contrasts, or gives expert opinion and viewpoints on it. You are seeking to form your own judgment, based on what you read from your sources.

, This is more than merely copying, highlighting, or cutting/pasting. If you do only this, you will end up with a pile of bits and pieces, and will still have to wade through them to find useful, relevant, and specific quotes.



Take notes of these: 1. facts that are not common knowledge. 2. quotes from experts that state a concept in a unique, unusual, or startling way. 3. summaries of longer explanations.
Learn the difference between a direct quote, paraphrase, and summary.
Be sure to mark exactly where the note came from in your source. You must know the exact location: author, title, magazine, book, internet page URL, date, volume number, etc.
Arrange your notes into groups according to their content, for later organization into sections of your paper.

, While you are reading, you might find new information, or questions on a topic that you need to read up on. You might have to broaden your research to check on details, possible errors, corroborating or conflicting evidence, the context of an article, expert, or paper.

, See: How to Evaluate Sources. Your source must be credible in terms of the author, location of publication, date, publisher, etc.

, This is what you will analyze in your paper. Your source material must help you establish your thesis (statement of opinion or belief) on that topic. If necessary after reading a lot, you might change your question to fit what you are actually finding. Or you might change your opinion after doing your reading.

, This is a single statement of your viewpoint on your research question. See: How to formulate a thesis.

, This is when you start writing what you have learned, what you feel about your topic and thesis. Write what you have learned. First give the background and set the context for this topic. Then start explaining, describing, give reasons, state causes or effects, or analyzing parts of the topic.


Some university papers require a first section on ""literature review"". This is a special section where you discuss what papers other experts have published on this topic.

, These should be added into your paragraphs where they will highlight or help explain what you are saying. Be sure to introduce sourced materials in the correct way (see a standard writing handbook), and mark where your citation will be.


Note all material taken from sources must be cited. Depending on what system you use, your (in text) citation will contain a name, date, or page number. This notation will refer to the list at the end of the paper of References or Works Cited.

, This writing process follows all similar academic writing steps.


Revising means checking the content of your paper, and making sure the thesis is developed, the content matches your thesis, there is enough material, it is in a logical order, nothing off topic is included, and the writing flows smoothly.
Editing means checking the writing details such as paragraph breaks, sentence structure, punctuation, spelling, and citation formats.

, Strictly follow the format you are using, by checking with its handbook or style book. This includes: title page, page setup and numeration, in text citations, reference list, inclusion of visuals, sections and titles, etc.

Refer to the graph in your text.,
Place the caption underneath the graph.,
Provide a brief description of the graph.,
List the author's name.,
Provide the title of the book or other resource.,
Include the book's location, publisher, and year inside parentheses.,
Finish with a page number and the resource format.",How to Cite a Graph in a Paper1," When referring to a graph in your writing, use either ""figure X"" or ""fig.X"" in parentheses. Use the Arabic numeral, and don't capitalize either ""figure"" or the abbreviation ""fig.""For example, you might refer to a graph showing tomato consumption patterns this way: ""Due to the increasing popularity of salsa and ketchup, tomato consumption in the US has risen sharply in recent years (see fig. 1)."";
, A graph or chart from another source is first labeled as “Figure X,” though you may opt to abbreviate ""Figure"" to ""Fig."" You should capitalize ""Figure"" or ""Fig."" in the caption.


Figures should be numbered in the order they appear; your first graph or other illustration is ""Fig. 1,"" your second ""Fig. 2,"" and so on.
Do not italicize the word “Figure” or “Fig.” or the numeral.

, This description should provide a clear and concise explanation of what's shown in the graph.


For example, “Fig. 1. Rise in tomato consumption in the US, 1970-2000...”

, Note that in contrast to MLA bibliographic citations, you will begin with the author's first name: ""John Green"" instead of ""Green, John."" If the author is an institution, such as USDA, give the institution’s name instead. You need to add the words “Graph from” if the graph is not your original material.


“Fig. 1. Rise in tomato consumption in the US, 1970-2000. Graph from John Green...”

, The title should be formatted in italic text. Give the title directly after the comma following the author’s name: ""John Green, Growing Vegetables in Your Backyard,...""


You also italicize the title of a website, such as this: Graph from State Fact Sheets...


, Follow the model of location: publisher, year): for example, (Hot Springs: Lake Publishers, 2002). After the closing parenthesis, type another comma.


“Fig. 1. Rise in tomato consumption in the US, 1970-2000. Graph from John Green, Growing Vegetables in Your Backyard', (Hot Springs: Lake Publishers, 2002).

If the graph came from an online source, follow the MLA guidelines for citing an online source: give the website name, publisher, date of publication, media, date of access, and pagination (if any -- if not, type “n. pag.”).
For example, if your graph came from the USDA website, your citation would look like this: “Fig. 1. Rise in tomato consumption in the US, 1970-2000. Graph from State Fact Sheets. USDA. 1 Jan 2015. Web. 4 Feb. 2015. n. pag.”

, Type a period following the page number, then indicate this book's format (i.e. ""Print,"" ""eBook,"" etc.) Now you're done! Your complete citation should appear as follows:


Fig. 1. Rise in tomato consumption in the US, 1970-2000. Graph from John Green, Growing Vegetables in Your Garden, (Hot Springs: Lake Publishers, 2002), 43. Print.""If you give the complete citation information in the caption, you do not need to also include it in your Works Cited page.

Choose a simple template with high contrast between text and background, though preferably not a white background with black text, which can cause eye strain (and effectively blind people in a darkened presentation room).,
Avoid gradient backgrounds.,
Avoid the temptation to put your logo on every slide.,

, Notice how your reading speed accelerated when the last sentence switched to lowercase? There's no advantage in capitalizing beyond the first word in a sentence.

, After you've completed your presentation, select View > Master > Slide Master (command will vary per PowerPoint version; these directions are based on PowerPoint 2003). Depending on your template, you will probably see a <#> on the lower or upper right corner. Immediately after it, add a space and the words ""of x"" and replace x with the number of slides in your presentation, so your fifth slide will read ""5 of 23,"" for example. Depending on your version of PowerPoint, there are fields/macros that also perform this function.

, Add a closing slide, or at minimum a blank slide to end the show.

Identify your objectives.,
Set the parameters of your survey.,
Match your questions to your objectives.,
Understand the differences between open and closed questions.,
Remember to include demographic questions.,
Pay attention to question order.,
Ask everyone to contribute, if working in a group.,
Keep your survey short.,
Maintain careful records.",How to Conduct a Survey1," Before you begin to ask people questions, you need to understand why you are conducting your survey in the first place. Is it to complete a class assignment? Is it to get feedback on a particular product? Then, start to think about who you should talk with and what you should ask them to get at your larger goal.For example, your objective might be to determine how many people in your class will attend the school dance. This could be a relatively quick yes/no survey unless you want to add additional layers about motivation, dress, or other factors.;
, Decide when you will start and stop the surveying process. Determine how many people you want involved either as interviewers or data analysts. If this is a solo class project then that answer is easy! Formulate the instructions that you will include with your survey to guide respondents.With the instructions you may ask them to complete the survey in a certain time frame or perhaps only using pencil. There are many options here.
You may also want to craft a brief statement as to your intentions or goals with the study. This is particularly important if the survey is not face-to-face. You can make people more likely to trust you and respond if you let them know, for example, that this is part of a college project.

, This is one of the most critical steps. Now that you’ve identified your objectives, think about what kind of information you need to get in order to make your survey worthwhile. Would you be satisfied with simplistic, basic answers or are you interested in more elaborate narrative responses?If you are trying to get an indication as to a person’s feelings then an open-ended narrative response will be more helpful. However, if you need to quantify emotions then you may need to go with a ranking question. For example, “How angry are you about X? Choose from 1 to 10 (with 10 being the angriest).”

, Do you want to present your respondents with multiple answer options or just a single choice? Once you’ve made these decisions start to write out your questions and then narrow down the list to your final choices.


An open-ended question could be, “Tell me about your childhood.” A closed question would be, “Was your childhood happy? Answer yes or no.” The design of your survey can also limit the space allowed to answer open questions, limiting the length., If you intend to analyze the final responses while taking into account demographic categories, then you will need to formulate these questions as well. You do not have to ask about every category, so decide which ones relate the most closely to your overall objectives.


You might ask respondents about their income, marital status, sex, ethnicity, age, or race. Many of these questions will be formatted as lists in which the respondent will choose the appropriate option. For example, “Please circle your marital status: Single or Married.”

, You will generally want to start with the easier questions and work up to the more complex ones. This allows your respondents to grow comfortable with the survey process before they are asked to provide intimate or challenging information.You should generally place your demographic questions either at the very beginning or the very end of your survey. The danger of placing them at the end is that many respondents, if not asked in person, will skip this section.

, You may want to divide up the task of writing questions. Ask each of your group members to contribute a few and then work together to finalize the list. If everyone is focused on the same core objectives, this collaborative process should yield a more focused and precise set of questions., You’ll want to keep the total survey process somewhere around 5-10 minutes ideally. This is the total time that it should take a respondent to complete the survey. You will notice that your response rate will drop if your time commitment goes up. You can sometimes counter this by offering a gift., A researcher is only as good as their records. You will want to keep a detailed accounting of your methodology, the interview process, and the final results. Everything should be documented when possible. This process starts as soon as you begin brainstorming objectives and only ends when your results are presented.


For example, if you are working with a team of researchers it is important to know who conducted each interview, on what day, and other details. Keep documentation as to which questions were removed from the initial list and why."

Follow with author, date of publication, location, and publisher.,
End with copyright information for the graph if you plan to publish the paper.",How to Cite a Graph in a Paper2," You should not include any figure that you don’t mention in the text.Always refer to the figure by its number, not wording such as “the figure above” or “the figure below.”


For example, you could write: “As seen in Figure 1, tomato consumption has risen sharply in the past three decades.”, Label the graph or chart “Figure X.” Italicize this part.Figures should be numbered in the order they appear; your first graph or other illustration is Figure 1, the second is Figure 2, etc.
If the graph has an existing title, give it in “sentence case.” This means you only capitalize the first letter of the first word in the sentence, as well as the first letter after a colon.

, This description, or legend, provides your reader with information regarding the graph's content. Make sure you give enough information that the caption describes the figure adequately. In APA, this description ends with a period.


For example: Figure 1. Rise in tomato consumption,1970-2000.
Use sentence case for the description too.

, In most cases, you will begin this information with the words ""Reprinted from...""This will signal to your reader that the graph is not original to your work, but rather comes from a different source.


If the graph you’re presenting is your original work, meaning you collected all the data and compiled it yourself, you don’t need this phrase.
For example: Figure 1. Rise in tomato consumption,1970-2000. Reprinted from...

, Place book titles in italics, and cite the relevant page number in parentheses immediately following the title with no punctuation in between. Use title case for books and journal titles, meaning you capitalize all the major words in the title.For example: Figure 1. Rise in tomato consumption,1970-2000. Reprinted from Growing Vegetables in Your Backyard (p. 43),

, This information should follow the format of ""by first initial(s) last name, date, location: publisher."" For example, ""J. Green, 2002, Hot Springs: Lake Publishers.""


For example: Figure 1. Rise in tomato consumption,1970-2000. Reprinted from Growing Vegetables in Your Backyard (p. 43), by J. Green, 2002, Hot Springs: Lake Publishers.

, For example, if rights to the graph in question are held by the American Tomato Growers' Association, you'll need to contact this organization for permission to use the graph. Then, state in your caption that the graph is ""Copyright 2002 by the American Tomato Growers' Association. Reprinted with permission."" Your complete citation, then, will read:

Provide the right amount of information.,
Break complex slides down into several simple slides.,
Include audiovisual support only as needed.Your PowerPoint slideshow should always be designed to reinforce your verbal explanations with visual images.",How to Choose the Right Number of Slides for a Powerpoint Presentation1," PowerPoint presentations are useful to provide an overview, a general description of a given topic. Your presentation should not be encyclopedic. Don’t go overboard including every little detail, citation, or factoid which may inform the conversation on the issue you’re presenting. Too much information will burn your audience out and you’ll be left with a bunch of people more interested in lunch than in what you have to say.Keep the presentation about you, not the slideshow.The slides are there to support what you have to say. They should be just one part of your presentation, not the whole thing.;
, PowerPoint presentations are at their most effective and powerful when they adopt a clean, minimalistic style.For instance, if you have one slide whose heading is “Habitats,” with three bullet points beneath reading “Forest,” “Desert,” and “Ocean” with a description of each habitat following, you would do well to instead allocate three separate slides to the three different habitats, and include a summary and image of each on the appropriate slide.

, Sometimes it works to put words on a screen, but generally, your text should be limited. Do you need the graphics as a starting point from which you will explain results, trends, predictions or specific outcomes? Are you using visuals merely to keep your audience engaged, to provide humor, and/or to accommodate diverse learning styles? These and other relevant questions should guide your decision-making process when settling on the right number of slides for your presentation.


Go through your entire presentation and ask yourself if you really need a given slide. If the answer is no, or if you find you can deliver the info verbally instead, eliminate it.

Create an incentive.,
Do a trial run.,
Contact respondents face-to-face.,
Use an online survey program.,
Tally the results.",How to Conduct a Survey2," You are more likely to get quality responses if you include some sort of reward into the process or upon submission of the survey. Consider using a raffle entry, a public announcement of thanks, a promotional product or even something more substantial like a gift card., Before you send out your interviewers or mail off your surveys, conduct a small, local trial-run perhaps just on family and friends. Let them take your survey and then ask them for feedback about the questions, the process on the whole, or anything else. Revise your survey based on their responses, if necessary, before sending it out.You can also use this as an opportunity to see if the kind of data and responses that you are receiving are the ones that you want. Do these responses answer your central problem or question?

, This is one of the best ways to conduct surveys as it yields a high response level and the quality of responses is often good. You establish a particular list of contacts that you would like to approach or you can take a “random walk” approach and spontaneously approach people until you’ve reached your target sample number.If you are in a class setting and need to conduct a quick survey you can walk around with a sheet of paper and ask your respondents to simply place a “tally mark” by their choice within a table.Be aware that face-to-face interviews are often seen as more personal and they can sometimes be a bit awkward when dealing with sensitive information. Your respondents may shield or edit their answers more as well., This is one of the new breakthroughs in survey methodology. You can direct your respondents to one of the many websites available where you can set up a detailed survey for them to complete. Survey Monkey, Dot Survey, and Key Survey are just a few of your options.Many of these sites let you create a basic survey for free. They may charge for repeated or more detailed surveys involving larger participant numbers. But, it remains a low-cost survey method.
The sites may also help you to analyze your data as well.

, After you’ve completed the survey, look over data and decide how to report it. Perhaps you would like to create a table or graph showing the information. Or, maybe a chart listing the statistics would be more helpful. If you are in a business setting you may be asked to complete and present a formal report."
"
Decide on sample size.,
Get review board clearance.,
Pursue funding.,
Contact respondents via email.,
Contact respondents via the post.,
Contact respondents via the phone.,
Choose a research firm to survey for you.,
Monitor your interviewers.,
Adhere to federal and state regulations.,
Prepare your findings for professional review.",How to Conduct a Survey3," You will need to figure out how many respondents you need and how to keep the process as free of selection bias as possible. It is generally best to go with random selections of participants or an all-inclusive approach based on demographics.For example, Pew Research limits their international interviews to 1,000 persons per country. This may seem like a small number but it allows them to cover more countries.Be realistic about how many people you can feasibly interview or survey in your given time period and with your available resources. Good data does not necessarily mean more surveys.

, If you are operating out of a university or business setting, you may need to approach your institutional review board (IRB) and have them sign off on your research. This is generally the case because survey research requires interaction with human subjects. During the IRB review process you will need to provide as much information as possible about your survey objectives and methodology., Don’t forget to factor in the cost of your survey, if going beyond the classroom and gathering scientific data. You can submit a grant application to funding agencies at the local, state, or federal levels. You can also approach field-specific organizations. To get an idea as to cost a phone survey, for example, can cost up to $40 per contact., This is one of the most preferred ways of communicating now, so it makes sense as a survey delivery option. It is quick and generally cheap to do, even if you need to purchase an email list. You can generally reach a particular target audience and ask them to complete the survey within the email or direct them to another site. The downside is that it is very easy for respondents to delete emails., This is an old-fashioned, but still used, method of survey contact. You will mail out your questionnaires to your survey sample addresses. This method allows you to cover a wide geographical range and it is also a friendly method for older respondents who are less comfortable using email and the like. However, be prepared to pay more and expect a lagging response time., With telephone surveys you will want to navigate the balance between cell phones and landlines. Which ones will you contact? You’ll also want to figure out how to get the numbers, perhaps by purchasing a calling list.Telephone surveys are one of the cheaper methods, but they also generally yield high refusal rates as people often feel inconvenienced., You can find a research firm near to you by searching your city name and “research firm.” Depending on your budget, you may want to hire a group to ask your questions for you. Or, you can even hire them to write the questions as well. This is one option if you need a professionally created survey with a quick turnaround time.Review all of the policies of the company that you hire to make sure that they have privacy practices in place. You also may want a confidentiality agreement in order to protect the process and final results., Fieldwork can be challenging but to get the best data you must use trained, professionals to administer your surveys. Asking interviewers to log information about their contacts, such as the time of the interview, is one way to keep track of what is happening in the field.Be aware that some survey researchers may need additional training in counseling if they are going to ask personal questions that my elicit a strong emotional response., Make sure to do your research regarding applicable laws before you make your survey public. This is especially the case if you will be contacting persons “cold” and without their prior knowledge or consent. There are generally age limits for contact, time limits, as well as limits pertaining to particular contact methods.


For example, some laws prevent researchers from using auto dial to make phone calls., The way that you handle your final results is likely to be very field-specific. Some fields, such as sociology, provide venues for journal publication, conference presentations, and lectures. Whatever your approach, after you’ve analyzed your data, look for a way to share your findings with the broader academic (and maybe even public) world.

Practice your presentation in front of a mirror or a small audience of friends and family before you do it for real.,
Think about the speed at which you speak.,
Do not use too many slides.,
Do not use too few slides.If you have a lot of info which would be of use in your PowerPoint, or have graphs, tables, or images available that could improve your presentation, use them.",How to Choose the Right Number of Slides for a Powerpoint Presentation2," If, during your practice run, you find that your time has elapsed before you could get through your whole presentation, you’ll know that your presentation has too many slides.Head back to the drawing board to edit it accordingly.


If your presentation ended well before the time limit you’ve been given, try to extend the amount of time you spend on each slide, or add extra slides to expand on the info introduced in the presentation.
Solicit advice from family and friends during your practice presentation. If they feel there are too many or too few slides, or if they feel certain sections of the presentation felt rushed or slow, adjust your presentation to correct these deficiencies.

, If you speak quite quickly, you will be able to get through a great number of slides. If, on the other hand, you speak more slowly, you’ll probably require a smaller number of slides. Use your rate of speech to determine how many slides your presentation can accommodate.

, If you have ten minutes to present, you might need upwards of 60 slides. On the other hand, you might also need just ten slides. Whatever number you settle on, do not include more slides than you can get through in your allotted presentation time.

, While you don’t want to include so many slides that you can’t get through them all in the allotted time, neither should you feel constrained to the point that you don’t include valuable information or graphics in your slideshow.

"
"
Don’t listen to the experts.,
Match the number of slides to the subject matter.Some topics require a few slides and a lot of exposition.,
Tailor your slideshow to your audience.If you're presenting highly detailed or technical information to a group of people who are very familiar with the industry terms and metrics that you're presenting, you might include a lot of slides that you move through rather quickly, but which are necessary to provide supporting material and demonstrate that you know what you’re talking about.,
Think about the venue you’re presenting in.If you’re presenting in a large venue like an auditorium but you only have a small projection screen for your PowerPoint slides, you should minimize the importance and number of your slides and focus instead on the spoken aspect of your presentation.",How to Choose the Right Number of Slides for a Powerpoint Presentation3," Everyone seems to have their own idea of how many slides is enough.Some people think five slides is enough for thirty minutes,others think ten is enough for twenty minutes, and still others think ninety or more could be right for twenty minutes. In fact, each presentation is different, and needs to be approached on its own merits.


One well-known formulation for PowerPoint presentations is the 10/20/30 rule. This rule dictates that you should use about ten slides for a twenty minute presentation, and each slide should utilize thirty point font. In other words, each slide should be about two minutes in length.Perhaps the 10/20/30 rule works for you. If it does not, don’t feel as if you’re using the wrong number of slides.
Others argue that an average slide should be onscreen for no more than two minutes, and can be onscreen for as little as 15 seconds., Other topics require many slides with only minimal explanation. For example, if your presentation is on a particular product or a single beautiful landscape, then many slides containing photographs may be more effective than a few slides featuring text. Think about how you can combine a number of text-based slides into a few image-based slides with some accompanying text, and vice versa.

, If you’re presenting the same data to a high-school business class, you might need to condense the slides you’re presenting and edit the presentation so that you can explain each concept in language which the layman will understand.

, Similarly, if you’re presenting outside or in a brightly-lit environment, you might want to consider keeping the number of slides in your presentation to a minimum since they might be too hard to see in the glare.


If, on the other hand, you’re in a more intimate environment and can control the lighting, you might be inclined to utilize a greater number of slides. As always, however, don’t feel obligated to use many slides just because you can.

Ask indirect questions to limit bias.,
Craft open-ended questions.,
Maintain a neutral stance.,
Avoid implying that there is a right answer.",How to Avoid Bias in Qualitative Research2," If your research methods include interviewing participants, it is important to acknowledge that the participant’s own answers may be inaccurate. People often structure responses that will make them seem more likable, and they may be less inclined to give a truthful answer on controversial topics. Combat this by asking indirect questions and asking them to think about what a third party would do in a particular situation.If you are interviewing a coworker or a colleague, avoid asking directly if they are unhappy in their current job. Reframe the question so that it is not as direct. “What do most of your coworkers think about the management in your office?”This indirect question about a third party can foster a honest response from the participant.

, Asking participants open-ended questions will allow you to gain a better understanding of the scope of your research topic. These types of questions allow additional information to flow freely, which may reveal emotional responses and attitudes toward the topic that you may not have considered before.Include these types of questions in your survey, questionnaire, or interview to collect more meaningful data.


Don’t ask a participant a close-ended question that they can answer simply. Instead of asking someone who they voted for in the last election, ask them to describe how they felt about each candidate.
If you are trying to gauge if a new workflow process in your office is helpful, ask employees how the process has influenced their work. “How has this process helped or hindered your workflow?” This question will reveal more than simply asking whether or not they like the new process.

, Maintain a neutral and impartial stance on everything from the subject matter to the sponsor of the study. If a participant can sense that you or other researchers feel a certain way, they may tailor their answers to conform to your expectations. Or, if a particular company or institution is sponsoring the study, a participant may be influenced by the sponsor’s reputation, mission statement, or overall impact in an industry.


Try to remove any trace of the sponsor from the interview or observation, and do not express your own personal feelings or opinions.Do not add your company’s logo or your school’s seal on materials provided to the participants.
If a person is being polled on how they feel about the efficiency of a particular school, for example, they may provide a biased answer if they suspect or know if that institution is performing the research. If you are collecting opinions regarding the admissions process from current students, do not let the participants know if you work in the admissions office or sit on the admissions committee.

, Acquiescence bias describes someone’s inclination to be positive and agreeable to avoid conflict. It is also an easier response since it takes less effort to agree and move on than to provide thorough, truthful feedback.To prompt meaningful responses, avoid developing questions that ask someone to agree or disagree, and remove any yes or no and true or false questions from an interview or a survey.Instead of asking a respondent to agree or disagree in a customer satisfaction survey, ask item-specific questions.Form a more direct question instead of asking a participant to respond to the statement, “My experience in the store was satisfactory. Agree or disagree.” Ask a participant, “How was your overall shopping experience at this store? Excellent, good, fair, or bad.”

Be aware of confirmation bias.,
Consider every response.,
Collate and sort the data.,
Ask an outsider to review your work at various stages during the study.",How to Avoid Bias in Qualitative Research3," Confirmation bias occurs when a researcher interprets evidence or data in such a way that supports their hypothesis or expectations. It is important to be aware of this form of bias to ensure that it does not influence your research, methods, or conclusion. Confirmation bias can influence a wide range of academic research and everyday situations from medical studies to elections to judiciary proceedings.During an election, supporters of a particular candidate may only seek out new sources that showcase their chosen candidate in a positive light. This is confirmation bias. This can affect how you perceive a candidate and can influence your decisions., While you are conducting your research, you will collect a lot of data, and some may not seem helpful at the time. Regardless, all data should be collated throughout the collection process and evaluated equally. Only collecting data that is perceived as meaningful will skew your interpretations and conclusions. In addition, you might miss out on meaningful patterns or themes that could inform your conclusion., Once you have collected your data, it should be organized and recorded. Transcribe interviews into a word processing system, record numerical data or survey questions onto a spreadsheet, or enter data into an online database or program. Organize information into various categories to make it easier to sort and study fairly.


Sort data into categories that make sense for your project. List it by observation type, by date, by location, or by participant background information., A fellow researcher, mentor, or colleague who is not familiar with the study can read through your report objectively and find signs of bias that you may not have noticed. Some level of bias can present itself in all levels of research, and the study authors may not be able to recognize it.Before collecting data, ask a colleague to review your methods section to look for questions or approaches that may lead to biased data.
When you have written your final report, ask another mentor or researcher to review the results and the conclusions to look for signs of bias.

Ask yourself important questions.,
Pick something you love.,
Stay original.,
Get advice.,
Don’t be afraid to change your topic.",How to Write a Research Paper1," Although you may be limited by specific classroom or work related guidelines, choosing your topic is the first and most important step in your research paper project. Regardless of whether your topic can be anything you want or has rigid requirements, it is important to keep a few questions in mind: Is there enough research available on this topic? Is the topic new and unique enough that I can offer fresh opinions? Is it pertinent to my class/occupation?;
, Whenever possible, choose a topic that you feel passionate about. Writing about something you enjoy certainly shows in the final product, making it more likely that you will be successful writing a paper about something you enjoy.

, If you are writing a research paper for a class, consider the other students. Is it likely that they will also be writing about your topic? How can you keep your paper unique and interesting if everyone is writing about the same thing?

, If you are struggling to come up with a topic that feels “just right,” ask your professor or coworkers/classmates for advice. They will likely have great ideas that, even if they aren’t options for you to choose, can inspire you with new ideas. Asking a professor for help may seem frightening, but if they are worth anything as a professor, they want you to be successful with your work, and will do what they can to make that happen.

, If you choose a topic, begin researching, and realize that it isn’t the right decision for you for some reason, don’t fret! Although it requires a bit more time, you have the ability to change your topic even after you begin researching others.

Think of a good title to catch the reader's attention, but not a too long or too short one!",How to Write a Term Paper," Try to make it as creative as possible; if you're given the opportunity to choose your own, take advantage of this. Choose something you're particularly interested in because this will make it easier to write; in particular, try to select the topic as a result of pressing questions you already know you want to search for answers to. Once you've decided on a topic, be sure to hone down it to a do-able topic; often a topic is initially too broad in its coverage, which will make it impossible to complete within the time and space constraints given. Narrow down your topic to something that can really be worked within the boundaries of the paper. If the topic is already chosen for you, start exploring unique angles that can set your content and information apart from the more obvious approaches many others will probably take. Finally, whatever angle your topic takes, it should be both original in approach and insightful, something the reader will be drawn into and fascinated by.


Take great care not to choose a topic and be so set on how you see the outcome of your paper that you're closed to new ideas and avenues of thinking as you work through the paper. This is known in academia as ""premature cognitive commitment"". It can mar an otherwise good paper because an outcome that is pre-determined in your head, regardless of the research findings along the way, will be molded to fit the outcome, rather than the outcome reflecting a genuine analysis of the discoveries made. Instead, ask continuous questions about the topic at each stage of your research and writing and see the topic in terms of a ""hypothesis"" rather than as a conclusion. In this way, you'll be prepared to be challenged and to even have your opinion changed as you work through the paper.
Reading other people's comments, opinions and entries on a topic can often help you to refine your own, especially where they comment that ""further research"" is required or where they posit challenging questions but leave them unanswered.
For some more help, see How to establish a research topic.

, It's pointless to launch into writing before you've done the research. You need to understand the background to the topic and the current thinking, as well as finding out what future research is considered necessary in the area. While it may be tempting to rehash information you already know really well, avoid doing this or you learn nothing from the research and writing process. Go into research with a sense of adventure and an openness to learning things you've yet to grasp, as well as being ready to discover new ways of looking at old problems. When researching, use both primary (original text, document, legal case, interviews, experiment, etc.) and secondary (other people's interpretations and explanations of the primary source) sources. There is also a place for discussing with like-minded students and even finding online discussions about the topic if you feel comfortable doing this but these discussions are for idea-sharing and helping you to gel your ideas and are not usually quotable sources. For more information, here are some helpful resources to check out:



How to research a paper.

How to take notes, How to take better notes, How to take notes from a textbook, How to take notes on a book and How to take Cornell notes.

, After you've done the research, reflect back over the chosen topic. At this point, it's essential to pinpoint the single, strong idea you'll be discussing, your assertion that you believe you can defend throughout the paper and that makes it clear to a reader what they're about to learn about and be given a sound conclusion on. Your thesis statement is the spine of your essay, the idea that you'll go on to defend in the paragraphs that follow. Serve it up half-baked and the remainder of the paper is bound to be flavorless. Construct a thesis that your research has proven is interesting to you – that way, backing it up won't be such a bore. Once you're satisfied that your topic is sound and clarified, proceed to writing your first draft.


Remember that the research doesn't stop here. And nor does the thesis statement, necessarily. Allow room for flexibility as you continue working through both the research and the writing, as you may wish to make changes that align with the ideas forming in your mind and the discoveries you continue to unearth. On the other hand, do be careful not to be a continuous seeker who never alights upon a single idea for fear of confinement. At some point you are going to have to say: ""Enough is enough to make my point here!"" If you're so taken with a topic, there is always the possibility of postgraduate study some day but remember that the term paper has a finite word length and due date!

, Some people can work on a term paper skipping this step; they're a rare and often time-pressed breed. It is far better to have an outline sketched out so that you know where you're headed, just as a road map helps you to know where you're going from A to B. Like the entire paper, the outline is not set in stone but subject to changes. However, it does give you a sense of structure and a framework to fall back on when you lose your way mid paper and it also serves as the skeleton of your paper, and the rest is just filling in the details. There are different approaches to developing an outline and you may even have your own personal, preferred method. As a general guidance, some of the basic elements of an outline should include:


Introduction, discussion paragraphs/sections and conclusion or summary.
Descriptive or explanatory paragraphs following the introduction, setting the background or theme.
Analysis and argument paragraphs/sections. Using your research, write out the main idea for each body paragraph.
Any outstanding questions or points you're not yet sure about.
See How to write an outline for more details.

, The introductory paragraph is challenging but avoid turning it into a hurdle. Of all the paper, this is the part often most likely to be rewritten as you continue working through the paper and experience changes of direction, flow and outcome. As such, see it as simply a means of getting started and remind yourself that it's always revisable. This approach allows you the freedom to mess it up but rectify it as needed. Also use this as an opportunity to help yourself come to grips with the general organization of the term paper by explaining the breakdown, something the reader will also need to be aware of from the start. Try using HIT as the means for getting your introduction underway:



Hook the reader using a question or a quote. Or perhaps relate a curious anecdote that will eventually make absolute sense to the reader in the context of the thesis.

Introduce your topic. Be succinct, clear and straightforward.

Thesis statement. This should have been clarified already in the previous step.

Don't forget to define the words contained in the question! Words like ""globalization"" have many differing meanings and it's important to state which ones you'll be using as part of your introductory section.



, Make sure each paragraph supports your argument in a new way. Not sure your body's up to task? Try isolating the first sentence of each paragraph; together, they should read like a list of evidence that proves your thesis.


Try to relate the actual subject of the essay (say, Plato's Symposium) to a tangentially related issue you happen to know something about (say, the growing trend of free-wheeling hookups in frat parties). Slowly bring the paragraph around to your actual subject, and make a few generalizations about why this aspect of the book/subject is so fascinating and worthy of study (such as, how different the expectations for physical intimacy were then compared with now).

, Try using the ROCC method:



Restate your thesis statement.

One important detail which is usually found in your last paragraph.

Conclude – wrap it up.

Clincher – where you give the reader something left to think about.

, Using outside sources? Find out which citation style your instructor prefers, MLA or APA (or other style if you're not in the USA). Each has a precise notation system, so if you're unsure of the rules, check the manual (online versions are available at owl.English.Purdue.EU). Peppering quotes throughout your text is certainly a good way to help make your point, but don't overdo it and take care not to use so many quotes as the embodiment of your points that you're basically allowing other authors to make the point and write the paper for you.


Avoid cutting and pasting from other people's arguments. By all means use eminent thinkers in the field's thoughts to back up your own thinking but avoid saying nothing other than ""A says... B says..."". The reader wants to know what you say ultimately.
It's helpful to sort out your bibliography from the beginning, to avoid having a last minute scramble: How to write a bibliography, How to write an APA style bibliography and How to write a bibliography in MLA format.

, Space is at a premium in any graded paper, so finding ways to cull words is always a sensible approach. Are your sentences in good shape? Examine each one and decide whether you've used the fewest words possible while still retaining meaning.


Trade in weak ""to-be"" verbs for stronger ""action"" verbs. For example: ""I was writing my term paper"" becomes ""I wrote my term paper.""

, Running your spelling-checker is only the first step in proofreading your paper! A spell-check won't catch errors like ""how"" instead of ""show"", nor will it pick up on doubled words (""the the"") or grammar problems (unless you use MS Word, which can be configured to check grammar, and already catches double words). Little goofs like these aren't likely to impress the instructor – if you're too careless to proofread, after all, there's a good chance you didn't put much effort into your paper. Address the mess: ask a friend to read through your essay, marking any mistakes.


Decent grammar should be a given. You need a teacher to give you the benefit of the doubt, not correct your apostrophe use. A few too many errors and the message is soon lost beneath the irritation of the errors involved.

, For some essayists, a great title appears at the beginning of writing while for others, it only becomes apparent after slogging through the paper in its entirety. If you're still stuck, brainstorm with a friend or family member; you might be surprised how a fresh mind unacquainted with the topic can come up with a pithy title at a moment's notice!

Understand your objective.,
Develop considerate questions.,
Ask clear questions.,
Determine your audience.",How to Ask Survey Questions1," Make sure you know why you are asking questions in the survey. Having a firm grasp of this will help you make better questions. Without knowing your objective, your questions may seem aimless.Try to answer the questions: who, what, where, when and why for yourself. This may help you define your objective.
The objective is different from the topic. It answers: “What do I want to find out?”
For example: your topic might be a specific service, such as ""pizza delivery"", and your objective might be to find out what impacts tipping behaviors the most.;
, Make sure you research before you make your survey questions. This will help you to build insightful questions that are appropriate to your aims.If your survey questions are not well thought out, it may be more difficult for people to take your survey seriously.Look online and at your local library to see if people have researched and studied your topic in the past.
Think about what your concerns might be if you were taking your survey.
Talk to others beforehand to help you get an outside perspective.

, If you ask questions that are difficult to understand, your answers may be difficult to understand as well. Go to extra lengths to make sure your questions are easy to understand. Get help if you are unsure. Omit overly complicated language.


Cut out unnecessary words.
Shorten sentences.
Use basic vocabulary, avoiding overly technical language.Avoid leading questions, questions that prompt an answer, such as ""Wouldn't you agree that slow pizza delivery is tragic?"" These kinds of questions skew survey results.

, When you know to whom you're addressing your survey, it is easy to ask focused questions. What aspects of your topic will your audience be able to best respond to? Ask yourself relevant questions about your audience's concerns.


Research your demographic.
Avoid demographics that are least likely to give you good feedback. Adults without children are not good subjects for surveys on a child's enjoyment of a toy.
Avoid stereotyping.

Begin your research.,
Look for empirical research.,
Visit the library.,
Look online.,
Use academic databases.,
Get creative with your research.",How to Write a Research Paper2," With a topic selected, the next step is to begin research. Research comes in numerous forms including web pages, journal articles, books, encyclopedias, interviews, and blog posts, among others. Take time to look for professional resources who offer valid research and insight into your topic. Try to use a minimum of five sources to vary your information; never rely on only 1-2 sources., Whenever possible, look

for peer-reviewed empirical research. These are articles or books written by experts in your field of interest, whose work has been read and vouched for by other experts in the same field. These can be found in scientific journals or via an online search.

, Take a trip to your local library or university library. Although it may seem old fashioned, libraries are chock full of helpful research materials from books to newspapers and magazines to journals. Don’t be afraid to ask the librarian for help either - they are trained in research and know where everything about your topic is located.

, Using a search engine and picking the top three results isn’t necessarily the best method of researching; use critical thinking to thoroughly read every source and determine if it is legitimate. Websites, blogs, and forums online aren’t required to publish facts only, so make sure that the information you find is trustworthy.


Typically, websites that end with .edu, .gov, or .org contain information that is safe to use. That is because these websites belong to schools, the government, or organizations dealing with your topic.
Try changing your search query often to find different search results for your topic. If nothing seems to be coming up, it could just be that your search query isn’t matched well with the titles of most articles dealing with your subject.

, There are special search engines and academic databases available that search through thousands of peer-reviewed or scientifically published journals, magazines, and books. Although many of these require a paid membership to use, if you are a current student in college you have free access through your university’s membership.


Look for databases that cover your subject only. For example, PsycINFO is an academic database that holds nothing but works done by authors in the field of psychology and sociology. This will help you to get more tailored results than a very general search would.Most academic databases give you the ability to ask for very specific information by presenting multiple search query boxes as well as archives containing only a single type of resource (such as only journal articles or only newspapers). Take advantage of this ability to ask for specific information by using as many of the query boxes as you can.
Visit your school library and ask the librarian for a full list of the academic databases they subscribe to, as well as the passwords for each.

, If you find one really awesome book or journal that fits your topic perfectly, try looking in the works cited/bibliography/reference list at the end of it. This should contain many more books and journals that are about your topic as well.

Annotate your research.,
Organize your notes.,
Construct a preliminary bibliography/references page.,
Identify the goal of the paper.,
Determine your audience.,
Develop your thesis.,
Determine your main points.,
Consider formatting guidelines.,
Finalize your outline.",How to Write a Research Paper3," Once you’ve gathered all your research, print it out (if it is an online source) and gather post-its or anything you need to mark notes in the books/magazines you are using. This step is very important: read through your research, take notes on what you think is important, and highlight key facts and phrases. Write directly on copies you’ve made, or use slips of paper tucked into pages to mark places of importance.Do a thorough job annotating to make your outlining and paper-writing easier in the end. Make marks on anything that you think might be remotely important or that could be put to use in your paper.
As you mark off important pieces in the research, add your own commentary and notes explaining to yourself where you might use it in your paper. Writing down your ideas as you have them will make writing your paper much easier and give you something to refer back to.

, Annotating your research can take quite a bit of time, but needs to be taken one step further in order to add a bit more clarity for the outlining process. Organize your notes by collecting all of your highlighted phrases and ideas into categories based on topic. For example, if you are writing a paper analyzing a famous work of literature, you could organize your research into a list of notes on the characters, a list of references to certain points in the plot, a list of symbols the author presents, et cetera.


Try writing each quote or item that you marked onto an individual note card. That way, you can rearrange and lay out your cards however you would like.
Color code your notes to make it easier. Write down a list of all the notes you are using from each individual resource, and then highlight each category of information in a different color. For example, write everything from a particular book or journal on a single sheet of paper in order to consolidate the notes, and then everything that is related to characters highlight in green, everything related to the plot mark in orange, et cetera.

, As you go through your notes, mark down the author, page number, title, and publishing information for each resource. This will come in handy when you craft your bibliography or works cited page later in the game.

, Generally, speaking, there are two types of research paper: an argumentative research paper or an analytic research paper. Each requires a slightly different focus and writing style which should be identified prior to starting a rough draft.


An argumentative research paper takes a position on a contentious issue and argues for one point of view. The issue should be debatable with a logical counter argument.
An analytic research paper offers a fresh look at an important issue. The subject may not be controversial, but you must attempt to persuade your audience that your ideas have merit. This is not simply a regurgitation of ideas from your research, but an offering of your own unique ideas based off of what you have learned through research.

, Who would be reading this paper, should it be published? Although you want to write for your professor or other superior, it is important that the tone and focus of your paper reflect the audience who will be reading it. If you’re writing for academic peers, then the information you include should reflect the information you already know; you don’t need to explain basic ideas or theories. On the other hand, if you are writing for an audience who doesn’t know much about your subject, it will be important to include explanations and examples of more fundamental ideas and theories related to your research., The thesis statement is a 1-2 sentence statement at the beginning of your paper that states the main goal or argument of your paper. Although you can alter the wording of your thesis statement for the final draft later, coming up with the main goal of your essay must be done in the beginning. All of your body paragraphs and information will revolve around your thesis, so make sure that you are clear on what your thesis is.An easy way to develop your thesis is to make it into a question that your essay will answer. What is the primary question or hypothesis that you are going to go about proving in your paper? For example, your thesis question might be “how does cultural acceptance change the success of treatment for mental illness?” This can then determine what your thesis is - whatever your answer to the question is, is your thesis statement.
Your thesis should express the main idea of your paper without listing all of your reasons or outline your entire paper. It should be a simple statement, rather than a list of support; that’s what the rest of your paper is for!

, The body of your essay will revolve around the ideas that you judge to be most important. Go through your research and annotations to determine what points are the most pivotal in your argument or presentation of information. What ideas can you write whole paragraphs about? Which ideas to you have plenty of firm facts and research to back with evidence? Write your main points down on paper, and then organize the related research under each.


When you outline your main ideas, putting them in a specific order is important. Place your strongest points at the beginning and end of your essay, with more mediocre points placed in the middle or near the end of your essay.
A single main point doesn’t have to be kept to a single paragraph, especially if you are writing a relatively long research paper. Main ideas can be spread out over as many paragraphs as you deem necessary.

, Depending on your paper rubric, class guidelines, or formatting guidelines, you may have to organize your paper in a specific way. For example, when writing in APA format you must organize your paper by headings including the introduction, methods, results, and discussion. These guidelines will alter the way you craft your outline and final paper., With the aforementioned tips taken into consideration, organize your entire outline. Justify main points to the left, and indent subsections and notes from your research below each. The outline should be an overview of your entire paper in bullet points. Make sure to include in-text citations at the end of each point, so that you don’t have to constantly refer back to your research when writing your final paper.

"
"
Write your body paragraphs.,
Write the conclusion.,
Write the introduction.,
Document your paper.,
Edit your rough draft.,
Create the final draft.",How to Write a Research Paper4," Although it may seem counter-intuitive, writing your introduction first may be more difficult to accomplish than starting with the meat of your paper. Starting by writing the main points (focusing on supporting your thesis) allows you to slightly change and manipulate your ideas and commentary.


Support every statement you make with evidence. Because this is a research paper, there shouldn’t be any remarks that you make that cannot be supported by facts directly from your research.
Supply ample explanations for your research. The opposite of stating opinions without facts is stating facts with no commentary. Although you certainly want to present plenty of evidence, make sure that your paper is uniquely your own by adding commentary in whenever possible.
Avoid using many long, direct quotes. Although your paper is based on research, the point is for you to present your own ideas. Unless the quote you intend on using is absolutely necessary, try paraphrasing and analyzing it in your own words instead.
Use clear segues into adjacent points in your paper. Your essay should flow well, rather than stopping and starting in a blunt fashion. Make sure that each of your body paragraphs flows nicely into the one after it.

, Now that you have carefully worked through your evidence, write a conclusion that briefly summarizes your findings for the reader and provides a sense of closure. Start by briefly restating the thesis statement, then remind the reader of the points you covered over the course of the paper. Slowly zoom out of the topic as you write, ending on a broad note by emphasizing the larger implication of your findings.


The goal of the conclusion, in very simplified terms, is to answer the question, “So what?” Make sure the reader feels like (s)he’s come away with something.
It’s a good idea to write the conclusion before the introduction for several reasons. First of all, the conclusion is easier to write when the evidence is still fresh in your mind. On top of that, it’s recommended that you use up your most choice language in the conclusion and then re-word these ideas less strongly in the introduction, not the other way around; this will leave a more lasting impression on the reader.

, The introduction is, in many respects, the conclusion written in reverse: start by generally introducing the larger topic, then orient the reader in the area you’ve focused on, and finally, supply the thesis statement. Avoid repeating exact phrases that you already used in the conclusion.

, All research essays must be documented in certain ways in order to avoid plagiarism. Depending on the topic of your research and your field of study, you will have to use different styles of formatting. MLA, APA, and Chicago are the three most common citation formats and determine the way in-text citations or footnotes should be used, as well as the order of information in your paper.



MLA format is typically used for literary research papers and uses a ‘works cited’ page at the end. This format requires in-text citations.

APA format is used by researchers in the social sciences field, and requires in-text citations as well. It ends the paper with a “references” page, and may also have section headers between body paragraphs.

Chicago formatting is used mainly for historical research papers and uses footnotes at the bottom of each page rather than in-text citations and works cited or references page.

, Although it is tempting to simply read over your essay and use the spell-check tool, editing your paper should be a bit more in-depth. Have at least one, but preferably two or more, person/people look over your essay. Have them edit for basic grammatical and spelling errors as well as the persuasiveness of your essay and the flow and form of your paper.


If you edit your own paper, wait at least three days before returning to it. Studies show that your writing is still fresh in your mind for 2-3 days after finishing, and so you are more likely to skim over basic mistakes that you would otherwise catch.
Don’t ignore edits by others just because they require a bit more work. If they suggest that you rewrite a section of your paper, there is probably a valid reason for their request. Take the time to edit your paper thoroughly.

, When you have edited and re-edited your paper, formatted your work according to the subject matter, and finalized all the main points, you are ready to create the final draft. Go through your paper and fix all mistakes, rearranging information if necessary. Adjust the font, line spacing, and margins to meet the requirements set by your professor or profession. If necessary, create an introduction page and a works cited or references page to bookend your paper. The completion of these tasks finalizes your paper! Make sure to save the paper (in multiple places, for extra security) and print out your final draft.

Make it accessible.,
Give people enough time.,
Compensate participants where possible.,
Be courteous.,
Use a script.,
Smile.",How to Ask Survey Questions2," Be sure to have enough copies, or a reliable means to distribute the survey. Be sure that people can find it. If you place the survey somewhere obscure, people are not likely to find it. If you do not have enough copies, you might not get as much data as you could.


Try distributing the survey electronically, in email or on a website.
Have more copies of your survey than you think you will need if using hard-copies.
Electronic data may be cheaper and easier to analyze than hard-copies.

, Don't rush them. If you want people to give you accurate information, allow them enough time to think about it. The last thing you want is to miss out on important information because you made haste resulting in waste. Research suggests time pressure undermines performance., People are busy. People are apathetic. If you want them to take your survey, enabling you to ask your questions to them, you may need to compensate them. This need may vary depending on the subject. A survey of snack food preferences is maybe easier to administer than a survey of sexual preferences.


Offer a small sum of money.
Provide food.
Give out a coupon, voucher, or gift certificate.

, There's nothing like a thank you. There's little as persuasive as a genuine please. Make sure you treat the people taking your survey with courtesy. This will increase the likelihood they will do the same for you.

, When asking survey questions on the phone or in person, it will help you to have a script. This way, you won't confuse your participants or get confused yourself. Reading from your script will ensure that you ask each person the same question. This will in turn help to maintain the consistency of your results.


Be sure to speak slowly and to enunciate.
Repeat the question.

, Smiling will help people be more receptive to your questions. Even on the phone, a smile can be heard. Make sure you give your participants a smile, as this will help the experience be more pleasant for everyone.

Look into paying for a professional search.",How to Conduct a Patent Search," Patent searches can be incredibly complex and difficult to perform. If you do not feel comfortable taking on the task alone, or if you do not have the time or resources to do so, you can hire professionals to help you. The PTO recommends that you use only reputable agents and attorneys. The PTO offers a free search function where you can find qualified help. Use that resource to find professionals in your area.If you are looking to hire an attorney, make sure he or she is in good standing with your state bar by checking the state bar's website.


If you do not want to hire an attorney, you can look online for research companies. These companies make a living off of conducting patent searches for people. When you look for these companies, make sure you only contact the most reputable ones. To find these companies, do an internet search for ""reputable patent search companies"". There are a lot of scams in this area of business and you should be particularly wary of companies that guarantee results.
Before you hire a search company or attorney, make sure you ask about fees. The fees these professionals charge will relate to the complexity of your search. In general, fees range from about $500 to $1,500.Another sign of a scam is companies that offer services for a small fee (e.g., $50). Avoid these companies whenever possible.;
, PTRCs are PTO designated libraries with the resources necessary to help you conduct patent research. To find your local PTRC, visit the PTO website and search for PTRCs by state. While most states will have at least one PTRC, the physical library may be a ways away from where you live. If this is the case, you may have to hire help or conduct the search on your own.


If you have a PTRC close by, call the location and set up an appointment. When you call, ask about fees and whether the location is capable of helping you with what you need. Some locations will charge for their services and not every location can handle every patent question.
Once you have an appointment, make sure you prepare by conducting any preliminary research you think is necessary. The PTRC will only be able to help you if you know what types of questions to ask.
When you go to your appointment, a professional will help you conduct your search., Whether you are conducting your own patent search, hiring a professional, or using the PTRC, you should understand the process you are going to go through to find the information you need. While conducting your own research is difficult, it is not impossible. To help familiarize yourself with the PTO website, navigate through different parts of the website for a few hours on your own. Click through things, read articles, and review procedures. Keep detailed notes of what you did so you know how to recreate the results.


If you are going to get help with your patent search, you still need to be able to discuss your concerns intelligently. Therefore, it is important to know how to use the search system so you can help the people you hire.
Understand that patent searches will take weeks, if not months, if you are new to the process. Do not get discouraged and be sure to set aside enough time to complete the task., If you live in the United States, your first step will be to determine if someone has already filed a patent with the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). The PTO provides training in patent searches for people who haven't done it before.


There is a free video tutorial you can watch on the PTO website., Start the process by writing down a brief but specific description of your invention. In doing so, come up with a list of keywords and technical terms that might be used to describe it. Think about the following:The purpose of the invention, and whether it is a utilitarian device or an ornamental design
Whether the invention is a process (e.g. a way of making something or performing a function) or a product (i.e. a thing to be sold)
What the invention is made of
How the invention is used
Keywords and technical terms describe the nature of the invention. Consult a technical dictionary or thesaurus to help find the appropriate terms.
For example, if you've invented a silent drape-runner that will allow you to open and close drapes noiselessly, search terms might include ""drapes,"" ""drape runner,"" ""curtains,"" ""curtain rod,"" an so forth.

, Next, you'll visit www.uspto.gov to access patents that fall in the same classification schema (i.e. category of classes) as your invention. Use the search box in the upper right-hand corner and enter ""CPC scheme"" and a keyword for your invention.CPC scheme stands for ""cooperative patent classification scheme.""This search term basically tells the website that you are looking for a classification scheme that your invention might fall under.
For example, you might enter ""CPC scheme drape runner."" You might then scroll down the list and find ""furnishings for windows or doors."" This would be the classification schema for your invention.
If your results don't reflect the general type of product you have invented, try using one of the synonyms you came up with in the previous step.

, Clicking on a classification schema in your search results will take you to a list of classes of inventions, describing in general terms the features that distinguish these inventions from others in the general class. Pick the one that best describes your contribution.Make a note of the code number for your class. You'll use this for gathering patents of similar products.
For example, under ""furnishings for windows or doors,"" you find a variety of curtain suspension devices, and would look for the category that best described your new drape runners.

, If the class you think your invention might fit into is underlined, that means the PTO provides a class definition for this type of invention. Click on it and review.If the class definition doesn't match what you've created, go back and review other classes. That failing, refine your search terms and try again.
If there is no definition provided, continue with your search. If you're in the wrong class, you should be able to figure that out pretty quickly once you start looking at some of the patents.

, Now, use the dropdown menu under ""Quick Links"" on the PTO homepage and select ""PatFT"" (patent full text and image). You'll use this to gather all the patents in your invention's CPC class.In the ""term 1"" box, enter the CPC class code that corresponds to your invention.
In the ""field 1"" box, select ""Current CPC Classification.""
In the ""select years"" box, select ""1790 to present ."" Then, hit ""search.""

, You will now be looking at a results page that lists all patents in your class. These links will take you to the front pages of each patent, which briefly describe a patented invention. Review each one by clicking on the patent number.Within many results, you will see a red ""images"" button. This will allow you to a view PDF of the front page, which can be valuable since many will contain diagrams or images of the invention.
For any that look similar to your invention, note the number for closer evaluation.

, For those inventions you noted as being similar enough to yours to merit further examination, view the full patent, paying close attention to all diagrams and descriptions. Pay especially close attention to all legal claims made in these documents.You can view the full patents by clicking the ""full pages"" button, visible to the left of the front page.

, If you determine there are no patented inventions that match yours, your final step is to ensure that there are no applications that the PTO is currently reviewing that might. You'll do this in the same way you searched for existing patents in your class.


Use the same dropdown menu, but this time select AppFT (applications, full text). Enter your classification code, pick ""current CPC classification"" and search as far back as you can (which should be the year 2001).
Search these results in the same way you searched the approved patents. If you don't find anything that matches your invention, congratulations! You can apply for a US patent.

, If your PTO searches do not give you valuable results, try broadening your search. You will know if your searches are too narrow when you do not get any results. If this is the case, broaden your terms until you get results you can work with.This process will take time. Do not get frustrated and keep working.

, If there is any possibility you will want to patent or sell your invention overseas, you should also check to see if there are patents for an invention very similar to yours anywhere else in the world. The US PTO recommends starting with the European Patent Office.


Espacenet lets you search all of Europe for patents. On the left side of their website, you'll see a classification search option.Use this in conjunction with the key words you developed in Part 1 and begin your search again.
The classification search allows you to select a broad category of patents before beginning your search, such as ""textiles and paper."" This is optional but will help you narrow things down in advance and reduce irrelevant search results., If there are other nations that you consider it particularly likely you will wish to market your invention in, you may wish to consult the national patent offices of each. The US PTO provides links to several of these.For example, the PTO recommend the Global Patent Search Network (GPSN), which provides access to all Chinese language patents, translated into English.Generally speaking, you'll use the same search terms you did in searching for a US patent. Be aware, however, that not all nations provide patent documents in English, and the literal translation of your search terms may not apply in every culture. If you are seriously considering marketing your invention in a non-English speaking country, you may want to ask for help from a patent attorney, or at least consult with someone well versed in the language before conducting your search.

, There are other online tools that can be used to search for international patents. They can be used to identify potential patent conflicts you might find in other countries.


These services are not necessarily endorsed by the government of any nation, and thus may not yield perfect results.
Google Patents is a free service provided by Google that allows you to search full-text patent documents from around the world at no charge.The World Intellectual Property Organization also has a search tool called Patentscope that allows you to search patent documents from approximately 40 countries, though many of these are not available in English., To be certain that there are no patents that conflict with yours, you may wish to hire a professional to do an even more in-depth search. Many patent attorneys will take care of this for a fee as part of filing your patent application.


Provide your patent researcher with full details of your invention, and the description you created at the beginning of this process.
If you identified patents or applications that seemed similar enough to yours to merit concern, make sure to provide these patent numbers to your researcher so she or he can take a close look at these documents.
The PTO provides a list of certified patent attorneys and agents on their website.There are also other online services that you can pay to do a patent search on your behalf.

Deep clean the tiles once a month.,
Rinse and dry the deep-cleaned tiles.,
Remove stains as soon as you notice them.,
Avoid cleaning with abrasive materials.",How to Clean Outdoor Tiles1," Try to sweep your porcelain tiles every day or so. Use a soft, natural bristle broom or take a vacuum attachment and suck up the dirt. Regular sweeping will prevent your tiles from becoming caked with dirt and stained.


If your porcelain tiles lead up to an entryway for your house, you'll want to sweep them more often. This will prevent people from tracking dirt into your house.;
, Every few days (or whenever you notice a little dirt or grime building up) you should clean your outdoor porcelain tires with warm water. Fill a bucket with clean, warm water and mop the tiles. This will remove most of the dirt and keep the tiles looking their best.Try to wring most of the water out of the mop. You don't want excess moisture just sitting on the tiles.

, At least once a month, fill a large bucket with 2 gallons (7.6 litres) of clean water. Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of white vinegar and stir the mixture well. Submerge a mop into the cleanser and wring it out. Mop the floor with the cleaner to loosen any dirt.If you prefer, you can buy a commercial cleanser designed for porcelain tiles instead of using the vinegar mixture.

, Once you've scrubbed the floors with the vinegar mixture, submerge the mop into clean water and wring it out. Mop the floor with the water to rinse off the rest of the cleanser. Take a large clean towel or microfiber cloth and dry the tiles.If your porcelain tiles are really dirty, you may need to deep clean and rinse them a second time.
If your porcelain tiles cover a large space, consider mopping, rinsing, and drying small sections of the floor at a time.

, Try to remove any stains as soon as you notice them. Fill a 5-gallon (18.9-litre) bucket with water. Buy a commercial floor cleaner that's safe to use on porcelain and add 3 to 4 capfuls of the product to the water. Use a small brush or mop to scrub the mixture over the stain until it's removed.Avoid using an oil-based cleanser for stain removal on your porcelain tiles. These can leave an oily residue on the tiles which can make them slippery.

, While you might think that you need to scrub built on dirt with a rough brush, you should avoid anything that's abrasive to the porcelain. Avoid using abrasive cleaners like:Hard bristle brushes or steel wool
Cleaning products with ammonia or bleach
Oil-based detergents or wax cleansers

, For each one, extract whatever information you can about the primary sources used within the secondary/tertiary source and note it down. The specifics differ depending on the type of the secondary or tertiary source, but mostly, the information can be found as follows:


Look for bibliographic, references, or sources sections in most books, encyclopedias and other research papers. Usually all primary sources and citation sources are mentioned there. All you have to do is separate the citation sources from the general ones.
Look within the title or subtitle of interpretative, explanatory, and guide books and paper materials. Usually, a book about XYZ will have XYZ somewhere in the title. Look up this specific source in the bibliographic/references section.
Look within the body of the article for mentions of the primary sources in the case of magazines, newspapers, periodicals, handouts, and websites or web pages. This type of secondary or tertiary source is usually the hard one. In many cases, you won't find the source immediately and you will have to dig deeper. Sometimes, the source is not mentioned at all, in which case you should try one of the following:

Obtaining the primary sources from the author of the article in question:

From the publication, extract the name and contact information of the author (if possible).

If you couldn't obtain the contact information of the author from the article, look up the author in a directory service or online. Most authors have websites that provide contact information.
If you could not find a way to contact the author, follow the second method of obtaining primary sources below.


Contact the author asking for the primary sources. Use one communication method at a time, so as not to be confused with a spammer or a fan.
Discard the secondary or tertiary source. If it does not cite sources, its text is unverifiable.


Obtaining the primary sources from the publishing company, organization, or institute of the publication:

Obtain the contact information of the publisher from the publication.

Use directory services or online search if the contact information is not explicitly stated.


Contact the company asking for the primary sources of the article. State the title, the issue, the volume and any other information that identifies the article.




You might use the last method (obtaining sources from the publisher) in other cases, such as encyclopedia and other collective works.

, You can use a spreadsheet application or a handwritten list. You should fill out the following fields for each source:


Title. The title of the source.
Type. What type of documents is the source? Usually this is one of:

Works of art, architecture, literature, or music.
Magazine, newspaper, periodical, or an article in one of them.
Diary, journal or entry in a diary or journal
Letter
Proceedings (of meetings, conferences and symposia)
Records of organizations, governments, or agencies such as:

Deep clean your tiles twice a year.,
Avoid cleaning with abrasive materials.",How to Clean Outdoor Tiles2," Try to sweep your tiles every day or as soon as you notice dirt, leaves, or grime. Use a soft, natural bristle broom to remove the debris that's on the tiles. Regular sweeping will prevent your tiles from becoming caked with dirt or stained.

, Fill a 5-gallon (18.9-litre) bucket with water and a few squirts of mild dish soap. The water should be soapy and bubbly. Dip a mop into the soapy water and wring it out. Mop the tiles to until you've removed the dirt.You can use a string mop or sponge head mop. Just avoid using a scratchy or abrasive mop on the tiles.

, If you're cleaning a large space, take a garden hose and rinse the tiles with clean water to remove any soap residue. If you're cleaning a small area, you can dip the mop in clean water and wring it out. Mop over the tiles so they're rinsed with the clean water., As soon as you notice an oily stain, wipe up whatever caused it. Dip a sponge or soft cloth into soapy water and wash the stain. This might remove the stain on its own. If not, use a deck stain remover that's specifically made for wood or composite tiles. You'll need to follow the manufacturer's instructions.The longer the stain sits on the tile, the harder it will be to remove. That's why it's important to clean up the stain quickly.

, In addition to keeping your wood and composite tiles swept and clean, you should try to deep clean the tiles in the spring and fall. Buy a tile cleaner developed for wood or composite. It should contain sodium hypochlorite. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.Sodium hypochlorite will prevent mold and mildew from growing on your tiles.

, Your wood or composite tiles may become slightly scuffed over time. These scuffs may disappear on their own, so avoid trying to remove them with abrasive cleansers (like sand paper or pressure washers).If you place salt or ice on your tiles in the winter, clean it off as soon as the hazardous weather passes. Ice and salt can damage the tiles if they sit on them for very long.

, Fill a 5-gallon (18.9-litre) bucket with water and a few squirts of mild dish soap or stone soap. Dip a mop into the soapy water and wring it out. Mop the tiles in small, overlapping circles to remove the dirt and prevent streaking.Choose a soapstone with a pH level of 7 or try to find a soapless cleanser since it won't leave streaks. If you're using dish soap, choose one that's phosphate-free and biodegradable.

, To remove algae or moss, clean the tiles with a bleach solution. If your solid stone tiles are near a pool, patio, or hot tub, wash them off with clean water. Pour 2 gallons (7.6 liters) of water into a bucket and stir in 4 teaspoons (20 ml) of bleach. Use a sponge or mop to wash the area with the mild bleach solution., If you're cleaning a large space, take a garden hose and rinse the tiles with clean water to remove any soap residue.

Make sure you can accurately explain your ideas well enough in your essay to support your thesis.",How to Come up With a Thesis," Be sure you know the type of essay, its length, format, topic, purpose, and structure. Whether you have an assigned topic or a more general topic, your first step is to distill the assignment topic into one question which your thesis statement can answer. Think about your assignment topic. What are you expected to write about? Then take this topic and make it a question you can answer. For example, if you are assigned a paper or report on explaining the safety benefits of buckling your seatbelt in the car, make it into a question you can answer.
Your topic becomes “What are the safety benefits of buckling your seatbelt?”
The answer to this question is the beginning of your thesis statement.;
, A good thesis provides a concise point of view that is relevant to your subject matter. Is your topic an argument, an explanation, a personal description, a contrastive analysis, or a book analysis? Knowing what kind of paper you’re writing will further help you construct a quality thesis. Though you may be writing a paper about World War II or The Great Gatsby, your statement should contain similar attributes.
A good thesis statement answers the question asked of you. It’s your interpretation of the subject. It should aim to make a claim that others can dispute.
Your thesis should also express one main idea that can be developed enough to cover all parts of the assignment.

, What will your point of view be? Develop a point of view that interests you.


Whether you’re given a broad assignment like a paper on The Great Gatsby, or a more specific topic like the benefits of wearing seatbelts, you need to take a side and explain it clearly.
Break down your topic into an argument that you can adequately speak about. For example, if your topic is about the benefits of seatbelts, you have many points of view to explore. You can take a broader route and decide to talk about the decrease in fatal accidents since seatbelts became required. Or, you can get more specific and discuss the laws of wearing your seatbelt in the back seat. Your argument right now is that seatbelts save lives.
You can also choose to take the other side. Your argument may be that seatbelts don’t provide any new benefits. This side may be harder to argue in such a broad area, however. Because there may be a lot of information against you, you may consider getting more specific. You may consider arguing that seatbelt technology hasn’t improved safety in X amount of time. You may find that there is more information on the advancement of other vehicle safety measures which has progressed much farther than seatbelts.
If your topic is even broader, like a report on The Great Gatsby, you have to find an angle that you can argue about. Perhaps after reading the book, you became interested in how American consumerism and monetary pride lead to the Great Depression.

, A great way to come up with a solid thesis statement is to ask a question.


You might have the question: “What are the real world ramifications of the themes presented in The Great Gatsby?”
Therefore, you begin with this conclusion written as a sentence: “The monetary pride and dichotomy of old and new money depicted in The Great Gatsby lead to the Great Depression”. This isn’t your thesis statement yet. This isn’t a well enough formed argument, but it allows you to have a starting opinion and main idea.
Remember that you want to take a stance that reasonable people could argue. This doesn’t mean that you have to take an unpopular opinion, but you should be able to create a conversation with your thesis.

, If you had to state your idea ""in a nutshell"", what would you say?


You have already begun to do this by finding your point of view. However, your argument isn’t fully formed yet.
After you come up with your idea, do a little research to see if you have enough credible information to back it up.
Perhaps you look up seatbelt statistics and find that there isn’t enough information to argue that seatbelt technology hasn’t improved enough. Or, that there isn’t enough information to provide a counterargument. While researching, you read about front seat seatbelts and rear seat seatbelts. You then decide your argument is that backseat passengers should be required to wear seatbelts. Seatbelts are not always required to be worn in the backseat depending on the region. You find this topic has enough information to explore.
Now write down a few different sentence options that argue your point of view. Try to make a slightly different point in each sentence. One sentence may be: “Backseat passengers should be required to wear seatbelts at all times.” Another could be: “Not wearing your seatbelt in the backseat increases risk of serious injury by X percent.”
If you are writing about a broader topic, like your book report on the Great Gatsby, you may find through research that your current argument is too hypothetical. You may not find enough factual correlation to support your topic in the context of your paper’s requirements. Further research is required to support or change your argument.

, Before you waste time writing your thesis statement and then struggling to fill a paper backing up your point, gather some sources that provide you with enough information to write about.


If you decide to argue that seatbelts should be worn in the backseat, find sources that give you crash and safety statistics. Look for articles and facts that argue both sides of the argument.
If you’re writing about the themes of consumerism and pride depicted in The Great Gatsby serving as a roadmap to the Great Depression, research causes of the Great Depression. Do further research to see if other people have a similar argument to yours. See how other similar topics and articles go about relating the actual story in The Great Gatsby to the Great Depression.

, Make sure it's a complete sentence with a subject and verb. It cannot be a question, or an announcement of your purpose (""In this essay, I'm going to..."").


With enough information to back up your thesis, it’s time to go back to what you have written already and see what you may need to change about it. Perhaps in your research gave you a new angle to include.
While you previously had “Backseat passengers should be required to wear seatbelts at all times,” you realize that this doesn’t fulfill all of the requirements of your thesis. Though you have a solid argument, you haven’t fully answered your question.
The question: “What are the benefits of buckling your seatbelt?” still needs to be addressed. Look through your research to find some specific stats to back up your statement.

, It cannot be solely a statement of fact, but must include evidence that backs up your opinion. If someone read your sentence, you want it to illicit a response. While “Backseat passengers should be required to wear seatbelts at all times,” expresses your opinion, it doesn’t provide an argument yet that someone can really contest.
Get specific with the “why’s” or “what’s”. “Due to X percent of unbelted backseat passengers being ejected and fatally wounded in car accidents, backseat passengers should be required to buckle up at all times.” is a more structured thesis that provides a “why”.
The same applies to your potential book report. “The monetary pride and dichotomy of old and new money depicted in The Great Gatsby lead to the Great Depression.” doesn’t exactly offer a specific interpretation of the literary work. Consider, “The fear of muddled class systems and the pursuit of the American Dream depicted in The Great Gatsby lead to an age of consumerism and excess, which triggered The Great Depression.” This sentence more clearly defines your stance. It also passes the “So what?” test because you have outlined a controversial point of view which presents an interpretation of the literature.

, Make sure your sentence includes words that state the topic, your opinion, and that it doesn’t wander.


Getting more specific in your thesis is good, but it can sometimes cause you to wander as you try to incorporate everything you want to say. Remember, your thesis is a one-sentence introduction that gives an outline for the body of your paper.
You don’t have to include every little detail you will touch on in your thesis. It should provide a well-structured overview.
If your original question is “What are the safety benefits of buckling your seatbelt?” read over your current thesis and see if it still answers that question. “Due to X percent of unbelted backseat passengers being ejected and fatally wounded in car accidents, backseat passengers should be required to buckle up at all times.” Your current thesis doesn’t exactly answer this question, so it’s time to revise it again.
“What are the real world ramifications of the themes presented in The Great Gatsby?” is answered in our current statement: “The fear of muddled class systems and the pursuit of the American Dream depicted in The Great Gatsby lead to an age of consumerism and excess, which triggered The Great Depression.” However, we can still revise and tighten our statement.

, Though your thesis is essentially your personal opinion, it needs to be presented as a structured argument. Your thesis is a statement that others may hold a different opinion about. And which you will develop in your essay to show why you have this point of view.
Check to make sure your thesis contains an argument that hits on the focus of your question.
Revising your seatbelt thesis to: “Increasing seatbelt laws to include mandatory buckling in back seats will provide further safety benefits by reducing the percent of fatalities in vehicle accidents.” better answers your original question.

, A very vague, large statement will require many pages for you to support adequately. A highly specific idea may not be a strong enough argument or provide enough evidence to back up.


While “The fear of muddled class systems and the pursuit of the American Dream depicted in The Great Gatsby lead to an age of consumerism and excess, which triggered The Great Depression.” answers your question, it’s slightly broad.
“The themes of wealth disparity in American royalty, and pursuit of the American Dream presented in The Great Gatsby depict a parallel to real world consumerism and excess which lead to the Great Depression.” narrows down that you will talk about specific themes in the book and compare these fictional themes to the real world.
This is also an example of a thesis statement which can be broken up into two sentences.

, Now that you’ve compiled evidence, revised, and come to a specific stance, read over the assignment again. Make sure that you can write a paper with your current thesis that will fulfill the requirements.


If your assignment was to discuss the benefits of seatbelts, read your thesis again and ask yourself if it can cover the criteria.
“Increasing seatbelt laws to include mandatory buckling in back seats will provide further safety benefits by reducing the percent of fatalities in vehicle accidents.” In this thesis, you have taken a position that can be argued.
You have made it specific by narrowing your topic a particular aspect of seatbelt safety. And you have given an answer to how your argument will discuss the benefits of seatbelts.

, If you’ve already done some research, which you should have to arrive at your thesis, you should be able to provide enough evidence throughout your essay to back up your claim. Before beginning your paper, make sure you have fulfilled all the criteria. Do you answer a question? Are you taking a position others can challenge or oppose? Is your thesis specific enough? Does it pass the “So what?” and “how and why?” test.
If your thesis doesn’t fulfill these requirements, take a break and then go back and revise. Sometimes, after taking a step back, you can come back with a better angle.
As you write your essay, follow your thesis and outline, but don’t feel that you have to compromise your paper to fit your thesis. If you find yourself needing to revise your thesis throughout your essay, do so.

You should also provide background to your argument, including any relevant history, and your motive for arguing. Lastly, you want to use this paragraph to map out what you're going to discuss in the essay.

, Each body paragraph should contain its own relevant mini-argument. You should be able to back each of these up with hard evidence. It is not enough to simply list facts, you should also be able to analyze them for your reader. #*Address the counter arguments. Show, again with evidence, why they do not hold a candle to your argument.

, Here, you should briefly restate the points that you have made in the essay, as well as your thesis. Explain the broader significance of the points you have made, and end on a strong note.

, Review the essay yourself and give it to someone to edit. Having someone else look at your work will bring to your attention errors that you may not have noticed otherwise.

Read over the objective of the course and review the assignments to date to get some ideas flowing. Were there any projects or readings that particularly interested you? Use this as a guide to begin brainstorming potential ideas., Once you’ve refreshed your memories of recent work, gather a pencil and paper to create a list. Set a timer for 5 minutes and write down as many potential topics as you can think of in that time. Don’t be too critical of yourself at this early stage; you’re just trying to get some ideas out. You may find that your brain makes unexpected and pleasant connections.These don’t need to be cohesive thesis statements. Just start creating a base of ideas.
For a class on architecture, you might write down: Frank Lloyd Wright, midcentury modern, changes over time, Chicago, urban planning, influential architects, Mies van der Rohe, lots of windows, Prairie Style, nature.

, Go through your list and use symbols, such as stars or asterisks, to note related ideas. Consider which ideas have lots of directions to choose from and which have fewer. Did you have a lot to say about one topic but struggled with others? Look for patterns to better understand where your interest lies.


You’re more likely to write passionately about something that truly interests you.

, Using your brainstorm list as a guide, eliminate less interesting ideas until you have three potential topics or related keywords you might like to tackle. These don’t have to be firm thesis statements yet, they can just be narrower areas of focus you’d like to explore.


For instance, using the architecture example above, three ideas might be: Mies van der Rohe and Chicago; nature and Prairie Style; and Frank Lloyd Wright and midcentury modern.

, Use the Encyclopedia Americana, Encyclopedia Britannica, or another reputable encyclopedia to search for the key terms in the three broad topics you outlined. Read the articles that come up, and keep a pad of paper nearby to write down any interesting facts or important information you discover. This will give you a more thorough understanding of the topics at hand., Search the databases of reputable newspapers, such as the Washington Post and the New York Times, for your topic keywords. This will bring up any current articles about your topics. This will also help you understand if there are any new or critical developments to consider as you choose an area to write about. Some newspaper databases stretch back into the 1800s, so these can provide a historical perspective as well.Save the URLs of any particularly good or helpful articles, as they may be useful sources for you later on.

, Make an appointment with a librarian at your school or public library. Bring any notes you’ve taken about your early research. Talk through your potential topics with the librarian and see what unique books or databases they think might be relevant to your research. This may introduce you to new angles on your potential topic.For instance, in our architecture example, a librarian might be able to get you access to the digital archive of Architectural Digest or past articles by the Urban Land Institute.
Write down any important passwords or usernames you need to access the resources your librarian makes available.

, After your preliminary research, take stock of which broad topics have lots of critical resources and which have fewer. Compare your notes in each of the three areas. You’ll want lots of good materials to support your thesis later.

, The process of getting to know the topics better should have helped you better feel out which area is most of interest to you. You may even have a potential thesis statement in mind already, but if not, that’s okay too. Weigh your interest in what you’ve found out and the resources available. An area of high interest with a lot of resources is ideal.


In our architecture example, nature and Prairie Style architecture could be your broad topic to further refine.

, Using your preliminary research as a guide, turn your broad idea into a research question that you will attempt to answer with your paper. It can be helpful to consider the relationship between your keywords. Did one make or influence the other? Did they happen or live concurrently? The nature of your broad idea will inform the sort of question that makes sense.So, for example, rather than just nature and Prairie Style architecture, a research question could be: How did the Prairie Style architects represent nature in their architecture?

, Make your question more specific so you are addressing the topic in a unique way. The best way to do this is to restrict the topic by adding conditions.Limitations about geography, time frame, or population are some popular ways of doing this.So, How did the Prairie Style architects represent nature in their architecture on Chicago’s West Side? Or how did the Prairie Style architects represent nature in their architecture in the 1950s?

, Now, use your preliminary research to form a basic answer to the question you created. This will be the topic of your paper and the idea around which you centralize deeper research going forward. The answer might be obvious in your opinion based on what you’ve read, or you might want to revisit some articles and sources now that you’ve narrowed your topic.Often there is no one right answer to a research query. The answer depends on your opinion and how you interpret what you’ve read. Don’t be afraid to draw your own new conclusions.
So, for example, how did Prairie Style architects represent nature in their architecture on Chicago’s West Side? Might be answered: The wide open green spaces of Chicago’s West Side inspired Prairie Style architects to add large windows. This could be your paper topic going forward.

The last thing you want is to end up spending hours learning and writing about a subject in which you have zero interest. You will find the whole process much more enjoyable if you actually care about what you are doing.Be sure to stay within the guidelines you are given by your teacher or professor. For example, if you are free to choose a topic but the general theme must fall under human biology, do not write your essay on plant photosynthesis.
Stick with topics that are not overly complicated, especially if the subject is not something you plan to continue studying. There's no need to make things harder on yourself!;
, Before you begin writing, read up on the subject of your essay. It is best to gather all your sources and review them before attempting to begin your paper so that you can have things clearly planned out when you actually start writing. You can find information on your topic of choice through a number of different types of resources. Some examples are discussed below.


Specialty books; these can be found at your local public or school library. A book published on your topic is a great resource and will likely be one of your most reliable options for finding quality information. They also contain lists of references where you can look for more information.
Academic journals; these are periodicals devoted to scholarly research on a specific field of study. Articles in academic journals are written by experts in that field and scrutinized by other professionals to ensure their accuracy. These are great options if you need to find detailed, sophisticated information on your topic; avoid these if you are only writing a general overview.
Online encyclopedias; the most reliable information on the internet can be found in online encyclopedias like Encyclopedia.com and Britannica.com. While online wikis can be very helpful, they sometimes contain unverified information that you should probably not rely upon as your primary resources.
Expert interviews; if possible, interview an expert in the subject of your research. Experts can be professionals working in the field you are studying, professors with advanced degrees in the subject of interest, etc.

, When you are researching your topic, take notes on the information you find. It can be difficult to recall all you have read on the subject when it comes time to start writing, especially if you are unfamiliar with the topic; having notes will significantly help with this. Be sure to note where you found the information as you take notes so you can easily cite it as you write.


Organize your notes by sub-topic to keep them orderly and so you can easily find references when you are writing.
If you are using books or physical copies of magazines or journals, use sticky tabs to mark pages or paragraphs where you found useful information. You might even want to number these tabs to correspond with numbers on your note sheet for easy reference.
By keeping your notes brief and simple, you can make them easier to understand and reference while writing. Don't make your notes so long and detailed that they essentially copy what's already written in your sources, as this won't be helpful to you.

, Depending on the purpose of your research paper, you may find yourself needing to adopt a position or draw some conclusions about your topic. As you research the subject, ask yourself how the information you encounter fits in with the objective of your paper. For example, if you need to present two sides of an argument and then side with one, identify information that corresponds to the different viewpoints surrounding the topic (and organize the sources accordingly in your notes).


Sometimes the objective of your research will be obvious to you before you even begin researching the topic; other times, you may have to do a bit of reading before you can determine the direction you want your essay to take.
If you have an objective in mind from the start, you can incorporate this into online searches about your topic in order to find the most relevant resources. For example, if your objective is to outline the environmental hazards of hydraulic fracturing practices, search for that exact phrase rather than just ""hydraulic fracturing.""

, If you are researching for a class, ask your teacher or professor for advice or suggestions as to the direction you should take with your essay. He or she might be able to help you out by narrowing (or broadening) your focus or by pointing you toward useful resources. This way, you will also be able to gauge whether your teacher approves of the topic you have in mind.


Avoid asking your teacher to give you a topic. Unless your topic was assigned to you in the first place, part of the assignment is for you to choose a topic relevant to the broader theme of the class or unit. By asking your teacher to do this for you, you risk admitting laziness or incompetence.
If you have a few topics in mind but are not sure how to develop objectives for some of them, your teacher can help with this. Plan to discuss your options with your teacher and come to a decision yourself rather than having him or her choose the topic for you from several options.

, You will probably need to address several distinct aspects of your research topic in your essay. This is an important tactic for producing a well-organized research essay because it avoids 'stream of consciousness' writing, which typically lacks order.


Consider what background information is necessary to contextualize your research topic. What questions might the reader have right out of the gate? How do you want the reader to think about the topic? Answering these kinds of questions can help you figure out how to set up your argument.
Match your paper sections to the objective(s) of your writing. For example, if you are trying to present two sides of a debate, create a section for each and then divide them up according to the aspects of each argument you want to address.

, One of the most helpful things you can do when writing a research paper is to outline the various sections and primary points of the essay. Do this before you begin writing so you can visualize how each of the essay's parts will fit together. This will also allow you to rearrange components of the paper to make it flow logically.An outline can be as detailed or general as you want, so long as it helps you figure out how to construct the essay. Some people like to include a few sentences under each heading in their outline to create a sort of ""mini-essay"" before they begin writing. Others find that a simple ordered list of topics is sufficient. Do whatever works best for you.
If you have time, write your outline a day or two before you start writing and come back to it several times. This will give you an opportunity to think about how the pieces of your essay will best fit together. Rearrange things in your outline as many times as you want until you have a structure you are happy with.

, Research papers, unlike creative writing pieces, usually adhere to a specific style guides governing the way sources must be cited and various other aspects of writing mechanics. If you are writing a research essay for a class, your teacher will probably specify which style the essay must conform to. Common examples include MLA (Modern Language Association) and APA (American Psychological Association) style formats, but specific fields also have their own style guides. Consult your teacher if you aren't sure what style to use.Style guides tell you exactly how to quote passages, cite references, construct works cited sections, etc. If you are assigned a specific format, you must take care to adhere to guidelines for text formatting and citations.
Some computer programs (such as EndNote) allow you to construct a library of resources which you can then set to a specific format type; then you can automatically insert in-text citations from your library and populate a references section at the end of the document. This is an easy way to make sure your citations match your assigned style format.

, You should set realistic writing goals for yourself so you can stay on task without feeling overburdened. It is a good idea to create a schedule and set aside blocks of time each day to work on specific parts of your essay. This way you aren't stuck writing nonstop for two days to meet your deadline and you can check things off your list as you complete them.


You may wish to start by simply assigning yourself a certain number of pages per day. Divide the number of pages you are required to write by the number of days you have to finish the essay; this is the number of pages (minimum) that you must complete each day in order to pace yourself evenly.
If possible, leave a buffer of at least one day between finishing your paper and the due date. This will allow you to review your finished product and edit it for errors. This will also help in case something comes up that slows your writing progress.

, In this section, introduce your topic and establish the purpose for your essay. If you intend to investigate a debated topic, state this in your introduction. You want the reader to have a good idea of what the essay is about and how it is constructed by reading your introduction. Save your opinions and any conclusions you've drawn for the rest of the essay.Keep your introduction relatively short. For most papers, one or two paragraphs will suffice. For really long essays, you may need to expand this.
Don't assume your reader already knows the basics of the topic unless it truly is a matter of common knowledge. For example, you probably don't need to explain in your introduction what biology is, but you should define less general terms such as ""eukaryote"" or ""polypeptide chain.""

, This is the meat of your paper, on which you should place the majority of your focus. The length and detail of your essay will determine the form of its body, but at a minimum this should include any key arguments, any research methods used and results obtained (in cases where you performed original research), and your main research findings.You may need to include a special section at the beginning of the essay body for background information on your topic. Alternatively, you can consider moving this to the introductory section, but only if your essay is short and only minimal background discussion is needed.
This is the part of your paper where organization and structure are most important. Arrange sections within the body so that they flow logically and the reader is introduced to ideas and sub-topics before they are discussed further.
Depending upon the length and detail of your paper, the end of the body might contain a discussion of findings. This kind of section serves to wrap up your main findings but does not explicitly state your conclusions (which should come in the final section of the essay).
Avoid repetition in the essay body. Keep your writing concise, yet with sufficient detail to address your objective(s) or research question(s).

, One of the biggest mistakes you can make when writing a research paper is to fail to properly cite your sources. Passing off someone else's ideas as your own, whether intentional or not, is plagiarism, and it could land you a failing grade or even expulsion from your school. Take the time to ensure you are citing information the right way by following these guidelines:


Always use quotation marks when using exact quotes from another source. If someone already said or wrote the words you are using, you must quote them this way! Place your in-text citation at the end of the quote.
To include someone else's ideas in your essay without directly quoting them, you can restate the information in your own words; this is called paraphrasing. Although this does not require quotation marks, it should still be accompanied by an in-text citation.

, This section stands apart from the essay body in that it is devoted solely to stating the conclusions you have drawn from your research. Avoid discussing details of your research or presenting results in this section. You may wish to rephrase your study objective and state how your findings address that goal.Except for very long essays, keep your conclusion short and to the point. You should aim for one or two paragraphs, if possible.
Conclusions should directly correspond to research discussed in the essay body. In other words, make sure your conclusions logically connect to the rest of your essay and provide explanations when necessary.
If your topic is complex and involves lots of details, you should consider including a brief summary of the main points of your research in your conclusion.

, Once you've completed your first draft, you should go back to your introductory paragraph(s) and evaluate whether your essay accomplishes the stated goals you presented in the beginning. A good essay will thoroughly address any questions or unknowns posed in its introduction. If your conclusions do not logically follow the stated purpose or objective of your essay, then you will need to fix this.


Making changes to the discussion and conclusion sections instead of the introduction often requires a less extensive rewrite. Doing this also prevents you from removing anything from the beginning of your essay that could accidentally make subsequent portions of your writing seem out of place.
It is okay to revise your thesis once you've finished the first draft of your essay! People's views often change once they've done research on a topic. Just make sure you don't end up straying too far from your assigned topic if you do this.
You don't necessarily need to wait until you've finished your entire draft to do this step. In fact, it is a good idea to revisit your thesis regularly as you write. This can save you a lot of time in the end by helping you keep your essay content on track.

, This is a critical element of any research paper, because this is where you give credit to all the sources from which you borrowed information to write your essay. This is not something that should be left for the end of your writing; rather, you should build your works cited section as you write, adding citations as you reference them in your writing.


Computer software such as EndNote is available for making citation organization as easy and quick as possible. You can create a reference library and link it to your document, adding in-text citations as you write; the program creates a formatted works cited section at the end of your document.
Be aware of the formatting requirements of your chosen style guide for works cited sections and in-text citations. Reference library programs like EndNote have hundreds of pre-loaded formats to choose from.

, After you have written your essay, there are some final things to take care of to turn your paper into a polished piece of work that your teacher will appreciate. While not all of these have to wait until the essay is fully written, it is a good idea to take care of the important stuff first -- which is the writing, of course! Final tasks include:


Create a catchy title. Waiting until you have finished your essay before choosing a title ensures that it will closely match the content of your essay. Research papers don't always take on the shape we expect them to, and it's easier to match your title to your essay than vice-versa.
Read through your paper to identify and rework sentences or paragraphs that are confusing or unclear. Each section of your paper should have a clear focus and purpose; if any of yours seem not to meet these expectations, either rewrite or discard them.
Review your works cited section (at the end of your essay) to ensure that it conforms to the standards of your chosen or assigned style format. You should at least make sure that the style is consistent throughout this section.
Run a spell checker on your entire document to catch any spelling or grammar mistakes you may not have noticed during your read-through. All modern word processing programs include this function.

, The first draft of your paper should not be the version you turn in to your teacher (unless you are really good at editing as you write). It is usually necessary to rewrite or at least reorganize and tidy up a research essay before it can be considered finished. Give yourself a day or so away from your first draft to get some distance from your project before going back to revise it.Note that revising your draft is not the same as proofreading it. Revisions are done to make sure the content and substantive ideas are solid; editing is done to check for spelling and grammar errors. Revisions are arguably a more important part of writing a good paper.
You may want to have a friend, classmate, or family member read your first draft and give you feedback. This can be immensely helpful when trying to decide how to improve upon your first version of the essay.
Except in extreme cases, avoid a complete rewrite of your first draft. This will most likely be counterproductive and will waste a lot of time. Your first draft is probably already pretty good -- it likely just needs some tweaking before it is ready to submit.

If you are, however, writing a newspaper editorial or a letter to your senator, you may have a more flexible topic around which you will write. Try to narrow your topic so that you are writing about something fairly specific.


For example, if you are writing about the prison system in the U.S., you will find this is a huge topic. Narrow that topic to focus on one aspect of the topic, such as the treatment of elderly inmates or the rates of literacy among inmates.;
, Now that you have a narrowed topic, you can start to think about what you want to say about your topic. Why do you feel strongly about this topic? What is your solution to this problem or issue? This is the start of your essay’s thesis, or its overall argument. Persuasive essays appeal to the reader’s emotion; consider the most emotional angles of your topic.Brainstorming ideas with someone can be helpful because they might contribute ideas you hadn’t considered or they might expand on the ideas you have.
For example, if you are writing about the treatment of factory farmed pigs, your angle might be that this treatment should be banned because it is inhumane.

, Write down a list of different reasons you might give for supporting your thesis statement. Some of these reasons might be silly, but jot them down anyway. There might be a kernel of truth in them that you might revisit later on.


These reasons can be rooted in emotion and appeal to the reader’s sense of moral responsibility or ethics, for example. Evidence for a persuasive essay does not necessarily have to be rooted in substantiated evidence.

, You will likely not be able to write about every single example of evidence that you find; instead, choose the best, most convincing evidence.

, Your thesis statement, or the overall argument you want to propose in your essay, derives from the angle you are taking on your specific topic. Writing the thesis statement should answer the “what” and the “how” of your argument. The “what” is the topic itself and the “how” is the angle.For example, your thesis statement on inhumane treatment of animals might read: “Factory farming of pigs should be banned because it is cruel, torturous treatment of animals, and their living conditions can spread disease and contaminate the human food supply.”
Your thesis statement might change as you work through your paper. This is why it is still a rough draft at this point.

, An outline will help organize your thoughts and structure your paper. An outline can be numbered with Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, etc.), regular numbers, or bullet points. Use phrases and brief sentences to put your ideas on paper.


Use a basic five-paragraph structure for your paper, with one paragraph for your introduction, three paragraphs for three points of evidence, and one paragraph for your conclusion. Your paper may need to be longer than this, however, especially if you are writing a persuasive research essay that requires more information to give background to your topic.

, This can be a startling statistic or statement, a rhetorical question, a quotation, or a very brief anecdote.You might start out with the big picture and narrow down towards your thesis statement, or you might do the opposite and start very small and zoom out to your thesis statement.


An example might be: “The United States has a 25 percent larger prison population than China, giving the U.S. the worst prison record in the entire world.”

, You are taking a stand with your essay, no matter its purpose. Make confident and assertive statements, and don’t overstate or use extra words where fewer words will work. You want to draw in readers with this introductory paragraph and give them the sense that you are an authority on the subject.


Persuasive essays are most effective when they blend opinion with fact to convince the reader that the writer’s viewpoint is the “right” viewpoint.

, There are a few different kinds of introductions that are frequently used, but they often detract from the force of your argument by being too vague, broad, or unclear, or by including irrelevant information. Some of these introductions might be:



The dictionary definition: While you may try to establish a definition of a word like “slavery” to hinge your paper on, this is a less effective way of introducing a topic. An example of this type of introduction might be: “Webster’s Dictionary defines slavery as ‘the state of being a slave,’ as ‘the practice of owning slaves,’ and as ‘a condition of hard work and subjection.’”The very broad introduction, or the “Dawn of Man” introduction: Persuasive essays are written to provide a solution to a given problem, but connecting it to greater human existence in broad strokes can sometimes be an ineffective method. An example might be: “People have killed and eaten animals since the beginning of time.” The book report information: If you are writing a persuasive essay about a novel, for example, you might be tempted to fill in your introduction with information about the book itself, such as the full title, author, year of publication and so on. This information is typically not relevant to your thesis statement and should be eliminated, unless you are referencing some of those details for a specific purpose. An example might be: “Frederick Douglass wrote his autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave, in the 1840s. It was published in 1986 by Penguin Books. In it, he tells the story of his life.”, Your thesis statement, which you have already drafted, will argue your position and gives the reader clues as to how you will argue your position. You may want to change a few words here and there in your thesis statement to make it flow better within your introduction. It may have also changed somewhat after you drafted your outline.

, As you write your paper, you may develop other lines of thinking or decide that certain evidence should be tossed out. This may shift the focus of your paper. Your introduction and thesis statement might need to be revised based on these changes in the rest of your paper.

, Use your best examples of evidence to support your introduction and thesis statement. Follow the outline that you made so that you stay on track. Provide concrete examples, although you should paraphrase most information so you are writing in your own words. Use one paragraph for each piece of evidence (if you are using the five-paragraph essay structure).


Make sure that your evidence directly supports your thesis statement. If you start to get off track, revisit your outline.

, Between each paragraph, you will need sentences that tie them together so that they read logically. Otherwise, your essay might seem like a stream of unconnected paragraphs. Transitions help the reader understand the information that you’re writing about and help them follow your argument., Restate your thesis statement and the main points you have used to support your thesis statement. Your conclusion should do more than just simply summarize your paper. Think of an original and creative point you can make that ties your paper together.Avoid vague, overarching statements that don’t say much. Strive to write something meaningful yet concise and specific.

, After you have finished your first draft, take a break, and then read through the entire paper. Pay particular attention to your introduction and thesis statement, and keep these in mind as you read through the rest of the paper. Does your argument support your thesis statement? Do you make points that contradict your thesis statement?


You may need to tweak the wording on your thesis statement. Refine this sentence to say exactly what you want to say in a concise, clear way.

, Make sure your paper is free from errors, as these can unintentionally detract from the overall quality and effectiveness of your paper. Use proper grammar and spelling to ensure your essay is as persuasive as possible.

, Having another set of eyes on the paper will help you find illogical passages or unclear transitions. Try to find someone who has good grammar, as they may also help you fix minor spelling and grammatical errors.

Know which sources are acceptable to your teacher. Does your teacher want a certain number of primary sources and secondary sources?

Can you use Wikipedia? Wikipedia is often a good starting point for learning about a topic, but many teachers won't let you cite it because they want you to find more authoritative sources. Even if your teacher does not allow Wikipedia, you can still use Wikipedia articles as a starting point. If you have very little background knowledge about your research topic, Wikipedia can be a good place to get a general working knowledge of your research topic and find search terms. The ""Works Cited"" or ""Bibliography"" section at the bottom of the page can also be a good starting point for finding reliable sources. However, if your teacher forbids even that much, a normal encyclopedia can serve the same function.


Take detailed notes, keeping track of which facts come from which sources. Write down your sources in the correct citation format so that you don't have to go back and look them up again later.
Never ignore facts and claims that seem to disprove your original idea or claim. A good essay writer either includes the contrary evidence and shows why such evidence is not valid or alters his or her point of view in light of the evidence.;
, In your research you'll probably come across really well-written (and not so well-written) arguments about your topic. Do some analysis to see what makes them work.


What claims does the author make?


Why do they sound good? Is it the logic, the sources, the writing, the structure? Is it something else?


What evidence does the author present to you?


Why does the evidence sound credible? How does the author present facts, and what is his/her approach to telling a story with facts?


Is the logic sound or faulty, and why?


Why is the logic sound? Does the author back up his/her claims with examples that are easy to follow?



, Sure, you can use the arguments of others to back up what you want to say. However, you need to come up with your original spin on the topic to make it uniquely yours.


Make lists of ideas. You can also try mind mapping.
Take your time. Walk in your neighborhood or local park and think about your topic. Be prepared for ideas to come to you when you least expect them.

,


Look at the ideas that you generated. Choose one to three of your strongest ideas that support your topic. You should be able to support these ideas with evidence from your research.
Write a thesis statement that summarizes the ideas that you plan to present. Essentially, let the reader know where you're going and why.

A thesis statement should have a narrow focus include both your topic and what you plan to present. For example, ""Although Eli Whitney's cotton gin ushered in a new era of American prosperity, it also widened the gap in suffering for African-American slaves, who would soon be more in demand, and more exploited, than ever.""
A thesis statement should not ask a question, be written in first person (""I""), roam off-topic or be combative.



, Take the thoughts that you brainstormed and assemble them into an outline. Write a topic sentence for your main ideas. Then, underneath, make bullet points and list your supporting evidence. Generally, you want three arguments or pieces of evidence to support each main idea.


Topic sentence: ""Eli Whitney's cotton gin made life harder on African American slaves.""

Ex: ""The success of cotton made it harder for slaves to purchase their own freedom.""
Ex: ""Many northern slaves were in danger of being kidnapped and brought down south to work in the cotton fields.""
Ex: ""In 1790, before the cotton gin, slaves in America totaled about 700,000. In 1810, after the cotton gin had been adopted, slaves totaled about 1.2 million, a 70% increase.""



, You do want to think about length here; don't write pages and pages if your teacher wants 5 paragraphs. However, you should freewrite to let your thoughts reveal themselves. You can always make them more concise later.



Avoid sweeping generalizations. Statements such as ""______ is the most important problem facing the world today,"" can cause your reader to dismiss your position out of hand if he/she disagrees with you. On the other hand, ""______ is a significant global problem"" is more accurate.

Don't use ""I"" statements such as ""I think."" Likewise, avoid the personal pronouns ""you,"" ""we,"" ""my,"" ""your"" or ""our"". Simply stating your argument with supporting facts makes you sound much more authoritative. Instead of writing, ""I found Frum to have a conservative bias,"" tell the reader why your statement is true: ""Frum displays a conservative bias when he writes...""

, Your title and introduction make people want to read your essay. If your teacher is the audience, then of course your teacher will read the whole piece. However, if you're submitting to an essay contest or writing an essay for college admissions, your title and introduction have to hook the reader if you want to meet your objectives.


Skip obvious expressions such as, ""This essay is about, ""The topic of this essay is"" or ""I will now show that"".
Try the inverted pyramid formula. Start off with a very broad description of your topic and gradually narrow it down to your specific thesis statement. Try to use no more than 3 to 5 sentences for short essays, and no more than 1 page for longer essays.
Short essay example: Every year, thousands of unwanted and abused animals end up in municipal shelters. Being caged in shelters not only causes animals to suffer but also drains local government budgets. Towns and cities could prevent both animal abuse and government waste by requiring prospective pet owners to go through mandatory education before allowing them to obtain a pet. Although residents may initially resist the requirement, they will soon see that the benefits of mandatory pet owner education far outweigh the costs.""


, Summarize your points and suggest ways in which your conclusion can be thought of in a larger sense.


Answer questions like, ""What are the implications of your thesis statement being true?"" ""What's the next step?"" ""What questions remain unanswered?""
Your arguments should draw your reader to a natural, logical conclusion. In a sense, you are repackaging your thesis statement in your concluding paragraph by helping the reader to remember the journey through your essay.
Nail the last sentence. If your title and first paragraph make the reader want to read your essay, then your last sentence makes the reader remember you. If a gymnast does a great balance beam routine but falls on the landing, then people forget the routine. Gymnasts need to ""stick the landing,"" and so do essay writers.

, Get your essay done a couple of days before the due date so that you have time to go back and revise it to make it polished. Avoid turning in a first draft that you haven't double-checked for errors.

, Consult a style book if you are unsure how to properly use quotation marks, colons, semicolons, apostrophes or commas. Avoid using exclamation points.

,


Look for mistakes involving than/then, your/you're, its/it's, etc. Make sure you know how to use apostrophes correctly.
Look for mistakes involving general punctuation. Check for run-on sentences, commas and periods inside quotation marks, as well as sparely-used dashes, colons, and semi-colons.

, Vary your language with the help of a thesaurus. Also, consult a dictionary to make sure that you're using unfamiliar words correctly.


At the same time, try to keep your language short, sweet, and to the point. A thesaurus is a great tool, but don't just use big words to sound fancy. The best essays are clear, concise, and easily understood by a wide audience.
Focus on writing killer verbs for sentences. Verbs communicate the action in a sentence and drive the action. A great verb can be the difference between a bland sentence and a beautiful one.
Use adjectives lightly. Adjectives are great descriptive words, but when used indiscriminately, they can burden an essay and make it less readable. Try to let the verbs and nouns do most of the heavy lifting before you focus on adjectives.

, Do not use contractions or abbreviations (e.g., don't, can't, won't, shouldn't, could've, or haven't). Your essay should have a serious tone, even if it's written in a light or lyrical style.

, Does each sentence lead smoothly to the next? Does each paragraph flow logically to the next? Good connections will help your ideas to flow:


When events happen in sequence: I first started to realize that I was in the minority when I was in middle school...My realization was confirmed when I proceeded to high school.

If sentences elaborate on each other: Plants need water to survive...A plant's ability to absorb water depends on the nutrition of the soil.

When an idea contrasts with another idea: Vegetarians argue that land is unnecessarily wasted by feeding animals to be eaten as food...Opponents argue that land being used for grazing would not be able to be used to create any other kind of food.

If you're relaying a cause and effect relationship: I will be the first person in my family to graduate from college...I am inspired to continue my family's progress through the generations.

When connecting similar ideas: Organic food is thought to be better for the environment . . . local food is believed to achieve the same goals.


, You don't want your essay to ramble off-topic. Any information that doesn't directly or indirectly support your thesis should be cut out.

, Your ears are sometimes better than your eyes at picking up mistakes in language. The essay should sound like it has a good flow and understandable words.

, If needed, rearrange sentences and paragraphs into a different order. Make sure that both your conclusion and introduction match the changes that you make to the body.

, A persuasive essay is designed to sway the reader to adopt your point of view about a topic. These are good examples of persuasive essay topics you might write about:


Whether governments should or should not fund embryonic stem cell research.
Whether love is a virtue or a vice.
Why Citizen Kane is the best movie of the 20th century.
Why American citizens should be forced to vote.

, When you speak in a debate, you introduce your topic, list your evidence and draw a conclusion for the people who are listening. A persuasive essay has a similar structure.

, Support your argument with reasoned facts. A well-written essay is great, but a well-argued essay is undeniable.


In addition to doing research, you can perform empirical experiments including taking surveys, doing interviews or conducting experiments. Survey results or interviews could be great pieces of information to start your essay with.
Tell a story about the facts. Don't just list the facts; tell a story! For example: ""Since the death penalty has been reinstated, more than 140 inmates on death row have been released after evidence proved them innocent. Ask yourself: How would you like to be one of those 140 wrongfully-convicted inmates?""

, Present the other side of your argument and use logic and facts to show why the other side's opinion is either inaccurate or not up-to-date.For example: ""Some people argue that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to crime. Time after time, evidence has disproved this theory. The death penalty, in fact, does not act as a deterrent to crime: The South accounts for 80% of US executions and has the highest regional murder rate.""

, Be sure to stress your thesis, or what you are arguing for or against, one last time. Use some of the information you have discussed, or a story you've saved, to color your conclusion a little bit.

, You'll be investigating a topic and presenting an argument about the topic based on evidence.


For example, you could write an expository essay arguing that embryonic stem cell research can lead to cures for spinal cord injuries and illnesses like Parkinson's or diabetes.
Expository essays differ from persuasive essays because you aren't stating an opinion. You're stating facts that you can back up with research.

, Some common strategies and structures for expository writing include:



Definitions. Definition essays explain the meaning of terms or concepts.

Classification. Classification essays organize a topic into groups starting with the most general group and narrowing down to more specific groups.

Compare and contrast. In this type of essay, you'll describe either the similarities and differences (or both) between ideas or concepts.

Cause and effect. These essays explain how topics affect each other and how they are interdependent.

How-to. How-to essays explain the steps required for completing a task or a procedure with the goal of instructing the reader.

, Expository essays aren't about opinions. They are about drawing a conclusion based on verifiable evidence. This means keeping your perspective balanced and focusing on what the facts tell you.


You might even find that, with new information, you'll have to revise your essay. If you started out writing about the scarcity of information regarding global warming, but came across a bunch of scientific evidence supporting global warming, you at least have to consider revising what your essay is about.

, The facts will tell the story itself if you let them. Think like a journalist when writing an expository essay. If you put down all the facts like a reporter, the story should tell itself.


Don't mess with structure in expository essays. In narrative essays, you can twist and turn the structure to make the essay more interesting. Be sure that your structure in expository essays is very linear, making it easier to connect the dots.

, A narrative essay recounts an incident that either you or others have experienced. In a narrative essay, you could describe a personal experience in which embryonic stem cell research could have helped you or someone you love conquer a debilitating condition.

, You'll need an introduction, setting, plot, characters, climax and conclusion.



Introduction: The beginning. How are you going to set the story up? Is there something useful or important here that gets mentioned later on?

Setting: Where the action takes place. What does it look like? Which words can you use to make the reader feel like they are there when they read it?

Plot: What happens. The meat of the story, the essential action. Why is the story worth telling?

Characters: Who's in the story. What does the story tell us about the characters? What do the characters tell us about the story?

Climax: The suspenseful bit before anything is resolved. Are we left hanging on the edges of our seat? Do we need to know what happens next?

Conclusion: How everything resolves. What does the story mean in the end? How have things, people, ideas changed now that the end is revealed?

, Most narrative essays are written from the author's point of view, but you can also consider other perspectives as long as your point of view is consistent.


Utilize the pronoun ""I"" if you are the narrator. In a narrative essay, you can use first person. However, make sure that you don't overdo it. In all essays, you sound more authoritative if you state facts or opinions in third person.

, You're telling a story, but the purpose of the story is to make a specific point. Introduce your main idea in your thesis statement, and make sure that all of your story elements tie back to your thesis statement.



What did you learn? How is your essay an exploration of the things that you learned?

How have you changed? How is the ""you"" that started the essay different from the ""you"" now? Related to, but different from, the ""what did you learn?"" question.

, You will use words to evoke emotions in your reader, so choose your words deliberately."

This involves extensive research covering all aspects of the topic and gathering information on all involved points of view.


Argumentative essays also provide your audience with a well-rounded summary of the issue at hand, but clearly indicate what your own point of view is and why this view is the best option over others.;
, To prepare yourself to write an argumentative essay, it is crucial for you to fully immerse yourself in the subject material.


The effectiveness of this type of essay depends on the author's ability to parse through the various facets of the topic and lead the reader toward an obvious and logical conclusion. To this end, you must familiarize yourself with all opinions about the topic so that you can also outline the viewpoints that oppose your own view (counterarguments).

, In the end, the main reason someone chooses to write an argumentative essay (other than the fact that their professor told them to!) is to attempt to sway another person or group of people in their opinion on a subject.


Make sure you have your desired outcome in mind as you move forward in the writing process.

, Remember that an argumentative essay will argue in support of a particular view in a debatable issue. As such, it is important that you do not choose a topic that is not arguable.For example, writing an argumentative essay on the fact that exercise is good for you would be undesirable because it would be difficult to find contradicting views on the topic; everyone agrees that exercise is good for people.

, You'll be spending a lot of time researching and writing this paper. So it is important for you to choose a topic that you find interesting from the start.


Avoid choosing a topic that has been overdone, or, on the other hand, one that is too obscure (since supporting evidence may be more difficult to find).

, Find a peer (preferably one that holds an oppositional view) to discuss your argument with. This process will help you refine your thinking and develop new ideas to support your judgment.


Try a debate-style conversation in which you each bring up aspects of the controversy and attempt to explain your view on the topic.

, An important aspect of writing an argumentative essay is understanding your audience.


Are you writing the paper for a class, in which case your audience is your professor and your classmates? Or perhaps you are writing it for a presentation to a larger group of people. Regardless, you must think about where your audience is coming from in order to lead them to your desired outcome.
People's backgrounds and experiences often influence how they will react to views different from their own, so it is helpful for you to be knowledgeable about these factors.
You also use different language when addressing different groups of people. For example, you would speak to the pastor at your church differently than you might speak in a casual setting with your best friend. It is important to be mindful of these distinctions when considering your audience.

, It is essential that you understand all of the factors in the situation surrounding your issue. All rhetorical situations contain five basic elements: the text (in your case, the essay), the author (in this case, you), the audience, the purpose or purposes of the communication, and the setting.Rhetorical situations usually involve employing language that is intended to persuade someone toward a particular view or belief. That is why rhetoric is important in an argumentative essay. These types of essays aim to convince the reader that the author's view on the subject is the most correct one., Developing a creative, original title is a fantastic opportunity to hook your reader into wanting to read more of your paper before they even get to the introduction.


A good title will act as a ""preview"" for what your paper will be about. Many titles for academic papers come in two parts, separated by a colon. The first part is often a catchy hook that involves a pun on your topic or an impactful quote, and the second part is usually a sentence that sums up or provides details about your argument., Your thesis statement will be a concise idea that sums up your view on the issue. The thesis usually appears at the end of the introduction paragraph. Having this idea in mind early on in the reading process will help guide your reader through the rest of the paper.


A good thesis statement is concise and clear. It tells the reader what the point of the paper is and why it's important. The thesis must make a claim of some sort.This can be a claim of value (describing the worth of how we view a certain thing), a claim of definition (arguing that the way we define a term or idea needs to be altered in some way), a claim of cause and effect (claiming that one event or thing caused another event or thing), or a claim about policy solutions (arguing that the way we do things needs to be changed for some reason).
Here is an example of a strong thesis statement: Excessive meat consumption in America is the leading cause of pollution today, and, thus, is a significant influence on global warming. This thesis makes a claim (specifically a cause and effect claim) about a debatable topic with a narrow enough focus to create an interesting, manageable argumentative essay.
Here is an example of a weak thesis statement: Pollution is a problem in the world today. This is not a debatable issue; few people would argue that pollution is not a problem. The topic is also too broad. You can't write a paper on every single aspect of pollution.

, This format is constricting and limits the shape your ideas can take to being contained in three basic body paragraphs. Without the three-part thesis statement, your ideas can expand more freely and incorporate ideas that might not fit exactly into the three parts.


An example of a three-part thesis statement might look something like this: Global warming is caused by industrial pollution, automobile exhaust fumes, and waste dumping in the oceans. In this case, you would expect to find three body paragraphs: one about industrial pollution, one about car exhaust fumes, and one about trash in the ocean. Any other causes of pollution would not fit anywhere in this essay, which restricts the meaning and the message of the paper.
Changing the thesis to avoid this form will make for a much more functional essay that is written at a more advanced level. A more effective thesis would be something like this: Due to increasing global temperatures and rising ocean levels, global warming has become an issue that needs to be acknowledged by a wider audience in order to begin reversing the effects.


, This section should briefly explain the essay topic and include relevant background information to familiarize the reader with the topic. As previously mentioned, your thesis statement should appear at the end of the introduction.

, Carefully present information that supports both your argument and opposition. Acknowledge evidence that supports the opposition, but utilize powerful evidence to assert your claim.


There are many different ways to organize your argument,but the most important thing is that you cover all aspects of the issue. Leaving out information simply because it contradicts your thesis idea is unethical as it does not provide an accurate portrayal of the issue.
Be sure to include counterarguments (those ideas that are at odds with your own view), but explain to your reader why your own viewpoint is more logical and accurate, perhaps because the opposing view is based on outdated information, etc. Avoid implicating opposing views as wrong because it could alienate your readers.

, The aim of this section is to reassert your argument and persuade the audience to support your claim. Try to connect the essay topic to the interests and values of the audience.


Be sure to review your main points and restate your thesis. But make sure not to introduce any new information in the conclusion so that you can effectively wrap up what you've already said.
Often, it is helpful to end with a look forward to further research that could be done on the topic in light of what you have said in your paper.

, Go to the library and look up books on the subject. Or look up information from reliable sources on the internet. It is important to find sources that cover all views of the issue since the point of this kind of essay is to provide a well-rounded overview of all aspects of the topic. Collecting evidence and information that supports both your argument and the opposing view will strengthen your essay.


Ask a reference librarian for assistance in finding reputable, useful sources for your argument. They will probably be happy to help you.

, The best research acknowledges the foundational work on a given subject, but also interrogates innovations in the field and divergences from the status quo. You do this by looking at sources that are both old (these provide the foundation of the topic) and new (these provide current trends in thought on an issue).

, In order to make your work more credible, it is important to incorporate quotes from sources that are considered scholarly.


Scholarly sources should be written by experts in the field (i.e. use a quote from someone with a PhD in environmental science if you are writing an argumentative paper on the dangers of global warming) or published in scholarly, peer-reviewed outlets. This means that sources are fact-checked by a panel of experts before they are approved for publication.
It is important to remember that anyone can write things on the internet without any kind of publication standards for accuracy, so using blogs and many websites is not a good idea in an academic paper.

, When you use quotes in a paper, you must cite them properly. If you don't cite your sources, this is a form of plagiarism because you are not giving credit to the people whose ideas you are using in your paper.


Citing sources involves writing quotation marks ("") around the verbatim quotes and then including a parenthetical in-text citation at the end of the quote that refers to a source listed on the Bibliography or Works Cited page at the end of your paper.
There are several different formatting methods that are used in different fields.For example, in English departments they use MLA formatting and in history departments they usually implement Chicago style formatting.

, Often, it's possible to get so wrapped up in your own writing that it's easy to skip over obvious errors and mistakes. Take a break from writing for at least a few hours. Sometimes leaving your work for a couple of days can be incredibly beneficial as well. Looking at your work with fresh eyes will allow you to see the errors you previously overlooked because you were so involved in the writing that you could only see what you meant to say rather than what you actually said.

, Here are some of the most common grammar mistakes:


Sentence fragments.Fragments are incomplete phrases that cannot stand alone as a sentence because they are missing either a verb, a noun, or a complete thought.
Parallelism.Errors in parallelism occur when words or groups of words do not appear in the same format or structure within a sentence.
Subject-verb agreement.Errors with subject-verb agreement happen when an incorrect verb form is used with a particular subject. For example, he know instead of he knows.


, Formatting quotes properly allows your reader to easily find the information you are referencing. It also adds to your credibility as an author.

Be honest about your strengths and weaknesses when devising your plan.For example, if you are a good researcher but not great at editing, spend less time on the research section in favor of spending more time on the revising section.
Make sure to schedule breaks for yourself to refresh your brain and recharge yourself.
An example of a plan for a one-day essay writing project might look like this:
8:00 – 9:30 – Consider an essay question and argument for the topic.
9:30 – 9:45 – Take a short break.
10:00 – 12:00 – Conduct research.
12:00 – 13:00 – Outline the essay.
13:00 – 14:00 – Take a lunch break.

19:00 – 20:00 – Take a dinner break.
20:00 – 22:30 – Revise and copy edit your essay.
22:30 – 23:00 – Print and prepare your essay submission.;
, You may know the topic of an essay when your teacher assigns it to you, but even if you don’t, first consider the question and different ways you could make arguments about the topic. Doing this preliminary brainstorming will not only direct you towards the appropriate research, it will help the writing process go more quickly.Make sure you understand what the question is asking for! If you provide a summary when the essay prompt asked you to “analyze,” you’re unlikely to do very well.
If you don’t have an essay topic, choose a subject that interests you and consider the essay question afterward. You are more likely to write a good essay on a topic that you’re interested in.

, Your argument or thesis statement is the point you’re making in the essay through evidence and analysis. Develop your argument to help direct your research and make the writing process go more quickly.If you don’t have much experience with your topic, it might be difficult to develop an argument. You can still consider your argument and then use your research to support or refute the claims you want to make.
A good exercise to help you quickly figure out your essay question and argument is to write “I am studying (choose a topic) because I want to know (what do you want to know) in order to show (this is where your argument goes).”For example, “I am studying the medieval witch trials because I want to know how lawyers employed evidence in their cases in order to show that the trial process influenced modern medical techniques and legal practices.”Consider counter-arguments in order to strengthen your essay.

, You’ll need to strategically research your topic to find the evidence that will help you construct your argument and form the body of your essay. There are many different types of sources you can use for research, from online journals and newspaper archives to primary sources at the library.Since you don’t have a lot of time to write, focus on one or two places where you can do research. For example, the library and internet offer many different options for sources.Just make sure that you use reliable sources, such as peer-reviewed journals, government and university websites, and newspapers and magazines written by professionals. Don’t use personal blogs, obviously biased sources, or sources that don’t have professional credentials.
You can draw upon information you know to speed up the research process. Simply find a (reliable!) source to support it and include it in your sources.Doing preliminary research online can point you to sources in a library such as books and journal articles. It can also point you in the direction of web sources including newspaper article archives or other research on your topic.
If you're reading books, ""gut"" the book to get through it quickly and move on to other sources. To ""gut"" a book, skim the introduction and conclusion to find the main arguments, and then pick a few details from the body of the book to use as evidence.Take notes on your research sources. These will show that you’ve legitimately researched the topic while giving credit to the person who forwarded the idea.This is especially important if you plan to use direct quotes and will also help you add footnotes and bibliographic information to your essay without having to look them up in the sources.

, Construct an outline of your essay to guide you through the writing process. By structuring it in the same form as your essay and adding evidence, you will simplify and expedite the writing process. You’ll also be able to identify any areas that need better development.Structure your outline as you will your essay, with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion.
The more detail you put into your outline, the easier and more quickly you can write the essay. For example, instead of just writing a basic paragraph about the body, flesh it out into bullet points or sentences that presents argument and supporting evidence., Allotting a specific amount of time can help you write more quickly because it puts pressure on you to perform. Set up your working environment so that you don't have any distractions during this time and allow yourself to write freely.Nothing will keep you from finishing an essay on time like goofing off online or ending up watching eight straight hours of Cartoon Network. Turn the TV off, switch your phone to silent, and exit out of Facebook and other social media/chat sites.
Make sure you have all your material nearby when you start to write. Getting up to fetch a book or a piece of paper or a snack will eat into your precious time.

, The introduction does exactly what the word says: it explains to the reader what you’re going to say in the essay. The introduction should grab, or hook, your reader’s attention and entice them to read the rest of the essay.The most important part of your introduction is your argument or thesis statement. This tells the reader the point your trying to make in the essay.Write a “hook” that will grab the reader’s attention to start, then introduce the argument with a few relevant facts woven into the narrative. End by stating how you will demonstrate your points.An example of a hook could be, “People say Napoleon had a complex because of his size, but he was actually an average height for the time in which he lived.”
It is sometimes helpful to write the introduction after have written the body so you know how to introduce the topic and your arguments best.A good rule of thumb is to not have the introduction be more the 10% of your essay. Thus, for a five page essay, you shouldn’t write more than one paragraph., The body of your essay will contain the substantive points that support your thesis statement or argument. Analyzing two to three main points will strengthen your argument and add more words to your overall total.Pick two to three main points to help make your argument or thesis statement. Any fewer and you won’t have enough evidence for your argument and any more may make you not explore each point thoroughly enough.Keep your evidence to support the main points concise. Going off on explanatory tangents will cost you precious time.
Support your main points with the evidence compiled during your research. Make sure to explain how the evidence supports your claims!If haven’t reached your word limit, pick a main point and conduct more research on it to expand on your point., If you’re writing quickly, it will simplify the process to write easy sentences without difficult grammatical structures. This also makes it less likely that you’ll improperly use convoluted jargon.Avoid ""fat"" language when you write. Text that includes long prepositional phrases, passive verbs, and paragraphs that don't further your argument waste time that you could spend writing or revising your essay., It’s easier to draft text and subsequently edit than it is to work with nothing. By just allowing yourself to write freely, you’re assured to have some text that you have something to shape during the revision process.Free-writing can also help you overcome writer’s block that results from not knowing how to say something. If you’re struggling with getting the wording of an idea just right, write it as well as you can and come back to it later.

, Like the introduction, the conclusion does exactly what the word implies: it brings your essay to an end. It provides a summary of your basic argument and should leave the reader with a strong impression of your work.The essay conclusion should also be relatively short. Aim for the conclusion to be 5-10% of your essay’s total length.
Aim to do more in your conclusion than just restate your thesis and the evidence you used. You could acknowledge the limitations of your argument, suggest a direction for future research, or expand the relevance of your topic to a wider field.
Just as you drew in reader with good introduction, end your conclusion with a sentence that make a lasting impression on your reader., No essay is good when it contains mistakes. Revising and proofreading your will ensure that the essay you composed quickly doesn’t have any glaring errors. It’s also important to revise and proofread so that you leave a good impression on your readers.


Re-read the entire essay. Make sure that you are still arguing the same thing at the end of the essay that you are at the beginning. If not, go back and adjust your thesis.
Make sure that your paragraphs build on one another and don’t feel haphazard. You can use transitions and strong topic sentences to help you draw connections between your paragraphs.
Spelling and grammar are the easiest mistakes to revise, but they cost you a lot of reader goodwill if you don’t fix them., Even though you may only have a few hours to write this essay, taking a few moments at the beginning to develop a quick plan will help you perform at your best.


Read the prompt carefully! If the question asks you to take a position, take one. If it asks you to evaluate the events that led to the downfall of Rome, don’t just give a summary of Roman history.Jot down an idea map. You probably won’t have time to make a formal outline. However, having an idea of the main points that you want to touch on and how they relate will help you structure the essay. If you can’t figure out how to connect your main points, that’s a sign you need to think a little bit more before you start writing.Figure out your argument. Once you’ve noted down some main points, figure out what you want to say about them. Even timed essays need a unified argument or thesis.

, If you must answer more than one essay question during a time period, make sure that you leave yourself enough time to write all of them. It’s also a good idea to check the grade values for your essay questions, too.


For example, you wouldn’t want to spend the same amount of time and effort on a 3-paragraph essay question worth 20% as you would a 2-page essay question worth 60%.
If you see a question that you feel will be more difficult for you, it could be a good idea to tackle it first. This will get the hard stuff out of the way while you’re still fresh.

, All too often, students will write their way into their ideas after spending a whole paragraph on meaningless generalizations. Particularly in timed essays, it is very important to get directly to your main argument and providing evidence for it. Spending too much time on the introduction can leave you with less time to write later.If you notice that your introductory paragraph starts with something broad or hugely general, such as “Throughout the history of time, humans have been fascinated by science,” cut it.
Don’t put anything in a timed essay that doesn’t support your point. If you are talking about the importance of religious belief in modern society, don’t dilute your point by also referencing socialism, Hollywood, and banana farming.

, A common issue with essays, especially those produced under pressure, is that student writers often present evidence without explaining how it links back to their claims. Make sure that you follow the “C-E-E” (Claim-Evidence-Explanation) formula for each paragraph:



Claim. This is the main argument of the paragraph. It is probably located in your topic sentence.

Evidence. This is the supporting detail that proves your claim.

Explanation. This connects the evidence back to your claim and explains why the evidence proves what you say it does.
If anything in your paragraph doesn’t fit one of these three elements, it’s a good sign you don’t need it in the paragraph.

, Even in timed situations, you will want to leave some time to revise. This means more than cleaning up spelling and other minor errors. Read back through your whole essay.Does the essay actually demonstrate and support what your thesis says is the main argument? It’s not uncommon for ideas to evolve as you write. If this has happened, tweak your thesis accordingly.
Do the paragraphs flow smoothly from one to the next? Timed essays don’t have the same standards that regular essays do, but your reader should still be able to follow your argument in a logical progression without feeling yanked around or lost.
Do you offer a conclusion that sums up your argument? Don’t leave the essay hanging without a conclusion. Even if it’s very brief, a conclusion will help your essay feel complete.

You might be inclined to choose a topic that is overly broad or too narrow, which is a common pitfall. Instead, try to choose a topic that is both focused and will also allow you to compose an essay in its entirety. For example, you do not want to compare all of Africa to all of Asia because that topic would be too broad or too general. Instead, you might write an essay that compares the Great Wall of China and the Great Pyramids of Giza, which is focused and specific topic, and which would provide you with enough information to craft an essay that is an appropriate length.;
, Your research will provide you with examples, statistics, quotes, and evidence that will back-up the argument(s) you are making within your essay.Don’t wait until the last minute to begin researching your topic. Research takes a while to complete properly and it is one of the most important components of creating a well-crafted essay.

, While a Google search might offer reputable sources, it will inevitably offer sources that are not worthy of inclusion in your essay. You should consider avoiding:


Wikipedia Personal Blogs
Vlogs or video blogs
Satirical websites

, You might not know where to go to conduct your research and that’s okay. While the Internet has a wealth of information, one of the easiest ways to conduct research is to visit your local library. While at the library, you might try:Reading books on your selected topic.
Browsing scholarly peer-reviewed articles on your topic. These articles can be found through your school’s library online databases and through search engines like Google Scholar.
Reading magazine and news articles on your topic.
Listening to radio interviews or podcasts about your topic.

, Many people are unaware that there is a page layout for an essay. Most essays, regardless of genre and style guide, use the same page layout. Generally, an essay should be typed with 12 point Time New Roman font, double spaced, with one inch margins on the top, bottom, left, and right of the page., If an essay is missing one of its main components, it will not be as effective as an essay that is structured properly. Your essay should include:An introduction
A thesis (your main argument or the main point of your essay)
Supporting examples
A conclusion

, You don’t want to have a wandering or non-existent thesis statement. You also want to avoid having a thesis statement that is pure speculation. Your thesis statement should make an argument, which is often based in opinion, but which you can support with facts, statistics, and other evidence.An example of an arguable thesis would be: The government should decriminalize all drug use and rather than implementing punishment for people caught using drugs, a drug rehabilitation program should be put into place.

, This is a grave offense in colleges and universities. When you borrow another person’s work, be sure to properly credit them in your References or Works Cited page and through internal citations. Check your style guide to know how to reference another person’s work., When you are assigned an essay that requires research, you will be expected to write in a certain format, which will be determined by a style guide. In the humanities, most essays are written in APA Style, MLA Style, or Chicago Manual of Style.These style guides are comprehensive in explaining how to set up your essay, how to gather sources, what sources are acceptable for citation, and how to cite sources. Further, these style guides can be found at: https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/2/.

, The words that you use will determine the effectiveness of your essay. Additionally, your words will demonstrate your intelligence to your audience and will also communicate your respect for them as intelligent readers. When writing try to:


Avoid ambiguous words, or words that shift in meaning depending on context.Use words that have force or urgency by using active voice and avoiding passive voice.Avoid professional jargon, highly technical terminology, or overly specialized terms, so that even a layman can understand your writing. If you end up using a technical term or jargon, be sure to define and explain it in simple terms.
Utilize words that are understandable to a wide range of readers to avoid creating a document with an exclusionary readership, which will alienate all other readers.
Avoid clichés. You might like the idea of a cliché because it is easy to use, but clichés are frowned upon in essays. Clichés are old and overused turns of phrase.Rather than using a cliché, you should be inventive and consider a new way to say what you might have otherwise communicated as a cliché. Consider avoiding the following:
Beginning your essay with famous quotes
Using a definition to introduce us to the entire essay
Writing overly melodramatic prose

, Who is your readership for this essay? Are you writing for your peers? Are you writing for a professor? Are you writing for a fifth grade science class? When you know who your readership is, you are better able to tailor your language and essay content to meet the needs of your audience.


For example, if you are writing an essay on why the sky is blue, your essay would read very differently depending upon whether you are writing it for a college professor or for a class of elementary school children. Despite the fact that the reason for the sky being blue remains the same, your writing style and the included content (technical information, citations, explanation, and examples) should differ between the two audiences.

, As you are reading through your essay, you might notice that you have gone off on a tangent, or that you’ve written in extraneous details, or that you’ve added fluff to your essay. Now is the time to remove any unnecessary information to help focus and improve the flow of your essay. Unnecessary extra information can confuse your reader, and you want to make sure that your essay is clear and concise.

, While you are reading through your essay aloud, you may notice holes in your argument, or places where your ideas benefit from a detailed explanation of what you mean, and perhaps also an example of this. Be sure to add this information to make sure that your reader has a clear sense of what you mean to say., Try to avoid summarizing when you should be analyzing, or using a direct quote where you would do better to paraphrase.And make sure that your essay is focused on the topic you have chosen. Ask yourself:


Do I follow the appropriate structure?
Do I have a strong thesis statement/main argument at the end of my introduction paragraph?
Does everything that follows my thesis statement work to support it?
Have I used enough outside sources?
Have I properly incorporated my sources into my work?
Have I properly cited my sources?
Is my essay specific in its argumentation and logic?
Is my writing clear and concise enough for a reader to follow without issue?

, Edit your essay for grammar. Look for one type of grammatical issue at a time.While this may take you a bit of time, only looking for one type of grammatical issue at a time ensures that you won’t miss any glaring errors.

, Avoid repetition of words in your essay whenever possible, and instead try to introduce some variation into your writing. One of the ways you can do this is to utilize a thesaurus to learn new ways to say words you tend to use often. Another way to do this is to avoid vague words such as “stuff” or “things.”You want your words to evoke for your reader a clear picture of what you mean to say.

, Proofread your work. One of the easiest ways to do this is to use the spell check feature in your word processor. Spell check in Microsoft Word, for example, will catch all blatant misspellings and incorrect punctuation. When homophones are concerned, spell check often fails and careful attention by the author or an editor is needed. For instance, if you write “their,” but you meant to write “there,” Microsoft Word may not catch the error."

Write a body paragraph for a subject-by-subject compare and contrast essay.",How to Write a Compare and Contrast Essay," The first step to writing a successful compare and contrast essay is to pick two subjects that are different enough to be compared. There are several things to consider when choosing your subjects:You could pick two subjects that are in the same “category” but have differences that are significant in some way. For example, you could choose “homemade pizza vs. frozen grocery store pizza.”
You could pick two subjects that don’t appear to have anything in common but that have a surprising similarity. For example, you could choose to compare bats and whales. (One is tiny and flies, and the other is huge and swims, but they both use sonar to hunt.)
You could pick two subjects that might appear to be the same but are actually different. For example, you could choose ""The Hunger Games movie vs. the book."";
, “Meaningful” comparisons and contrasts do more than simply point out that “Topic A and Topic B are both similar and different.” A good compare and contrast essay will help your readers understand why it’s useful or interesting to put these two subjects together.For example, ask yourself: What can we learn by thinking about “The Hunger Games” and “Battle Royale” together that we would miss out on if we thought about them separately?
It can be helpful to consider the “So what?” question when deciding whether your subjects have meaningful comparisons and contrasts to be made. If you say “The Hunger Games and Battle Royale are both similar and different,” and your friend asked you “So what?” what would your answer be? In other words, why bother putting these two things together?

, You probably won’t be able to jump straight from deciding on your topic to having a thesis, and that’s okay. Take a little time to brainstorm about how your chosen subjects are similar and different. This will help you see which points are the major ones you want to focus on, and can help guide you when you formulate your thesis.


A “Venn diagram” can often be helpful when brainstorming. This set of overlapping circles can help you visualize where your subjects are similar and where they differ. In the outer edges of the circle, you write what is different; in the overlapping middle area, you write what’s similar.You can also just draw out a list of all of the qualities or characteristics of each subject. Once you’ve done that, start looking through the list for traits that both subjects share. Major points of difference are also good to note.

, You won’t be able to provide a list of every single way in which your subjects are similar and/or different in your essay. (And that’s not the goal, anyway.) Instead, choose a few points that seem to be particularly important.


For example, if you are comparing and contrasting cats and dogs, you might notice that both are common household pets, fairly easy to adopt, and don’t usually have many special care needs. These are points of comparison (ways they are similar).
You might also note that cats are usually more independent than dogs, that dogs may not provoke allergies as much as cats do, and that cats don’t get as big as many dogs do. These are points of contrast (ways they are different).
These points of contrast can often be good places to start thinking about your thesis, or argument. Do these differences make one animal a superior type of pet? Or a better pet choice for a specific living situation (e.g., an apartment, a farm, etc.)?

, There are many directions a compare-and-contrast thesis can take, but it should always make an argument that explains why it’s useful to put these two subjects together in the first place. For example:


Show readers why one subject is more desirable than the other. Example: ""Cats are better pets than dogs because they require less maintenance, are more independent, and are more adaptable.""
Help readers make a meaningful comparison between two subjects. Example: ""New York City and San Francisco are both great cities for young professionals, but they differ in terms of their job opportunities, social environment, and living conditions.""
Show readers how two subjects are similar and different. Example: ""While both The Catcher in the Rye and To Kill a Mockingbird explore the themes of loss of innocence and the deep bond between siblings, To Kill a Mockingbird is more concerned with racism while The Catcher in the Rye focuses on the prejudices of class.""
In middle school and high school, the standard format for essays is often the “5-paragraph form,” with an introduction, 3 body paragraphs, and a conclusion. If your teacher recommends this form, go for it. However, you should be aware that especially in college, teachers and professors tend to want students to break out of this limited mode. Don’t get so locked into having “three main points” that you forget to fully explore your topic.

, There are several ways to organize a compare-and-contrast essay. Which one you choose depends on what works best for your ideas. Remember, you can change your organization later if you decide it isn’t working.Subject by subject. This organization deals with all of the points about Topic A, then all of the points of Topic B. For example, you could discuss all your points about frozen pizza (in as many paragraphs as necessary), then all your points about homemade pizza. The strength of this form is that you don’t jump back and forth as much between topics, which can help your essay read more smoothly. It can also be helpful if you are using one subject as a “lens” through which to examine the other. The major disadvantage is that the comparisons and contrasts don’t really become evident until much further into the essay, and it can end up reading like a list of “points” rather than a cohesive essay.Point by point. This type of organization switches back and forth between points. For example, you could first discuss the prices of frozen pizza vs. homemade pizza, then the quality of ingredients, then the convenience factor. The advantage of this form is that it’s very clear what you’re comparing and contrasting. The disadvantage is that you do switch back and forth between topics, so you need to make sure that you use transitions and signposts to lead your reader through your argument.

Compare then contrast. This organization presents all the comparisons first, then all the contrasts. It’s a pretty common way of organizing an essay, and it can be helpful if you really want to emphasize how your subjects are different. Putting the contrasts last places the emphasis on them. However, it can be more difficult for your readers to immediately see why these two subjects are being contrasted if all the similarities are first., Outlining your essay will help you work out the main organizational structure and will give you a template to follow as you develop your ideas. No matter how you decided to organize your essay, you will still need to have the following types of paragraphs:Introduction. This paragraph comes first and presents the basic information about the subjects to be compared and contrasted. It should present your thesis and the direction of your essay (i.e., what you will discuss and why your readers should care).

Body Paragraphs. These are the meat of your essay, where you provide the details and evidence that support your claims. Each different section or body paragraph should tackle a different division of proof. It should provide and analyze evidence in order to connect those proofs to your thesis and support your thesis. Many middle-school and high-school essays may only require three body paragraphs, but use as many as is necessary to fully convey your argument.

Acknowledgement of Competitive Arguments/Concession. This paragraph acknowledges that other counter-arguments exist, but discusses how those arguments are flawed or do not apply.

Conclusion. This paragraph summarizes the evidence presented. It will restate the thesis, but usually in a way that offers more information or sophistication than the introduction could. Remember: your audience now has all the information you gave them about why your argument is solid. They don’t need you to just reword your original thesis. Take it to the next level!

, Let's say you're working with the following statement: ""When deciding between whether to go camping in the woods or spend a day at the beach, one should consider the following points: the weather, the types of activities each location offers, and the facilities at each location."" A subject-by-subject comparison would deal first with the woods, and then with the beach. This method of organization can be unwieldy, so if you choose it, be sure not to let your paragraphs become page-long lists of points about each subject. You can still have a paragraph per point about each subject; you’ll just put all the paragraphs about each subject together. A subject-to-subject body paragraph outline could look like this:Introduction: state your intent to discuss the differences between camping in the woods or on the beach.
Body Paragraph 1 (Woods): Climate/Weather
Body Paragraph 2 (Woods): Types of Activities and Facilities
Body Paragraph 3 (Beach): Climate/Weather
Body Paragraph 4 (Beach): Types of Activities and Facilities
Conclusion

, This is the more common method used in the comparison and contrast essay.You can write a paragraph about each characteristic of both locations, comparing the locations in the same paragraph. For example, in this case, you could write one paragraph describing the weather in both the woods and the beach, one paragraph describing the activities in each location, and a third describing the facilities in both. Here's how the essay could look:Introduction
Body Paragraph 1: Discuss first difference between woods and beaches: climate/weather.

Woods
Beach


Body Paragraph 2: Discuss second difference between woods and beaches: types of activities.

Woods
Beach


Body Paragraph 3: Discuss third difference between woods and beaches: available facilities.

Woods
Beach


Conclusion

, This type of organization works best for when you want to emphasize the contrasts between your subjects. First, you discuss how your subjects are similar. Then, you end with how they’re different (and, usually, how one is superior). Here’s how your essay could look with this organization:


Introduction
Body Paragraph 1: Similarity between woods and beaches (both are places with a wide variety of things to do)
Body Paragraph 2: First difference between woods and beaches (they have different climates)
Body Paragraph 3: Second difference between woods and beaches (there are more easily accessible woods than beaches in most parts of the country)
Body Paragraph 4: Emphasis on the superiority of the woods to the beach
Conclusion

, Once you've chosen an organizational method for your body paragraphs, you'll need to have an internal organization for the body paragraphs themselves. Each of your body paragraphs will need to have the three following elements:


Topic sentence: This sentence introduces the main idea and subject of the paragraph. It can also provide a transition from the ideas in the previous paragraph.
Body: These sentences provide concrete evidence that support the topic sentence and main idea.
Conclusion: this sentence wraps up the ideas in the paragraph. It may also provide a link to the next paragraph’s ideas.

, Once you’ve outlined your essay, it should be fairly simple to find evidence for your arguments. Look at the lists and diagrams you generated to help you find the evidence for your comparisons and contrasts.


If you are having trouble finding evidence to support your argument, go back to your original texts and try the brainstorming process again. It could be that your argument is evolving past where it started, which is good! You just need to go back and look for further evidence.

, Don’t just provide a list of “ways Topic A and Topic B are similar and different.” In your body paragraphs as well as your conclusion, remind your readers of the significance of your evidence and argument.


For example, in a body paragraph about the quality of ingredients in frozen vs. homemade pizza, you could close with an assertion like this: “Because you actively control the quality of the ingredients in pizza you make at home, it can be healthier for you than frozen pizza. It can also let you express your imagination. Pineapple and peanut butter pizza? Go for it! Pickles and parmesan? Do it! Using your own ingredients lets you have fun with your food.” This type of comment helps your reader understand why the ability to choose your own ingredients makes homemade pizza better.

, “Essay Number One” may say exactly what the paper is, but it’s not going to win any points for style. A good essay title will preview something about the paper’s argument or topic. Depending on your audience and the situation, you may make a joke or a pun, ask a question, or provide a summary of your main point.

, One of the most common mistakes student writers make is to not give themselves enough time to take a step back from their essays for a day or two. Start early so that you can let your finished draft sit for a day, or at least a few hours. Then, come back to it with fresh eyes. You’ll find it easier to see holes in your logic or organizational flaws if you’ve had time to take a break.


Reading your essay aloud can also help you find problem spots. Often, when you’re writing you get so used to what you meant to say that you don’t read what you actually said.

, Look out for any grammatical errors, confusing phrasing, and repetitive ideas. Look for a balance in your paper: you should provide about the same amount of information about each topic to avoid bias. Here are some things to consider before you turn in your paper:


Avoid bias. Don't use overly negative or defamatory language to show why a subject is unfavorable; use solid evidence to prove your points instead.
Avoid first-person pronouns unless told otherwise. In some cases, your teacher may encourage you to use “I” and “you” in your essay. However, if the assignment or your teacher doesn’t mention it, stick with third-person instead, like “one may see” or “people may enjoy.” This is common practice for formal academic essays.
Proofread! Spelling and punctuation errors happen to everyone, but not catching them can make you seem lazy. Go over your essay carefully, and ask a friend to help if you’re not confident in your own proofreading skills.

, Here is a sample paragraph for a body paragraph that uses point-by-point comparison:


""When one is deciding whether to go to the beach or the woods, the type of activities that each location offers are an important point to consider. At the beach, one can enjoy the water by swimming, surfing, or even building a sandcastle with a moat that will fill with water. When one is in the woods, one may be able to go fishing or swimming in a nearby lake, or one may not be near water at all. At the beach, one can keep one's kids entertained by burying them in sand or kicking around a soccer ball; if one is in the woods, one can entertain one's kids by showing them different plans or animals. Both the beach and the woods offer a variety of activities for adults and kids alike.""

, Here is a sample paragraph for a body paragraph that uses subject-by-subject comparison:


""The beach has a wonderful climate, many activities, and great facilities for any visitor's everyday use. If a person goes to the beach during the right day or time of year, he or she can enjoy warm, yet refreshing water, a cool breeze, and a relatively hot climate. At the beach, one can go swimming, sunbathe, or build sandcastles. There are also great facilities at the beach, such as a changing room, umbrellas, and conveniently-located restaurants and changing facilities. The climate, activities, and facilities are important points to consider when deciding between the beach and the woods.""

Temporarily block websites that you know might distract you, such as social media websites and apps.
Some people prefer to use earplugs to block or reduce out any ambient noise.
Let others around you know that you have to work on an assignment and would appreciate not being disturbed.
Call off anything you'd plan to do otherwise. Explain that you have a last minute essay to finish. Be persistent if people try to pull you away from your work: ""I'd go out if I could, but I have to finish this essay. Maybe tomorrow?"";
, Wherever you are working to write the essay, make sure it is clear of clutter and is comfortable. Just don’t take things too far. You’re trying to make your workspace conducive to writing, but if you find yourself trying to deep clean your entire house before you write your essay, you’re probably just procrastinating. , This includes any textbooks, notes, articles, research, etc., as well as your computer and/or writing utensils.


If you have any other things that help you write, like snacks or coffee, have those easily available as well. You’ll need to stay energized and comfortable throughout the writing process.

, Once you have everything you need to start writing, take a moment to focus before you begin. Breathe in, and try to focus your mind on the essay you are about to write. Motivate yourself by thinking about how you are now ready to tackle the task of writing, rather than stressing about how you don’t have enough time: ""I can do this. I've got everything I need in front of me. I just need to focus for X amount of time, and then I'll be through with this essay.""

, Pulling an ""all nighter"" is not recommended when trying to write an essay, as it can leave you exhausted and your work seeming unfocused. If you are in a situation where you have to do this, however, a few guidelines will help you to do the best you can:Save caffeine for when you really need it. Try to avoid having too much early on in the process, because caffeine will eventually cause you to mentally ""crash.""
Don't get too comfortable. Write in a place that means ""work"" to you, such as a desk, study room, or library. Try not to get in your pajamas or lie in bed. You'll want to keep your mind on writing, not drifting off to sleep.
Get some exercise now and then. Get up from your work to walk around for a few minutes, or do a few pushups, etc. once in a while while working on your essay. A little bit of exercise will help keep you energized and stay focused.
Get plenty of sleep the next day. You will need to recover from your lack of sleep.

, Look over any prompt or guidelines you have for writing the essay very carefully. Sometimes fully understanding the assignment is half the battle.You will want to make sure you follow any instructions you are given regarding the length, format, and content of the essay. Usually, the keys to writing a great essay are there in the prompt.


For example, if you are writing for a literature class and a prompt asks you to ""illustrate your argument with specific evidence,"" you'll know that means the essay will need to quote directly from the text you are reading.

, Choose a style you prefer (bullet points, a diagram, brief sentences, etc.). The outline doesn’t necessarily have to be very extensive, but at the very least you should jot down the main points you think your essay will make.When making your outline, work closely with the texts or research you will use to write the essay. Look for key points and quotations that you think you might incorporate into the essay, and make a note of them.
While it might seem like stopping to make an outline will eat up precious time, it will actually help you write more efficiently and clearly.Having a few points in mind, and a sense of direction, will keep the essay from rambling.

, This is especially the case if you are working on a paper that requires research or outside readings. It is tempting to put off the actual writing of the essay by doing more research, but the preparation has to come to an end so you can begin your work.You can always come back to your research while you are writing or revising if you think you need to incorporate more.

, Many rushed papers lack a strong thesis.Spending extra time focusing your main objective will result in a stronger essay. What question will your essay address?


Sometimes, an essay prompt gives you a specific question to answer, and sometimes you are asked to develop your own, so read your assignment directions carefully. Whatever the case, your thesis is your specific answer to the question.

, This means that you will be working to convince your reader of your point by providing evidence to back it up.Write out your thesis when you are making your outline. If it sounds like too obvious of a point, revise it until it seems more arguable. A thesis is more than a topic or statement of fact.


""United States government"" is an example of a topic or subject.
""The United States government is comprised of three branches: the legislative, the judicial, and the executive"" is a statement of fact.
""The structural division of the United States government into the legislative, judicial, and executive branches is responsible for the long-term stability of the nation"" is an example of a thesis because it would leave a reader expecting you to explain further. They might wonder, for example, why you think the branches of the government are responsible for the nation's stability, as opposed to economic or cultural factors, and you essay has the opportunity to explain and answer this.

, There are several kinds of theses. For example, an expository thesis explains something to readers, while an analytical thesis breaks down a topic into parts and evaluates them. Even an essay based on a narrative (story) will benefit from a clear thesis.Read your prompt or assignment sheet carefully to understand which kind of thesis you need for your essay.


A prompt that asks you to ""Evaluate the relationship between the branches of the United States government,"" for example, seeks an analytical thesis. On the other hand, a prompt that asks you to ""Describe the process by which the United States government was divided into three branches"" is asking you to narrate a sequence of events.

, The introduction is a very important part of an essay—perhaps the most important—because it orients your reader and explains your argument.For the first draft, however, don’t agonize over it. You just need to begin writing. The introduction doesn’t have to be perfect in the first draft, because you can come back and edit it later. Get something down, and it will help you move confidently forward.


When you are pressed for time, don't worry too much about writing a creative introduction--just try to write one that is clear and focused. If you have time left at the end, you can come back and try to improve it.
A simple but effective plan is to make sure that your introduction states your essay's thesis, and gives an overview of what the subsequent paragraphs or sections will discuss. Your outline will help you do this. A simple version of this would look something like ""In this essay, I will first describe X, before moving on to Y and Z. Then, I will explain the relationship between X,Y, and Z, demonstrating that .""

, Take the writing of the essay bit by bit, following the outline you made. This will keep your writing on track, and keeping your plan in mind will encourage you to keep going.

, If you're wavering between describing Shakespeare as a ""great"" writer, or ""the greatest,"" for example, just pick one for now and move on.You’ll be able to deal with such things when you do a final read-through of the essay. When time is short, you will write more productively, and keep your morale up, if you keep pushing through with more writing. , If you are quoting another work, cite it according to the style (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.) your instructor wants you to use. Even if you are just paraphrasing a work, you should cite it. If you don’t properly cite your sources, you are plagiarizing. As a rule of thumb, if you got an idea or information from a source outside of your own head, you should cite it.It is far easier to cite while you are writing than to go back and try to add in citations after you have written your paper. Keep up with them as you go.

, While you have to work quickly, take a short break from writing now and then, especially if you get stuck—just don’t get distracted and take too long.


Some prefer to take scheduled breaks, by setting a timer or watching a clock. Others prefer to take a break after reaching a convenient stopping point, such as the end of a paragraph or page. Whatever method you choose, make a note of where to pick back up when you return to writing.Take a breath, get up, have a drink or snack. By taking a short break, you’re not wasting time—you’re actually helping yourself write more efficiently by clearing your head and relieving stress., Look back over your essay and make sure one last time that your thesis makes sense and is arguable, and that your writing supports it. Editing at the end is a critically important step.While it can be tempting to consider yourself done once you have a draft, you can greatly improve your essay (and eventual grade) if you take some time to review it and make any necessary changes.
Review your essay’s structure, organization, and style. Make sure your paragraphs proceed in a logical way; move them around if they don’t. Now is also the time to go back and edit any of your sentences for word choice, clarity, and grammar.

, If you're really pressed for time, then probably the most beneficial things you can do to improve your essay are to make a reverse outline and to revise your introduction.A reverse outline is a great, quick strategy to check the logic of your essay’s structure.To do this, you create an outline from your finished draft, jotting down the main ideas of your essay paragraph by paragraph. The result will look much like an outline you would create before writing an essay, but you can use it to double-check your finished product.
Editing your introduction can clarify your thesis and make your essay stronger. While you made your outline and began writing your essay with a certain idea of what your thesis or ""point"" was, that idea probably changed at least slightly as you wrote the essay itself. Go back to the intro after you have finished a draft of the essay and make any changes to the wording of your thesis based on what the rest of the essay says (the reverse outline will help figure this out).

, At the final stage of writing, do a quick check of your essay for any remaining spelling and grammatical errors.


Electronic spelling and grammar checkers can help you out, but don’t rely on them to do all the work. Always do a read-through before submitting your work.
The most efficient technique for catching mistakes is to read your work out loud.Get someone you know and trust to proofread your work, if you can. A pair of fresh eyes can catch mistakes you might have overlooked.

, Print the essay if you need to. If you are submitting electronically, do everything you can to make sure the file type is correct and the file was received.

Keep a list of these things by you as you work.Many comparative essay assignments will signal their purpose by using words such as ""compare,"" ""contrast,"" ""similarities,"" and ""differences"" in the language of the prompt.
Also see whether there are any limits placed on your topic.;
, While some essays may be simple compare/contrast essays, others may ask you to begin with that framework and then develop an evaluation or argument based on your comparisons. For these essays, simply pointing out that things are similar or different will not be sufficient.The assignment will generally ask guiding questions if you are expected to incorporate comparison as part of a larger assignment. For example: ""Choose a particular idea or theme, such as love, beauty, death, or time, and consider how two different Renaissance poets approach this idea."" This sentence asks you to compare two poets, but it also asks how the poets approach the point of comparison. In other words, you will need to make an evaluative or analytical argument about those approaches.
If you're unclear on what the essay prompt is asking you to do, talk with your instructor. It's much better to clarify questions up front than discover you've written the entire essay incorrectly.

, Even though you are being asked to write a comparison essay, the inclusion of contrasting material is also implied. The best place to start is to write a list of things that the items you are comparing have in common as well as differences between them., It is likely that you will not be able to write about everything on your list. Read through the list and try to identify a theme or patterns among items that are listed. This can help you decide on the basis of your comparison.


You may want to develop a system such as highlighting different types of similarities in different colors.
For example, if you are comparing two novels, you may want to highlight similarities in characters in pink, settings in blue, and themes or messages in green.

, This provides the context for your comparison: how will you examine these two things? Among other things, the basis could be a theoretical approach, such as feminism or multiculturalism; a question or problem that you wish to discover an answer for; or a historical theme, such as colonialism or emancipation.The comparison needs to have a specific thesis or overarching idea that determines the reason why you are comparing the two (or more) objects.The basis for your comparison may be assigned to you. Be sure to check your assignment or prompt.
A basis for comparison may have to do with a theme, characteristics, or details about two different things.A basis for comparison may also be known as the “grounds” for comparison or a frame of reference.

, Although you want to have a thorough understanding of both things being compared, it’s important not to provide more details than the assignment can handle. Compare a few aspects of each topic instead of trying to cover both topics comprehensively.


Research may not be required or appropriate for your particular assignment. If your comparative essay is not meant to include research, you should avoid including it.
A comparative essay about historical events, social issues, or science-related topics are more likely to require research, while a comparison of two works of literature are less likely to require research.
Be sure to cite any research data properly according to the discipline in which you are writing (eg, MLA, APA, or Chicago format).

, Every essay should be controlled by a clear, concise thesis statement. Even if your basis for comparison was assigned to you, you need to express in a single sentence why you are comparing the two items. The comparison should reveal something about the nature of the items or their relationship to each other, and your thesis statement should express that argument., Before you start writing, it is best to plan out your organization strategy. A unique feature of a comparative essay is that you have several different organizational strategies to choose from.


Use a traditional outline form if you would like to, but even a simple list of bulleted points in the order that you plan to present them would help.
You can also write down your main points on sticky notes (or type them, print them, and then cut them out) so that you can arrange and rearrange them before deciding on a final order.

, Address both halves of the comparison in each paragraph. This means that the first paragraph will compare the first aspect of each subject, the second will compare the second, and so on, making sure to always address the subjects in the same order.The advantages of this structure are that it continually keeps the comparison in the mind of the reader and forces you, the writer, to pay equal attention to each side of the argument.
This method is especially recommended for lengthy essays or complicated subjects where both the writer and reader can easily become lost. For Example:Paragraph 1: Engine power of vehicle X / Engine power of vehicle YParagraph 2: Stylishness of vehicle X / Stylishness of vehicle YParagraph 3: Safety rating of vehicle X / Safety rating of vehicle Y

, Devote every other paragraph to one of the subjects. This means that the first paragraph will compare one aspect of a subject and the second, the same aspect of the other subject; the third paragraph will compare a second aspect of a subject and the fourth, the same aspect of the second subject – and so on, making sure to always address each subject in the same order.The advantages of this structure are that it allows you to discuss points in greater detail and makes it less jarring to tackle two topics that radically different.
This method is especially recommended for essays where some depth and detail are required. For example:Paragraph 1: Engine power of vehicle XParagraph 2: Engine power of vehicle YParagraph 3: Stylishness of vehicle XParagraph 4: Stylishness of vehicle YParagraph 5: Safety rating of vehicle XParagraph 6: Safety rating of vehicle Y

, This means that the first set of body paragraphs is devoted to addressing every aspect of the first subject and the second set, to addressing every aspect of the second subject, making sure to address each aspect in the same order.This method is by far the most dangerous, as your comparison can become both one-sided and difficult for the reader to follow.
This method is only recommended for short essays with simplistic subjects that the reader can easily remember as (s)he goes along. For example:Paragraph 1: Engine power of vehicle XParagraph 2: Stylishness of vehicle XParagraph 3: Safety rating of vehicle XParagraph 4: Engine power of vehicle YParagraph 5: Stylishness of vehicle YParagraph 6: Safety rating of vehicle Y

, Though you may have been taught to sit down and write your paper from start to finish, this is not only harder, but also more likely to make your thoughts disjointed. Try this instead:



Body paragraphs first. Work through all that information you've been compiling and see what kind of story it tells you. Only when you've worked with your data will you know what the larger point of the paper is.

Conclusion second. Now that you've done all the heavy lifting, the point of your essay should be fresh in your mind. Strike while the iron’s hot.Intro last. This is basically a reorganizing/rephrasing of your conclusion. Make sure you don’t reuse the exact same words/phrases., The first sentence of a body paragraph (often called the topic sentence) prepares the reader for what you’ll be covering in that paragraph, the middle of the paragraph presents the information you've gathered, and the last sentence draws a low-level conclusion based on that information. Be careful not to overstep the bounds of the paragraph by making a much larger point about your two topics; that’s the job of the conclusion paragraph.


Organize your paragraphs using one of the approaches listed in the ""Organizing the Content"" part below. Once you have defined your points of comparison, choose the structure for the body paragraphs (where your comparisons go) that makes the most sense for your data. To work out all the organizational kinks, it’s recommended that you write an outline as a placeholder.
Be very careful not to address different aspects of each subject. Comparing the color of one thing to the size of another does nothing to help the reader understand how they stack up., When the essay’s done, the reader should feel like (s)he learned something and know that the essay is done, not be looking around for missing pages. The conclusion should open by giving a brief, general summary of the points you covered in the body paragraphs, then draw a larger conclusion about your two subjects.(Be careful to base your conclusion in the data and not your personal preferences, especially if your essay prompt has instructed you to keep a neutral tone.) The last sentence of the essay should leave the reader feeling that all the different threads of the essay have been drawn together in a cohesive way.


Be aware that your various comparisons won’t necessarily lend themselves to an obvious conclusion, especially because people value things differently. If necessary, make the parameters of your argument more specific. (Ex. “Though X is more stylish and powerful, Y’s top safety ratings make it a more appropriate family vehicle.”)
When you have two radically different topics, it sometimes helps to point out one similarity they have before concluding. (i.e. ""Although X and Y don't seem to have anything in common, in actuality, they both ....”)

, Start with a general point that establishes the similarity between the two subjects, then move to the specific focus of the essay. At the end of the introduction, write a thesis statement that first announces which aspects of each subject you plan to compare and then states what conclusion you've drawn from them.

, If time is not an issue, the best way to revise your work is to leave it for a day. Go out, have something to eat or drink, have fun - forget about the paragraph/essay until tomorrow. Once you settle down to revise, remember that the two most important things to do are to find problems and to fix them. These should be done separately (i.e., go through and find all the problems you can without correcting them, then tackle them during a second run-through). Although it is tempting to do them at the same time, it is smarter to do them one by one; this ensures you have checked everything and, ultimately, makes the job quicker and more efficient.


If possible, find a friend to look over the essay, as he or she may find problems that you missed.
It sometimes helps to increase or decrease the font size while editing to change the visual layout of the paper. Looking at the same thing for too long makes your brain fill in what it expects instead of what it sees, leaving you more likely to overlook errors.

Polish your work with proofreading.",How to Write a Philosophy Paper," Writing a good philosophy paper takes time and careful planning, so make sure that you begin working on the assignment as soon as possible. Philosophy papers require skillful argument and rational thought, which takes time to develop.Try to begin developing your ideas for your philosophy paper as soon as you get the assignment. Jot down your ideas and use some of your spare time to think about what you want to write about.;
, Before you begin to develop your ideas for the paper, make sure that you have carefully read all of the materials that are related to the assignment. If you read the materials, but do not remember much or do not understand part of what you read, then you should reread the texts before you attempt to work on your paper.Having a solid understanding of the concepts covered in your readings is essential to create an effective paper. Otherwise, your explanation of the philosophy may be flawed or your argument may not hold up.

, Some professors distribute assignment guidelines while others simply describe the assignment in class. Before you start working on your paper, make sure that you have a clear understanding of what your professor is asking you to do.If any part of the assignment is unclear, ask your professor for clarification.

, It is important to keep your audience in mind as you plan your paper and as you write your paper. Your professor is your primary audience member and your classmates might also be part of your audience.You can also think of your audience as a person who has some knowledge of philosophy, but who does not have the same understanding as you do. Therefore, if you introduce a special term or concept, you will need to define it for your audience.

, With philosophy papers, it is best to use quotes from the text only when it is absolutely necessary. The goal of your paper is to explain and evaluate a philosophical argument in your own words. Therefore, you should not rely too heavily on quotes or even paraphrased passages from your sources.Only use a quote when it is necessary to support your point of view.
Make sure to provide a citation for every quote or paraphrase that you use from a source. Include the author’s name as well as a page number.

, All philosophy papers need to have a strong thesis. Your thesis states your position for the paper and you will need to make sure that you stay focused on your thesis and support it throughout your entire paper. Keep in mind that a strong thesis states your position as well as why you hold that position.For example, if you plan to refute Aristotle’s idea that beauty is related to virtue, then you would have to provide a brief explanation of why. One reason that you may cite might be that beautiful people are not always virtuous. In this case, your thesis might be something like, “Aristotle’s concept that beauty is related to virtue is false because beauty is often found in those who lack virtue.”
You will need to place your thesis at the end of the first paragraph in your essay.

, An outline can help you to stay on track as you draft your paper and ensure that you include everything that you need to include.Try making a simple outline that includes:


ideas for your introduction
your thesis
main points of your explanation
main points in your evaluation along with supporting evidence
potential objections and your refutations
ideas for your conclusion

, Writing in a flowery, overly complex way will not make you appear to be more knowledgeable about philosophy. It is better to write in your own voice and use simple, direct language to get your point across. Imagine that you are explaining the concept to a friend and making an argument for why you agree or disagree with this concept. What would you say? What examples would you use?Try to avoid padding your work with extra words. This makes it hard for your readers to understand what you mean.
Look up new words before you used them. If you like to sue the thesaurus feature ow Word when you write, just make sure that you are looking up the meanings of these words before you include them. The thesaurus does not always provide suggestions that are grammatically correct or equivalent in meaning to the original word.

, Your introduction is important because it gives readers a first impression of your paper. The introduction is your chance to grab your readers’ attention and to provide a preview of your argument. That is why it is important to use your introduction wisely.Avoid introductions that provide a sweeping overview of your topic, such as “Since the dawn of time…” or “All people everywhere have wondered….” Instead, jump right into the topic. For example, you might lead in with something like, “Aristotle often draws a line between beauty and virtue in his work.”

, After your introduction, you will need to explain the philosophical argument or concept that you are planning to refute or support. Make sure that you present the philosopher’s ideas in a clear, objective manner.Do not add or leave out any details that might provide you with an advantage when you start to evaluate the philosophy. Otherwise, your professor may consider your argument to be less effective.
Stick to the relevant details of the argument. Do not explain things that you do not plan to argue against in your paper unless they are absolutely necessary for understanding your point., After you have provided a clear explanation of the philosophy, you will need to move on to your evaluation. Your evaluation should work to support your thesis at all times. Do not go back and forth between positions or contradict yourself at any time. Stick to your position no matter what.One great way to support your thesis is by using examples that you draw from personal experiences or that you create. For example, if you are arguing that beauty and virtue are unrelated, then you might give an example of a convicted criminal who many consider to be beautiful.

, A good argument should also acknowledge and refute any objections you’re your opponents might have. Try to identify the strongest objections that an opponent might use to refute your argument and develop responses to these objections.Don’t worry about handling every single objection. Focus on handling the three biggest objections that your opponents might raise.
For example, if you are arguing that beauty and virtue are not related, then you might identify an objection that some studies have demonstrated that some men are less attracted to women with undesirable personality traits, despite their beauty.

, Conclusions are also important because they provide an opportunity for you to summarize, clarify, and emphasize one or more important parts of your paper. Try to conclude your paper in a way that will help your readers to see the relevance and significance of your paper.For example, you might explain what your paper has established or how it has added to a philosophical conversation.If your paper is about Aristotle’s concept of the relationship between virtue and beauty, you might discuss how your findings demonstrate the modern separation of image and personality.

, Revising is easier if you can take a break from what you have written for a few days. After you return to the paper again, you will have a fresh perspective that should help you to improve the content of your work more easily than if you had attempted to revise it right away.


If possible set aside your paper for at least three days, but keep in mind that even setting aside your paper for a few hours before you revise is better than nothing.

, Revision is not about fixing typos and grammatical errors. Revision is about seeing what you have written with new eyes and being willing to make major changes, additions, and deletions if it will improve the content of your paper.When you revisit your paper, read it with a focus on the content. Do your arguments hold up? If not, how might you improve them? Are the concepts in your paper clear and easy to understand? If not, how might you clarify these concepts?

, Having someone else take a look at your paper can also help you to improve your work. Someone who is not too familiar with philosophy may also help you to identify areas where you could offer more helpful details.


Try asking a classmate or friend (preferably someone who you know to be a good writer) to take a look at your paper and give you some feedback.
Many universities also have writing centers where students can make an appointment and get some feedback from a trained writing tutor. This can also help you to develop effective strategies for revising your own work.
You can also make an appointment with your professor if he or she is willing to provide feedback before you submit the paper. Just make sure that you request an appointment at least one week before the paper is due. Otherwise, your professor may not have time to meet with you.

, Proofreading is the final step in the writing process where you check for minor errors and correct them as needed. These little errors can distract your readers, so take time to proofread your work before you submit your final draft.To proofread, go through your paper and correct any typos, grammatical errors, or other minor flaws before you print and/or submit your work. Try reading your paper out loud or reading it backwards one sentence at a time. Mark any errors you find with a highlighter or pencil.

Look for local species that need help.,
Grow naturally.,
Consider your space needs.",How to Help Endangered Animals1," Endangered animals can seem like a far-away problem, but there are likely threatened species, from birds to bears to bugs, in your own neighborhood.


Invasive plants that overrun native vegetation and invasive animals without existing predators can combine to devastate native animal populations. Note the difference between invasive and non-native species; invasive refers specifically to species that thrive and overtake native species. Many non-native plants and animals are just fine. In fact most of our animal and plant foods are not native.
When planting, choose plants and flowers that are native to the area. Native vegetation is more likely to attract native birds, butterflies and other insects, and other animals that may be endangered.
Remove invasive weeds and non-native plantings in favor of local varieties.
Build bird feeders suited to native species.;
, Eliminate the use of chemical pesticides in your yard or garden in favor of natural deterrents. Give your local threatened or endangered species a fighting chance to thrive without dealing with unnecessary toxins. Water runoff can spread pesticide chemicals far from your home as well, so you will be benefiting a larger habitat than you might think.


""Integrated pest management"" is an option that relies on ""natural"" ways to combat pests and unwanted plants. If, for example, you have an aphid problem, try attracting lady bugs that feed on aphids. The feeling among people who practice permaculture (and others as well)is that if you have an abundance of snails or slugs in your garden, the problem isn't the abundance of snails and slugs, it's the lack of ducks who would eat the snails and slugs and keep them in check.
Also, start composting to create natural, ultra-locally sourced fertilizer instead of relying on chemical-laced, long-distance hauled store brands.

, Many people dream of having the huge backyard with the pristine green lawn, but the growing encroachment of humans into wildlife habitats is a major cause of species endangerment.


Consider turning your yard into an edible landscape. In drought-stricken areas like California, focusing on using native and/or drought adapted plants can help animal species survive.
When it is time to move to a new home, think carefully about the amount of space you really need. Also consider the benefits of a smaller space (less mowing, for one!) as well as living in an area of existing development rather than a newly-carved suburban enclave.
If moving is not on your to-do list, consider whether it is possible for you to reduce your footprint on your own property. Would you be able to permit part of your land to return to a more natural state -- for instance, by replacing lawn space with native plantings that you allow to grow freely?

Be sensible and be informed.",How to Make an Essay Appear Longer Than It Is2," Quantity will never replace quality in the knowing eyes of any teacher. It is always better to write a short but excellent paper than one that is long because it has been filled with fluff and nonsense. Keep that in mind before trying out these methods! In addition, some of the methods listed on this page may be considered to be cheating or intellectual laziness by your institution, and could get you in trouble with your teacher or professor. In some schools, colleges and universities, this could be enough to have you removed, even permanently. Know the rules applicable to your institution and heed them.


It is not advisable to use all of the steps suggested below. It will shriek ""obvious attempt at padding out"" and you'll get a fail. If your paper ends up being too long (a possibility if you overdo things), then remove some of the steps. Indeed, if you have the opposite problem of writing too much, check you haven't done any of the things suggested here!
Realize that if you can read this, so can your teacher or professor.
Trying many of these (the font size and margin ones, especially) in a university or college course will most likely result in a fail.

"
"
Format your heading.,
Format your title.,
Make use of line breaks.,
Pay attention to font and font size.,
Use line spacing.,
Play with the margins.,
Focus on character spacing.,
Bold important words and phrases.,
Make use of footers.",How to Make an Essay Appear Longer Than It Is3," In the upper right hand corner, type your name, the date, the assignment name, the class, and your educator's last name. Give each element its own line.

, Once you choose your essay title, write it at the top of the page. Choose a big font size––you can even make it bold and underlined. It helps if you choose a fancy big font. If your title is long, break it in the middle so it takes up two lines instead of one. However, be careful, because if it is too large it will be obvious that you are trying to make the essay seem larger.

, Every time you have to hit the return key, hit it twice. Since it is likely that your paper is spaced, you'll be getting two extra lines––two less lines that you have to write! This can be done after the heading, after the title, and between each paragraph.

, Your educator will most likely make you use the Times New Roman font at 12pt. If you're only turning in a hard copy, make it 12.5 (or 12.3) pt instead. Of course, overriding their preference is at great risk to your results. Also, do a find/replace (COMMAND+F) and replace all periods and commas with a 14 pt font. It's not noticeable while reading, but it does make the paper appear longer.


If you're allowed to use it, use Lucida Sans Typewriter. This is a big font at 12pt. If you need a simpler font, use Arial, Euphemia UCAS or Courier New, which are almost as large. Try not to use ""light fonts"" , such as Gill Sans light, as they will make your essay shorter.

, In Word 2007 and 2010, select all the text in your paper, then click Home → Paragraph → and find the little icon that looks like it's stretching out the text. You can customize line spacing to be anything you want. 2.25 doesn't look obviously different from 2.0.

, Change the margins of the paper just enough so that it's not too obvious. The margin at the bottom of the page is usually easiest to manipulate.

, This one is a little less common, so it works well. Click on Format → Font, go to Character Spacing, and choose expanded spacing. This makes the spacing in between letters a little larger and is not very noticeable.

, Bolding takes up more space. After you type up your paper make some of it bold. Only highlight some of the text, such as a specific point and don't make it too obvious.


Be careful here, as some educators do not want anything in the paper underlined or bolded.

, These can move your bottom margins up, which means less on a page, so you have to write less.


Add info like the page number and your name at the bottom, which adds functionality and you can bring the bottom margin up to put less on a page. Do not have the words right at the bottom, have a line or two after them to give some space and give you a reason to move the margin up.
Make sure not to have your name twice on the first page.

"
"
Make use of topic and concluding sentences.,
Avoid using any contractions.,
Spell out all numbers lower than ten.,
Minimize pronouns.,
Make use of a lot of quotations.,
Be a wordsmith.,
Use CTRL-F and make all periods and/or commas a larger font.

,
Draw out your conclusion.",How to Make an Essay Appear Longer Than It Is4," Restate your opinion in a sentence at the end of each paragraph. Don't use the same sentence word for word, but restating your first sentence at the end of the paragraph can have the effect of making your essay sound considered, professional and well-thought through, in addition to making it longer. However, it can also irritate a details-oriented marker who notes the habit being repeated throughout. Use at your own risk!

, Use as few contractions as possible. Instead of ""it's"" use ""it is"". In academic writing, this has the benefit of making your paper sound more formal. If you're in high school, it will provide good practice for upper level papers, where you're not allowed to use contractions anyway, so it's good training.

, You should always spell out the numbers below ten anyway (instead of using 1, 2, 3 etc). As this is a requirement in formal writing, not only will it make your essay a little longer, it will also make your essay look a little better.

, Instead of saying ""we went swimming"" try using ""my brother, my sister and I went swimming"". Be careful here, though, as this has the tendency to make your essay very wordy very quickly and it may detract from the quality and readability if overused

, Instead of just giving a snippet, include the entire quotation before you proceed to explain it. Be sure to find a way to connect it back to your original thesis, though, as not doing so will have the reader commenting on the left field addition.

, Instead of saying ""This painting is red"", say ""This magnificent artwork is full of vibrant warm colors such as red, brown and mahogany"". In addition to lengthening your essay, you may give off the impression that you're truly passionate about the topic, which is doubly helpful! As with other method, don't overuse this one; you don't want the paper to sound too verbose or embellished.


Use longer words in place of shorter words.
If you're having trouble thinking of ways to make your words longer, you can use your computer's synonym tool to find a longer word to lengthen the line.


,, Conclusions don't have to be limited to one paragraph. A good technique for squeezing out another half a page or a page, depending on the length of the rest of the paper, is to add a conclusion paragraph that simply summarizes the rest of the paper. Then, add another conclusion that draws on the summary and makes a final point about your thesis.

Shop for locally-grown organic produce.,
Reduce, reuse, and recycle.,
Consider alternatives to driving.,
Save energy by turning off lights and electrical appliances when not in use.,
Don't waste water.",How to Help Endangered Animals2," Support farmers who avoid chemical pesticides and can deliver produce to market without significant fuel consumption (and pollution). Every bit of pollution prevention helps endangered species, and you will help make organic farming the socially and financially sensible choice for growers.

, If your municipality has a recycling program, make full use of it. If there isn't a program, work to create one. Keep as much of your waste out of landfills as possible.


Landfills take up valuable space and some waste (like plastic bags and bottles) inevitably seems to make its way into wild habitats or the huge swirls of trash found out at sea, with negative consequences to animal life.
Buy products and food without packaging whenever possible. Take your own bags to the store. This will reduce the amount of garbage and waste you produce, not to mention the pollution resulting from the creation and distribution of this packaging. Whales and tigers will thank you.
Start an initiative to share specialty tools and seldom-used household items among neighbors. There are good examples of people working with their local libraries to have a tool lending section.
Donate used toys, books, games, clothing, etc., to hospitals, shelters, daycares, or charities.
Before throwing something out, consider creative ways of reusing it. A toilet bowl flower pot may not be your style, but that old, beat-up kitchen table might make a nice little workbench.

, Walk or ride a bicycle to work or the market. It's good for your body and produces zero emissions that negatively impact earth's delicate climate balance. Take public transportation when available.


When you do use the car, drive more slowly. Animal-vehicle collisions are on the rise as human and animal habitats increasingly overlap, and this is a particular threat to certain endangered species. , Unplug televisions, computers, and other items that still draw electricity even when turned off. This will stop the ""vampire"" energy drain of these devices.


You will cut pollution that damages the habitats of endangered species while also saving money. Not a bad deal. Make it a habit in your own life and share it with others. Tell them you can save them a buck and help the polar bears.

, Turn off the tap while you brush your teeth and use water-saving devices on your toilet, taps and shower head. Fix leaky pipes and faucets promptly. Even a small drip can waste large amounts of water over time.


Use drip irrigation or other water saving devices in the garden. If legal in your area, consider installing a ""grey water"" system that uses water from showers and sinks in the garden. If you are hardcore, install a composting toilet.
Growing human demand for water leads to changes in freshwater ecosystems, beyond just reducing water levels. For instance, the building of dams to make reservoirs can prevent salmon from reaching their spawning grounds.

"

Support national parks, nature reserves, and wilderness areas that protect endangered animal habitats.,
Leave nature as you find it.,
Join a wildlife preservation group.,
Encourage farmers and large landowners to establish wildlife habitats and leave groves of old trees standing.,
Join your voice with others and be heard.",How to Help Endangered Animals3," Visit them, spend money there, or volunteer at one.


Teach kids about protecting endangered species. Many parks have special programs and tours for children.
When you travel, consider ecotourism in areas struggling to protect large numbers of endangered species. For instance, there are plenty of locals in Madagascar, an island nation east of mainland Africa with a unique and fragile ecosystem, who would like to preserve their endangered species; give them a financial incentive to do so., When you visit a national park or simply take a walk in the woods, follow the rules and do simple things to keep the area pristine: pick up your trash; follow fire regulations; leave flowers, eggs, and even rocks and logs where you find them. Take only pictures and leave only footprints.

, There are numerous national and international organizations that work to protect endangered species, and you may also find local organizations in your area. They might be doing things as simple as weed removal and native planting in the local nature preserve. Join them, or start a group yourself.

, If you know someone in this situation, inform them of the benefits of doing so. If not, join an organization that supports farmers and others in making this choice.

, They say the ""squeaky wheel gets the grease"" for a reason. If you believe endangered species deserve protection for their benefit and ours, let people know. Increased awareness is the first step toward making positive change.


Contact your elected representatives. Ask them to support not only legislation that protects endangered species here at home or supports the effort abroad, but also measures to reduce pollution and tackle climate change.
Speak out in your community. Help make fliers. Talk at a school, library, or community center. In a friendly but resolute manner, assist people in seeing the bigger picture, how the little things we do (or don't do) impact the whole system, including species endangerment. Tell them how the loss of species creates a ripple effect that will in some way impact them as well, and not just in what animals they can see at the zoo.

Be aware that the local parish must embody ecological solutions.,
Avoid competitive ideas.,
Consider how the local pastor can begin to do something.",How to Green Your Parish or Church4,",, If the Orthodox Church and her agencies do not provide a whole witness for right Christian behavior, then who will? The modern world brings challenges to the local parish that are substantially different from the demands of the past: secularism is more virulent; the social and cultural fabric does not support Orthodoxy; distractions and temptations abound from media, sports, entertainment and a myriad of local issues. Faced with these challenges, in addition to the cycle of services, sermons and pastoral counseling, local issues of fund raising, baptisms and classes, how can one more issue such as ecology find a place in the parish?

, Some pastors and parishioners see ecology as competing with an already overloaded schedule of parish concerns. But is this an accurate way to view ecology? Ecology, in an Orthodox context, is not a new thing: it is the ancient ‚Äúeconomia‚Äù of salvation as applied to daily life; it is the context of all issues; most especially, it is God‚Äôs providence extended through human agency into social activity. To allow this process to begin, a list of introductory principles and functions follow. The process of awakening parish ecological activity is divided into four general areas of focus: priest, parish, and parishioners.

, There are many activities embraced within the framework of a healing spiritual-ecological activity. The basic theme for the pastor is teacher by example.


The parish priest starts in his home and begins to make deliberate, step-by-step changes, modeling the direction in which the parish will proceed.
The parish priest is the shepherd of the flock. He demonstrates the virtues of temperance and restraint and teaches that immersion into the consumer mentality involves the sins of greed, gluttony and lust, which lead to what the Fathers call ‚""insensibility."" He invokes the Orthodox saints to obtain inspiration on working with the deeper elements of Western culture. He prays for the spiritual growth and the ecological awakening of his parishioners and the whole community. He teaches the acquisition of the virtues and family ascesis as defined within the gospel as it relates to consumerism and lifestyle. He embraces elementary ecological practices, such as recycling, the elimination of all styrofoam, and the use of recycled papers.
Offer an occasional class as well as a series of sermons on Orthodoxy and the ecological predicament which is open to other interested people. He explains that ecological degradation involves hidden and unaddressed sin. The priest transmits a spiritual vision of Christ in all things. His emphasis is that ecological practice is not a new thing, but the traditional Orthodox patristic teachings as applied to the decadence of modern culture.
Essentially, the priest presents the ecological crisis so that it gets to peoples‚Äô hearts. Without this felt dimension of ecological sin, there is little motivation for change to take place. This is a pastoral responsibility. Overall, the priest‚Äôs goal is to teach the Orthodox theology of creation and its implications for lifestyle and to emphasize these as integral elements of Orthodox Christian practice.

Remember that the parish represents the Church within the local community.,
Observe the Ecumenical Patriarch's decree that the first day of the liturgical year (September 1st) is now the Day of Prayers for God's Creation.,
Consider the challenges.",How to Green Your Parish or Church5," The basic theme is education. An array of services, programs, and teachings can be assembled to assist in understanding the modern ecological predicament and to help parishioners embody solutions in their lives. Exposure to Christian ecological literature will exert a subtle effect in changing attitudes and pave the way toward a whole Orthodox way of life. Establish a small library of Orthodox publications (books and pamphlets) on ecology, a class or lecture series on Orthodoxy and care of creation.

, This should be celebrated with special prayers, blessings upon created nature and petitions for healing the environmental degradations within our communities.

, The consistent goal through all of these programs and practices is the transformation of souls while simultaneously reducing our negative impacts upon nature. The principle latent in all of these programs is that healing the environment happens as individual parishioners are healed. This means bringing the assumptions, attitudes and worldview of parishioners into an Orthodox understanding of culture and creation. As the parish strives for an Orthodox Christian lifestyle, an invigorating spirit and vitality will emerge that will help to show the way into further steps. These activities will extend the parish‚ as an example of Christian behavior into the wider community.

Have parishioners implement simple and obvious solutions to ecological problems through the application of traditional Orthodox teachings on food, clothing, possessions, employment, home life and livelihood generally.,
Have parishioners discuss their attitudes toward food, clothing, work, education, media, consumerism, entertainment, technology and right livelihood.,
Get parishioners involved.",How to Green Your Parish or Church6," For parishioners application is the basic theme. As parishioners are educated to the traditional worldview of Christ in all things, to the seriousness of ecological degradation, to the relationship between personal salvation and cosmic transformation, and to the realization that pollution is fundamentally a moral and a spiritual problem, the importance of repentance will be emphasized.

, Ecological healing begins in the home. Parishioners are presented with the opportunity to deepen their spiritual striving by the intentional acquisition of the virtues. This provides spiritual direction for the conduct of the home and emphasizes that a soul-deadening life of luxury is fought by combating excess.

, They need to get out on the firing line of activity This provides a challenge which will inspire some to rise up to new levels of leadership within the parish. This opportunity already exists to some extent, but ecology provides a clear arena for individual responsibility and will encourage people to do more.

Conserve energy.,
Digitize.,
Reduce paper usage.,
Carpool.,
Use eco-friendly lunchboxes.,
Wear an eco-friendly wardrobe.,
Telecommute.,
Use biodegradable materials.",How to Go Green in Your Workspace," The Workplace uses the maximum number of computers which are using high level of energy. If companies were to come up with policies to reduce the wasteful usage of electricity, it would help to conserve energy. Instead of leaving the computer plugged in and powered, it would be a good method to switch off or power off your systems when not in use.;
, In the growing world of technological advancement, it is important that we practice greener values to reduce our carbon footprints. The best way to do that is to convert all documents to e-documents. Instead of printing out page after page of document reports, the company should encourage using electronic submission and sharing of document across the Internet.

, Paper usage could be reduced by recycling the waste papers. It would be wise choice to get eco-friendly papers and print on both sides of the paper instead of just one. The very important and vital documents alone should be printed and the rest should be shared as a PDF file.

, It would work to the benefit of the company, if they could gather details of employees living close by to each other and encourage them to carpool. Rewarding such an act would also encourage, the workplace to be conscious of their carbon emission. The other alternative method could encourage people to bike in groups to work. Among the Fundamentals of Engineering, the future Licensed Engineers to should learn about conserving energy.

, Instead of ordering individual take outs, companies could encourage their employees to bring their homemade lunches in reusable boxes. Alternatively, they could join together and order take out lunch. They need to make sure that the package is a single huge box without napkins and plastic cutlery. Using real cutlery from home, would reduce the waste created from unnecessary trash.

, The Company could bring about a change in dress code that allows employees to change their wardrobe to eco-friendly materials. This would reduce the requirement for a dry cleaning their clothes and thus harming the environment. But if they must dry then encourage them to choose a green dry cleaner near their home. As for a change in wardrobe states a style statement, so the FE Review Course can provide input data regarding about various conserving methods.

, The company should allow its employees to work from home or telecommute. Working for four long days instead of five short days will reduce the carbon emission from their long commutes through horrendous traffic. It will also be an effective way to conserve energy.

, A Company should encourage using bio-degradable materials. For instance, a bio-degradable soap could be used or instead of non- recyclable paper towels being used for drying hands. If paper towels are used it is recommended that short washable hand towels should be used. If recyclable paper towels are not used than a low energy hand drier machine can be implemented to dry employees hands after washing.

Subscribe to peer-reviewed journals.,
Visit peer-reviewed journals online.,
Visit a library.,
Look for educational organizations.,
Seek information from governmental departments.,
Consider related sciences.",How to Find Reliable Information on Climate Change1," Peer reviewed journals and articles are written by experts in the field. The works then undergo critiquing by other experts before they can be published. This ensures that the articles are factually based on the best knowledge to date. Some examples are:The International Journal of Climate Change: Impacts and Responses
Journal of Earth Science and Climate Change
Global and Planetary Change;
, Online journals offer more flexibility than print journals. Just go to the website of your favorite journal and subscribe online. Some journals will even offer the option to pay for certain articles rather than buying the entire subscription.Pubmed is a great place to find peer reviewed articles online.

, You can access an endless number of journals at little or no cost. University libraries are likely to be better stocked with peer-reviewed materials, but you can look at a local library, too. Many libraries participate in interlibrary loan programs that allow them to borrow materials from other libraries, thus expanding your selection.

, There are many organizations that are dedicated to providing factual information on climate change. You only need to find their websites or speak with a local representative. They are usually more than willing to have a discussion or provide you with written information to keep you knowledgeable about climate change. For example:The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research
Alliance for Climate Education
National Center for Science Education

, Several governments around the world have pushed for investigations regarding climate change. They often set up their own agencies or hand this task to an existing agency. The information and conclusions found are published for the public to read.The Australian Bureau of Meteorology is a great example.

, Climate change is often studied by other sciences or science organizations. This usually happens because climate has a direct impact on the study of that science, or that science can provide information relevant to climate change. This scientific overlap often leads to unbiased, reliable information.For example, NASA provides data relevant to climate change. They are able to use satellites to monitor things like the size of polar ice caps over time.

Beware articles that are not peer-reviewed.,
Avoid articles with an obvious agenda.,
Check the sources and citations.",How to Find Reliable Information on Climate Change2," If an article or journal does not say that it is a peer reviewed or scholarly publication, you should find information elsewhere. Though there can be factual information in these publications, there is no verification that it is factual. Publications that do not undergo a peer review process can be false or misleading., Many different industries and companies are affected by the public facts and opinions on climate change.You may notice articles that seem to be very pointed in one direction or the other. In this case, it is best to find other information, or at least to make an effort to find information supporting the statements made by the article.For example, articles published by companies that provide fossil fuels may be more likely to downplay the human involvement in climate change.

, A reliable article will list sources or citations. This gives you an idea of where the author(s) obtained the information set forth in the article. You can evaluate the validity of the article based on the quality of sources that are provided.


This is particularly important for articles on the internet. Anyone can post any opinion they want on the internet, making it difficult to decide what information to trust and what to discard.

Learn about greenhouse gases.,
Realize that the sun is not static.,
Consider how much sunlight is reflected.",How to Find Reliable Information on Climate Change3," Greenhouse gases are atmospheric molecules that prevent light and heat from escaping the earth. These gases include things like carbon dioxide. An increase in greenhouse gases can lead to warmer global temperatures.Though greenhouse gases are produced naturally (e.g. a volcanic eruption), the majority of the scientific community claims that human activity (e.g. burning fossil fuels) adds significant amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Skeptics of this theory argue that greenhouse gases produced by humans do not significantly impact climate.

, The amount of light and heat that the sun gives off is subject to fluctuations. These changes directly impact the earth’s climate. Energy given off by the sun is another variable in climate change over time.Scientists have measured the levels of energy given off by the sun over time. The data shows that the amount of solar energy reaching earth fluctuates, resulting in changes to climate. However, in most scientific models, this does not account for the degree of climate change that has been measured in the last several decades.

, The earth reflects much of the sun’s light. This helps to keep the planet cool. Some places (e.g. polar regions covered in snow) will reflect more light and remain colder. Other regions (e.g. metropolitan areas) will absorb more sunlight and keep higher temperatures.The impact of urbanization is also subject to the climate change debate. Again, skeptics of human-driven climate change claim that the amount of urbanization in the world is too insignificant to affect climate. People who consider human activity to have a direct impact on climate generally take the stance that increased urbanization leads to more sunlight being absorbed by the planet (making it warmer).

Use less running water in your bathroom.,
Install low-flow shower-heads and faucet aerators.,
Have a dual-flush or low-flow toilet installed in your home.",How to Go Green in Your Bathroom1," You can save multiple gallons of water daily by shutting off running water when performing certain daily tasks. Examples of ways you can use less water is to take quicker showers, and turn off the faucet while shaving or brushing your teeth.;
, These types of shower and faucet accessories will allow you to save thousands of gallons of water per year because they restrict heavy water-flow. In most cases, installation will require you to unscrew the shower- or faucet-head using a wrench, and screwing the new shower- or faucet-head onto the nozzle.

, A dual-flush toilet has 2 handles for flushing different levels of water; whereas a low-flow toilet can save approximately 9,000 gallons (34,068 liters) of water per year.

Buy commercial cleaning products made from all-natural or organic ingredients.,
Clean using various all-natural household products.",How to Go Green in Your Bathroom2," The toxins and chemicals often used in standard commercial cleaning products can be harmful to your health if used consistently over time. Examples of green cleaning brands you can buy are Seventh Generation and Shaklee.


Visit a retail or grocery store that specializes in all-natural and organic products to locate additional brands of green cleaning products you can use in your bathroom.

, Distilled white vinegar and baking soda are examples of products you can use to clean toilet bowls, bathtubs, sinks, and faucets.


Spray surface areas with a mixture of 1 part distilled white vinegar and 1 part water, then allow the mixture to soak into surfaces for 30 minutes before wiping away with a towel or rag.

Replace disposable bathroom products with reusable products.,
Use bathroom items made from recycled or environment-friendly materials.,
Use a shower curtain made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-free plastic or hemp.,
Use green and energy-efficient lighting methods.,
Replace your bathroom toiletries with organic, all-natural, and green alternatives.",How to Go Green in Your Bathroom3," Using reusable products will help eliminate the amount of waste that goes in and out of your bathroom. Examples of reusable products you can use are rags and towels for cleaning as opposed to paper towels, and toilet-bowl brushes that can be used repeatedly instead of just one time.

, For example, use toilet paper made from recycled materials, and hand- and body-towels made from organic cotton or bamboo, since conventional cotton is manufactured using a variety of pesticides and other chemicals.

, This can prevent you from being exposed to the chemical odors and gases that typically reside in most shower curtains made from PVC plastic.

, You can replace standard light bulbs with energy-efficient light bulbs, or remove some light bulbs from the row of bulbs above your vanity to save energy.

, These types of products are better for your overall health and for the environment; whereas many commercial toiletry items including soap, toothpaste, shampoo, shaving gel, and feminine products contain chemicals and other toxins.

Gas is cheap in the US so we have bad habits driving big cars and idling endlessly.,
Drive less!,
The greenest thing to do is not drive at all.",How to Drive Green," What you put in your tank, and how you do so matters. It takes more fossil fuels for oil companies to make higher octane fuels. And since most fuels today have an ethanol blend, you can stick with the lower grade fuels to keep the environment – and your car – happy.;
, Do it on your way home! One less Saturday errand and less gas consumed.

, Don't just sit there with the engine running; you're choking the planet! Idling a car for only 20 seconds burns more gas and emits more CO2 than simply turning it off and starting it up again when you are actually ready to drive! If you are stuck at a light, a RR crossing or in that lovely traffic, shift to neutral – over the course of a year you would be amazed at how much less CO2 will be emitted on your watch!

, When you are hitting the gas and on the move, ease up lead foot! When you are at a light don't gun your engine. You may think you're looking cool but really you're just wasting gas and poisoning the air. Save your drag racing fantasies for another day! Don't jack rabbit start or jump off the line when you get the green. Head out nice and easy and reduce your gas consumption. Your RPM's are a good indication of how smart you are driving. Red-lining your car is anything but “green” for the environment.

, Slow down. Driving more than 55 mph (89 km/h) reduces your fuel efficiency by almost 15%.

, Maybe it's time to buy a green car. These days, more and more car makers sell hybrid vehicles, using gas and electricity - and now they even make ones that run on ethanol and natural gas! These cars could save you up to USD$300 every year! However, give it some thought -- junking a vehicle produces an incredible amount of waste and making new cars takes a lot of materials and energy. You should weigh these factors against the benefits of upgrading to a more efficient vehicle.

, You can drive to a centralized location and bike to a number of errands close by. You'll not only save fuel, but get some free exercise while reducing wasted time stuck in traffic looking for a place to park!

, Europeans use 40% less fuel per mile than North Americans do. It's not that they are smarter than us, but they drive smarter and are less wasteful!

,).

, Gas is much more expensive in Europe so they are more motivated to save fuel thanks to carbon taxes - which taxes fuel to force folks to conserve while investing in wind turbines and better healthcare and schools for the people. So get motivated...conserve fuel!

, What's greener than a hybrid? A car not driven!

, Carpool; take transit; bike to work; combine trips; walk kids to school for exercise and fresh air.

Contact the municipal authorities.,
Ask around among your friends and neighbors.,

Decide which junkyard you need.,
Provide your own service.,
Visit a full-service yard.,
Find a junkyard that specializes in a specific items.,
Consult a junkyard’s database.,
Physically walk through a junkyard.",How to Find a Junkyard," If there is a junkyard under government administration, the municipality can direct you to the nearest site. Although most junkyards are privately owned, there may be a county- or state-owned yard near you.


Check with your local Department of Transportation, as these departments are often the most knowledgeable about junkyard locations.;
, If you’re new to the area, people in your community may know the locations for junkyards, scrap yards or salvage yards.


Some locals may even know the hours of operation, the rates, and any relevant rules imposed by the junkyard when car owners drop off their used vehicles.

, You may need to look under each category, as some businesses only list their information in one section. Regardless of the size of the junkyard, most will list their phone number in the local yellow pages.


Yellow pages are becoming increasingly outdated and difficult to find. However, since many junkyards are small businesses and may not have an online presence, the yellow pages can still be useful by providing a junkyard’s address and phone number.

, There are multiple sites which allow you to locate junkyards in your area.Some of these sites are sophisticated enough to allow you to search for a specific item or car part in a junkyard’s inventory.


Start with a Google Maps search. This may turn up more results than you expect.
Check junkyard-specific sites, such as iJunkyard, UsedPartsCentral, or JunkyardLocator.
Look at a national directory for salvage yards. You should be able to find a directory online. Some directories will list junkyards by specialty, which can help you need to find a specific item.
Visit an online junkyard or salvage yard locator’s website to find a location near you. Type in the state, city, or zip code in which you live and check the results.

, This will provide you with immediate information regarding the location and size of the junkyard. However, you may need to call or visit the junkyard to know which (if any) product or vehicle types the yard specializes in.


You may see evidence of the junk, such as used cars, before you see any signs for the business.

, Not all types of junkyards are identical—some specialize in vehicles—or even specific makes of cars—while others are a catch-all for discarded machinery and electronic equipment.Consider if you’d like:


A “DIY” recycling yard. These let you choose your own parts—even ones already attached to vehicles—and mix-and-match whatever you need. Junkyards of this type often have a broad inventory.
A repair shop. These typically sell exclusively vehicle parts, although the cars and parts themselves may be in poor condition. That said, the staff will likely be knowledgeable about vehicle repairs and alterations.
A salvage yard. While salvage yards provide freedom to search for any part you like—and often yield unexpected finds—they may be filled with rusting cars and useless parts.

, Many junkyards allow you to find your own items or vehicle parts—even if the part is currently attached to another vehicle. You can then disassemble the item or remove any vehicle parts that you need.


Self-service yards are useful as they allow you to inspect parts before purchasing.If a self-service yard has multiple identical parts, you can look them over and choose whichever part you prefer.

, If you cannot find a junkyard that allows you to serve yourself, or if you are relatively inexperienced with car repairs/alterations and need the assistance of a professional, consider visiting a full-service junkyard.These yards let you request the part you want. The junkyard staff then finds the piece and brings it to you, with a fee added for their labor.

, For example, many junkyards and salvage yards specialize in old cars and car parts. (Some will deal only with the specialized item.)


It’s best to find as specific of a junkyard as you can.By finding a junkyard that contains the exact type of product you’re looking for (car engine, microwave, etc.), you save yourself time and energy when you search for the actual part.
You may be able to find a junkyard by looking for the recycling centers that accept the specific item you need.

, Once you’ve found a specific junkyard, you can frequently find out if they have the part(s) you need online. Many junkyards are well organized, and a database search will provide specific information about parts and products in stock.You should have a specific idea of what you want—i.e., “a left door for a 2004 Honda Pilot,” not “a car door.”
If the junkyard does not have an online database, call the junkyard office directly. Often the manager will be able to tell you if a certain part is in stock on the lot.

, This is the most common way to find parts at a junkyard, although it can be time consuming.Before you start walking through the junkyard lot, check and see if the lot is organized by type of product, make and model of vehicle, or year.


Wear an old pair of jeans and a shirt that can get dirty. Also bring a pair of thick work gloves with you.
Never assume that junkyard products are in good condition. Examine the parts thoroughly before buying anything. When in doubt, ask the junkyard attendant or manager to appraise the condition of a part you’d like to buy.

Encourage employees to enroll in direct deposit and review their paystubs online instead of receiving a paper check and pay stub., Check computers, printers, fax machines, and copiers as part of your end-of-day routine. Leaving this equipment on throughout the night and over the weekend will use a significant amount of energy.

, Enable the hibernation or standby modes on office computers when they are idle for more than 10 minutes. This will allow the computers to save energy when employees step away for brief lunch breaks or restroom breaks.In some cases, you can save up to 80 percent energy on a monthly basis by modifying the power modes of your office equipment.

, Encourage employees to use this set of utensils when they’re eating in the break room. Provide dish soap, sponges, and a dish rack so they can easily wash dishes when they’re done with them.When ordering food for company events, request that the restaurant or catering company not provide any plastic utensils or silverware.
Provide your employees with coffee mugs or containers imprinted with the company logo to reduce the use of paper or foam cups and plates.

, Toilet paper, paper towels, hand soap, and cleaning supplies can all be purchased in organic or all-natural forms that do not contain harmful chemicals or pollutants., Next to every regular trash can, place a bin that’s just for paper and plastic. Add extra bins for more specific items, like used printer ink cartridges, which can’t be thrown away with regular recycling.Add a sign or label on new bins explaining which items can be placed inside them.

, If paper must be used for faxes or printing, use 100 percent recycled paper and print double-sided whenever possible. Return blank sheets of paper that have accidentally been used back to the paper tray of the printer, fax machine, or copier.

, Real plants will improve the quality of indoor air and help offset any harmful pollutants that are caused by chemicals present in office carpeting and furniture. They also have the added benefit of decreasing stress and enhancing productivity., Open window shades and blinds during daylight hours and turn off indoor office lighting to save energy.


Have landscaping performed outside of office windows to ensure that trees, bushes, and other tall or large vegetation does not prevent sunlight from entering the office.

, Switch fluorescent bulbs to LEDs to save on energy, and use desk lamps rather than overhead lighting whenever possible. Attach motion sensors to lights in spaces like break rooms or conference rooms, so that lights don't stay on once people have exited those areas., Switch out faucets and toilets for newer, water-saving models. Low-flow toilets use half as many gallons per flush as older models, so this upfront cost will lead to lower water bills later on. You can also opt for motion-sensored fixtures so that faucets can’t be left running accidentally., Eliminate short shifts that span throughout 5 days and allow employees to work 10 hours per day for 4 days per week. This cuts out an entire day of electricity usage each week. It also means employees will be commuting less and therefore contributing less to air pollution., Select certain days when all employees need to be present in the office, and encourage employees to work remotely the other days. Or consider allowing employees to work from home full time. Not only will this eliminate their commute, but you will eliminate many overhead operation costs.Have employees use tools such as video conferencing, email, and instant messaging to stay connected to their bosses and clients throughout the day.

, If working from home isn’t an option, encourage employees to get to work in a more environmentally friendly way. Suggest commuting via rapid transit, cycling, or carpooling. Offer incentives like vouchers for train or bus fare, or disincentives like charging employees for parking., Sponsor green events like Earth Week, or a service project like community trash pick-up. Or have everyone calculate and share their carbon footprint, then create a contest to encourage employees to lower it.

The foliage will absorb excess water and protect the topsoil from the impact of rain, heavy wind and foot traffic. The roots of the plants will also help anchor the soil once they take hold, safeguarding the soil beneath from water runoff.


Grass and plant roots also serve to draw nutrients from deep in the soil closer to the surface, improving the healthiness of the topsoil.
Ryegrass and clover make excellent choices for basic groundcover, as their roots spread deep and hold fast. Other useful anchoring plants include grains such as wheat, barley, and rye and crops of root vegetables like radishes.;
, If you have a field or flat, wide open space on your property, considering growing a row of trees to act as a barrier from the wind. This is known as a windbreak cover and is an efficient means of combating wind erosion often employed by landscapers. A windbreak cover will cut down on the amount of wind that sweeps an open area of land, keeping topsoil from being scattered and dried out.For best results, group trees or shrubs relatively close together so that little space exists between them for wind to penetrate.
Choose tree species that develop thick foliage.

, Look for areas where the ground is hard and bare. This is most often a symptom of compacted soil. Sew grass in these areas, and be sure to water and aerate the soil frequently. If not remedied, the soil below can become even more dense while the top layer erodes, making growing conditions inhospitable.


When soil becomes compacted, its particles are pressed tightly together so that water cannot penetrate deep into its sublayers, causing the uppermost layers of soil to be worn away by runoff. In addition, soil compaction cause aeration problems within soil, meaning that it’s less likely that you’ll be able to get things to grow in places where the soil is badly compacted.
Be careful about habitually walking in the same places if the soil in your yard or garden is compacted; this will just make the problem worse. Choose a new footpath to take, or stand on a broad, flat board when gardening to keep your body weight from contributing to soil compaction.

, Building a no-dig garden involves layering materials over the topsoil in which plants and crops can be planted so that there’s no need to disturb the soil itself. When gardening is done above the soil instead of within it, the soil will not be exposed to lots of harsh digging and watering that can damage soil and lead to erosion.Create multiple no-dig plots to serve as flower beds or patches for growing crops that require similar soil conditions.
A wealth of different planting schemes exist, but all make use of the same basic structure: multiple tiers of compostable matter are layered over a permeable surface like cardboard directly on top of the ground. Look into different ideas for constructing your own no-dig garden., During peak growing season, spread a thin layer of mulch around the base of thriving plants. The weight of the mulch will keep the soil from being exposed to wind and water while also preserving important nutrients and moisture in the soil at root-level.Mulch can be bought cheap at any gardening center, or you can easily make your own at home by feeding scrap wood, live foliage and decaying plant matter into a shredder to form a composite.

, If you live on a hillside or in a valley where water might collect, create channels around the edges of your property to redirect runoff water. Drainage channels work much way gutters do for your roof. Reducing runoff keeps surges of water from carrying off soil or killing plants due to overwatering.Dig a simple paved irrigation ditch by hand, or embed PVC or drainage pipe into the channel to install what is known as a ""French Drain,"" which conducts water away with greater efficiency., Protect the soil in your garden by tilling it and shaping it to catch rainwater. Tilling turns the soil to allow nutrients to spread through it evenly, while contouring (planting flowers and crops in long, linear depressions with mounds between each row) will ensure that water soaks into your crops instead of washing over the top and taking topsoil with it. Soil compaction can be avoided by tilling, as well.Tilling can be done using an automatic or push rototiller that makes use of a rotary wheel covered in small spikes that aerate the soil as they turn, or by hand, using a shovel or pitchfork to make shallow stabs into the soil and turn it over a few feet at a time., Terracing involves constructing a series of short step-like platforms on which to grow plants and is a useful alternative to planting on sloped ground. Rather than simply running down the slope, water will soak into the flat soil of each platform, hydrating plants and keep soil from being swept away.Create a landscaping terrace by leveling the embankment of a slope and reinforcing the vertical walls with wood beams or stone.Constructing a terrace is also a good way of organizing flowering plants and crops, as each level of the terrace can be used to grow something different.

, If precipitation tends to cause flooding in your area, a rain barrel or catch basin can be implemented to collect excess water. As the name suggests, rainwater is “caught” in the basin, which is installed underground with a grated drainage opening, or stored in the barrel and saved for later use. These methods make it possible to repurpose extra water instead of simply letting it erode vulnerable topsoil.A rain barrel most often works in conjunction with a gutter or irrigation system so that water flow is directed straight into the barrel.
Catch basins are easy to install yourself. The only require measuring the unit and digging a hole of the right dimensions to accommodate it at the bottom of a slope.

, In many cases, professional landscapers and certain non-profit groups concerned with repairing the effects of soil erosion can come to you and assess the severity of the soil damage on your property. These experts will perform a detailed examination of your land and come up with solutions for restoring soil to its natural health. Check to see if any of your local landscaping businesses offer soil restoration services, or if there are other eco-related groups in your area that might work with you on rescuing badly eroded soil around your home.Ecological restoration groups sometimes operate out of farms and universities, and many will assist in repairing erosion damage voluntarily or for little cost.Even if your soil is healthy, you should consult with a professional landscaper once a year or so to inspect your property for potential problems and discuss preventative solutions.

, Purchase live earthworms and add them to areas where soil is compacted, dry or barren. Earthworms are some of the world's greatest biological decomposers, feeding on decaying organic matter and returning vital nutrients to the soil through excretion. Earthworm activity is one of the best means of naturally recycling and reintroducing organic nutrients to soil.In addition to infusing soil with badly needed nutrients, the subterranean movement of earthworms also acts as a kind of hands-free aeration process, increasing nutrient mixture, moisture retention and room for new root growth in topsoil.
Earthworms can be purchased at most gardening supply stores for this very purpose, or may be acquired locally from conservation groups., Amendment is the process by which missing nutrients are added to eroded soil directly in order to restore the right chemical balance. Many different types of amendments can be used: compost is a common amendment used for gardening purposes, as are organic fertilizers, salt and peat. Soil amendment can be used in conjunction with aeration, earthworm introduction and meticulous watering to bring soil back to a healthy state.


In order to select the right amendment for your soil, it is first necessary to identify the exact properties your soil lacks. You may be able to use erosion symptoms to diagnose various deficiencies, but it's probably wiser to work with a landscaper or other soil expert to find out what's missing from your soil and take the appropriate action.

Ask your company's human resources department if they are offering any incentives to commute differently on Earth Day.,
Pledge to commute in a green way on Earth Day.",How to Commute on Earth Day1," Many companies offer transportation subsidies because they are not taxed. The following are popular ways that companies promote an eco-friendly commute on Earth Day and throughout the year:


They replace parking subsidies with transportation subsidies. If your company gives parking spaces or other benefits to people with cars, ask what they can provide to people who take the bus or ride their bike.
Companies provide people who carpool, use public transit and bike with subsidies. The amount depends upon your company and your city. The US government allows companies to use pre-tax dollars on these expenses, so there is a benefit for the employer as well as employee.
Some companies and city programs provide emergency ride home reimbursement. This lowers the risk of you being stranded at your job in the case of an emergency. There are usually limits to how much you can spend on a cab in these situations, so get detailed information from your employer. You may also need to sign up for the program in order to be eligible.
They may offer a monetary or other incentive to employees who choose to change their commute on Earth Day. Some companies offer luncheons, contests and prizes to employees who choose a green commute on Earth Day. The companies increase their sustainability and social responsibility awareness by supporting eco-friendly employees.;
, Enter city-wide programs or go to act.earthday.org to pledge a new commute option that day. You may want to pledge a larger goal, such as commuting in a different way 2 to 3 times a week.

Walk to work.,
Bike to work.,
Take public transportation.,
Propose and start an Earth Day carpool.",How to Commute on Earth Day2," If you are 1 of the few people who live within 3 miles (4.8 km) of your office, then choose this heart-healthy option of walking to and from work. Make sure to wear supportive athletic shoes and bring a change of shoes and/or clothing with you to the office.

, Perhaps a bike commute is seen as 1 of the most popular Earth Day commutes. Like walking, it allows you to commute using your own physical power; however, a bike commute may allow you to reach an office 10 to 30 miles (16 to 48 km) away from your home.


Map out your bike commute before you try it. Take some time on a weekend before Earth Day to see if there is a safe route that you can travel. This is especially important if you don't ride your bike very often.

, Leave your car at home and opt to take a bus, subway or other public form of transportation. Check in advance to see if public transportation prices are lower on Earth Day, a subsidy often provided by local governments.


You may need to leave a little earlier to take the bus or subway to work. Depending upon where you live, it could take 30 minutes to an hour longer.

, Post an advertisement for the carpool 1 month to 2 weeks before Earth Day. Ask people to email you their location, so that you can map out neighborhoods, routes and how many cars are required.

Get to know your neighbors.,
Participate in a community building initiative.,
Get to know your local police.,
Spend time outdoors.,
Prioritize accessibility for all residents.",How to Help Your Community Be a Safer One1," Even if you’re not the most outgoing person, make an effort to introduce yourself to your neighbors. It can be as simple as greeting them if you pass them on the sidewalk or waving hello when you’re doing lawn maintenance. Developing relationships with your neighbors is mutually beneficial for fostering trust and friendship with the goal of making your community a better, safer place to live.Block parties are a great way to get out and meet your neighbors. Offer to host a cookout or potluck during summer months to bring community residents together in a relaxing atmosphere.;
, Building community is important to make sure everyone in your neighborhood is familiar with one another and is aware of the community’s safety goals. Aside from safety, community building can help neighbors build friendship and make the neighborhood a pleasant, inclusive place to live.Community building initiatives like National Night Out, held every August, are great ways to move out into your community to meet and engage with your neighbors and local law enforcement., It is helpful to know what initiatives the police are implementing to fight crime in your neighborhood. If your community members can help watch for and report potentially suspicious activity to law enforcement, this builds a relationship between your neighborhood and the police. These relationships help deter crime by employing a “brother’s keeper” strategy for community safety., Simply seeing residents outside and active in their communities is sometimes enough to deter potential criminals. Empty streets with residents who keep to themselves will have the opposite effect.


Going for a jog or walk around your neighborhood, reading a book on your front porch, or working in your garden are great examples of how to be present in your neighborhood.

, Don't limit your focus on community safety to only crime reduction. Community safety is a comprehensive goal that also includes accessibility for children, the elderly, and those with disabilities.


For example, crumbling sidewalks create a safety hazard for children who ride bicycles on the sidewalks and for those who use wheelchairs to get around on those broken sidewalks. It's important for the safety of these community member that the sidewalk be addressed as a component of community safety.

Implement a neighborhood watch system.,
Check out local businesses.,
Make sure the community appears well-maintained.,
Speak with your city or district council about community safety measures.,
Request community improvements formally.",How to Help Your Community Be a Safer One2," A neighborhood watch system is a group of community residents who periodically patrol the community in the interest of the safety and well-being of its residents. These systems help reduce crime in the community as well as foster a sense of pride and safety for neighborhood residents.Neighborhood watch systems are about more than simply catching or deterring criminals. For example, if your group of neighborhood watch volunteers is out for a routine patrol, they might notice a lost child or pet and help get them home. Or, they might notice smoke coming from a window of a home and alert the fire department.Many police departments are happy to offering training or conduct a meeting with neighborhood watch groups to offer tips and training. Contact your local police station to see if they offer these services., When you spend money locally, local businesses thrive. When your community has a thriving business economy, there are fewer vacant buildings and lots, which can be havens for criminals. A thriving local business scene also helps foster a sense of community pride. Instead of defaulting to a chain store or restaurant, try out your local coffee shop or cafe and get to know the owner. Not only will you be cycling money back into your local economy, but you’ll be promoting safety and a sense of community by getting to know others who work in your neighborhood.

, It’s difficult to take pride in your community if it looks run-down. As much as possible, work to maintain and improve the appearance of your community. Encourage residents to maintain the exteriors of their homes and complete routine lawn maintenance. Develop community green spaces like parks or gardens, if possible, as these are great crime deterrents.A great way to improve and invest in your community is to Start a Community Garden. Community gardens have been shown to increase neighborhood property values and build a sense of community among participating gardeners. They also deter crime by reducing the number of abandoned vacant lots., Sometimes neighborhood maintenance goes beyond what residents can do for themselves. At this point, it’s appropriate to involve city or district council member to discuss how to implement community safety measures.


For example, if your neighborhood has poor lighting, this is a safety hazard on multiple levels because criminals feel safer committing crimes in the dark, and residents out walking in the evening might not be seen and could be struck by passing vehicles. The city will have to install better lighting because it’s a major improvement project not suitable for individual residents to do themselves.

, Attend city council meetings and bring a formal list of requests with you or your community's representatives. Having your requests in writing gives your local city governance something concrete to work with. Be sure to detail the ways in which your requests will better your community by making it safer, both in terms of accessibility and decreases in crime.


Depending on your community’s needs, examples of community improvements that your neighborhood might request from local officials include the repair or creation of well-marked bike paths, youth centers, or accessible and safe playgrounds for neighborhood children to use.

Invest in a home security system.,
Install window coverings for privacy.,
Lock your doors and windows.,
Install timers on your lights and TV.,
Remove your name from your home’s exterior.,
Let your neighbors know when you’ll be out of town.",How to Help Your Community Be a Safer One3," These systems deter break-ins and crime because they offer a direct line to emergency services from inside your home, whether you are home or away. If burglars notice that your home is equipped with a home security system, they might pass on your house and move on to an easier target.Only share your home security code with individuals whom you absolutely trust. If you think someone untrustworthy has obtained the code, change it as soon as possible.
Choose a home security system with a lighted motion sensor. When these systems detect movement, they turn on flood lighting, making it easy to see what or who is approaching your home.Some home security systems involve cameras. Be sure to invest in a high definition camera, so that if your home is ever burglarized and the cameras capture photos or video of the perpetrator, the images will be clear enough to give a good picture of the burglar.
Don’t give burglars the opportunity to hide or lurk outside your home. Keep bushes and shrubbery trimmed and leave your porch light on, if possible. You want your home to be as uninviting to criminals as you can make it., While everyone loves a bright, airy space, window coverings are important to install so that your belongings aren’t on display for potential burglars. It’s especially important to keep your window coverings closed at night when it’s easiest for prowlers to look into your home for things they might want to steal when you’re gone., This is a basic but very important safety precaution. Before you leave your home or go to bed for the night be sure that all your doors and windows are locked, including your garage door, if you have one.This applies to your car, as well. Be sure that all your windows are closed and any valuables are out of sight or locked in the trunk.

, Timers help you control when your lights and TV turn on and off when you aren’t home. This gives the illusion of someone being home and can help deter potential home break-ins.Many timers can be programmed remotely with your cellphone and some even have a battery backup in case of a power failure., Offering personal information on your mailbox or exterior of your home invites stalkers and burglars to learn who lives at your address. For safety and anonymity do not advertise your name on the exterior of your home., If they keep an eye on your home while you’re gone, ask them to watch for any suspicious activity. Authorize them to report any strange activity or suspicious individuals to police or the neighborhood watch group in your absence.


If you’ll be gone for more than a week, consider having the post office hold your mail and hire a teenager in the neighborhood to mow your lawn. An overgrown lawn with packages piling up at the front door is a dead giveaway to criminals that no one is home at your house. Make it a priority to have your home appear to have someone at home so that potential criminals will be deterred.

Stay informed about humanitarian crises.,
Identify the organizations that help refugees.,
Donate money and/or goods.,
Organize an action on behalf of refugees.,
Start an online fundraising campaign.,
Spread the word via social networking.,
Take action abroad.",How to Help Refugees1," To know how to help refugees, you’ll first need to know where they’re coming from, and what their needs are. Make sure to keep up with global news reports and social media so that you will stay abreast of humanitarian crises, natural disasters, and political regimes that create refugee situations.


Aside from your favorite news outlets, you can follow an agency such as the Human Rights Watch by email or social media.;
, There are numerous agencies and organizations that focus on providing assistance to refugees, and keeping up with these is a great way to stay involved. The websites and social media of organizations like these will have a wealth of information about recent and ongoing refugee crises, as well as additional ideas for how to get involved. Familiarize yourself with:


The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees: http://www.unhcr.org/

American Refugee Committee: http://www.arcrelief.org/

International Rescue Committee: http://www.rescue.org/

The Women’s Refugee Commission https://www.womensrefugeecommission.org/about

Refugees International https://www.refugeesinternational.org

The Church World Service: http://www.cwsglobal.org/

Religious centers and community organizations in your area that may work to help refugees

, This is probably the quickest and easiest way to make a contribution to refugee efforts. Pay attention after natural disasters, political uncertainties, and other situations that can create waves of refugees. Look for calls to make financial contributions to charitable organizations, which will then apply the money to get refugees the material and humanitarian assistance they need.Sometimes, you can also donate goods (such as non-perishable food and clothing) to make a direct impact.
Donations to charitable organizations are probably tax-deductible, but check with the organization to make sure.

, If you want to make a bigger impact, you can band together with like-minded people. There is strength in numbers, and the more people work together to help refugees, the more attention will be drawn to the effort.


Try to do things like host an event (such as a telethon) where people can make donations to refugee organizations, or arrange a march to bring attention to the refugee crisis.
Make sure to get the word out there so that people will know about your event. Post flyers with the name of the event, and important information like the date, time, and location. You should also broadcast this information widely via social media, email lists, and word of mouth.
You can also contact organizations like the UN Refugee Agency or the Refugee Start Force for help organizing a fundraising or awareness campaign in your area.These groups have the know-how and experience to help you launch a successful event. You might find this especially helpful for figuring out the logistics of hosting an event (finding a space, getting equipment, developing a program for the event, etc.).

, Crowdfunding sites are now an easy and often effective way to raise money to support valuable causes. All it takes is a few minutes to set up an account and fundraising website. Then, people can make donations online, and you can pass the funds along to organizations that help refugees.


Crowdrise has a fundraising set up devoted to the UN Refugee agency, so you can direct people there. However, you can also use a site like that for ideas, then create your own crowdfunding site using services like Indigogo and Go Fund me.You can choose to create a limited-time fundraising campaign (like “Summer 2017 Refugee Fundraising Drive”), or to have an ongoing donation website.
You can also decide to focus your crowdfunding site on a specific theme or group (like “Teens for Refugees”).
No matter what form your crowdfunding site takes, make sure to advertise it widely, especially via social media.

, The widespread use of social networking websites has made it easier than ever to spread under-reported news to friends, relatives, and acquaintances. If you come across a story related to refugees, or information about how to make donations and get involved, post and share widely. This will help to increase aid to refugees.You can also write posts about a refugee situation that matters to you, how a refugee crisis impacts you, or stories about refugees that you meet. First-person, human interest stories help readers know more about refugees as individuals, and their needs. This can encourage others to help refugees.

, If you are really committed to making an impact, you can go to the home country of refugees to help them leave the area. By joining a rapid response team, you can make sure that refugees are taken care of as their situation is sorted out, see that the aid effort is organized, that international media agencies are getting good information, etc.Response teams are made up of people who have international experience, or specific skills that can help with refugee aid efforts (like language knowledge or medical training).
If you are interested in working on a refugee response team, be prepared for potentially difficult circumstances, such as volatile political situations and lack of access to basic services (electricity, running water, etc.).
Check with refugee aid organizations to learn more about possibilities for volunteering or interning abroad.

Research opportunities to volunteer with senior citizens.,
Contact volunteer organizations.,
Offer your services to senior citizens for free.",How to Help Senior Citizens1," You can do this by inquiring at local nursing homes, places of worship, volunteer organizations, looking online, or asking family and friends if they know of opportunities. Write down any opportunities you find that sound interesting to you.


Look for opportunities to help senior citizens while also doing something else you love. For example, if you play the violin, inquire with local organizations or nursing homes about opportunities to come play at a residence for a special occasion (such as a major holiday) or on a regular basis.;
, Make a list of potential places to volunteer and then start contacting them to find out how you can help. Think about what you would enjoy doing the most or what would give you the most satisfaction and start there. Do you enjoy working directly with people and being very hands-on? Or do you prefer to be in the background and run things behind the scenes? Think about your style and personality and find volunteer opportunities that suit you.


Look for a phone number on the organization's website. Call and let them know that you are interested in volunteering.
Send an email to an individual in the organization and ask how you can help. You could say: ""I'm interested in helping senior citizens and wanted to ask if you are looking for volunteers."" If they don't know, they can most likely direct you.

, This is especially useful if you are skilled in a trade, such as plumbing or carpentry, and can offer needed services for charity. You can take out a classified ad to advertise your services or talk to others to find out who might be in need of your services.

Work with organizations to help connect refugees to the services they need.,
Provide transportation for refugees.,
Help out with childcare.,
Teach or mentor refugees.",How to Help Refugees2," Once refugees arrive in the sheltering country, they will need more help. Governmental offices, NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations), and charitable organizations keep track of the benefits and aid that refugees are eligible to receive. Working with these refugee organizations will allow you to safely and effectively help refugees. These groups help connect refugees to things like:Cash support
Food assistance
Language training and interpreter services
Job training and placement
Transportation
Child care
Citizenship classes

, Sometimes the simplest ways to help, like giving someone a ride, make the biggest impact. Ask refugee organizations in your area if you can help by picking up refugees at the airport when they arrive, or by giving them rides to meetings with governmental offices, to job interviews, or even just to the store to get basic needs like food and clothing., Some refugees enter a safe country with children, or have them after they arrive. If you are comfortable taking care of children, talk to refugee organizations in your area about serving as primary or backup childcare. Looking after the children of refugees while they are busy doing things like looking for jobs, finding housing, or going to meetings can make a world of difference.


In some cases, refugees are eligible for childcare services provided by government agencies., Depending on their situation, refugees can have widely varying levels of education or experience. Regardless of their background, however, many will need assistance getting around in a new country and language, and earning permanent resident or citizen status. Talk to refugee organizations in your area about ways you can help educate refugees on the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in a new nation. You can do things like:Offer to teach or tutor English to non-English-speaking refugees, or volunteer as a conversation partner.
Mentor refugees on adjusting to life in your country (learning customs, finding a job, understanding laws, etc.)
Teach citizenship classes to refugees (these typically require some knowledge of a country’s history and government)

"
"
Invite refugees to share their experiences.,
Hit the streets.,
Contact congresspeople on behalf of refugees.,
Encourage businesses to make contributions.,
Get in touch with local media sources.",How to Help Refugees3," One way to encourage more people to get involved with assisting refugees is to increase their knowledge of crises and refugee situations. A direct and meaningful way to do this is to invite refugees to talk about their experiences (on their own or through an interpreter) to community organizations, churches, government agencies, schools, etc.Get in touch with aid organizations and your community to see about hosting a “share your story” or Q&A event with refugees.

, Your goal might be to generally increase knowledge of the plight of refugees, rather than respond to a particular natural or political disaster. In this case, one way to memorably and visibly make an impact is to be on the ground in your area, telling others about refugee situations.Stand at busy intersections and ask pedestrians if they have a moment to talk about refugee situations.
Pass out flyers to pedestrians on city streets, college campuses, etc. that have information about refugee aid organizations.
Organize a march to heighten awareness of refugee situations.
Whichever method you choose, band together with others to increase visibility. Things like wearing matching brightly-colored t-shirts with your organization’s logo and carrying picket signs will also draw more attention to your cause.

, Making calls or writing letters to government officials can be surprisingly effective, especially when many concerned people make the effort. Contact the U.S. congressman in charge of your district or other government officials concerning current and future refugee resettlement programs.Make sure that everyone involved in your organization does the same.


To be most effective, don’t just tell the senator, representative, or other official that you are concerned about the plight of refugees. Tell them exactly how you want them to respond (supporting a new bill, increasing funding for aid to refugees, etc.).

, Individual donations matter, but corporate contributions can be larger and more visible. Talk to area businesses about making financial contributions to refugee aid organizations, or get in touch with those organizations about helping with their plans to seek corporate contributions.If you have connections to any businesses, chambers of commerce, or development authorities, lean on these to drum up aid for refugees.
Offer to prominently acknowledge corporate donations in an aid organization’s website, emails, promotional materials, etc.

, When local, state, and national refugee stories come up, contact your local media and encourage them to report on those stories. If you are especially knowledgeable about refugee crises or have experience working in the field, you can also offer to be a point of contact for the media.


Local media can include television news, radio news, websites and newspapers.

, There are millions of trees that are getting slashed every year for land, wood and leaves. Imagine the impact that this would have on the world – all these beautiful trees disappearing in the thousands! Did you know every day, Americans buy 62 million newspapers and throw out 44 million. This is the same as disposing 500,000 trees every week! So what can we do to help?


One car. Running more than one car is damaging to the planet and could be costing you thousands of pounds a year.
Buy furniture at second hand stores. Who said that new furniture is better? At these stores, they get completely refinished so they look and feel like a new piece, without the major price tag. And, if you have any pieces that you don't need anymore, instead of hauling it to the dump donate it to one of these stores. They will appreciate the contribution, and it will help reuse the resources needed to create it.

Don’t litter! It’s not hard to keep your trash at hand until the nearest trash can, or put it away in a bag to dispose of later. It’s a criminal offence to litter, so it's important to throw your items away wisely.
Put pressure on companies to produce products that last longer.
Campaign. Issues could include that non of the leading world powers have taken a solid commitment to what they will do about climate change. An average american causes twice as much pollution as an average person in the uk.

Start compost bins, and put all your fruit scraps into it. This will act as a great fertilizer and will cut the waste we leave lying around.

Use recycling bins. That way, things that could have been easily recycled aren’t lying around wasted at a dump where they could blow and ruin natural forests and tree habitats. Try to encourage them around the workplace or at school, as well as your home.

, Lots of animals are being neglected and endangered by human beings worldwide. Many animals are falling extinct because of human actions or the environment which we have created on top of their natural habitat. There are about 400 animals who are listed as endangered and about 160 that are threatened in the US. But there are about 500 animals listed as endangered and 440 listed as threatened worldwide. That's almost a thousand animals that we know of as being extinct or endangered! Here’s where we can help.


Did you know that eighteen foxes are needed to make one fur coat? Don't buy them!
Support some global funds such as the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA), The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Greenpeace, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). To get inspired, many celebrities are taking a stance on the issue and encourage you to do so as well. For example, singer Pink is a supporter for PETA and The Veronica's support the Australian fund, Steve Irwin’s Wildlife Warriors in Queensland. Really take part in your chosen fund, and take the opportunity to meet some other people there with similar interests.
Volunteer to work at your local zoo or donate to their animal support funds. Many zoos have campaigns and things that fight animal cruelty, so why not get involved and do your bit to make a difference?
Try not to buy products that may harm animals, or that have been tested against them.

, People in under-privileged countries are living in complete poverty – imagine not knowing when your next meal is! Every three seconds, a child dies from extreme poverty. Here’s what you can do.



Participate in the next 40 Hour Famine. This is a great organization who helps raise funds for those living in poverty, plus you will experience only a little of how much pain the people living in poverty experience daily due to lack of food.
Poverty is a human creation made worse when the mega rich don't pay enough taxes since they lobby governments.

Sponsor a child – ask your family or your school if they could sponsor a child as a group so you can get involved in making a child who has less that you do's life better, plus meet a new friend.
Donate any old or unwanted items to charities which support families living in poverty.
Wear a Make Poverty History band to show your support to end all forms of poverty, and encourage your friends to purchase them also and as a group fight poverty.

,


Hold the door open for someone behind you instead of letting the door swing behind you into their face. It's just common courtesy, and the person will acknowledge you for your kindness.

Give someone you love a compliment - try to give one compliment every day! Try to keep away from material comments - whilst hearing your hair looks great can make you feel pretty good, nothing beats being told that you have a great personality or that you are an amazing friend!

Use your manners - saying please and thank you is only polite! Try to replace words in your vocabulary for the more polite version - for example, if you are a child, address adults as Mrs/Mr instead of their first name, unless they give you permission to, and say ""May you please help me?"" instead of ""Can you help me?"".

Spend some quality time with your family. This is very important, as it will prove to them just how much you appreciate all they do for you, and how much you love them. Always make time for your loved ones.
Try to smile as much as possible - show off those pearly whites! Smiling is contagious, so spread around the joy!
Go comfort a friend who is at the sickbay at school, or visit your local hospital. This will provide some happiness to those currently lacking it, and they do say that laughter is the best medicine, so why not cheer someone who isn't feeling too well up?

,



Recycling – set up a recycling system in your household to reuse items the right way. Try setting up different colored trash cans, and have a different color for a different recyclable. For example, a pink trash can for all the empty soda cans, or a blue trash can for all the scrap paper.
Turn off the light when you’re not in the room – this will save electricity and money! Do you really need to have the bulb lit when no one needs the light? Natural resources like water, wind and coal are used to provide electricity, so don't waste it!
Plant native plants in your garden to create a home for native animals.
Attach a hose to your washing machine so after you've finished washing your clothes, maybe hose down your pathway or give your deck a wash with the water. This way, you will be recycling water instead of using more, and cleaning at the same time!
Cold on a freezing winter's night? Throw on an extra jumper instead of turning on the heater.
Try purchasing rechargeable batteries for your camera/television remote/toys instead of buying lots of normal batteries and creating waste.
Did you know that even appliances on standby still consume electricity? So even if you think your Playstation is turned off, it'll still be using energy until it is unplugged at the wall. Doing this will save electricity, and money when it comes to paying your electricity bill!
Print on both sides of the paper when printing to save paper. Having it back-to-back doesn't really make that much of a difference to printing on only one side, except for the amount of paper used!
When scrapbooking, cut any decorative paper from the sides, don't go cutting your shapes in the middle straight away! This ensures that you will have enough room to cut out more shapes later, instead of using another piece.

Pick up trash – don’t ignore any litter on the ground! Pick it up, and participate in some clean up the community events.

Keep showers short! No need to stand under the tap for twenty minutes! Try keeping your showers to a 5-minute limit, or have a bath.
Go op-shopping – this is reusing items, and you’re saving money!
Donate anything you don’t need to charity or participate in Trash and Treasure stalls.
Share - don't hog everything to yourself! Maybe someone forgot their lunch, or has little, or has no umbrella in the rain. Be kind and share what you have.
Share environment friendly ideas with family, friends,colleague,employees and children. Sharing is caring.

, Estimates go up to 4 million women and children each year.

, 250 million children worldwide are involved in child labour.

Help with summertime activities.,
Show them how to use their electronic devices.,
Volunteer at a game night or social event..",How to Help Senior Citizens2," Some senior citizens enjoy being out and about during the summer. There are a variety of activities that some senior citizens enjoy, including celebrating holidays with family and friends, walking out in the sun, and swimming.


Find out what activities senior citizens enjoy doing and plan something fun to do. You can say something like, “What activities do you enjoy doing during the summer?” to gauge what the senior citizen is interested in and then plan something accordingly., Sometimes senior citizens receive gifts from family or friends that they do not know how to use because they are unfamiliar with the technology. Ask a senior citizen if they need help with using a device, such as an iPhone, and then show them how to use the device.You can say something like, “Can I show you a few things on how to use that phone?” to open the conversation in a way that doesn’t sound condescending. Then, show them how to navigate the device and how to execute important functions, such as placing a call, texting, and using the contact list.
If you have time and they are interested, show them how to download and play some games or use a fun app.

, Most nursing homes have game nights and social nights that keep senior citizens occupied and socializing with others. Inquire as to how you can help at these events at your local nursing home. It is likely that they rely on volunteers like you to operate these events!

Assist with household tasks.,
Help out with yard work.,
Offer to help with gardening.,
Go grocery shopping.,
Drive them around to complete their errands.",How to Help Senior Citizens3," There are certain chores that a senior citizen will have difficulty performing and could benefit from someone’s assistance. Doing things like sweeping and mopping floors, cleaning the bathrooms, vacuuming, washing windows, and cleaning the kitchen will greatly assist a senior citizen.


You can always say something like, “How about I give you a hand mopping the floors today?” Ask them which tasks need to be completed and set to work getting those things done! , Senior citizens may not be able to move, bend, and lift as well as younger individuals. If a senior citizen is living in their own home, they may need help with yard work, especially in the fall and spring seasons. Take a look at their yard and then talk about what things you can do to clean it up and keep it looking nice. You can say, “It looks like the garden has some weeds that need to pulled and the lawn should be mowed soon.” Once you start a conversation about it, you can find out specific things you can do for them.


Remove debris, like fallen branches, from the yard.
Cut down branches on trees that are taking up too much space or look like they need to come down.
Pull weeds in the garden.
Rake leaves in the autumn.
Mow the lawn as necessary.
Assist with snow and ice removal to prevent dangerous falls.

, Some senior citizens love gardening and regard it as a beloved and rewarding hobby. A strong pair of hands can be a great help to a senior citizen while gardening. There is a lot of bending of legs, being on one’s knees, scraping, and back bending that an older person might have trouble with or be unable to do.


Be prepared to work hard and do a lot of pulling and bending. Try wearing knee pads to take the pressure off your knees when working on the ground., Many senior citizens need assistance with grocery shopping because they cannot lift heavy objects very well.


Talk about the groceries and supplies they will need for the next week or two and then put together a shopping list.
Offer to drive them to the store or simply go on their behalf. If they go with you, take your time going up and down the aisles and make sure that they have everything that is on their list and more.
Carry all of the grocery bags into their residence and put the groceries away.

, If you have a car and a valid driver’s license, set aside a few hours to drive a senior citizen around to do all of their errands. They may need to do things like go to the post office, go to a certain store, go to an appointment, drop something off, etc.


Before you go out, sit down and talk about all of the places they need to go and what time their appointments are. Then figure out the most efficient way to complete the errands. Be sure to be prompt in picking them up if you first dropped them off somewhere.

Determine what tasks to be done on a recurring basis.,
Plan for the financial future.,
Establish a schedule.",How to Help Senior Citizens4," There are certain chores and household tasks that need to be performed on daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Determine what those tasks are, who will be assisting with those tasks, and when. Then make sure that everyone involved adheres to the schedule. If there is in-home help or assisted living, many of these tasks will already be taken care of.

, Plan finances ahead of time so that the senior citizen is prepared for incidentals and emergencies. Make time to sit down with them and lay out a plan. It is best to be prepared and know what to expect so that a senior citizen is not taken by surprise or left with nothing. Review the state of the senior citizen’s finances with him or her. Determine their income, what assets they possess, what bills need to be paid, and what debts are owed.
Create a realistic budget and financial plan that the senior citizen understands and can stick to.

, Planning out a schedule for senior citizens will prevent them from becoming bored, will give them something to look forward to, and will prevent depression. Whether it be a hobby that they enjoy, lunch with friends or family, or a game of cards, a schedule will make a senior citizen’s life more pleasant.


Talk to the senior citizen and find out what they want to do more of. If they want to do things like visit friends more often, then schedule some time to visit with friends. Incorporate their favorite activities in the schedule so that they can look forward to something every day. "

Find some friends.,
Talk to school administrators.,
Find a teacher as a sponsor.,
Find a meeting room.,
Publicize your club.,
Have your first meeting.,
Create your club’s structure.,
Plan projects.",How to Create an Environmental Club1," You won’t be able to do this alone, so you’ll need some people to help. Find a friend or two who cares about the environment like you do. This way, you can show others that people are already interested in your club, and you have members to help do the organizing to get things going.When you talk to other people about your club, listen to their ideas and concerns too. You might be able to fit into your potential club, making it more attractive for them to join.;
, Any club that wants to draw in students and use school facilities needs to have permission from your principal or other school leader. They will tell you all the things you need to do to become an official school club, probably some paperwork. Along with this permission, they can also provide additional advice for good ways to start your club and get the word out., Most school clubs need an advisor from the faculty to help become official. Your faculty advisor will supervise your meetings, offer regular advice, and may even pitch in to help if needed. Your advisor doesn’t need to be an environmentalist, though someone who shares your concern for the environment would be a good place to start. Science teachers are probably the most likely to help, but anyone can be interested in helping the environment., When you start planning your first meeting, remember that you will need a classroom to hold it in. Make sure it is a room you can get to regularly. You will use it for scheduled meetings to discuss upcoming projects.The classroom of your advisor is probably your best bet, but check first. Someone else might be using it at different times, which will limit when you can schedule your meeting.

, Now that you have a club, make sure people know about it. There are a variety of ways to spread the word about a school club. For all of them, remember to include the name of your club, and the time and place of your first meeting. You can include other information if you want, but it needs at least that much. If people don’t know about your club and your meetings, they won’t know to attend.


Post fliers around the school. Your school probably has lots of posters for different clubs and activities. Look for ways to help yours stand out and get people’s attention. You might try printing on recycled paper, green color paper, or posters with pictures of celebrities who care about environmental causes.If your school has rules about posters and fliers, make sure you know what they are, and that you follow all instructions.
If your school does announcements in the morning, over a loudspeaker or a television, make sure your club gets a mention. Talk to the person who controls the announcements, usually the principal or a teacher, about how to make sure your message gets read to the school.
A good way to get people’s attention is to give a presentation in front of them. You probably won’t get the whole school, so talk to your principal or teacher about giving an announcement in your homeroom or other classes. This will give students a chance to see you directly, rather than having your club announced with a bunch of other things in the morning.
Another good way to spread the word is to have your members talk to a new potential member about the club and try to encourage them to come to the next meeting. You won’t get all of these people, but even a few new arrivals can help your club grow., Once you have some people interested, and a place to meet, have your first meeting. Get people to show up and talk about what the club will be doing. Talk about what you want the club to accomplish, and how everyone will be involvedThe most important thing you can do at this meeting, along with making sure people know about your club, is to get contact information. If someone shows up, make sure you get people’s names, phone numbers, and emails. This way, you’ll be able to keep in contact with them when trying to schedule future meetings. Be sure to also give them some contact information for the club, so they can contact you if they need something.
One good way to encourage people to show up to the first meeting is to provide snacks. If you are going to have food, make sure you mention it when you tell people about the meeting, so it will encourage them to come.
During your first meeting, make sure you schedule and announce your next meeting. Regular meetings will help people build time in their schedule and make sure to attend, which is important for a new club.

, Once you have some people gathered, you’ll need to figure out how your club should be structured and run. It shouldn’t just be one person doing all the work and deciding what happens. Instead, create some rules for how the club decides what to do, and choose some officers.If you can, try to give your club a statement of purpose, a couple of sentences that explains who you are and what you are trying to do. This is important to help explain to people what your club believes in, and why they would want to join up.
Your first meeting might be a good time to decide the kind of officers you want your club to have rather than picking him right away. Some positions to consider include a president, project coordinator, secretary, treasurer, and public relations coordinator. Make sure your club is clear about what holding these positions will entail, so you can find the right people for them.

, Once your club has started, you’ll want to start doing projects to carry out your environmental goals. The list of potential projects is endless, but to start with you should probably focus on doing something around the school.This will help spread the word about your club and get more students interested. Once you get a larger club, you’ll be able to take on even bigger projects.


You should probably have one or two ideas when you start the club. That way you can get started on something quickly, which will keep your new members interested. Once those are done, you can start taking ideas and suggestions from other club members, which should give you a nice long list of things to do.
Part of planning projects may include raising money to pay for those projects. When you start your club, your school may have a budget that you can use. That may not be enough, though, so when you start planning projects think about how much money you will need to do things and how you can raise that money."

Look for other environmental groups.,
Talk to other community groups.,
Create your club’s structure.,
Find a meeting place.,
Publicize your club.,
Network with other environmental groups.,
Have your first meeting.,
Plan projects.,
Create a long-term plan.",How to Create an Environmental Club2," While you may be excited to start your own organization, make sure you know what other groups are already out there. Maybe you are really interested in cleaning up waterways. There may be local groups that do environmental cleanup, but focus on cleaning highways or forests. Choosing something different will give you a niche, and give people a reason to join your new club. If your group isn’t different, or doing something that others aren’t, it will be hard to get traction., Your club doesn’t have to exist on its own. Consider working with local organizations that do service, or otherwise like to get involved in the community. These groups can be a good basis for finding new members, as well as providing volunteers, meeting space, and advertising.Some good groups include service organizations like the Lions Club, Boy and Girl Scouts, local libraries and community centers, or colleges. You should consider church groups. Some denominations, such as Lutherans, Reform Judaism, and Episcopalians, put emphasis on local community work and are interested in helping the environment.You should also consider contacting local politicians. Cleaning up the environment can look good to voters, so politicians will be willing to help as a way to improve both the community and their chances of getting re-elected. Plus, they will likely know local laws and groups you need to work with and around., Once you have some people gathered, you’ll need to figure out how your club should be structured and run. It shouldn’t just be one person doing all the work and deciding what happens. Instead, create some rules for how the club decides what to do, and choose some officers.If you can, try to give your club a statement of purpose, a couple of sentences that explains who you are and what you are trying to do.

Some positions to consider include a president, project coordinator, secretary, treasurer, and public relations coordinator. Make sure your club is clear about what holding these positions will entail, so you can find the right people for them.

, Once you have some people together, you need to figure out where you are going to meet. Look for common spaces like community centers or libraries. People generally know where they are, and this can be better than trying to meet in someone’s house. If you can find a large place to meet for free, that is a good choice.Your partnerships and sponsorships with other organizations can be really helpful in doing this. Many of them may already have spaces that you can use or rent out, as long as they aren’t doing something else there at that time.
This location should be somewhere you can meet regularly. If you can only reserve the space for one meeting, and have to keep moving, it will be difficult for people to keep track of where you are, and you’ll lose potential members. Consistency is important.
When you get your meeting place, make sure you can reserve it for a time when people can show up. You may have found a great location, but if you can only have meetings at 10:00 am on Wednesdays, you probably won’t get too many people to show up. Availability will dictate some of your meeting times, but make sure you put them at a time when many people can show up. Consider talking to your members about good days and times for your meetings.

, You want to do this before your first meeting so that you have some new people who will show up when you start. Once you have your basic club in mind, and a time and place for your first meeting, find ways to advertise what you are planning. Make sure any advertising or announcing you do includes the name of your organization, the time and place of your next (or first) meeting. You should also include some contact information for you so that people can contact you if they have questions, or want more information.


Remember that your target audience is people who care about the environment, and would be interested in volunteering for your projects. Make sure your advertising reaches those people, so look for existing environmental clubs, service organizations, and places where you might find others interested in the environment.
At first, you’ll probably want to keep your advertising cheap, if not free. Get your friends to spread the new by word of mouth, post fliers in strategic locations, and put announcements into newsletters, community calendars, and church bulletins.
A social media account, like a Facebook page, is a good way to reach many others. These can also be good platforms for people to communicate with you and learn about what you want to do.

, Once you’ve got your club up and running, get in contact with other environmental groups in your area. Look for ways your group can help with projects they have in mind, and think about how they can help you with your ideas. You may even find some people who want to join your club.One really good way to do this is through your social media account. Use that page to follow and communicate with other club’s accounts. Even if you have a slightly different focus, you’ll probably reach a few more people who care about your issues.

, Once you have some people interested, and a place to meet, have your first meeting. Get people to show up and talk about what the club will be doing. Talk about what you want the club to accomplish, and how everyone will be involved.The most important thing you can do at this meeting, along with making sure people know about your club, is to get contact information. If someone shows up, make sure you get people’s names, phone numbers, and emails. This way, you’ll be able to keep in contact with them when trying to schedule future meetings.

, Once your club has started, you’ll want to start doing projects to carry out your environmental goals. Your probably started with one or two ideas in mind, which is good. These are things you can get started on something quickly, which will keep your new members interested.


Part of planning projects may include raising money to pay for those projects. Some projects cost money, as you will need supplies and other things that aren’t free (like volunteer labor). When you think about projects, think about how much they will cost, and where that money will come from. If it is more than you have readily available, consider adding fundraising projects to your list of things to do., There are many different ways you can do environmental work and help create a cleaner Earth. Some of those projects will take a long time and many hours of outdoor work, while others might only take a day or two. Create a plan of events and projects that your club can work on. A big project might include the creation of a community garden, or the cleanup of a highway. These are long-term projects that will take a lot of effort and time from a lot of people. Depending on where you live, you might not be able to work on them all year round, either.
Shorter-term projects could be something like a letter-writing campaign to local officials, or decorating posters to advertise an upcoming event. These are things you can do in the course of a single meeting, and can fill the time when you can’t work on your bigger ideas.

Come up with specific projects to do.,
Plan your project.,
Get volunteers.,
Carry out your project.,
Share your experiences.",How to Create an Environmental Club3," You founded this club to help the environment, so now it’s time to look for ways to do that. You may have had a few ideas before starting the club, which is great. This is the chance for your whole club to talk about their goals and brainstorm project ideas. There are all sorts of projects you can do, so focus on ones that play to your strengths and fit within your larger goals. Some things you might consider include:Start a composting or recycling program for your school or business
Create a community garden
Have a local clean-up, maybe of a dirty lot or polluted waterway
Adopt a highway
Write up environmental tips and other information for your school, office, or other places
Show an environmental film, or have a film series
Start a letter-writing campaign to local officials for better environmental policies

, Once you have a project in mind, now you need to prepare. Make sure you have an idea of the scope of your project, including how long it will take, how many people you will need, and what kinds of supplies and equipment are necessary. You want to have all of this arranged before you start working, otherwise you won’t be able to get your project done.


If you are doing something large scale and outdoors, talk to your local government too. Many towns and cities want to encourage environmental projects. Not only can they help in getting the word out for your effort, but some will be willing to provide supplies, including brooms, rakes, shovels, gloves, and trash bags, as well as paint and paint supplies for dealing with graffiti, and even an industrial-sized dumpster for depositing trash., Chances are you and your friends, and maybe even your club members, won’t be enough to carry out all the projects you have in mind. Once you have some ideas for things to do, look for additional volunteers for your projects. Make sure you tell people what you need from them, and how much time and effort you are expecting.There are many great ways to recruit, including face-to-face, with posters and fliers, and through media like newspapers and websites. Talk to other local organizations, like social clubs, community and religious organizations, even your own businesses, for potential help.
Once you get people to show up to help, remember to get their contact information. You’ll need to keep in touch with them about the project, plus you never know who will be interested in joining once they see how much fun it is.

, Once you’ve got the plan and the people, get to work. This is the fun part. The great thing about your club is that you have a bunch of people to work with. This will make it even more likely you can make a big difference for the world, whatever it is you are trying to do.

, While working on projects, and after you finish, find ways to let other people know what you are doing. Take before and after pictures of a clean-up area, or get photos of you and your club mates in action. Let people see how many volunteers you have, and how much fun you all are having while making a difference in the world.Having a social media page is a great place to post these pictures so that your social network can see all that you are doing. Maybe you’ll be able to inspire some new people to join.

There might be the same person we drive by or pass on the street, but other than that, it's totally random. So be ready to help by keeping a food kit in your car (or mom's!). A gallon-sized resealable bag (or two) with non-perishable items is a great way to always be ready.


As for non-perishable items, think the basics. Granola bars, canned fruit or vegetables, peanut butter, maybe a candy bar -- pretty much anything you can open and eat (that can't get smushed, like potato chips).
Don't forget pet food! It's estimated that around 10% of homeless people have pets to keep them company. That's 1 out of every 10! Pet food can be just as useful -- if their pets aren't fed, that's one more thing they have to worry about.;
, You know how practically every checkout line nowadays has row upon row of gift cards readily available to inspire that impulse buy? Instead of needlessly spending money, spend it for a good cause! Having a gift card or two is super easy to carry around. Now where to?


Keep it simple, like Starbucks, McDonald's, Walmart, or Target. Even $5 would be an amazing gesture. Gift cards are much easier to carry around wherever you go!

, As you've probably noticed, homeless people often go around collecting cans and bottles. We all have recyclables that we could donate to someone who actually needs the change, so keep yours! And hey, it saves you a trip! That's win win. That's by winning.

, If there's not one going on at your school or work, find out about what's happening in your community. Some organizations practically have food drives that run all year long. Check your newspaper, local schools, and other news outlets.


If you can't find a food drive in your area, there are plenty of other ways to donate food! Contact your local shelters, churches, and coalitions to ask what they need. This is especially useful around the holidays.

, You've heard it before and we'll say it again: when you give money, who knows what it could be used for? Some organizations say that giving cash keeps them on the street, so they don't go searching for assistance at shelters and coalitions.


But do feel free to donate cash to nonprofits and other similar organizations that assist the homeless. When you help the helpers, your dollar can reach maximum efficiency. They know exactly what to do with it!

, They go by different names in every town, but one is your local Catholic Charities (CC) which is a clearing-house for this and other programs. They aren't interested in whether you're a Catholic, or not, for the record. They'll be grateful for any help you can give!


Whether your help is in the form of volunteering your time, money, food, or clothing, you will be making a positive difference. Those that go to churches looking for help aren't necessarily religious; they just know they'll reach people that are inclined to help.

, The Internet and the yellow pages will be super helpful here. Once you have a list comprised you can:


Make phone calls, asking how you can help each one. Some may need volunteers, some may need food, and yet others may need personal items, etc.
Have information at the ready when you are talking to a homeless person. Giving them a can of food feeds them today, but telling them about a shelter feeds them for much, much longer.

, Why stop at donating the food when you can help prepare it? Homeless people don't just need food, they need a smiling face to go along with it. You can restore their faith in humanity by just lending a helping hand like they're a worthy human being.

, Wanna take your efforts to the next level? Fundraise at your school or workplace! Even if you get a few friends together, there's power in numbers. The more people you get involved, the more people you can help. Whether it's for a day or a month, it's a good idea.


For bigger fundraisers, get the word out! Make flyers, pass 'em out, send emails, do a couple Facebook shout outs -- whatever can reach the most people. Even if everyone donated one dollar, it'd be something!

, Though you may not know it, there are probably coalitions in your area with the main purpose of helping out the homeless. These are nonprofit organizations that aim to reduce the number of people on the streets. Get involved with yours!


In America, calling 211 or 311 can put you through to the crisis hotline if you find someone desperately in need. The emergency dispatcher may alert someone from the coalition to the area immediately., Just like fundraising, you could organize a food drive! Sometimes people are more inclined to give away canned goods over money -- we notice it less in our pocketbooks. Start one at school or work! Make a goal and get to it. Now how long will it run for?


Go big or go home, right? Contact your local newspaper or news station for coverage. Get the word out! You have such a good cause; who'd say no? Get the word out on social media and tell all your friends -- you'll need back up!

, Since the homeless don't vote much, they don't get a lot of attention when it comes to our representatives. Let yours know that you want initiative taken!


Right now the ""Bring America Home Act"" is trying to be pushed through legislation.For more information, visit the National Coalition for the Homeless' website.
In addition to pre-existing efforts, write letters! The more letters your rep gets, the more he or she will have to sit up and take note.

, Your current representatives not doing anything? Get involved yourself! Even being on the school board is a step in the right direction! Sometimes people won't speak for you, so you gotta speak up yourself!


Start attending committee meetings, for starters. Get to know the people you need to get to know. It'll be hard to start momentum all by yourself. Other people probably feel the same as you do -- you just need to team up!

, Feeding the homeless is one thing, but why stop there? Once they have a roof over their heads, they have so much less to worry about -- and more money to spend on food. Don't just think about shelters -- volunteer your time elsewhere, too!


You can also feed the habitat workers! Contact your local division to ask if you can sponsor lunch or, heck set up a lemonade stand. Every bit helps!

, Obviously this is going to take the most work -- community approval, start-up costs, possible licensing, etc. But it is possible -- it's how the programs you know got started: one person. Are there any gaps in your community that could be filled?

Find out where the flood happened.,
Stay informed and up-to-date over time.,
Decide how you would like to help.",How to Help Flood Victims1," Chances are you already have a specific flood trajectory in-mind, but if you don't or aren't abreast with smaller-scaled floods happening throughout the world, the first step is to find out which regions have suffered floods and need help.


Depending on where the flood occurred, different humanitarian organizations will be involved in coordinating relief efforts.
If the flood occurred in the United States, chances are the American Red Cross and Salvation Army will be marshalling aid and leading relief efforts.
If it is an international natural disaster, check to see if UNICEF or AmeriCares are providing aid in the affected area.
Visit the organization's website or call to find out what kind of aid they are providing and how you can best get involved.;
, As the needs change, so will the ways you can help -- some ways might be more inline with your abilities or resources over others.


Different needs will arise at different moments in the crisis. For instance, there will be emergent needs in the immediate aftermath as well as long-term rebuilding needs for years to come.
Sometimes an organization will reach maximum capacity with certain types of donations (like clothing), but have a deficit in another area. The best way to know what is most needed is to frequently check-in with the status of their aid efforts and need by calling or looking for updates on their social media accounts.

, There are several ways to get involved, and each has their own pros and cons as detailed below in and in the following sections.


If you have extra funds or goods, you might consider making monetary donations. If you have time, skills, or other supportive resources to offer in lieu of monetary donations, you can offer these to those in need.
There are pros/cons for each this type of involvement: for donations, a pro is that you can act quickly and put resources in the hands of organizations who can decide how to best help the victims. A con to making donations is that you don't necessarily know if all of your money will go directly to the victims (be sure to research how organizations administer donations before you give to them). One of the biggest pros of volunteering instead of donating money is that you get to feel like you really providing hands-on helps while interacting with people. A potential con is the danger and risk of injury associated with traveling to flood zones.

Do your research.,
Become an advocate.,
Fight stigma.,
Spread the knowledge yourself.,
Direct your friends or colleagues to useful information.,
Encourage others to participate.",How to Help Homeless Children1," One of the first steps to empathizing with homeless children is learning about the events surrounding their circumstances. Some children leave home after being repeatedly abused, others have multiple family members that are also homeless. Many homeless youth have already begun using or selling drugs as a means of coping with their situation. Read up on the facts about youth homelessness so you can be better prepared to help.Most shelters or kitchens that deal with homeless youth will have informational pamphlets available. Reputable organizations like the National Coalition for the Homeless also feature valuable information on their websites.;
, Find out what resources are needed at homeless shelters or soup kitchens and contact local charities or civic organizations to sponsor food or clothing drives. You can also be an effective advocate for homeless youth by attending city council meetings and speaking up about how the city could better allocate resources to help them.A major part of advocating for the homeless is using respectful terminology. Instead of “street kid” or “vagrant,” use phrases like “children experiencing homelessness.”, Many people are discouraged from helping homeless youth and families due to unfair and inaccurate information about homelessness. Use what you've learned to encourage others to rethink their biases when it comes to homeless youth.


If a colleague makes a generalization like, ""All homeless people are lazy,"" you might counter with ""A lot of homeless youth don't have the resources to help themselves, and others have substance abuse problems or emotional health concerns.""Almost 40 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ—others constitute racial minorities. Being sensitive and informed about the special challenges facing minority homeless youth can help you better serve them.

, Use what you have learned to influence the way others think about homeless children. Start by striking up casual conversations with friends, loved ones, or coworkers to share information. As you become more confident addressing these topics, consider hosting an informative session at your home, local recreation center, or place of worship.


Consider inviting the director of a homeless youth center to come speak at your workplace or a community center. Ask them to hold a Q and A session to address the challenges facing homeless children.
If you decide to host an informative gathering, consider inviting a young person who has experienced homelessness to speak about their experiences and educate the audience about how to be sensitive to the needs of homeless youth.

, Organizations like the National Alliance to End Homelessness often host conferences to keep communities informed and engaged. Others, like the NCH, maintain facts sheets on their websites designed to educate people about the causes of youth homelessness as well as keep them updated on statistics and special issues.No matter how passionately you may feel about circulating information on youth homelessness, try your best to be tactful and sensitive about it. Friends and coworkers may respond better to the occasional email or brochure than a constant inundation of suggestions and statistics.

, Go the extra mile by suggesting that your friends or family attend advocacy events or informational meetings with you. Be on the lookout for outreach programs or conferences in local newspapers or online forums.Undertaking short fasts, such as skipping one meal in a day, can cause people to stop and think about what life is like for children who are hungry on a regular basis. Experiences like these can often teach more effectively than a conference or brochure.

Make a monetary donation.,
Donate goods.,
Donate blood.,
Donate your leave time.",How to Help Flood Victims2," Sending money is an easy and effective way to help.


Be sure that you are donating to a reputable organization like The Salvation Army, American Red Cross, or UNICEF. Unfortunately, some sham organizations can crop up in the aftermath of disasters as ploys to steal well-intentioned donations.Ask if you can make a donation via text message. A recent trend among aid organizations is to provide a phone number and keyword for people to make a donations. The amount you give will show up on your next mobile phone bill. It’s as easy as sending a text message, and much more meaningful!, If you have extra or unneeded items laying around, consider donating them to flood victims in need.Gently used clothing, socks, shoes, bedding, and blankets are almost always in need after a devastating flood.
You can also help the children affected by floods by sending them books and toys.
Purchase and donate new, non-perishable food items and bottled drinking water.
First aid kits, tents, mosquito netting, soap, and hygiene products might also be needed.

, Floods can cause serious injuries and there may be a need for more blood after a the disaster. If there’s a blood drive in your area, and if you meet the health/age requirements, consider becoming a donor., Some large companies, especially governmental agencies or offices, allow people to donate their unused sick time or vacation leave to others in need. Contact the human resources representative at your work and ask if you can transfer some of your leave time to those unable to work as a result of the flood."
"
Volunteer in the affected area.,
Volunteer your professional services.,
Volunteer outside of the affected area.",How to Help Flood Victims3," If it's safe enough to travel to the afflicted area, see if aid organizations are looking for volunteers to help on the ground.


If you meet height, weight, age, fitness, education, and U.S. citizenship requirements, consider joining the National Guard. The National Guard is a part-time, locally organized branch of the U.S. military that responds to natural disasters (both in the U.S. and sometimes abroad) as part of their call of duty.After completing basic training, you can chose a short-term enlistment (three years) and then continue to be a member of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) who are called up in the event of emergencies like natural disasters.Consider volunteering with Habitat for Humanities or other organizations whose mission is to clear debris, help homeowners salvage their personal belongings, and rebuild damaged homes. , Your time and talents are a valuable resource and can help those in need.If you are a health care professional, see if you can donate your medical services or supplies.
If you are a contractor or work in construction, volunteer your manpower, supplies, and other resources towards rebuilding efforts.
If you are an educator or child care worker, offer to provide support and assistance with displaced families and their children.
If you are a business owner, especially in the area surrounding the flood, offer discounts or gratis goods/services to those affected by the flood.

, Even if you can’t be there on the ground, you can still make a big difference by volunteering.


Get in touch with the local branch of the aid organization working with flood victims and see if they need help in their call center, hotline, or donation processing facility. You can also become a community liaison by collecting local donations and bringing them to the regional sorting facility.

Offer shelter.,
Offer spiritual support.,
Offer emotional support.",How to Help Flood Victims4," If you live nearby the flood area and your house is intact, consider fostering a displaced family who may have lost their home and everything they own in the disaster., Many people rely on their faith during times of crisis and draw emotional and spiritual strength from the support of church and religion.


If you are part of a church or religious organization, encourage your leaders to reach out to flood victims with support as well as tangible aid.
Some large religious organization, like the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team, send crisis-trained chaplains into areas impacted by natural disasters to coordinate relief efforts and provide further emotional and spiritual support for those affected.If you are a spiritual person, pray for the flood victims and/or reflect for a moment on the situation. Open your heart to ways you can help, and be a comfort to those in need., In additional to other forms of help, you can make some basic, caring gestures towards those in need.Ask how you can be most helpful to those affected by the flood. They might need a hot, home cooked meal, help taking care of their pets, or photographing flood damage for insurance claims.
Be a good listener and remember that sometimes its best to just listen and not offer your own opinions or solutions without being asked for them.
Remember that people need support in the days, months, and even years following natural disasters. Be sensitive to the fact that new issues and difficulties can continue to arise, even after the flood waters subside.

Serve as an ambassador.,
Help out at a special event.,
Write or visit your legislators.,
Make a presentation.,
March for babies.,
Post on social media.",How to Get Involved With the March of Dimes2," Ambassadors typically are parents who have had a child born prematurely or with birth defects. Celebrities and community leaders also may serve as ambassadors for the March of Dimes.To become an ambassador, you must first be nominated by your local chapter. The March of Dimes leadership chooses ambassadors from among the nominations.

, November is Prematurity Awareness Month, and November 17 is Prematurity Awareness Day. On this day and all month long, the March of Dimes promotes many different events to raise awareness for prematurity and birth defects.There also are activities that you can coordinate at your school or within your workplace, such as door decorating contests, a purple costume contest, or a baby photo contest.
You also can sell March of Dimes awareness bands at your school or workplace to help raise awareness for the cause.

, The March of Dimes is a nonpolitical organization and engages in only minimum lobbying efforts. However, this doesn't stop you as an individual from contacting your federal, state, or local representatives to advocate for laws to better support and protect premature babies and their families.For example, you can campaign to make sure that maternity coverage is required for all health insurance providers.

, You can set up a booth or table at your school or workplace to help educate about prematurity and health complications that affect babies and mothers. Contact your local chapter to find out what materials and support are available.The ""color"" for March of Dimes is purple, so outfit your booth or table with plenty of purple fabric and balloons so that it stands out.
Provide information on how to get involved with or donate to your local March of Dimes chapter.

, Each year, the March of Dimes sponsors a number of walks throughout the country that are designed to raise money for the organization as well as promote awareness for the challenges of premature birth and birth defects.Go to https://www.marchforbabies.org to search and find a march near you.

Schedule recurring financial contributions.,
Help organize a local benefit.,
Donate food and supplies to your local NICU.,
Donate your old car.",How to Get Involved With the March of Dimes3," You can donate to the March of Dimes either directly through your local chapter or by visiting the March of Dimes website at https://www.marchofdimes.org/giving/support-general.aspx.The March of Dimes accepts one-time donations, but also allows you to set up a recurring contribution using your credit or debit card.
With a recurring donation, you may find that you are able to donate more money and still stay within your personal budget.

, Even if you don't have a lot of money to donate yourself, you may be able to pull in more donations from others through a local fundraising or benefit event to raise money for the March of Dimes.Prematurity Awareness Month in November is a good time to do this, but feel free to schedule your benefit at a time that makes sense given the nature of the event. After all, you wouldn't want to hold a charity golf tournament in November if there was snow on the ground.
Any sort of benefit event is welcome, so play to your own strengths. For example, if you play basketball, you might get some others together and organize a community basketball tournament as a benefit for the March of Dimes.

, Contact your local hospital before you organize a donation and ask what sorts of things they'll accept. For sanitation and safety reasons, many hospitals will not accept donations of anything that is used.You may be able to visit the NICU once a month and provide a hot meal for the families there.
You also can donate children's toys and books, although these typically must be in new condition.

, The March of Dimes accepts donations of cars and will tow your donated car for free from anywhere in the U.S. You'll be provided with a receipt and may be able to deduct the market value of your car on your taxes.When you donate your car, make sure you sign the title over directly to the March of Dimes.

Volunteer at a homeless shelter.,
Make use of your skills.,
Get others involved.",How to Help Homeless Children2," Homeless shelters and soup kitchens need lots of help. This can mean doing anything from clerical work like filing papers and answering phones to dealing directly with the children at the shelter. Whether you’re washing dishes, folding clothes, or serving a meal, donating your time at a shelter will positively impact the lives of homeless youth, and enrich your life as well.


Working with homeless children directly usually requires that you be at least 18 years of age and pass a background check. If you’re planning on volunteering at a homeless shelter, be prepared to meet these criteria.

, If you have any legal, secretarial, medical, counseling, plumbing, carpentry, or other occupational skills, put them to use for a shelter or soup kitchen. Volunteer your services at your local shelter or offer to train others.

, Invite a friend or colleague to volunteer with you at a homeless shelter or ask them to participate in a food or clothing drive. They may soon find they have as much of a passion for helping homeless youth as you do!


When recruiting others to donate their time or resources, be respectful of their boundaries. Not everyone is comfortable spending long periods of time at shelters or offering up their professional skills, so don’t demand that they do so right away.

"
"
Choose a reputable charity.,
Give within your means.,
Be consistent.",How to Help Homeless Children3," There are many charities that assist homeless youth, but it’s important to find one that allocates its resources well and steers clear of political posturing or financial corruption. Research the charitable institution you plan on patronizing to make sure they have the best interests of homeless youth at the heart of everything they do.Well known organizations like Stand Up For Kids, Habitat for Humanity, or Housing Families have the experience needed to effectively make use of their donations. When in doubt, donate to a well respected institution.
Many charities offer the opportunity to sponsor a child. This method of donation can be particularly helpful as it allows a child the benefit of one patron they can look up to. Research sponsorship to see if it’s right for you.

, Not everyone can afford to write big checks to charities. Sometimes all it takes to make a difference is donating a few dollars a month or collecting canned goods to take to a food bank. There’s nothing wrong with giving generously, but make sure you’re staying with your own means and being financially responsible.


Another great way to give to homeless children is by donating clothes, diapers, shoes, and hygiene items. Donate hand-me-downs to a clothing drive or make a gift of new toothbrushes to a homeless youth center to increase a charity’s resources and their potential to help homeless children.

, Whatever method of donation you choose, it’s important to be consistent in your support. Make regular, incremental donations to a charity and you’ll begin to see the improvements brought about by your support.

Try to offer first.,
Help the needy.,
Think or what you can do.,
Put yourself in their shoes.,
Donate or volunteer.,
Watch or observe.,
Listen.",How to Help (Kids)," This means ask if they need it rather then having them ask you. Reach out and ask politely, ""Can I help?"" or ""Need a hand?"" or ""How can I help you?"" Some people are afraid to admit that they need help in the first place, so you asking them first can make them feel better. Remember that if they don't want help, they don't want help. Don't continue asking, ""Please, please, please?"" or be rude and say, ""But you need help!"" If they don't need help, leave them alone, but if they do, smile and ask what you can do.


If a person obviously really needs help, help them, even if they don't want to be helped. It's better than having them drop all of their books, or having to paint an entire house alone.
Know when you are needed. If your mom is making cookies, she can probably make them alone without your help, so don't be whiny and ask. If you don't know if you do or don't, let them ask you first. if they need help urgently, they'll ask.;
, Sometimes, even a few coins can make a big difference. If you see a man sitting on a box with raggedy clothes, he's probably poor and needs some assistance. Drop a quarter or dollar in his cup if he has one. Ask him what exactly he needs and be glad to give it to him (unless it's too much)! Remember, you can always help out a little!


Sometimes, when you see beggars on the street, consider whether or not they really need help. Some people just stand there because they want money, but others need help badly. Use your best judgement.

, Helping them with something that they don't need help with is good, but doesn't get you far. Think about what this person has been having trouble with or has been recently doing and think about what you can do to help them. Also think about; what would happen if you don't help this person? What would happen if you do? Take your best choice and do it!

, Being a nice person will bring thoughts of why you should help them and what it would be like if you were that person. If you were this person, how much help would you want or need? Some people want help, but don't need a ton of it. You don't want to be an overbearing person forcing them to take your assistance. Let them accept what you will give. Some people want a ton of help, and if you don't give them a lot, they'll be frustrated. Think about what this person needs and offer what you can give.

, Donating clothing, money or food will help the poor. Also volunteering for things is great! Make sure, though, that the organization or group you are helping will be trustworthy though. You don't want to help a lot for nothing at all. Give what you own, and then give your support, but make sure they will take it and put it to good use.

, See what people have to go through, it might motivate you to help even more! See the beggars, lined down the streets, begging for money, or watch some kids struggle to learn to read. Although it may make you feel sadder, it should help you to see what the world is like and what it needs from you. By looking around your community to see what the troubles are, you can make a difference.

, You can't possibly know anything if you don't pay attention! Listen to what people say, whether you are listening for instructions, or listening to a sad mother tell her story. Look around you and hear some children cry or hear the people you helped cheering, and remember that by listening, working hard and help out even a little, you can make a difference.

Adopt.,
Animal shelters don't have a lot of money, so anything you can do to help is great.,
Raise money for an animal shelter on Facebook.,
Raise money with a fundraiser.Hold car washes, set up a collection, sell jewelry or lemonade.,
Donate: Look for household items that you think will help.,
Make a donation bin.,
Become a photographer.,
Get a group of friends together and make various sizes of brightly colored bandannas.,
Get your dog/cat neutered or spayed.,
Click on the advertisements.,
Build a website.",How to Help an Animal Shelter," Animal shelters are always looking for people to adopt the animals they rescue. So instead of buying your dog from a breeder, adopt an equally loving dog from the shelter. Never buy a dog from a pet store, and encourage others to do the same. Those dogs typically come from puppy mills: where dogs are bred with no concern for their health. If you don't want to adopt from a shelter, at least go to a good breeder.;
, Volunteering positions include helping with adoption events, cleaning, doing paperwork, and walking the dogs. If you want to volunteer but for some physical reason you are not up to these activities, most shelters have a cat socializing position!

, It's an easy and effective way to raise money for pets online. Especially, if the shelter has a strong community (followers) on Facebook. There are fundraising platforms that were built for Facebook. They have apps that allow the shelter to add a ""Give tab"" to its facebook page and people can donate to a cause without leaving Facebook. Platforms, like Fundraiser, have a deep Facebook integration that sends all campaign's activities such as donations, story updates, comments to the news feed of donors and their friends. That's how the shelter reaches more people, builds awareness and raises more money for animals.

, Do something to raise money for the shelter. It's hard to believe, but $100 can be the difference between an animal's life or death.

, Normally, an animal shelter has a website that will show a wish list. Donate blankets, pet food, collars, leashes, toys, towels, office items, and many more!

, Put out a box at work or school asking people for gently used pet supplies, in addition to whatever else was on the wish list.

, Volunteer to take pictures of pets up for adoption. If people see an interesting picture they will be more interested in adopting the animal.

, A dog wearing a bandanna will jump out at people.

, You can help control the overpopulation of dogs and cats.

, If the shelter has a website, click on the advertisements. Ads usually pay the website per click. So, if you are really bored and want to help a shelter, go to their website and click as many ads as possible. You can make them money!

, Help your shelter enter the digital age by going online! Being online is a tremendous advantage when looking for publicity. If you are techie, build a website for a shelter.

Understand Phonological Awareness.,
Play with language.,
Cultivate the ability to hear sounds in words.,
Reference the following word lists for soundbox activities


Dictate words with two sounds: an, at, no, he, me, go, in, it, to, of, tea, pea, The words tea and pea have the vowel pattern /ea/.,
Sort pictures according to beginning sounds.,
Moving from phonological awareness to phonics (sound-letter match).",How to Teach Your Child Phonological Awareness," Phonological Awareness is a concept that occurs everyday, all day as we communicate by listening and speaking with others. It is the understanding that each word heard is determined by the sound said in a specific order. Below are some fun activities to practice phonological awareness with your child;
, Reciting nursery rhymes and playing rhyming games is a fun way to focus your child's attention on sounds. Engaging your child in these activities will help him/her build an understanding of phonological awareness.


Focus on the rhyming words in each rhyme. In saying each set of rhymes your child will learn that word order is important - changing the beginning sound of a word changes the word. For example: in the rhyme, Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water; the beginning sound change of /J/ to /h/ changes the word Jill to hill. This builds the realization that the order of sounds said in a word is important.
Extend the activity to provide your child with additional practice hearing sounds in words. Ask your child to say a word that rhymes with hill? If your child gives you an incorrect answer, provide him/her with some possible answers by asking what word rhymes with hill; mill or cat?

, This is an activity that does not involve letters. Its intent is for your child to focus on the number of sounds heard in each dictated word.


Make soundboxes. Create a template with three boxes to accommodate words with one, two or three sounds. Each box represents a sound heard in the word, not a letter or letter pattern.
This is important to note because words consisting of letter patterns will have less sounds than number of letters. Letter patterns are two letters joined (patterned) together to make one sound. Letter patterns include: silent e, vowel pairs (/ea/, /ee/, /ai/), and consonant digraphs (/sh/, /ch/, /th/, /wh/). For example the word sheep has five letters and three sounds /sh/, /ee/, /p/.
Say (dictate) a word to your child. Have your child say each sound as they push up a counter (or magnet) into a box to represent that sound. For example, the word at has two sounds /a/ and /t/, and the word cat has three sounds /c/, /a/, and /t/. and the word seat has three sounds /s/, /ea/, /t/


, 
Dictate words with three sounds: bat, sat, can, box, sit, cat, net, big, bug, sat, dog, cake, make, meet, seat, rain, team, sheep, chip, white 
Introduce words with four sounds when your child is ready, Add another soundbox to include words with four sounds such as: train, clock, skate /t/ /r/ /ai/ /n/


, As children develop phonological awareness, it is important for them to practice differentiating the sounds heard in words. This builds the realization that sounds must be said in the correct order to produce the desired word.


Have your child sort picture cards or objects according to their beginning sounds.
Extend the activity. Have your child sort picture cards and items according to their ending sounds. Use pails or other containers to sort picture cards and items

, Extend the activity to include letters. Have your child sort picture cards and objects according to the correct initial letter. This activity requires both sound and letter knowledge.


Place a letter on or in front of each pail or sorting container
Have your child (1) say the name of the picture card - bear, (2) produce the sound that it begins with - /b/, and (3) place the picture card or item in the pail that shows the correct letter that represents the sound - b.

Identify causes that you care about.,
Find an organization.,
Rate the organization.,
Look at what your community needs.,
Think local or think global.",How to Give Back to the Community1," If you are interested in supporting your community in a specific way, you can tailor your volunteering and charitable giving based on causes.


Usually, charitable organizations have a mission that is related to one particular cause. If you feel called to support an organization based on their mission, this is a good place to start.
Other organizations, like community centers, do not have a specific cause that they are working towards. They tend to be interested in generally supporting and benefiting the members of the community.
Whether you choose an organization that is dedicated to a specific cause or not, this is a good way to start thinking about your charitable actions.;
, Now that you have identified causes that you are interested in supporting, you can begin to search for organizations.


Search with organizations that are aligned with the causes that you care about. For example, you could search “Domestic violence organizations” with your zip code or city and see if there are charities in your area that you can support.
Ask friends and family about what organizations they support. They may be supporting an organization that you hadn’t come across in your search that you connect with.
Visit organization’s websites. The majority of charities will have a web presence and most will list what sort of support they need (ex. clothing donations, food donations, monetary).

, Some charities are better, more reputable, and help more people than others. You should take some time to make sure that this organization will distribute your donations to the people who need them.Before you donate your time, resources, and money to an organization it is important to consider its reputation and how effective it is.
Use a charity search to look for reviews and ratings of the different organizations that you are considering supporting.Smaller and local organizations may not be searchable. You should ask around your community and social network to see if anyone has had any negative experiences with that organization.

, As you look at ways to give back, you will learn more about the needs of your community and how already established organizations or programs support those needs. You may notice that there is a gap in the services offered in your area, or that organizations aren't reaching certain groups or areas.


Start an organization or program. You may be passionate about promoting literacy and helping kids love to read, and notice that your local school district doesn't offer any after-school programs dedicated to reading. You could start a program that promotes causes that you care about.
If you decide that you'd like to start an organization or program in your area, it may be helpful to partner with an established organization or community center in your area. That way, you can tap into their resources and expand their programming.
Look for other people that share your interests and form a group that dedicates their time to working towards that cause.
Organize with others to start a club, program, event or organization that you believe will give back to your community. You can use this as an opportunity to educate others about the cause, to raise funds, and to raise awareness.

, Giving back to the community can also mean giving back to the global community, or you could decide to keep your donations closer to home.


You may identify national or international organizations that align with the causes that you care about.
If you live in an area that a global organization works in, your support for that organization would also indirectly support your own community.
You can also limit your search for an organization to your town or county and keep your focus local.

Donate your human capital.,
Make a schedule.,
Ask friends and family to join you.,
Make giving back a habit.,
Become involved politically.,
Fundraise for organizations.",How to Give Back to the Community2," Your human capital refers to the things that make you the person that you are. In respect to charitable giving, this could mean the skill sets that you have, the time you have, and the gifts you have.


You can choose to donate your time in a skill specific role. For example, if you are a lawyer, you can offer pro bono legal consulting to women’s shelters, to domestic violence organizations, or to counsel troubled teenagers.You can also give your time as a volunteer. This could mean volunteering for an hour a week or establishing a long-term relationship with an organization.
Giving your gifts would allow you to use a special skill, or gift, that you have to help others. For example, if you have a compassionate heart for animals you could volunteer at an animal shelter to socialize the animals.

, Making a time commitment to an organization will make you much more likely to follow through on your commitment of giving your time.


You can start off as slowly as you’d like. You can start by giving an hour or two of your time volunteering at an organization during the month.
Ask you become more engaged with the organization and your community, you may find that you can give more of your time.
Make your volunteering a family activity with your significant other and children. This is a great way to teach children about generosity, helping others, charity, and their community., When you’ve found an organization that you care about, you should share your passion with the people you care about.


Use charitable events as a time to spend with your friends and family. For example, you could all sign up to run a 5k that supports an organization that you care about.
Encourage others to join you when you volunteer. It can be harder to ask someone to give their money to an organization, but people may be more receptive to spending time volunteering with you instead.
Sharing the great work that an organization does with others helps to grow the organization so it can benefit more people!
Since your friends and family are part of your community, you can all give back to the community together.

, Giving back to your community is rewarding for you, for your community, and for the people that you are helping. It can be tempting to associate giving with the holidays, but these organizations need help year round.


When giving becomes a habit, rather than a special event, you are more likely to think about ways that you can help others and give back.As you continue to give back to your community, you will be able to see the direct effects of your participation over time! This is a rewarding feeling and encourages you to continue to give back. like new packages of disposable razors, menstrual products, toothpaste, and more.

, Local politics exert significant influence over a community, and becoming engaged politically can allow you to make a direct impact on the services, funding, and manpower available for your area.


You can lobby for causes that you care about by reaching out to local and state politicians and telling them why you care about this cause. This can be especially important if there is a bill that is related to your interests up for vote.
Running for local office is a great way to become engaged in politics and to make a direct impact on your community.Run for an elected position within an organization. Many interest groups, community centers, charities, school boards, and non-profits elect officers to complete different tasks within their group. By running for an elected office, like President or Secretary, you can directly involve yourself in the day-to-day workings of an organization that you care about.

, Most organizations and programs receive their funding from public and private sources, including donations from individuals like you. Raising funds for a group that you care about helps that organization to continue the work that they do, expand to reach more people, and to make more of an impact.


There are a lot of different ways that you can raise money, including asking friends and family, selling items like baked goods or products related to the organization, holding a charity fundraiser, auctioning off items, or partnering with a local restaurant."
"
Assess what you can give.,
Create a budget with giving in mind.,
Donate your physical resources.,
Know what to donate.",How to Give Back to the Community3," If you have decided to donate your physical resources to an organization, you should take stock of what you can give.


It is completely okay if you feel that you don’t have much to give. Small donations can still have a meaningful impact on the organization and the people they help.Go through your belongings and identify anything that you could do without. This could be books, old electronics, clothing, furniture, tools, and more.
Create a pile of things that you would like to donate. You can divide this pile up between different organizations, as long as they are willing to accept these items.

, Budgeting is already an important part of our financial health. When you modify your budget to include a section where you set aside money to donate, you can commit to giving financially.Your employer may offer matching contributions for charitable giving. This means that if you decide to give $100, your company will also give $100, so the charity receives $200.
Use a search tool to see what sort of donations that your employer will match. You can also speak to a member of the Human Resources Department to get this information.Set aside a certain amount of money each month that you can commit to giving. Some charities will allow you to make automatic donations on a monthly basis, so you don’t have to remember to give at a certain time.

, When you’ve collected things that you know that could be used by someone else, you need to make sure that they are gently used, functional, and clean.


Call the organization or check their website to see if they will accept the item. For example, some organizations will accept appliances like fridges while others do not.
Some organizations will offer to pick up your donation. This is especially helpful for large items like furniture that can be difficult to transport., There are many different things that you can donate.Here is a list of some different items that can help you get started:


Clothes
Rewards points that you’ve accumulated on your rewards credit card or from airline miles.
Non-perishable food
Glasses
Old cell phones and old electronics
Furniture
Books
Toiletries

Introduce sequencing words, and use them often.,
Play the robot game.,
Use sequence words to describe the arrangement of items.,
Have your child sequence toys and items according to your directions.,
Use sequence pictures.,
Bridge sequencing items to sequencing events of a story.,
Try a question and answer match for analyzing story sequences.",How to Teach Sequencing to Preschool Children," While most children by age four or so have a working understanding of words as first, second, third, next, in front of, after, and last, not all children have a firm grasp of the concept. Engaging children in language and discussion about their daily activities will help them to build their understanding of sequencing.


Focus on these words in everyday conversation and situations. For instance, while waiting at the crosswalk, say to your child: ""See the cars at the red light? The first car is blue, and the second car is green. The last car is red."" This emphasizes the concept of first, second, last and colors.
Construction play is a terrific source of sequencing. Describe what your child has built: ""I see that you put a big block in back of the triangle. Look at how you also put a little block on top of that big block.""
Words indicating time are important too. For example, as your child is getting dressed to go outside, you might say, ""'First, put on your jacket. Next put on your hat and mittens. Then, we will be ready to go to the playground.""

Encourage your child to answer questions. Your child should be an an active participant - ""Nina, what do you want first, the scissors or the glue stick?"" ""Who was the first student at school today?"" ""What is the last thing left in the shopping bag?""
Use pretend play to help develop sequencing. Dramatic play helps children build communication skills. The story should have some level of logic, including events that lead to other events.
Puppet shows. Puppets are another great way of unfolding dramatic play, and some children are more comfortable storytelling in this way.;
, This is a game that uses a lot of sequencing and communication skills. An adult or teacher is a ""robot"" that will follow directions given by a child very, very literally!


Ideally, there is a task the robot is supposed to do, such as make a jelly sandwich. The child has to give a command, and the robot will do it...even if the direction is incomplete! This will lead to hilarious situations such as, the child forgets to tell the robot to reach inside the bread bag, or open the top of the jelly jar, or that the jelly is supposed to be in the middle of the sandwich.
This game reinforces concepts of positioning, but also how to communicate instructions clearly and completely.

, Place four items in sequential order from left to right. Discuss how the items are arranged using sequencing words: first, second, third, last, next, and after.


The large red square is first. The blue triangle is second. The yellow circle is after the blue triangle and the red triangle is last OR

The red square is first. The blue triangle is next to the square. The yellow circle is after the blue triangle and the red rectangle is last.

, Gather items to sequence. Make the activity fun! Have your child gather some of his/her favorite toys and items from around the house. Items should vary in color, shape, and/or size.


Place the blue ball first, and the bear second. Place the car third, next to the bear. Place the timer last.

, When your child has a strong understanding of sequencing objects, introduce a series of pictures or photographs that tell a story. Guide your child by asking what would happen first, second, next... Have your child arrange the pictures/photographs in the correct order. Then have him/her explain the order. Help your child self-correct misplaced pictures by asking, ""Would that make sense?""

, For example, you might read and experiment with Goldilocks and the Three Bears.


Move from using cards to asking questions about a story.
Read the story to your child.
Ask your child, ""What happened first in the story, next, and last?"" OR

""What did Goldilocks do first - eat the porridge or fall asleep in Baby Bear's bed?"" If your child doesn't know the answer, help your child find the answer in the story.

,


On separate sentence strips write sequencing questions: What happened first in the story? What happened next? What happened last?
On separate sentence strips write an answer for each question
Read the story to your child

Safety first.,
Have an area for whiteboard, chalkboard, or SmartBoard.,
Have a space for important student information.,
Have a large meeting area.,
Be sure materials adjacent to the meeting area are not overly distracting.,
Have a work area.,
A place for children's belongings.,
Carefully consider wall space.,
Create a classroom library.,
Design your class programs.,
Avoid common ""Rookie Mistakes"".",How to Set up a Kindergarten Classroom," Kindergarten classrooms foremost have to be a safe place. There are rules, guidelines, and regulations regarding classroom set-ups. These will vary from country to state, to licensing body or accrediting institution. However, some issues to consider are:


Students are visible at all times. You must be able to monitor the classroom reasonably well. Students who know they cannot be seen will often misbehave.
Students should not have easy access to hazardous items such as paper cutters, kitchen knives, electrical sockets, or medication.
Fire exits may not be blocked, and emergency exits clearly marked, and fire drills. Practice ""lockdown"" as directed. Kindergarten children tend to be very sensitive to these often unannounced, noisy, sometimes scary drills.
Make sure materials are appropriate for young students. For example, use non-toxic art materials such as glue sticks, tempera paint, and certified crayons. Materials fine for older students, such as permanent markers should not be used by young children.;
, When working with a large group, you are likely to want something to write on or otherwise illustrate a lesson.


Many people argue that a chalkboard is the go-to method. While time-tested, chalk dust can trigger asthmatic children.
Whiteboards are increasingly more common. Dry erase markers are now typically odorless and have fewer of the issues of chalkboards.
SmartBoards are the latest in technology. On it, one can set up multi-media presentations, such as PowerPoint. You can share websites, video, audio, and interactive games. While it takes some training and requires technological support, both teachers and students typically love it.

, Kindergartens have a wealth of information that has to be organized: what is for lunch, classroom jobs, where students go upon dismissal and more. Not only does this keep the students organized, but the teacher as well. For a substitute teacher, this information is critical. For example:


Post your daily schedule. Having a daily schedule makes sure everyone knows what happens when. Be sure to include things that are not necessarily everyday things, such as assemblies, field trip departure time, and so on.
Make lunch and snack choices simple. If you, as a teacher, have to process food orders, have your students take some responsibility. For example, a chart in which a marker (such as a craft stick with his or her name) is placed for the type of lunch, if ordering milk for a snack etc.
Classroom jobs: A chart with names and jobs helps to make it clear who feeds the class guinea pig and who is line leader.
Dismissal: A chart with names and dismissal information should be easy to find. Usually, there is a list of buses, walkers, and students going to an after-school program and pick-ups. Note that schedules are sometimes very complicated.
Calendar: A calendar is helpful for developing a sense of time, and concepts such as weeks and days of the week. It can also help show upcoming or past events, such as holiday breaks, field trips, and birthdays.
Consider making a word wall. It's easy; just type up some words, and print them out as largely as possible, and post them on the wall so that the children can easily read them.

, Typically, kindergarten children need a large open area to gather for lessons, to play, and sometimes for taking a nap. Many teachers have colorful individual rug tiles, a single low table in the middle, or a large rug that delineates the meeting area.


Many teachers like having a ""teacher chair"" in this area. This is a chair that is adult-sized and acts as a focal point for meeting time. Having an elevated sitting spot allows the teacher to be more easily seen while reading a story book or teaching a lesson. Older teachers, especially try to avoid sitting on the floor (and the subsequent getting up) too often.

A soft armchair is a warm, soft, homey touch in what can be a sea of hard, institutional furniture. However, upholstered chairs can be an allergy issue (especially since these chairs tend to be old and thus a bit dusty) for some children.
Rocking chairs are an injury hazard, even though rocking is soothing for children. Consider a ""glider"" chair instead. Be aware that young children do tend to abuse these chairs.
Do not use a swivel chair, or one on coasters unless perhaps these functions are disarmed. Young children will spin on them and roll them around for fun and thus become a hazard and at the very least a huge distraction.



, The meeting area should be kept free of too many distractions, obstacles, or clutter.


Consider fabric coverings over shelving to block the view of students. For some students, seeing toys is a distraction.
Be sure there is enough room between other areas and the meeting area. If students are squished against a bookcase, for example, it is an annoyance and distraction. Also, wriggly children will tend to knock things over.

, Give assigned seats, and rather than desks, give a homey appeal and give tables. They should be circular or blunt edged rectangular to avoid sharp corners. There should be enough chairs for everyone and a couple extras; metal is preferred rather than wood to avoid multiple replacements,


Tables, desks and chairs should fit students properly. Furniture should mostly be child-sized. A good janitor or custodian can adjust some furniture down (such as tables) to fit.
Desks or tables? Both have pros and cons.

Generally, tables are preferred by early childhood professionals to encourage a sense of community rather than individual territory. Also, young children tend to not be able to manage materials in desks. Of course, sometimes you do not have a choice and make do with what you have.
Desks have the advantage of giving an excellent sense of personal space.
If a room is especially spacious, a combination of desks and tables allows for versatility. For example, perhaps worksheets are best done at individual desks, but a hands-on science experiment is done at a large table so everyone can see.


Give a source of writing equipment; put cups on tables for either markers or pencils, whichever you prefer their using on a particular assignment (pencil is favored for daily work).

, Kindergarten students need a clear, simple organization system for belongings. It needs to be adequate to keep personal belongings such as lunchboxes and backpacks and hang up coats, snowsuits, and so on.


Inside the classroom or in the hallway? Inside the classroom avoids having students leaving the classroom, where it is harder to monitor them. However, inside the classroom needs more room (which may be in short supply), and tempts children to constantly go to and from cubbies and so on, which may be a distraction.
Lockers are generally not good for kindergartners. They tend to try to hide in them or play dangerously with the doors. Cubbies are typically better.
Each child should have their own labeled coat-hook in order to avoid confusion. In cold climates, two may be necessary to hang up backpacks, bulky winter coats, and snow pants. #*Have your own space as a teacher. You should have your own desk and computer in the classroom, which you should be sure the children do not have easy access to. While you should not have anything truly dangerous in your work area, you need to have your own space for your work as a teacher. This includes student information, emergency kits, substitute plans, ""teacher scissors"", and so on.

, Apart from chalkboards and such, kindergarten walls typically are full of both informational displays and student work. But this space typically fills up quite quickly, and what to put up should be considered with great care.


Informational displays. This includes things such as alphabets, ""Word Walls"", classroom rules, classroom jobs, maps, posters, and so on. Be sure the information is useful, makes sense where it is, tidy, and aesthetically pleasing.
Student work. Displaying the hard work of the students is a powerful message that their work matters and is valued. Be sure all students have items put on the bulletin board, not just the best or most artistic.
Art or other Beautiful Things. Sometimes teachers proudly display something mostly just for beauty, inspiration, or for its own sake.
Be careful of cluttered walls. A more detailed explanation is below.

, Books are a central focus of the classroom. Organization is extremely important, as it needs to be accessible, easy for children to re-shelve, and pertinent to the curriculum.


It is usually better to have several smaller shelves or sections than one large ""shelf"" that tends have books tumbling over.
Try organizing around categories so children can narrow down what they want to read: ""Animals"", ""Eric Carle Books"", ""Sports Books"", ""Science Books"", ""Fairy Tales"".
Have books out that are topics of the curriculum. If you are studying penguins, have books out about Arctic creatures.
Audit your books for diversity and inclusion. Are the majority of your main characters male? Are there any books with characters that have handicaps? Are there characters that reflect your minority community? Do you have books that both reflect your community, but also others different than yours?
Have a comfortable reading environment. Try to make your library area cozy and inviting to read in. Make sure the lighting is good, that there is space to sit down or lie down comfortably, and there are limited distractions.
Make sure that your classroom is restocked with what you will need; such as paper towels, tissues, hand sanitizer, etc. Ask parents for generous donations; many are willing to help out! Some schools, school districts or the parent-teacher organization (PTO/PTA) will furnish such things.

, Some schools have ""mystery reader,"" where a parent comes in and reads to the class, as their son or daughter beaming with joy, or parent helps with choice time, where their child gets to choose whether they'd like to color, play a game, etc. Whichever you choose, you should be able to do it in your perfectly set-up kindergarten classroom.

, When putting together a kindergarten classroom, there are some very common mistakes new teachers make.


Do not put up too many things on the walls. A lot of advice is given to put up educational materials: ""Word Walls"", maps, calendars, birthday charts, inspirational posters, artwork, and on and on. But the danger is that the entire classroom becomes cluttered, distracting, and overwhelming. Try to balance very important materials with what can be put up as needed.
Avoid too many bright colors. A common design mistake for early childhood classrooms is to paint walls bright, super-saturated colors. Vivid colors tend to be very over-stimulating and thus possibly quite distracting. It is actually better to go with soft whites or pastels, with some ""pops"" of color.
Do not rely too much on word labels. Typically, kindergarten students now come to school with a basic grasp on simple words. But not all students. You may have a student who does not speak your language, or is autistic, or simply not reading. In any case, young children take longer to process writing than adults, and so such labels are not as efficient.

Try using digital photos to label items as well as word labels.
Encourage students to help you make labels. It helps with writing skills, classroom cooperation, and fine motor skills.

The best questions are balanced; they are open enough that there seem to be a few good answers, yet closed enough that people know how to approach them, and feel motivated to start talking.


For example, suppose you’re discussing Romeo and Juliet. You may start by asking, ""In what ways does the Friar make mistakes in guiding Romeo? In what ways does he succeed?"" This question doesn't feed any answers, but leads students in a productive direction.;
, As the discussion leader, you should come into the meeting with several ""big"" questions. Be prepared to ask the next one when discussion dies down, when people need more food for thought. The more prepared you feel when you walk into a classroom, the more confident you’ll look. If you look confident in your ideas and your approach, students will be more likely to respect you and to cooperate.


It can be helpful to give participants 1-2 questions in advance to give them more time to provide thoughtful contributions when the discussion comes.
Also, it can be helpful to give participants the questions you'll discuss in class, on paper, or on the board. Some students learn better and think more effectively if they have the questions out in front of them. This can also be an excellent reminder of the main question for the day.
In a 2 hour discussion, 2-5 good questions should suffice. It is also good to have 2 or 3 smaller sub-questions for each main question. However, you should prepare for at least 1.5 times as much material as you think you’ll cover, just in case students are particularly reticent that day or in case one line of inquiry wasn’t as fruitful as you thought it was.

, Everyone knows how to have a conversation; but a thoughtful discussion is more intentional and more focused than just a chat. If you want to start the conversation off on the right foot, then let the students know exactly what your expectations are. Should students raise their hand before speaking? Or should they speak freely without raising their hands? Should they use ""Mr."" and ""Ms."" when addressing their fellow students? These details clarify expectations and hence increase student confidence. You might also coach students on how to avoid personal biases in their responses, or any terms to use or avoid, and what to do if the discussion gets heated.If you have a handout with “Dos” and “Don’ts” listed on it, this can help students stay on track, too.

, It’s important for you and the students to have something you can all talk about before you begin the discussion. This can be almost anything: the assigned reading for that day’s class, a news story or poem, a work of art, or even a natural object like a sunset. The important thing is that you and the students share a common object of study so the discussion can be concrete instead of wallowing in abstractions.Make the expectations for being prepared clear. If you don’t have incentive for students to do the homework or consequences for students who are unprepared, then they’ll be less likely to come to class with fresh, exciting ideas.

, One way to make sure that the discussion goes well is to show your enthusiasm for the subject right from the beginning. If you have engaged body language, are alert and energetic, and show how the topic is important to your life and the lives of the students, they’ll be much more likely to be engaged. If they think that you’re tired, apathetic, or just trying to get the discussion over with, then they’ll be less likely to care.Even if a topic isn’t inherently fascinating, don’t try to cushion the blow by saying, “I know this isn’t that exciting, guys…” Instead, show that the topic is worth caring about; your students will follow.
Sometimes, showing that something has real-world applications can help your students care about it. If you’re studying a historical event, for example, then starting off the class with a news article about an event with similar themes or values behind it — such as current protests against discrimination in relation to race riots of the 1960s — can help students stay engaged.

, One helpful way to begin the discussion is to define any key terms that may be useful to your students throughout the discussion. For example, if you’re giving a lesson on poetry, you can discuss simile, metaphor, allusion, or any other literary devices that are central to the poem. If all of your students feel like they’re on the same page and have a strong foundation before they begin the discussion, then they’ll be much more confident about participating.


Even if it feels like you’re oversimplifying things a bit, it’s better to have everyone on the same page before the discussion really kicks off than to lose a few students. Some students may be too shy to admit they’re confused about some of the more simple terms, and it’s important to explain them before you can move forward.

, In order to lead a meaningful discussion, you should strike a balance between confidence about what you know and a willingness to learn more. A discussion is an adventure -- you may not know exactly where it will go, but you can lead the way. If you are willing to be vulnerable in showing that you don't know everything, students will be more likely to be vulnerable too.


Present yourself as a professional in dress and body language: stand tall, make eye contact, and smile. Be genuinely excited about your students’ ideas to help generate enthusiasm for the topic. Point out great comments and ask the student to repeat it. They may not even realize that they made a great comment!

, One of your most important jobs is creating an atmosphere of respect, even respectful disagreement. If you want to encourage your students to participate, then you have to give them a safe environment for doing so. You have to make it clear that all of the students deserve respect and that no one will be made to feel unworthy because of their ideas or opinions. You should treat students positively and reward them for contributing.And never make them feel stupid, and don't let other students do so. If a student is being rude to another student, address the problem head-on instead of letting the conversation go on; if you say nothing, you’ll make it look like it’s acceptable for students to be rude to each other.
Encourage students for speaking instead of tearing them down. Make them feel excited to join the discussion, instead of self-conscious.

, Don't just share your feelings or opinions without backing them up. If you’re discussing Romeo and Juliet and someone asserts, ""The Friar shouldn't have given Romeo any advice!"" ask them why that is so. Discuss possible support or objections to their claim. Use the ""Pros and Cons"" model; argue for a position, and then let students argue against it (or argue against it yourself!). Ask: which conclusion would hold up better in a court of law? This can lead to meaningful results without having the students feel like you’re spoon-feeding them the answers.


Help guide students to reach conclusions for themselves. If the objective of the discussion is only to make the students see the “right” answer, then you might as well have lectured at them instead.

, No one can learn if they know everything already; and no one can learn if they know nothing. A good discussion begins when we realize we know something but need to learn more. Even if you feel you have answered a question, press deeper. Find another puzzle you don't yet understand, or move to the next area of interest. Once you’ve established something you and the group have puzzled out, move on to a new, more complicated mystery. Use your previous discussion as a reference point and continue to dig deeper.


Treat each new “unknown” as an exciting mystery that the students will solve together. Even if you’ve already thought it through, act like you’re figuring it out right along with them.

, Some students love to discuss and debate; others feel anxious speaking in a group. Give space to each different person, and don't worry if you sometimes make mistakes. Make sure every participant has an opportunity to be heard. Some will not take the opportunity, but they will feel cared for that it was presented. Work to make sure that every student is heard, and that some students aren’t heard too much. Make it so students with conflicting personalities don’t have misunderstandings and that everyone gets along, for the most part.


For the more talkative student, here are a few tips: 1. Ask them to speak only 5 times that day and make them keep track of their comments; this allows them to decide which comments are really important. 2. Ask them to help lead the discussion; let them ask questions and not just answer your questions every time. 3. Invite them to write out their thoughts and present a conclusion at the end of class. 4. Tell them that they get a turn to speak every time a quieter person speaks first; this will encourage them to balance each other out.
For the quieter student, here are a few tips: 1. Try specifically ask the quieter members what they think of the topic. 2. Invite them to write their thoughts out and offer to read their thoughts to the class at the beginning of the next discussion. 3. Allow room for silence and reflection while ""internal processors"" think through the discussion.
Be aware of the different personality types in your classroom and of how they succeed the most in group discussions. For example, if you have a student who likes to absorb the conversation and then weigh in toward the end, let this student take the time he needs instead of forcing him to speak when he’s not ready.
Don't take it personally if some students refuse to participate. They may have other things going on in their life, such as social anxiety or family stress, that make it difficult for them to engage. Encourage them, if possible, that their presence matters.

, One technique to help maintain a productive class discussion is to write down the ideas of your students throughout the discussion. This can remind students of what you’re talking about and can give them something to point back to. You can even write their ideas down in a slightly more articulate way to help frame the discussion. If you do this, though, make sure you write down most of the ideas that are said so some students don’t feel discouraged if you don’t write down their ideas.


You can even consider having one student as a designated “note taker” who stands at the board and writes down the ideas as they come.

, When you lead a class discussion, you may be feeling self-conscious and thinking that if it’s not going well, that it’s because the students don’t like you or respect you. This negative thinking will only discourage you instead of focusing on the topic at hand. If your students aren’t responding well or aren’t as engaged as they could be, then remind yourself that this is because the topic could be presented in a new light, not because there’s something wrong with you.Once you stop focusing on there being something wrong with you, you’ll have more freedom to turn to the discussion topic and to make the conversation as dynamic as possible.

, One important aspect of leading a discussion is making sure that you hit most of the important points you wanted to hit. If students get too stuck on one point that isn’t central to the discussion, then you can move the conversation along to the more important aspects of the day’s material. That said, if you find that students are having a fascinating conversation about something you didn’t intend to hit and that they are really learning from each other, then you can continue to use this time to explore a new line of thinking.


Time management is an important part of leading a class discussion. It’s important to keep the students on track and avoid talking about one minor quibble for the entirety of your class time.
Find a way to subtly check the clock or your watch from time to time. You don’t want to make the students nervous when you do this.
Give students a ""two minute warning"" to allow them to slow down, reflect, and present any closing thoughts or last words.

, One way to help move the discussion forward is to help students talk to each other instead of to you. As long as the conversation is respectful and well-meaning, then having them directly address each other’s points can help them get to know each other and can facilitate a meaningful discussion without any barriers. If you find that this technique is making the conversation too aggressive or argumentative, then you can pull students back a bit.


Having the students talk to each other more can lead to a more dynamic, exciting discussion. They’ll feel like they can talk more openly if they’re talking to each other instead of just addressing the teacher.
Just make sure to stress that they should do this in a respectful manner and that focuses on the person’s ideas, not the person.

, Unfortunately, just one problem student can ruin an entire discussion. If there’s a person in your class who always talks out of turn, interrupts others constantly, puts down the views of others, or just generally disrespects you and the other students, then you need to work on addressing the problem head-on as quickly as you can so this one student doesn’t keep the others from learning. You can first try to address the problem in class, and if that doesn’t work, you can pull the student aside and talk about his or her behavior privately.


There are many kinds of problem students. For example, if one of your students talks out of turn, stress the importance of raising his hand before he speaks.
If you have a student who talks too much, tell him to wait until at least four other people have spoken before contributing again. Though this may sound harsh, it can help this student focus on listening to what others have to say.
Occasionally, though thankfully not very often, an overbearing participant may need to be removed from the discussion. Mostly, such students respond well to gentle but firm correction. It does happen, though, that a student refuses to play by the rules. It is not fair to the participants who want to learn to allow one person to ruin the discussion. If possible, and after many warnings, you may want to find a way to organize the discussion without them.
If you have students who are distracted or doing other things during your class, sit them up front and pay extra attention to them.
If you’re having trouble leading a discussion because many students aren’t doing the reading, then you should incentivize them to do their homework by giving reading check quizzes at the beginning of class, making class participation a higher percentage of the course grade, or finding other ways to hold them more accountable for doing their work.

, One way to make sure that all of the students are on the same page is to summarize the class discussion as you move forward. You can make it feel seamless, and not like an interruption of the conversation. Even repeating the points that you or your students have made with extra care can help your students get a firmer painting of the big picture. Make a point of slowing down and rebooting every 20 minutes or so, especially if you’re teaching a longer class, so that everyone is on track.


You can ask other students to help you with this task. Say something like, “Okay, what have we learned so far?” and have volunteers help you out.

, When the allotted time for the discussion is up, or when things have reached a natural end point, do a full summary of what you covered. Talk about the point you started from, and remind the students of any arguments that were made along the way. Don’t invalidate any arguments and focus on bringing together all of the different ideas you talked about instead of acting like you’re showing students the one and only way something should be done. Make sure you leave some time to do this so your students aren’t distracted and ready to pack up their bags.


This is where leaving notes on the board during the discussion can really come in handy. Having something you can point to can make it easier to wrap up your ideas.
You can even try having another student or two wrap up the class discussion. This can make students feel more accountable and involved.

, Make sure to leave at least a few minutes for questions at the end of class. You want students to leave the discussion feeling like they learned something, not like they are utterly confused. If you wait until the class is almost over to ask if anyone has questions, then students will be much more reluctant to say anything because they won’t want to hold up or even prolong the class. Leave a suitable amount of time for questions and make sure to encourage students to speak up if they’re confused.


Answering the students’ questions can also help you wrap up the discussion more thoroughly.
Having people ask questions can also give you insight into the strengths and weaknesses of your discussion. If five students seem to be confused about the same thing, then it may be because you didn’t cover it thoroughly enough in your discussion.

, Close with a related question, or a ""suggestion for further research."" This will give all involved something to think about for next time. You shouldn’t leave students feeling like you discussed absolutely everything there was to say about the given topic and that you had completely solved the puzzle together. Instead, you should have moved the conversation forward, helped students gain valuable insight, and leave them looking forward to the next discussion.


Leaving your students wanting more can also give you a logical place to pick up during the next class. They’ll come to class feeling ready and excited to continue the conversation, and they may have even gained some insight into the topic in the meantime.
Consider conducting a brief “check out”. Let students talk about where the discussion leaves them or where they will go next. They can do this at the end of class, or even in a written survey they take during the last few minutes of class.

, After the discussion is over, ask yourself who did the most talking, who did the least talking, and who contributed the most meaningfully to the conversation. Keep in mind that talking the most doesn’t actually mean contributing the most, either. The next time you lead a discussion, you can work on encouraging the more quiet students a bit more, and making sure that everyone has a chance to speak and that the students don’t feel dominated by a few more confident speakers.Remind yourself that no discussion is perfect. As you improve at leading class discussions, you’ll improve at making sure that all students participate in the conversation.

Visit a spot where there are lots of flyers.,
Use the largest paper format that your printer can handle or the biggest enlargement you can afford from a print shop.,
Use brightly colored paper.,
Choose a striking picture.,
Use simple, thick fonts.,
Avoid clutter.,
Make sure the flyer can be seen from a distance.,
Post your flyers early, at least one week before your event.,
Plan any big events a month or 2 before you start handing out flyers to make sure that everything is planned.

",How to Design an Event Flyer That Gets Attention," It's best to visit a spot where event flyers tend to get posted, not the laundromat, where it's mostly babysitting, housecleaning, and appliances for sale. Scan the flyers and note which ones stand out to you the most. Take a closer look: What made those flyers stand out to you? Keep that in mind as you continue with these steps.;
, Size matters, especially among a flurry of other flyers.

, Neon paper will grab the most attention on its own, but it can overpower the text or pictures. Consider using a color that's bright but still soft enough to create contrast with dark ink (e.g. sky blue). Or, if you do stick with a neon color, use a dark color for the text and images.

, The picture you choose will depend on your audience, but no matter what, make sure it has high enough contrast and saturation that it ""pops"".

, The funky fonts may look good on your computer, and work well on a handbill or some other type of pamphlet, but they are hard to read from a distance and don’t photocopy well. Use simple, bold fonts that are easily read and will not distort after being copied 150 times.

, It's tempting to cram every square inch of the flyer with words and graphics, but sometimes having ""whitespace"" around your headlines and images can make them stand out better.

, Test your flyer by hanging it up and taking 4-5 big steps back- you should be able to read the headline from this distance.

, This will ensure that your poster is posted before others, and help publicize your event early on. Check back later and re-post your flyer if necessary.

Focus on the positive.",How to Present at a Conference," The first step in presenting your paper is finding an appropriate conference. If you are already a member of a professional organization, then this may be easy. Check the website of your organization to see if they are sponsoring a conference in the near future. Otherwise, you should conduct a general Internet search to find conferences on subjects that interest you.


For example, if you are an art teacher, you might search for “Art teacher conferences.” This would show you that the National Art Education Association is having a conference in March 2017 in New York City.If you search for “animal care conferences,” you will find, among other things, that the National Humane Society is sponsoring the Animal Care Expo in May 2017 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.;
, You can narrow your search more specifically to find conferences that are accepting proposals for presentations. Check the websites for any upcoming conferences that you find to see if they are still accepting papers or presentations. You can also run a general search using the phrase “call for papers” or ""call for proposals"" along with your subject area.


For example, using the phrase “call for papers in hotel management” results in a conference on “Advances in Hospitality and Tourism Marketing,” which is to be held in July 2017 in Cyprus.The website outlines a range of topics that will be accepted and provides the information for submitting proposals.

, It is important that your submission match the topics requested. For example, the Advances in Hospitality and Tourism Marketing conference has a list of approximately 40 different topics that would be considered for presentation topics.If you have an idea that you do not see listed in the call for papers, you should contact the organizers of the event to ask if they would consider your idea. Some conferences are more flexible in the papers they will accept, but you should not just assume this without checking.
For example, a call for papers for an Animal Welfare Act conference at Harvard Law School contained a list of topics, but added, “Potential topics include, but are not limited to…”, The call for papers will generally include details about the length and style of presentation that is expected. In some cases, there may be several options to choose from. These formats often include including paper sessions, poster sessions, workshops, or breakout discussion groups. Each type will have its own requirements for length, the style of graphics or supporting materials you will use, and amount of material you are expected to cover. Know what you are applying for and meet the expectations., Most conferences will provide two or more deadlines for submission. The earliest deadline will be for an abstract of your presentation. The abstract is generally a short description of your presentation, with minimal references to source material. Some time later, you will then be expected to provide the final copy of your presentation. Know the deadlines and then meet them. These conferences often receive many more applications than they need, so it would be easy for them to deny yours if you fail to meet a deadline., Many conferences will “peer review” the proposals before accepting them. Experts in the field will review your paper and return it to you for editing or further research. Cooperate with these revisions if you wish to be accepted as a final presenter at the conference. As before, return each stage of the paper on time., Your acceptance letter should clarify the expectations for your presentation. If it is not clear, you should immediately contact the conference organizers to inquire. You don’t want to plan for a 75 minute lecture and then find out that you were expected to speak for 45 minutes and then respond to a Q&A session for 15 minutes. Conferences often operate on a tight schedule, and you cannot afford to overrun your allotted time., This is another item that should be made clear to you in the acceptance letter. You will need to know if you are presenting your paper to a large conference room as a keynote speaker, or if you are one of three presenters sharing a small space and time. If the acceptance letter does not answer any questions you may have, you should call the organizers and ask.Presentation formats may include small workshops, large keynote addresses, round-table discussions, or general research reports., Review the conference website and study information about the sponsoring organization to understand the style that they expect. Many conference sites will include links to materials from prior years. These can be valuable sources of information as you prepare., Verify what technology will be available for your presentation. Do not assume that you will have access to wi-fi, for example, if you rely on Internet links as part of your presentation. If you are preparing a slide show, make sure that you are using a program (PowerPoint, Prezi, LaTex, Beamer, for example) that the host system will support., You must be thoroughly prepared and present yourself as professionally as possible, especially if you hope to be asked to return. You need to practice your presentation repeatedly. Whether you are standing at a podium reading your paper or presenting a more extemporaneous lecture using a slide show outline, you must appear polished and professional. Ask some trusted friends or colleagues to listen to your presentation and let you know if you are loud enough, slow enough, and can be understood., As the presenter, you should arrive at your assigned location at least 15 to 30 minutes before your presentation is scheduled to begin. You may need to set up your computer, arrange seating, or distribute copies of any materials you want to hand out. Conference schedules are often very tightly arranged, and you will be expected to begin promptly as scheduled.You can gauge your audience and the space that you have. If you are scheduled to begin at a particular time, but it is clear that many audience members are still entering, you may wish to delay briefly to let the space fill. If possible, you may wish to check with conference organizers to make them aware of the situation.

, Unless you have been invited specifically to read a published paper, you are more likely going to be presenting from a slide show or outline. The best presentations are organized but given in a loose, conversational style. Use your slides to organize your speech, but do not read every word on every slide, or you will bore your audience. At the same time, avoid getting too technical in details, which the audience likely will not be able to absorb as part of a busy day.Bear in mind that your presentation is only one of several that the audience will be hearing that day. If you become too detailed or too technical, you will lose people’s attention.

, Even at a high level conference, simplifying and summarizing your words with graphic presentations can be very powerful. Pictures that you may use to illustrate key points are likely to be remembered more than five minutes of talking. A graph or table can quickly summarize years worth of data. Make use of these tools to your advantage., Because your audience’s attention is going to be highly taxed through the course of a busy conference, your opening and your closing will be the most memorable moments. Provide a strong opening introduction with an outline. Then conclude by reviewing the outline and the general topics you covered. Repeat the main highlights of your presentation., If you had a good experience at the conference, and if you would like to present again, you should send the organizers a brief note as soon as possible. Just like attending a party, you should send a note of thanks for allowing you the opportunity. This may not directly get you invited back again, but it can’t hurt and will add a touch of professionalism.

, You can combat a tendency to get nervous speaking in front of an audience by preparing thoroughly. Practice your presentation many times. Think about questions that your audience might ask and prepare some responses.

, Nervous speakers feel the need to speak as soon as they take the stage. If you take a deep breath and pause briefly, you will feel more control and present an attitude of strength., As you speak, look at individual audience members. Instead of scanning your gaze across the entire room, look at one person and present one thought. Then move to focus on someone else. This serves two purposes. It will help you slow your speech as you focus your attention on someone. It will also help you see your audience as individuals rather than a large collection. Even if you do not make contact with each person in the audience, the appearance helps personalize your presentation for everyone., Nervous speakers tend automatically to speak quickly. This can make you difficult to understand, which leads to a lack of focus by your audience, which then makes you feel more nervous. To break this cycle, you must consciously speak very slowly. If you believe you are speaking naturally, you are probably speaking too fast. When you feel that you are speaking... unusually... slowly..., then... you... are... probably... speaking... just... right., If you feel your nerves taking over, just pause and take a deep breath. This will help you regain composure and will slow your speech. In addition, the brief pause has a way of attracting attention. Any audience members who were drifting will be likely to refocus on your presentation., If your topic is at all controversial, you may notice audience members who frown at you, scowl, cross their arms or display other negative body language. Ignore them. Focus instead on those audience members who support you and your presentation. You may not change the attitudes of those negative members, but your presentation will be better."

It is also someone who uses the traditional means, such as writing a book, giving speeches, holding a protest rally, etc. In the 21st century, you have the opportunity to use the many means at your disposal to get the message across more broadly.;
, The best social activist is an informed one and it is only by having sound information that you will convince people that your cause is worthwhile. An informed social activist able to point out sound sources for information and facts will be trusted by other people. If you're scrambling for facts to back up your statements, you're not yet ready to promote the cause.


Use online search engines to research your cause. Also, read from a variety of sources; read the opposite side to what you consider is right so that you can understand the reasoning from those opposing your cause.
Research the best non-profits for your cause by using sites such as guidestar.

, Use social media to raise awareness of a wrong, an injustice or a problem. Tell a story in brief, clear words, so that it grips your readers quickly. Give them links to places where they can find more details if they would like; the more clued-in readers will need to read more before trusting the cause.


Even an anonymous Facebook group or a posting somewhere can spark a revolution if it hits the right note and exposes injustices. However, if you choose to remain anonymous, keep things polite and well researched, leaving links and images, etc. for people to find and verify what you're stating. You should also consider cloaking your IP address and other means by which people can work out who you are if you need to remain anonymous.

, Use hashtags — words or phrases prefixed with the “hash” or “pound” symbol — on Twitter to help spread, share, and organize information about a certain topic. Hashtags can be used to coordinate protests, update people about an ongoing crisis, and crowdsource information.

, Wikis are a great way to quickly share information and can also be used to organize events.

, Witnessing an injustice in person? Record it on your cell phone and post it to YouTube. You’ll need a YouTube account with a mobile setup that allows you to upload directly from your phone to your YouTube channel. Or provide a feed of events on the ground as they happen with a live video broadcasting app.

Crafting a presentation for a group of high school interns would be very different compared to an executive report to management, pitching a sales idea, or addressing a hostile audience about why the company needs to cut benefits.;
, You absolutely must be an expert on the subject. Okay, you don’t have to be the world’s leading authority, but you have to know the critical facts as well as much of the little-known information. Just talking about things everybody already knows is a recipe for boredom. It’s not at all unusual to spend weeks, or months, getting the facts, alternate opinions and comments from reputable sources as well as what the general community may think.

, Where you get your information is as important as the information itself. Without solid, peer-reviewed data, you’re just a person with an opinion. The audience, in this exercise, is expecting facts and projections. Your personal opinion may very well be important but it must not be the only thing you present. You won’t be listing the sources ad nauseum (you will bore them silly) but you do want to be able to give citations when asked.

, Off-the-cuff talks are fine if you’re on a soap box in a park. In a large room with hundreds of attendees, you just can’t afford that. You might not exactly ""read"" the speech, but that’s certainly not uncommon, especially if you’re going to be using a teleprompter. Print the speech in large print so you can easily see it at a glance without appearing to read from it. You want to give the appearance of talking to the audience instead of reading to them, but you also want the words and phrases to be precise and predetermined.

, If you're going to use a slide show, the visuals you will show to the audience need to be designed to support what you’re saying. Avoid showing a slide that has an inordinate amount of detail – the visuals are for impact. A spreadsheet with dozens of rows and columns will be basically meaningless. Titles on the slide should reflect the content of the slide and support what you’re saying. Do not read the slide! Assume the audience can read. The visuals should support your words, not duplicate them. There are very few things you can do that will have a worse impact than reading what the audience can read on their own. If all you’re going to do is put up slides and repeat what’s on them, then they don’t need you.


PowerPoint slides, overhead projectors, blackboards, and whiteboards are ""visual aids"" and should be treated as such. First, they should be visual, focusing on graphics, illustrations and plots rather than text. If your slides contain large blocks of text--or even a few sentences in bullet points--your audience will spend their time reading instead of focusing on you and the points you want to draw attention to. Second, they should be aids--don't rely on the slides to make the presentation for you. Your speech should have more content than the slides.
Don't pack slides too densely. If you put too much information up at once, the audience will lose focus. Have your bullet points have around ten words or less. This is a PowerPoint, not a PowerEssay.
Don't use too many flashy graphics and animations. They distract attention from the information content of the slides--and they will distract attention away from you, the speaker, and what you are saying.
Time your presentation to fit the information. If there is a time limit, be sure you stick to it including time for questions, if that is planned. It is better to pare down the material rather than to rush through it more quickly. Time your visuals to coincide with your speech. Avoid unnecessary or redundant slides such as outlines that describe the presentation to follow.
If you have more material than you can fit in the time limit, push that material onto ""extra"" slides after the end of your presentation. Those slides might come in handy if, during Q&A, someone asks you for more detail. Then, you will look extra-well-prepared!
Make sure the color schemes of slides are appropriate for the presentation venue. In some situations, dark text on a light background looks best, while sometimes light text on a dark background is easier to read. You might even prepare a version of your presentation in both formats just in case.

, Do this repeatedly. Read your speech and watch your presentation dozens of times. This needs to be so familiar to you that you know what slide is next; what you’re going to say about each one, how you will segue between slides… this must be second nature to you. When you begin to get completely bored with doing this and you know it by rote, then you’re ready for the next step.

, Enlist some people that you trust to give honest opinions. These should be people that are reasonably representative of your expected audience. Give them the whole presentation. Have them make notes during the rehearsal – where are you confusing; what is particularly good? Have them also concentrate on you: Are you moving around too much; too little? You don’t want to appear ""hyper"" but you also don’t want to come across as a monotone statue.

, Take what you learned in the dress rehearsal and make modifications. Try to put yourself in the audience when you do this. What will they hear when the slides are on the screen?, So far, the steps have all been about preparing your presentation. Now, it’s time to think about you. Unless you do this for a living, you’re going to be nervous. Do some visual imagery of yourself in front of the crowd; doing a perfect job; getting applause, oohs and aahs. Find a quiet spot, close your eyes, and go over the presentation, imagine yourself being completely in control without any stumbling. This is a very, very important step. Professional athletes use this virtually every time before they go out to perform. It’s a proven technique. Use it. You should also be doing this immediately before you go on stage.

, You’ve done a great job preparing, you know the material, you’ve rehearsed, you’ve visualized perfection – in short, you’re ready. One of the very important things to which you must pay close attention is your physical demeanor. You don't want to look too stiff, and you don't want to look too casual. You should have already gotten the right stance and movement in your dress rehearsal.

, Obviously, this is the meat of the subject. Remember you are the expert. Also remember… you will be nervous. How to avoid ""stage fright"" varies from person to person (you have heard the ""imagine them in their underwear"") but one serious tip is to use eye contact. Present to one person – then another – then another. Don’t think of it as a large crowd… you’re talking to one person at a time. Remember that YOU are the presentation.

, This is optional, but can be an important way to clarify key points and be certain that your audience received your message. How to do a Q&A session is worthy of an article in itself but there are a few things you should consider.


You must be in control. Some questions will undoubtedly be less than friendly. When you get those, answer them factually and move on. Just don’t call on that person again.
You also might get ""soft"" questions that don’t really ask anything new – be careful with those. They’re easy and don’t deserve a lot of time. Don’t dismiss them or brush them off, but don’t spend too much time rehashing what you’ve already said. Answer factually, bring in some new information, then move on.
Open the QA with, ""before I close, are there any questions"". This allows for a strong close and not a presentation that withers away with poor audience participation.
When you get a question, first repeat the question to the audience so everyone can hear it, then proceed to answer.

Take a few seconds to formulate a clear answer before replying to a question. Failing to do so can lead to wandering or vague responses that do not reflect well on you as a speaker.

, Thank everyone for their attention, tell them the presentation is available in printed form. If you will be available for personal consultation, make sure you mention that. Don’t spend a lot of time in the exit; you’re finished – exit graciously.

Start early.,
Resolve the home language.,
Make it a game.,
Have an initial game plan.,
Smile to the trick.,
Acknowledge your child's efforts.,
Start a translation game.,
Vary it.,
Reinforce it some more.,
Be inventive.,
Keep the interest in reading both languages alive by investing in beautiful and interesting books in the language not spoken outside the home.,
Use summertime to your advantage.",How to Teach a Child Bilingual Reading," If you can, start this technique at preschool, as that's the best window of opportunity, although it's not too late to start at early school age either. Ages 6 months to four years are the optimal time for learning a second language., Though this step is optional, consistency is important. If you decide to speak only one language at home (for example, your native language in a country with a different language), resolve to stick with this. It will not hamper your child if you speak your native language if you start early and stick to it. Some families also choose to have the mother speak the mother's native language, and the father speak the father's language; whatever works best for you is fine but it remains important that your child can see consistency.


Note that the method outlined in this article is unsuitable for trilingual families (where the mother speaks one language, the father another, and your child is learning yet another one at school).

, Much like in other activities, your child will learn more effortlessly if it is turned into a game and it's fun.When your child is comfortable, talk about a ""school game"", or a ""letter game"" you could play. (Avoid saying ""learning"" or ""translation"" as they sound like a task to avoid.) Gauge your child's reaction and don't force it.


Make it short without forcing. Play it for a short period or leave the game in plain sight and wait till your child initiates.

, Once you get your child's self-initiated cooperation, work out a game plan. Follow the steps below, and don't rush. Once the process is natural you'll find yourself improvising more and more.

First few sessions: play around with letters with no particular reason in mind. This will familiarize your child and create the feel of a non-threatening environment.






Next ask for a short favorite word. Propose one from a favorite movie or TV show if you need to give help.






Work that name. Think how you can ""work"" that name. It (or one similar in sound) should be suitable to follow for the next steps. Arrange the letters and read it aloud, one-by-one a little faster every time.

, Smile and tell your child that here comes the ""tricky part."" Your child need to close his eyes. Children will be intrigued and delighted to play along. (You'll be surprised just how many times this works.)


Tell him no peeking. Now take away the front letter.






Allow your child to look and say once more ""This is very tricky."" (Tell them what you did by repeating the word and that you removed the front letter.)
Now ask them to ""read"" aloud. Try it and you'll be surprised because with a little encouragement they'll do it.

, Let your child feel proud of her effort and achievement. Repetition is the easiest, most rewarding reinforcement.


Now repeat same as above with back letter.
Do one or two more words per session. Repeat with playful variations.

, Once you both get into some kind of habit where you both accept rules of the game (your child will come up with some rules too, so be ready to accommodate one or two), it's time to start the translation game. This needs a little planning too; again, the words chosen should be easy and suitable.


Think up a word that would appeal to your child which could be rearranged into a word in your language.

, Once you've found a good word, follow these steps:


After the front and back game, rearrange as before, while he closes his eyes. Tell him that it's now even trickier!
Read out the word aloud. Tell your child that it's in your language and ask him what he thinks it means. Then tell him. Don't tell him that it's a translation to begin with; only do this after the process has become very natural.

, Reinforce this process with more positive experiences.


Let her choose from your selection. Let your child watch videos in the two different languages. This way she will request one language or other, just to exercise her freedom of choice. You can pick up the main character and talk about its different names in the two languages.






Play a letter block game on this name too.






Find a playmate who speaks the second language to come over and play often.It will do both children good, and it makes it a lot more fun.







, There's no excuse: your child is inventive, that's how she or he learns. So don't lag behind. Be inventive in getting the new words from your child's new experiences.

, Sit down regularly with your growing child and continue reading these books with him or her.

,

Many families find that they can immerse their children in another language over summer vacation. So if they are in school in one language, you can take our send them to somewhere where they get the other language on their vacation.

The feeling of being useless can come from deep psychological mechanisms.,
The essence of human productivity is taking one kind of good and turning it into another kind.,
Consider the effects each of your actions will have on others.

,
Feelings are infectious.,
Give more than you take (think karma).,
Listening and sharing feelings is mutual.,
Direct intervention.,
Observe.,
Give blood.,
Never discriminate.,
Protect the weak.

,
Join a charity and raise money and awareness for the cause.

,
Save a life!",How to Be Useful and Help Contribute to Society," Simply being useful may not stop the feeling of being useless. In contrast, not contributing to society (leeching society's benefits) may create or amplify many negative feelings.;
, In order to make some output, you need input. Take something or material, move it to a more useful place, or combine it with other materials to make something. Not all of us have access to the best inputs. There are no free inputs, but forward-thinking individuals have created things like the internet, which can be the next best thing to free inputs. Your local library is another source of cheap or free inputs. It may seem counter-intuitive when you intend to create something out of yourself, that the first thing you need to do is take some things in. But the truth is that in order to be a producer, you must first be a consumer. You cannot be productive based on a blank slate.

,, Smile and be polite to those you meet (even if your cat scratched up your favourite jacket last night). If you have suppressed negative emotions, people around you will sense this and get ""a bad vibe"", so find a friend to talk to.

, Consider society like a sandbox. Each time you ""get a stroke of luck"", you get more sand to play with. Be thankful for this and the next time you get the chance, help somebody else (selfless acts will create a mutual positive feeling, see step 3).

, When you tell/share a negative feeling with somebody else, let them share theirs, too. Try to balance up by sharing something positive as well. This will contribute to the people closest to you by letting them offload otherwise soul crushing feelings (step 3) and by mutual sharing and listening you are contributing by being a dependable character.


The opposite option would have been to just spew out your emotions and letting everybody else clean up the mess of emotions you poured over them.

, This is both under- and overvalued. When you spot a chance to make a direct intervention (help an elderly with a door, give a snickers to the homeless guy at the corner) take the chance and do it with a smile.

, Most of the times we are powerless to act against corruption and injustice, sometimes we can support a person being subjected to this by showing the victim (a co-worker who just got yelled at by their boss) that you agree with him/her. A few times in your life you'll get the chance to really tear things up (anonymously sending proof of your boss's corruption to a news agency, for instance). The feeling of victory is unbeatable.

, A blood or blood-plasma shortage will force surgeons to give each patient less blood and plasma, replacing them with inferior products. The downside for you is that you walk home with a band-aid on you arm which discretely states you just did a selfless act.

, Even if groups can be over-represented in statistics, this says nothing about each individual.

Learn about your heritage.,
Inquire about others’ backgrounds.,
Learn about equality and inequality.",How to Be a World Citizen1," To be a global citizen, you must identify with a world community, but you should not lose your heritage or culture. Your heritage involves what cultures are present in your family history, what culture your family actively subscribes to, and what community you live in today. To learn about these, talk to your family, research your family history on the internet, and get to know more about your community by being active citizen. You can research your background on websites like Ancestry.com. Most websites that offer these services do charge a fee.
Be an active community member by exploring its museums, making use of the library, and talking to members of the community.
Ask your family what they consider their heritage to be. It is possible to have many different heritages in one family.
Think about where you come from. For example, if you are a North American, you have many cultures within being a North American. You may be a North American, from the United States, who lives in Texas, but has a Mexican heritage.;
, Ask your friends, family members, or teachers, about their cultural backgrounds and what that means to them. This isn’t limited to people you know personally. You can also research the backgrounds of your favorite political or entertainment figures, whether they are current or historical.For example, you could ask “What would you consider your cultural background to be, and is it important in your daily life?” Before asking people about their background, make sure you tell them that you are trying to learn more about every culture. Be as polite and respectful as possible. Don’t push the subject if the other person doesn’t want to talk about it.

, Thinking that all people are equal goes beyond respect. To truly be a global citizen, you should believe that all people are equal regardless of their race or religion. A person who believes in equality believes that every person deserves healthcare, education, respect, and justice when wronged. Watch the news and read newspapers and history books to gain an understanding of inequality that has happened in the past and is happening in the present. To believe in equality, it is crucial to see where equality has not been achieved.You should also read history books to see how equality was achieved. For example, it is important to learn about the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, and the important figures involved in the movement, like Martin Luther King Jr.

Learn about current and past events.,
Discover the values of other cultures.,
Read as much as possible.,
Learn another language.,
Learn about your purchases.,
Understand climate change.",How to Be a World Citizen2," Visit the library, subscribe to newspapers, and watch the news. You may have learned about past events in history, but brush up on world history by visiting your library and checking out history books about different cultures. To understand where the world is today, you need to see how past events have influenced the present. It is just as, if not more, important to stay updated on events happening all throughout the world..


Some things to learn about are: Global policies (international treaties), programs, wars (past and present), tragedies, positive happenings, politics, and entertainment news from all over the word. Information can be found in your local library, on the internet, and on television. It is possible to find international news in your language.

, It is positive and necessary to respect the values of a global community, but it is also important to learn about them. Some values to learn about are human rights, poverty reduction, prevention of conflict between countries, and sustainable economic growth. These values can be learned by visiting your local library, watching the news, and searching specifically for the values country by country on an online search.Consider cultures that seem far removed from your own culture. If you are familiar with Western culture, consider learning about countries like South Korea, India, and China. If you are familiar with Eastern culture, consider learning about France, Canada, and Norway. You can also learn about countries like Brazil and Argentina.
Other values like religion, entertainment, and manners can be learned in the same way, but you also can learn about them by talking to members of other cultures.

, You will learn about values and events from reading, but you will learn about parts of the world you wouldn’t have thought about by reading. You can learn about your own and other cultures by reading books, both fiction and nonfiction. Reading will allow you to get a glimpse into someone’s mind that is not possible in any other way.You can look on websites like Goodreads, TasteKid, and Shelfari for reading recommendations.

, There are many benefits that come from learning a new language. It is the best way to get to know another culture, become more open-minded, and bridge cultural gaps. Learning another language can seem daunting, but it is possible with time and dedication. You can learn another language on your own, in a class, and with the help of a willing friend.Check out a language textbook from the library. A book may not help you become fluent in a language, but it is a good introduction to the basics and grammar.
Look for classes in your community. Sometimes colleges will allow enrollment, but there are programs that offer language classes in the community. There are also classes offered online.
Once you have some basics down, try communicating with people who are fluent in the language you have chosen to learn. You can ask people in your community, or try communicating with people online, as long as it is done safely. Make sure the other person is willing and happy to help.

, Unless you consciously buy locally, there is a large chance that many things you own and buy come from other places in the world. Globalization has made trade, importing, and exporting easier and more common than ever. It seems positive because it has made some products cheap, but it is negative because the conditions those products are being made aren’t always positive. Take a look at what you buy, see where they were made, and learn about the conditions they were made in. Some things you can search for are: What are the conditions for the employees at the factory where my shoes were made?
Are the employees at this factory paid a living wage?
Is the factory that made my olive oil ecologically responsible?
Does the factory that made my t-shirt support gay rights?

, Being a global citizen goes beyond engaging with and understanding people. Learning about the environment we live in, and the ongoing climate change crisis is important, too. There are still people that refute climate change, but the evidence for it is prominent. You can do an online search to learn about climate change, watch documentaries, and read news that is focused specifically on the environment.To learn about what you can do to be more environmentally friendly, do an online search for The Environmental Protection Agency. Their website offers a list of things you can do in your daily life to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

Share and listen to stories.,
Support art, music, and culture in your community.,
Make new friends.,
Volunteer locally.,
Donate wisely.,
Stand up for injustice.",How to Be a World Citizen3," Being a part of the global community starts in your local community. Share stories about your background, and listen to the stories of others. You can ask friends, family members, and people you encounter at school, church, or work to share stories about their backgrounds.For example, if you are talking to someone from a different culture, you could ask “What is it like celebrating your biggest holiday? What is it like for you?” To a friend or family member, you could ask for a memory from their childhood.
You can also turn to social media to listen to and share stories with a broader community of people. You can go to YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook to share and search for content.

, Search for art and music shows. Also, look for cultural fairs and exhibitions. You can go to your local theatre, venues, schools and cultural centers to ask for information about upcoming events. Spending time supporting your community both financially and with your time at events is a great way to actively be a community member., Building and nurturing relationships is a vital part of being an active global community member. Make new friends with people from your culture, as well as other cultures. Start locally, and then you can build your connections globally through social media and pen pal programs.If you are in school, ask a classmate to join you in an activity. If you work, ask a coworker if they would like to accompany you to an event.
Post and respond to the updates of others on social media. You can reach out to people in your community, or people from all over the world. Do not, however, share any personal information with strangers.
Join a pen pal program. You can sign up on safe and secure websites to exchange letters or emails with another person from anywhere in the world. This is a good way to get to know about the daily life and values of another person from a different culture firsthand. A few pen pal programs are PenPal World, Mail friends, and International Pen Friends., You don’t have to travel far to make a positive impact by volunteering. There are plenty of opportunities to volunteer within your community. You can volunteer at your local homeless shelter, senior center, or education center. Many people acting locally influences a global change.VolunteerMatch is a website that matches you with volunteer opportunities in your community. Enter your email, and you will receive a newsletter with volunteer opportunities in your community weekly.

, It’s okay if you do not have the means to donate, but if you do, donate your money wisely. Donating is a great way to support local and global causes, but there are many charities out there that do not use their funds honestly. Research any foundation before giving your money to it. A couple of trustworthy foundations are:


The Life You Can Save. This is a website that recommends trustworthy charities: https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/

Zidisha. This foundation is focused on microlending. Microlending is giving small amounts of money to a person or company with low or no interests rates. Money typically goes to businesses or people in the developing world: https://www.zidisha.org/, Injustice to people, animals, and the land has occurred all throughout history. Unfortunately, injustice still happens in the world today. A global community member should not stand passively by, but instead, stand up against anyone or anything that has been wronged. How active you want to be is your choice.Voice your opinion on social media. There are hashtags dedicated to specific causes. A few of those causes are #BlackLivesMatter and #YesAllWomen.
Attend a peaceful protest for a cause you care about in your city.

"
"
Take a road trip.,
Teach in another community.,
Volunteer.,
Travel abroad.",How to Be a World Citizen4," Seeing the world is part of being a global citizen. You don’t have to travel far to learn about other parts of the world. You can drive to the next town, state, or even country, if you live in an area where it is possible to do so. The important thing is that you observe and interact with the land, people, and local culture., It is enough to teach others in your community, but it is also an option to teach abroad. You can volunteer to teach abroad, or be paid to teach in another country. There are many programs out there that you can apply to to teach in the destination of your choice. Some programs require a specific degree, but others do not.The JET Programme is an organization that sends teachers to Japan to teach English.
The TEFL program sends teachers to speak English in several countries.

, You can volunteer to teach, but there are plenty of other options to volunteer if teaching is not your thing. Volunteering is great way to help others while enriching your own knowledge of other cultures. You can volunteer to work on a farm, build schools in developing countries, or spread your religion to others.The WWOOF programs sends volunteers to work on organic farms all over the world.
Global Vision International is a program that has volunteer and internship opportunities all over the world in a range of programs, like animal care and education.
International Volunteer HQ has programs all over the world in childcare, medical care, etc.
Keep in mind that most volunteer programs require a fee.

, Traveling abroad can be expensive, but it is possible if you save your money over time and budget well. To spend less on travel, take low-cost airlines, buses, or trains. Avoid staying in expensive hotels. Instead, stay in an Airbnb apartment, or consider Couchsurfing, a website that offers a free place to stay. Shop at the local grocery store instead of eating out for every meal. You don’t have to travel extravagantly to get the most out of an experience abroad.Only stay in situations that you feel comfortable with. Connect through certified websites, and leave any situation that makes you feel uncomfortable.

Being a pacifist is not about the label.,
Starting with simple changes, like not hoovering up bugs on the carpet but letting them out, are small yet effective ways of including pacifism into your life.

,
Try to read up on the Jainist, Buddhist or Hindu principles of Ahimsa.,
The Buddha, very specifically, spoke of having compassion for all things.,
If your pacifism begins to extend to a more global view, make sure that you don't begin to blame organizations or groups for violence in the world.,
If you feel like you need to do more, consider searching for peace or protest marches in your area or in a city near you.,
Remember that pacifism isn't just an instant change.,
Keeping a plant can also help with non-violence by causing you to care for something else alive.,
If you are trying to be non-violent towards someone or something try to count to ten or twenty, if you are very violent just walk away.

",How to Be a Pacifist," If you want to be a pacifist, it's good to start with identifying your reasons why. Try not to jump into it for status or being able to tell all your friends that you've become a non-violent person.;
,, Ahimsa is non-violence, and this can help you see other people's perspective of non-violence.

, The next time you feel yourself heating up because your neighbor has let his dog poop on your lawn, take a deep breath and let it go. Pacifism extends to both emotions and actions.

, Remember that they believe they are doing the right thing -- for whatever reason.

, Join in with large peace-related projects.

, Society can largely view violence with contempt in the right conditions (self-defence, violent video-games, the war against terror, etc.). Smaller steps will be more successful.

, The same applies to having a pet.

Determine if you really are up to the task of being a challenge.,
Never try to be a hero mostly for selfish reasons.,

, Don't be a hero just so you could get publicity or because you wanted to be all that. Do it because you feel like it's the right thing to do.

, Like as simple as helping people when they needed, or help people up if they tripped, or even help treat their wounds or call for an ambulance if they hurt themselves.

,, Sometimes there's a safer method of doing things that can be just as heroic as well. A good example would be:


Calling the police if you saw a store that is currently being robbed and get as much detailed information as you can by watching from a distance so you could report what you had saw.
Noticing and assisting someone who was alone but is injured, like severe burns, broken parts of the body such as limbs, arms or legs, or anything that prevented them from getting medical help on their own.

, If you ever encounter such situation in the public, you don't necessarily need to have a large medical knowledge. You'll most likely just be recognized to show signs of heroic characteristics if you could somehow take control of such things and assisting people and letting them know what they should do until proper help arrives. During the process you might even be able to save the person's life if he or she was injured.

, Sometimes just thinking about the right time to act might not always be a good idea. If someone was pointing the gun at you for example, don't just risk other people's lives by trying to steal the gun from him or her. It'll risk them trying to shoot you and others around the vicinity. Also if you're not really all that physically healthy then the chance of unnecessary harm is greater.

, Many times, if you want many people to look up to you then doing this might encourage them to do the same. Also, maintaining good health helps you become physically fit and will help improve your chance of assisting people more efficiently.

, Many times just by assisting people whenever they needed, or without being asked, or even volunteering at an old folks home or other similar places and being a good role model by putting their needs ahead of your own is a good way to show selflessness. But don't do it if you just want do it for the thanks. Some good example of doing so would be:


Volunteering at an old folks home
Work at a homeless shelter area during Christmas time or free time
Work with the people who have mental and/or physical disabilities.
If you can afford it, donate to groups that help starving children or families from different countries that are much less fortunate, and possibly give them a greater chance to have a brighter future.

, Knowing how to defend yourself and others is a good ability to learn because if and when you really do need to protect yourself and others, you need to act quickly and safely. But only use it as a last resort and don't just use it to try to heroically save others because doing so might lead to casualties.

, Because, if you attempted to save someone at a wrong time and not knowing how to do so, the consequences most likely would be bad.

, Sometimes, even every one of us who tries to help others needs help as well, and it wouldn't make you look less of a person. In fact, sometimes the right thing to do is to ask for help.

, On those rare occasions, you can be a little bit selfish during your personal time, but can easily take it too far so approach with caution.

Analyze your failures.",How to Be a Community Organizer," Before you commit to being a community organizer, you should understand what the job entails. You will have to identify issues in your community, think of solutions, and gather enough support to enact them. This will sometimes mean challenging the existing authority by public protesting or rallying. You shouldn't be afraid to speak to a crowd, go door to door, make cold calls, and do whatever it takes to get attention for your cause., To change the government, you should understand how it works. Become familiar with the election process, how laws are passed, and who your local politicians are. Familiarize yourself with local and national laws. This will all become important when you start campaigning for change.

, These can range from simple, like needing a stop sign on a corner, to serious, like an unjust law. Whatever the case, you should learn all you can about the issue before taking action.There are a few ways you can do this.


Watch the local news. These networks will often cover local issues and give you ideas on how to take action.
Read local newspapers. Look especially at the editorial or opinion sections. Local citizens will often write in complaining of problems in the community.
Talk to people. This is a crucial skill for a community organizer. Ask neighbors if they're unhappy with something in the community and listen carefully to their answers.

, Once you've identified an issue and educated yourself on it, you should see if anyone else has already taken action. Usually an internet search will uncover groups in your area. You can also check local meeting places like libraries and government buildings for flyers.


If you find a group taking the same actions as you, you may want to join it instead of starting your own. However, if you think this group has different goals or methods than you, you can go ahead and start your own.You may still wish to approach this already established group and present your ideas and see if they will support you.

, If you're still unsure if community organizing is for you, try volunteering with a similar group. This will show you what the job is like. By volunteering you can also make important contacts that will become important when you form your own group., Through investigating an issue, you've probably come across a few people who share your thoughts. These can be friends, family, or people you know from school or the community. Say you'd like to meet and discuss a problem you've noticed in the community. Even if it's only a few people, this initial meeting is very important to develop a plan for your group.

, Now that you've identified an issue and investigated it, you have to figure out how you'll remedy it. With this first meeting, you should brainstorm with your group about what action you will take.Talk about the issue that brought everyone there. Ask specifically what concerns them and why they feel this is an important issue.
When you're all clear on what the issue is, brainstorm what you hope to do to fix it. Figuring out clear goals for this group will help you develop a plan of action. For example, if your goal is to elect a new member to your local legislature, most of your work will revolve around raising awareness and support for that candidate.
Let everyone propose solutions. It is important that you allow everyone a chance to speak. Community organizing is based on group participation. Even though you are the group's founder and leader, you are responsible for listening to all your members equally.
Discuss the methods you are willing to use in achieving your goals. Are you only planning on writing letters and talking to the media, or will you use direct action like protests? See if everyone in the group is on board with the methods you plan on using. Some won't be comfortable marching in rallies and protesting. If not, that's okay- there's still plenty of behind the scenes work they can do to help.

, Ideally your group's name will be easy enough to say and remember while also giving a clue of what the group's goals are.


If you plan on using an acronym, research if there are other prominent groups using that acronym. If so, consider changing your name. You run the risk of all your potential members being unable to find your group when searching the internet.

, At the first meeting, work out a plan of action with your attendees. The mission statement is crucial for defining what your group is all about. Keep the following in mind while writing your mission statement:Start with the group name. This will ensure all readers know whose mission statement this is.
State the group's purpose. What problem do you hope to fix or what service do you hope to provide?
State your goals. What is the group's overall plan, and what methods do you intend to use?
Make your statement specific enough to display the group's intentions, but broad enough so that you don't have to keep changing it. For example, if your group wants a stop sign by a school, say that your purpose is to promote neighborhood safety.
Keep it short. A few sentences will do just fine. You want to get straight to the point so potential members will understand exactly what you're about and if they want to join.
Once you settle on a mission statement, be sure to print it on any flyers and other media the group produces.
As an example, look at this mission statement from a top nonprofit: Greenpeace is the leading independent campaigning organization that uses peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and to promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future., Is the group a democracy? Will there be an election? How will decisions be made? Will each member have a specific task? Do your best to figure all these questions out early, ideally at the first meeting. This way, the group can focus on solving the original issue without being troubled with organizational questions., Once you've established your group, you should continue meeting regularly. Otherwise, your group may simply melt away before you even get started., Most local libraries, government buildings, and businesses have bulletin boards where you can advertise your group and cause. Put together an eye-catching flyer that displays your group's name and the issue you represent. Also make sure you include your group's contact information and details on when and where you meet so you can attract new members.

, Spreading awareness is very easy with social media. Make a page for your group and update it regularly. Have your members advertise the group on their personal pages. This method can increase your support far beyond your immediate community.


It is very important to keep your social media pages active. If people see that your pages haven't been updated in months, they will likely assume the group is inactive.

, Community organizing means interacting with the neighborhood, and face to face conversations are crucial for building support.Make each one of your members responsible for a given area. Make this an area that can be covered in a day, not more than a few blocks.
Make sure you've printed flyers or a newsletter that they can distribute. Include the group's mission statement and a brief description of your group's goals and vision.
Your door to door people should ideally be your most enthusiastic members who are well-versed on the issues. Not everyone is comfortable knocking on doors and interacting with strangers. You want to make sure the neighbors you meet come away with a positive view of your group and cause.

, Submit an editorial to your local paper. State the issue and that you have formed a group to fix the problem.


Some newspapers won't let you advertise your group in an editorial. If that's the case, you can still make a good argument for your cause by laying out a plan of action.

, The media is a very powerful force, so it will serve you well to use it to your advantage.Contact local media stations and see if they are willing to cover your group or give an interview.
Designate a spokesperson. While all members of the group are potential media liaisons, important press interactions should be handled by specific members. Ideally they will be well-spoken, charismatic, and know the issues inside and out. This will provide the best possible public face for your group.
If a local news station or newspaper runs a story about your group, make note of who the reporter was. They can be an important contact who is willing to give you more coverage.

, Many towns have fairs and other events that attract a lot of people. Make sure these booths are stocked with flyers and staffed by charismatic members who are able to talk about the issue with strangers., It is crucial that you have all your members in an organized file with all their contact information. Check in with members regularly to keep them involved. If you lose track of members, your group will gradually fall apart., Now that you've built support for your cause, you have leverage to present your issue to local politicians. State your problem clearly and how you expect it to be solved. If they can't help you, have them give you the information of someone else who can.

, Have all your members contact the politician you need to work with. This flood of correspondence should help get their attention.


If politicians remain unresponsive, use letter-writing campaigns to contact the media instead. If there is a lot of buzz about a particular issue, the media is more likely to cover it.

, When your group has grown large enough, a public rally will demonstrate the support behind your cause.Before scheduling, make sure all or most of your members can come. You don't want to publicize a rally and have a small crowd. This event is supposed to demonstrate your support.
Advertise the rally. After you know all your members will come, reach out to the community. Invite anyone interested in your cause to come show their support.
Make up posters, banners, T-shirts- anything to get attention for your group. This will both get your message across and show group solidarity.
Most areas require a permit for a rally. Make sure this is all taken care of before your event to avoid any trouble with law enforcement.
Contact the local media and see if they will cover the event. If a particular reporter or station has covered your group before, contact them first.
Have your spokespeople ready to talk to any spectators. This can be a great opportunity to get new members.
Keep everything peaceful. You want this rally to demonstrate that your group is a positive force in the community. A rowdy-looking group will probably not gain you any support from locals.

, Have all your members go around and collect signatures. When you've gathered enough support, present this petition to your local government.

, There are probably other organizations that can add to your base of support. Meet with their leaders and see if they will support your cause. Organize joint rallies and events to increase your support., If the current government won't support your cause, it will probably become necessary to vote in a new one. If you cannot find a candidate who supports you, consider running yourself or nominating someone from your group.

, It is very likely you will experience setbacks in community organizing. The important part is not getting discouraged, but learning from these setbacks. When you understand where you went wrong, you can fix the problem and succeed the next time.

Decide who the person is that is need of help or change...,
Who is this person?,
If you know that you do not have the proper resources or experience to help this person, decide right now who you trust that can guide them better than you can.. For example, you could always encourage that person to attend a support group at a local ministry, with your supportive company..,
If you can relate to that person's situation, you can offer them advice.,
If you share religious values with that person, express the things that help you stay strong or content.,
Be a good listener.,
The most simple way to be a change in someone's life, is to just take the time to compliment or wave cheerfully at them.,
If it is you, that is in need of comforting assistance, my advice is to deeply get in touch with your spiritual side, figure out your religious beliefs, and strengthen your faith by attending church, or any supportive class.,
Partake in activities that strengthen you, not bring you down.,
Be the change.",How to Be the Change," Ask, do they really want the help?;
, Why do they need help? Does their state of being affect you in any way? Why do you want to help them? Do you relate to, or understand their situation at all?

, If not, please, move on to the next step..

, Don't know where to start? Begin with sharing your experiences, and your feelings about them. Make sure he/she is comfortable discussing it.

, Read comforting passages, possibly from a bible.

, Always be open to them sharing their feelings or events that have taken dramatic effect on their life. Comfort them, if things seem to get a little teary-eyed.

, You could brighten someone's life easily by any caring gesture.

, Faith and hope are the most cleansing, renewing, and strengthening traits a person can withhold. The most important thing you can remember is, no matter how far the you go down the wrong road, its never to late to turn back.

, Surround yourself with positive people, and positively influential environments.

, Not tomorrow, or in a year or so... How about now? It starts with you....

Meat and potatoes.,
The Takeaway.,
To thine own self be true.,
Effective use of humor.,
Breathe.",How to Build a Powerful Presentation from Scratch," Let’s face it – we live in the age of Twitter communication, where anything longer than a sentence starts to lose our interest. We’re constantly being bombarded with information at every turn, so it pays to keep things brief. Sound bites rule! Of course you’ll want to have supporting information to back up any bold declarations you make, but there is something to be said for brevity.;
, The lecture format is passé. Keep the mood fresh and engaging, invite questions and audience participation, and if you have a longer presentation, incorporate an activity or exercise that gets people involved while driving home a key point. Use current references and analogies, don’t be afraid to weave in pop culture references if you can make it relate to your key point (assuming this is a match for your audience).

, Odds are, you can fondly remember a teacher from your grade school days and you may remember things that he or she taught you – even if you didn’t particularly like the subject itself! Likeable people keep us interested and engaged, and enthusiasm is contagious., It is positively baffling how many speakers and presenters don’t know how to simply and effectively use audiovisuals. Used properly, these tools can enhance a presentation, drive home key points, and keep the focus where it belongs: on the speaker. Anything else becomes a distraction that leads to boredom.

, Be sure to structure your presentation so that it has plenty of meat (valuable subject matter, new information, useful tips, etc.) as well as potatoes (such as supporting explanations, demonstrations, hands-on experiences, and exercises or material designed to reinforce the key points).

, Here on this blog, you can find entire articles that explain how to master the takeaway, which refers to the key point or points you want your audience members to remember (and possibly take action on) long after your talk is complete and you take a bow. Speakers who master the art of the takeaway are the ones who tend to have the most lasting impact on their audiences – sometimes for years to come.

, Perhaps Shakespeare said it best, and his wisdom still rings true after all these years. If it’s one thing an audience can spot a mile away, it’s a phony. Be authentically you and you will win your audience over every time – even if the “real you” isn’t witty, funny, or outgoing. Additionally, when you are being yourself, you will find that presenting becomes easier and more natural, since trying to be anything else can only serve to increase your nervousness.

, As mentioned in the prior paragraph, you’ve got to work with what you’ve got. If you’re not a funny guy, don’t feel as though you need to pepper your presentation with jokes and humor, if merely one powerful joke -- that you can tell masterfully -- would suffice. If you have a wry, or dry sense of humor, work that angle. Humor should enhance your talk and engage your audience.

, Take several deep breaths while working on creating and polishing your presentation – it will keep your head clear and ensure a true focus.

Decide where to start your search.,
Look for subject-specific databases.,
Ask a librarian.,
Use regular search engines with caution.,
Choose your keywords carefully.,
Narrow when necessary.,
Look for credible, authoritative sources.,
Cast a wide net.,
Wikipedia can be a good place to start, but websites such as this are open to editing by anyone, which means that their information can be inaccurate, outdated, or biased.If you want to use Wikipedia or another wiki for research, scroll down to the “References” section at the bottom of the page and check those out.,
Find the original source whenever possible.,
Look for consensus.,
Check the source’s affiliations.Checking who owns or sponsors the website will help you figure out whether it is credible or not.,
Check out the author.,
Look at the date.,
Look for reliability and accuracy.,
Cite your sources.,
Beware of the ephemeral nature of the web.,
Consider a technological fix.,
Build your own archive.,IF you want more sources use the deep web but be carefull.",How to Do Internet Research," If your employer, college, or university provides you with a search engine or directory, begin there. If you have access to a library database of research articles, such as EBSCOhost, start there.Library databases provide you with access to peer-reviewed research, which is the gold standard for academic study. “Peer-reviewed” means that top experts in the field have reviewed the research to make sure it is accurate, trustworthy, and informed before publishing it. Even if you’re just trying to learn something for your own personal benefit, academic research will provide you with the most up-to-date, reliable information.


You can usually access these databases through your home library’s website. Some academic and universities libraries may require a password if you are accessing them remotely (from somewhere other than in the library itself).
If you don’t have access to a library, try using Google Scholar for your searches. You can find academic research through this search engine, and Google Scholar will show you where you can find free copies of the articles online.;
, Depending on the area of your research, you have several options for online databases specific to your field. For example, if you are looking for research on education, the ERIC (Education Resources Information Center) is sponsored by the United States Department of Education and provides peer-reviewed research and informational materials on education topics.If you’re looking for medical or scientific research, PubMed, sponsored by the United States National Library of Medicine, is a great place to start., If you have access to a library, make an appointment to speak with your reference librarian. These people are specially trained in helping you access the best research and knowledge available.They can help you find sources and also help you determine whether sources are credible.

, Search engines crawl the web indexing pages by reading the words and phrases that appear on those pages. From there, the process is automated. Each search engine has an algorithm that’s used to rank results for specific searches. This means that no human is vetting the accuracy of the results. The “top” result is simply the result of an algorithm. It’s not an endorsement of the content or quality of the result.Most search engines can be “gamed” by savvy websites in order to ensure their content comes up first. Moreover, each search engine has its own algorithm, and some tailor their results based on your browsing history. So the “top” result on Google will not necessarily be the “top” result on Yahoo, even with the exact same search phrasing.Be aware that simply because you find information online doesn’t make it credible or authoritative. Anyone can make a webpage, and the amount of poor, unverified, and just plain wrong information often outweighs the good stuff online.To help you sift through the useless stuff, talk to your teacher or librarian, and use library or academic search engines when possible.

, For any given inquiry, there are an almost limitless number of potential word and phrase choices you could enter into a search engine. Therefore, it’s important to think carefully about what you hope your search will find, as well as try multiple different search combinations.


If you’re using an academic search engine, such as your library’s search feature, try using a combination of keywords and Boolean Operators, or words you can use to narrow down your search: AND, OR, and NOT.For example, if you are doing research on feminism in China, you might run a search for “feminism AND China.” This will return results that include both of those topic keywords.
You can use OR to run searches for related keywords. For example, you could search for “feminism OR feminist OR social justice.” This would return results that contain one or more of those terms.
You can use NOT to exclude keywords from your search. For example, you could search for “feminism AND China NOT Japan.” You would not get any results that included Japan.


You can use quote marks to search for full phrases. For example, if you want to search for academic performance, you would search for the whole phrase inside quotation marks: “academic performance.” Be aware, though, that using quotation marks will kick out any result that isn’t an exact match. For example, you would not get results about “school performance” or “academic functioning” because they are not worded exactly the way you searched.
Use specific keyword phrases to locate the most relevant information. For example, if you are looking for information social welfare expenditures in the U.S., you’re more likely to get the results you want by searching for “total yearly amount spent on welfare programs in U.S.” than searching for “welfare,” which would bring up definitions of welfare, types of welfare in other countries, and thousands more results you don’t want. Be aware, though, that you can’t always find information like this -- the more words you enter, the fewer results you’re likely to get.
Use alternate words or keyword phrases to locate additional research sources. For example, if you are researching “welfare,” consider using “safety net” or “social programs” or “public assistance” in place of “welfare” to find different results. In many cases, your word choice might unintentionally bias your results, since terms like “welfare” are often politically loaded. Using a wider variety of terms ensures that you’ll be exposed to a broader — and therefore potentially less biased — set of sources.

, If you’re researching a topic about which you’re relatively uninformed, begin your search with broad terms, then use the information culled from that first search to begin narrowing your search.


For example, in your search for “total yearly amount spent on welfare programs in U.S.,” you’ll quickly discover that there are several different public assistance programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Use that information to decide which program(s) you’re interested in, and then perform a new (more specific) search, such as “total yearly SNAP expenditures in U.S.”

, Perhaps the most difficult — and important — task in internet research is ensuring the sources you select are credible. Generally, you want to prioritize information from government sources, academics, and nationally recognized news organizations.Government sources will often have “.gov” somewhere in the webpage. For example, the United States Department of State’s website is www.state.gov. The official website for Australia’s Department of Defence is www.defence.gov.au.
Websites that end in .edu belong to colleges and universities. However, you do need to be careful with .edu sites, because often faculty and students can run personal webpages that will have the .edu extension, but the information there may not be vetted by the university.It’s better to find academic sources through an academic database or search engine, like EBSCOhost or Google Scholar.
Websites that end in .org belong to non-profit organizations. While some of these are highly credible, some are not. Anyone can purchase a website with a .org extension. Check these sites carefully, and don’t rely on them as your sole source of information if you can avoid them.Major news sources such as The Guardian, CNN, and Al Jazeera tend to be credible, but you also need to make sure you’re reading a factually based article and not an opinion piece. Many news sites also have blogs and editorial sites where people can state their opinions, which aren’t necessarily backed up by facts.

, Don’t limit yourself to the first few results in the search engine. Look beyond the first page of search results to find information for your research.While it’s impossible to view all of the results for most searches, it’s important to view at least several pages of results in order to ensure you’re not missing important information. Because of search engine optimization, if you’re using a regular search engine like Google or Yahoo, the first several pages might contain the links that were most effectively promoted, not the ones with the best information., Go to the original source whenever possible.


For example, if you are writing a report on penguins, you could start with the Wikipedia page on Penguins. Scrolling to the References section would show you several peer-reviewed academic journal articles on penguins, along with references to book chapters by academic publishers. Look at those sources for more authoritative information.

, During your research, you will find many statements online, but not all of them are true or useful. Some sources will not cite any references, or they may twist the reference to say something other than what it originally stated. Don’t take anything at face value. Particularly when the website reporting a fact or statistic is questionable, you should attempt to find the original source.


For example, if you’re doing research on changes in welfare expenditures during the past 20 years, there’s no reason to trust Yahoo answers, a blog, or any secondary source. Most credible sources will note that they’re using data from federal agencies. Therefore, it’s usually better to search for the original government data sources and cite them directly, rather than citing a page that is itself just reporting (possibly incorrectly) the data.
Citing the original source will also make your own research more authoritative and credible. For example, it is much more impressive to your teacher if you cite an article from the National Institutes of Health (a US government source) than if you cite an article from webMD -- even if they have the same information. If you can cite the original scholarly research that produced the information you're discussing, that's even better.

, If you can’t find the original source for a fact, your best bet is to verify the fact on multiple, credible sites.


No matter what information you’re seeking, if you can’t find a single official source, it’s advisable not to trust a piece of information until you find identical information on several independent sites. So, for example, if you can’t find an original source for SNAP expenditures in 1980, enter the data you found into a search engine to ensure that the same number is reported on multiple sites and that those sites are not all citing the same (potentially erroneous) source.

, For example, the Mayo Clinic website is owned by the Mayo Clinic, one of the most prestigious hospitals in the world. It is a not-for-profit organization, so it is not out to make money from its content. Its articles are written by medical professionals. These are good clues that information you find on this site will be credible. On the other hand, a “health” website that has a storefront or lots of ads, and doesn’t have any institutional or professional affiliations, won’t be as credible.


If you’re using an academic database, check out who published the article or book. Texts from prestigious journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, and books from academic publishers like the Oxford University Press, carry more weight than sources from less-known publishers.
If you’ve never heard of a source, the first place to look is the “About Us” (or similar) portion of the website. If that doesn’t provide you with a good idea of who’s producing the web page, try conducting an internet search for the site itself. Often news articles, Wikipedia entries, and the like that reference a source will include information about its affiliation(s), ideology, and funding. When all else fails, consider using a web domain search engine to discover who owns the website. However, if you’ve had to go to that length, chances are good that the site is too obscure to be trusted.

, Unfortunately, many internet sources will not list an author. If you are searching online for peer-reviewed research, however, you will usually find sources with named authors. Look at their credentials.For example, does this person have education in his/her field? Neil deGrasse Tyson has a Ph.D. in Astrophysics from the prestigious Columbia University, so it’s likely that what he says about astrophysics is credible and authoritative (meaning trustworthy and up-to-date).On the other hand, an amateur star-watcher’s blog will not be authoritative, even if the information is accurate.
Has the author written anything else on the topic? Many authors, including journalists and academic scholars, have areas of specialty and have spent years studying and writing about these topics. If the author has written many other articles on the same area, this makes him/her more credible (especially if those articles are peer-reviewed).
If there is no author, is the source credible? Some sources, particularly government sources, will not list an author. However, if the source you are getting the information from is authoritative -- such as an article on chickenpox from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- the absence of an author isn’t cause for concern on its own.

, It’s important to make sure that your information is as up-to-date as possible, especially if you’re research a medical or scientific topic. Scientific consensus changes with the presence of new studies and information. Check when the article or website was published. Being more than five years old isn’t necessarily bad, but look for the most recent articles you can find for the best shot at updated information.For example, if you were writing a research paper on treatments for cancer, you wouldn’t want to use only articles from the 1970s, even if they were published in prestigious academic journals.

, There are many sources out there that claim to be fact-based but aren’t. Websites that appear to have a clear agenda are usually not good sources, because they may ignore or misrepresent evidence that disagrees with their position.


Look for the site’s sources. A credible internet site will cite its sources. A really great site may even link out to the original research articles so you can track them down. If you can’t find any references for the information provided, or if the references are out of date or poor quality, it’s a good sign that your site isn’t reliable.
Watch for bias. Highly emotional language, inflammatory rhetoric, and informal writing are all signs of potential bias in your source. Most academic writing tries to steer clear of these and aim for impartiality and objectivity as much as possible. If your website uses emotional language like “Manipulative big pharma companies are out to keep you broken and unhealthy to line their own pockets!” it’s a good sign that there is bias present.
Review each website for grammatical errors and broken links. If the website is credible and reliable, grammar and spelling should be accurate and all links should take you to the appropriate landing page. Websites with numerous grammatical errors and broken links may be copying their information from another source or may not be legitimate.

, In order to avoid the same errors made by inaccurate sites, you should always document your sources. This will allow you to return to them later, if necessary, and will allow others (when applicable) to verify your sources themselves.


Bibliography entries for webpages traditionally consist of the author of the web article or webpage (if available), the title of the article or page, the name of the site, the site’s web address, and the date on which you accessed the article or page.

, Just because a source is there today doesn't mean it's going to be there tomorrow. In order to guard against making your research irrelevant, consider your options for preserving web pages.


The simplest way to save a webpage as you see it today is to print a hard copy or save it as a PDF.This will allow you to refer back to the page, even if it's moved or deleted.
Since a hard copy or PDF version will only be available to you, you should periodically check the links in your research if it is published on the web. If you discover a web page has been deleted or moved, you can keyword search for its new location in a search engine or check to see if it was archived by Archive.org's Wayback Machine, which preserves web pages as they previously displayed., There are numerous free web browser features, apps, and services that can help you save your sources quickly and organize them easily.


Using the bookmarks feature of your web browser is the simplest way to save sources. Rather than saving every source in the parent “Bookmarks” folder, consider creating subfolders for specific topics. For example, if you’re researching welfare, you might want to create a folder for “Welfare” in “Bookmarks” and then maybe even create more folders within “TANF,” “SNAP,” etc.

, Beyond simple bookmarking features and apps, more advanced research software and services can help you create your own personal repository of sources.


Numerous services and apps have made it possible to sync sources to the cloud, capture images of web pages as they appear on the day you accessed them, add keywords to sources, etc.
Many of these services, such as Zotero, are freeware created by academics and other open-source advocates. Others, such as Pocket, offer some services for free and charge for others. If you need functions beyond your web browser’s standard bookmarking features, consider using one of these sources to make organizing your sources easier.

Start writing.",How to Research a Paper," Spend some time thinking about what you want your paper to accomplish. Do you want it to prove your viewpoint? Explain a topic? You’ll want to have a clear focus before you begin your research. You also need to know what kind of paper you are doing, for example literary analysis, historical, scientific, etc. This will determine the structure and style of your paper.


Know the specialized requirements sought by your educational institution with respect to format, style, and content for a research paper in a specific field. Sometimes the requirements are very exacting.;
, Pick a clear and concise title to sum up your paper. Keep the title focused, so that your paper goes into one specific subject or question really deeply, rather than giving a less informative overview of the entire topic area. Make it fit in with your objective, for example, if you were aiming to write an analytical paper, consider saying something more like ""To what extent did X affect Y"", rather than just ""What were the effects of X"". However, be prepared to change this if your research takes you in a different direction.

, Make a list of key words on your topic that will be helpful in locating information when you conduct online and offline searches. Making a mind map of all the topics and sub-topics you are thinking about covering can be very helpful.

, While you can find an abundance of material with your laptop, to get an actual book on a topic, plus find academic papers, journals, and other subscriber-only materials, you’ll need to head to a library. Find a quiet spot, grab some books and get down to work! You can find books by looking down the shelves of books for that topic, asking a librarian, or using the library catalogue, if there is one. Libraries may also have tables or desks which you can use, so take advantage of this and spread out your notes and books!


Don't forget to use reserved or reference sections. These will usually carry the most popular information as well as restricted borrowing items.

, Get down any facts, and make detailed notes from a variety of sources, as long as your notes are completely in your own words. If you don't think you can write something in your own words but you need to include it, you can always directly quote the source, as long as you use speech or quote marks """" and make it absolutely clear that it is a quote, and referencing where you got it from in the footnotes or end notes. If the books have any relevant pictures, you could also scan the pages and include them in your paper, as long as you reference where you got them too! Don't be afraid to make your notes colourful, as well as making them more interesting to look at; doing this can help you keep organised, for example by colour-coding by sub-topic. If you want, you could also scan in or photocopy some of your paper sources, so you can make notes or highlight on copies of them!


If reading PDFs online, learn how to highlight text for quick return referencing when writing up your paper.
Avoid leaving notes penciled in the margins of library books. This is a nuisance for later readers; always erase any marks you make.

, Use the library’s indexes to find articles in periodicals, like trade journals and magazines. They’ll contain the very latest information on your subject, and are much more likely to be peer-reviewed and reliable. Ask a librarian for help if you need it - they will know better than anyone what information is available to you.

, Now you can do some online research by plugging in those keywords you listed at the start. Only take information from reputable sites and organizations. Wikipedia, for example, has been shown to be about as accurate as ""proper"" encyclopedias, but isn't completely accurate and wouldn't be respected as a research source unless your educational institution has said otherwise. It can be put to good use however, to gather a brief overview of the topic and to send you to other sources that are considered reputable; look at bottom of any Wikipedia article – see which sources they used to decide whether these might be useful to you too! There is also a large number of books, or portions of books, that can be found online without cost or (much) effort. Check places like Google Books, Google Scholar, Internet Archive, and Project Gutenberg.

, While you’re researching the facts, don’t forget the figures. Find some useful statistics to aid your research. Helpful search words when looking for statistics include “percent of,” “Census Bureau,” and/or “survey results.” These will be more useful if you're writing a more scientific or economics paper, but can also be used to illustrate a point in a wide variety of topics. Once you have the statistics, you can always use a program like Excel to make them into graphs to include in your paper.


Be sure to analyse the statistics with care and not simply pick and choose elements of them to meet what you want them to demonstrate.
""Numbers are like people — torture them enough and they'll tell you anything."" — Anonymous

, See if there are any documentaries on your topic. These will be more visual, more interesting to research, and will also add some variation to your list of sources! Check the television schedules of some relevant documentary channels, look around for DVDs or some older documentaries can also be found on places like YouTube. If you do quote from a video, be sure to cite it properly.

, Organise your research, mull it over, and then start writing! Once you've started, don't be afraid to go back to the library to do a little more research in a particular area if needed, or to alter your title slightly if one area of your research is particularly interesting or detailed.

Remember your mission.",How to Be a Social Entrepreneur," For any position as an entrepreneur, leadership experience is key. Throughout your career and education, be on the lookout for opportunities to lead.Join clubs and take on positions of authority. If you're in school, join a club of interest to you and try to be something like the secretary, president, or vice president.
Volunteer with an organization. You can actually find leadership opportunities if you volunteer at a particular organization and work your way up. You can start, say, helping out with basic work and eventually volunteer to help train other volunteers, plan events, and more.
As social entrepreneurs advocate for a particular cause, find leadership opportunities related to that cause. If, say, providing affordable, healthy food to underprivileged areas is important to you, work at a local food bank.;
, Social entrepreneurs need to know how to work with others. You will have to get people and corporations on board with your cause. Any experience you can get that builds social intelligence will help you with your career path.Look for jobs where you work with people. A summer customer service job can teach you how to best interact with people. You can also try to work at a phone bank taking donations, as raising money for your cause will be a key part of your job.
If you're in school, take courses like psychology to help you learn how people think.

, Social entrepreneurs need to be creative. You will have to find innovative ways to operate charities and nonprofits to maximize donations and implement action. Anything you can do to increase your creativity can help here.Activities like yoga and meditation can boost creativity. Try taking a class in one of these areas.Write. Keep a notebook and jot down ideas. Do free writes where you explore your feelings and future plans.
Incorporate play. Playing may seem mindless, but things like video games, board games, and strategy games can actually boost your creativity.

, Resiliency and grit are important to becoming a social entrepreneur. Advocating for a cause can be rough, as there will be a lot of setbacks along the way. You will also have to deal with a lot of failure and rejection as you try to establish yourself professionally. Developing a can-do attitude is key to a successful career as a social entrepreneur.Try to have a positive attitude. When you're in a difficult situation, look for the hidden perks. For example, you miss your bus and have to walk to work. Instead of getting frustrated, think about how the long walk will let you clear your head before starting your job.Develop a good sense of humor. When something does not go your way, crack a joke. Laughing at negative situations can help you bounce back from them quicker.
Take care of yourself. Develop a routine where you eat right, get enough sleep, and exercise regularly. You will feel stronger and more resilient if you're in good health.

, There is no specific education path to becoming a social entrepreneur, although a degree in business can help. However, there may be short-term programs and conferences in which you learn the basics of the field. Be on the lookout for these kinds of opportunities at work and school. Something like a six-day training program may seem short, but you can gain a lot of valuable information and make connections.You can also seek advice from people running non-profits and charities. Try to have a sit down meeting with someone involved in a cause that interests you.

, Once you're ready to start striving for social change, identify a problem. Figure out where to focus your energy. There are a lot of causes in the world, and it can be hard to choose just one. However, companies are most appealing to consumers when they have a specific direction. You will need to narrow down what kind of problems you want to address.Think about what's important to you. There are many issues in the world, such as pollution and poverty, that need addressing. What drives you personally? You'll be more motivated in your career if you're working on something you truly care about.
Try making a list of causes and, from there, narrowing it down. For example, animal rights are very important to you. What can you address, specifically, under this umbrella term? Maybe you can raise awareness of animal testing and find ways to stop it from happening.

, If you're currently employed, many companies are excited about the notion of a social-good program. A social good program can create positive public relations for a company and enhance its image. Talk to your boss about starting an initiative for social good through your own company.Sell the idea to your boss. Remind them that younger people are concerned with social change, and may pay more for products that help change the world.
Think of a way you could incorporate your cause into your current company. For example, say you work at a cosmetics company. You do not test on animals, but many of your competitors do. You could propose that your company start donating 1% of makeup profits towards shelters that rehabilitate animals that have been used for cosmetic testing.

, Once you've found a way to start advocating for your cause, you need to have a business-like mentality. Even if you end up working for a non-profit, a business model is important to success. Well organized organizations run better and get more done.Draft a business plan. This is a document that includes a description of your company, how it's organized, how you plan to raise funds, and all other aspects of how you will run your social entrepreneurial endeavor.If you don't have experience in business, recruit people to help you. A business plan is a complex document and you need someone with experience running start-ups for assistance if your personal background is not in business.

, As you begin to advocate for your cause, seek out people more talented and experienced than you. The best companies, charities, and non-profits are made up of incredibly talented people.Many people are afraid to hire people with more experience than them. You may be afraid you will fall out of the spotlight or people will surpass you and take your job. Remember, your cause is what's important and not you as an individual. People willing to work towards a particular cause are unlikely to be competitive. They will collaborate with you for the greater good.
You can recruit people with your enthusiasm. Advertise positions focusing on exactly how you're going to work towards social change. If you're motivated by your cause, that enthusiasm will rub off on others. You should be able to get a lot of people interested in working with you.

, Whether you're running a non-profit or a social initiative through your company, a solid brand is important. Companies that sell products like toothpaste work very hard on establishing a brand to get consumers' attention. If your cause is important to you, you need to find a way to generate enthusiasm.

How can you differentiate yourself from other charities? What makes your cause unique? Work with your team here to find a specific angle that people can get behind.
Things like social media marketing can work well. Gain inspiration from things like the Ice Bucket Challenge, which was popular in 2014. If consumers have to complete a challenge to donate, this can gain a lot of attention.

, Consumers are more likely to donate to a charity if they know exactly where their money is going. Operate from a place of honesty and transparency. This will help you gain more support and, in turn, enact change.Tell people all about your cause. Have a section on your website highlighting your beliefs and what you're trying to accomplish. For example, explain your opposition to animal testing, what you want to change, and how you plan on creating that change.
Let people know where their donations go towards. Share specific statistics and milestones. For example, if donations managed to fund an extra wing in a wildlife sanctuary, send out a personal thank you to all your donors explaining how their efforts helped.

, Social entrepreneurs often network with corporations that believe in their cause. Reach out to like-minded corporations and find ways to network with them.Look for corporations that already believe in your cause and have established relationships with consumers. For example, reach out to a popular cosmetics company that has taken a strong stand against testing on animals.
Remember, companies operate for profit. Make sure you let companies know the potential pay off. Remind them many consumers will pay more for products if they're sold by ethical companies and that a social entrepreneur initiative could generate a lot of positive publicity, which could translate to more profits.

, Know as much about your cause as possible. This will allow you to appeal to consumers emotionally. Advertisements and donation requests made from a place of strong emotion will gain you more attention and money.Use things like videos and images. If viewers can see and hear the impact of something, they're more likely to help. You can, for example, show images from animal testing facilities.
See if you can find well known people to help advocate for your cause. A celebrity endorsement can really bring out people's emotions.

, As your company grows, continue to network. This will allow you to maintain strength over the years and enact positive change in the world.Attend conferences, funding events, and other events centered around charity and social entrepreneurs. Find people and organizations to collaborate with that advocate for causes similar to yours.
Don't be shy. Walk up to people you're interested in working with, strike up conversations, and pass out your business card.

, Consumers are more likely to donate when they're having fun. Develop things like games, challenges, and phone applications. Use your marketing and creative team to your advantage to create fun, engaging media that will encourage consumers to give., Always look for ways to slash your budget and save resources. It's important to have a nest egg in place in the event of a major disaster or setback. Operating on as small a budget as possible can help you in the event of an emergency.After writing up your business budget, try to cut costs in half wherever possible.
Take out a savings account and put any spare money you have into it. If something goes wrong, a nest egg can save your charity or non-profit.

, Remember, you should run your non-profit or charity much like a business. If you want to be be successful running a business, evolution is important. You will need to be flexible and adjust your marketing strategies and business model to keep up with recent trends.Pay attention to shifts in your industry. Hire a market research team to keep you up to date on the latest trends and how to best adapt your strategies.
Learn new ways to appeal to donors. Take note of successful charity drives and awareness campaigns in the headlines. Adjust your approach accordingly.

, Becoming any kind of entrepreneur can be stressful at times. You may have some bad days, or bad months, and there will be failure along the way. If you feel lost, remember your cause. Recall why you got involved to begin with. Remembering your cause can help you stay on track and generate new ideas when you feel burnt out.It's always a good idea to learn more about your cause. Follow any news regarding the issue you're fighting for. This can help you keep up your motivation.

Try to find sources in different disciplines.,
Begin writing.",How to Do Research," Clarify who it will help. The answer may be based on your academic, personal or professional needs, but it should be your motivation for doing a thorough job.;
, You should boil the question down to basic terms, time periods and disciplines. Write down any sub-questions that need to be researched before you can answer the question., Usually a thesis is a response to a general topic or question being asked. You should have an idea what you would like to use your research for; however, it does not need to be fully formed before you begin the research project.

, Generally, a research proposal is required for research projects that will last more than a few weeks.


Term papers, graduate projects and field research projects will require a research proposal that states what problem you would like to solve through investigation.
State the problem first, and then explain why the problem is relevant and important for the people to which you will be submitting the research.
Include the types of research you would like to conduct, including reading, surveys, gathering statistics or working with specialists.

, The following topics should be determined before you get started:


The timeline for the research to take place. You will need a timeline to successfully cover all your bases.
A list of topics that should be included in your final report. If you have a syllabus or official assignment, it should explain the scope.
The schedule of reviews by teachers or managers, so you can meet progress checks along the way.
The number of sources that are required. Generally, the number of sources is commensurate with the length of the paper.
The format for your research list, citations and works cited list.

, Type the basic terms of your research question to get a cursory knowledge on the subject.


Give preference to websites that are sourced by universities, scientists, government research projects and journals.
List any exceptional resources that you would feel comfortable citing.
Use plus signs to search for multiple terms when they are used together. For example, “Christmas+Boxing Day.”
Use minus signs to exclude search terms. For example, “+Christmas -shopping.”Collect information about the website, such as the published date, the authority that published it and the date you accessed it, as well as the URL.

, If possible, use your local college or university library. If a larger library is unavailable, apply for a library card at your public library.


Consult a librarian in the reference section to find out what collections, journals and dictionaries the library has access to. For example, the Library of Congress directory will give you access to all books published on a topic. Do background reading, such as historical books, photographs and definitions in a major dictionary.
Use the electronic card catalog to access books that can be requested from other libraries.
Use the computer lab to access journals and other media that is only available at the library. For example, some scientific journals may only be available on the library computers.
Look in the media lab to see what other sources, such as microfiche, movies and interviews are available through the library.
Request any promising materials through the reference desk or through your online library account. , Interviews and surveys can provide quotations, direction and statistics that support your research. Interview experts, witnesses and professionals who have conducted relevant research in the past.

, Taking a trip to gather information at a relevant location can help to establish a historical and background to your research project. If you are allowed to use opinions in your research report, you will want to note how the research grows and changes from your point of view. , When you decide your thesis, you should break it into sub-topics that you can research online, in a library or with interviews and observational research individually. Remember that you will probably need at least 6 good sources for each 15 pages of your final report.

, Primary sources are evidence, artifacts or documents that originated from people who had direct contact with a situation. Secondary sources are those that discuss information from primary sources.


A secondary source could be a point of view or analysis of an original historical event or document. For example, an immigration record would be a primary source, while a newspaper article about a family’s ancestry would be a secondary source.

, If the narrator of an account is not personally connected to the subject, they are more likely to remain objective.

, Web sources usually feature less strict controls than articles published in journals or books.

, Subjective sources that take opposing points of view can be extremely important, because they are able to give a larger view of the issue. Find “pain points” in your argument and document any possible ways to deal with them.


It is easy to conduct research that supports your thesis. Try to find resources that disagree with your thesis so that you can handle objections to your project.

, Keep your sources separate until you determine you want the source to be part of your research. Although helpful in the research process, some resources will not be sufficiently valuable to support published research.

, Write down questions posed by your research followed by sources and the answers you found. Reference the page numbers, URLs and sources that answer those questions.

, Photocopy your printed sources and take notes on visual or audio sources. Make notes in the margins about any terms that must be defined, relevance to your research topic and sources that build on each other.


Use a highlighter and a pencil on photocopies. You should do this as you read it, rather than returning to do it at a later date.
Annotation promoted active reading.
Keep a list of citations that may be useful in your report.

, Separate it into folders according to different topics, if possible. You can also use an electronic filing system, like Evernote to keep scans, websites and notes together.

, Separate the topics you need to break down by number. Then letter the sub-topics that you must research and report on.

, Try not to assume that a past approach is the only approach.


Step away from your research for a few days, so that you see it with fresh eyes. Take a break every week, just as you would with a job.

, Try to explain what you’ve found. Ask the person to ask questions that arise as they hear about the topic to see the topic with fresh eyes.

, If you have been approaching a subject from an anthropological perspective, try papers in sociology, biology or another field. Expand your sources through your library’s reference section.

, Start filling in your outline. As you write, you will decide which sub-sections require more research.

, Here are some tips for putting information into your PowerPoint presentation:


Use short, concise words to guide your audience, and let yourself do the detailed explaining. Keywords show that you know your subject when you go more in-depth during your powerpoint. For example, use ""Fire Kiln"" as a keyword in a PowerPoint, but explain the process during the actual presentation.
Think bullet points. Don't use full sentences in your PowerPoint presentations unless it's absolutely necessary.
Don't be afraid to spread information across multiple slides. It's better than overcrowding a PowerPoint!

, To insert anything (text, charts, etc), simply click on the designated box to activate it and start inserting away.


Inserting pictures and graphs is a good idea to make your presentation more visually engaging. Break up your text!
Use color effectively in your PowerPoint. Have a theme of colors and be consistent when using them to highlight key points. This makes your presentation look more professional.

Click “View”, then either “Notes Master” or “Handouts Master.”Headers will only appear on the printed handout or notes version of your presentation, not the slide show you present on a screen.,
Click “Insert,” then “Header & Footer.” You’ll automatically be brought to the Notes and Handouts tab of the “Header & Footer” screen.

,
Check “Date and Time” and choose a time setting.,

,
Print a handout or notes page.",How to Add a Header in Powerpoint2," Notes and Handouts headers are limited to text-only.


Choose “Notes Master” if you’d like to view and print your presentation as a single slide-per-page situated above a lined area intended for note-taking.
Choose “Handout Master” if you intend to print the presentation as a series of slides (with no note-taking area) on a single page.

,, Choose between “Update automatically” and “Fixed” as a display type. If you choose “Fixed,” type the date in the blank.

, You can also choose to add a footer here (which will appear at the bottom of the notes page or handout) by checking “Footer” and entering your desired information.

, This will add your header (and footer, if you added one) to every printed page. You can return at any time to modify your header settings.

, If you want to move the header to another place on the page, hold your mouse cursor over one of the lines surrounding it until a 4-way arrow cursor appears. Hold the mouse button down and drag the header to another location.


Moving the header to another location on the Notes Master will not move it on the Handout Page—you’ll have to switch to the Handout Master on the Views tab if you want to reposition the header that style of printout.
Footers can also be moved this way.

,, After pressing print on your PowerPoint presentation, find the “Print What” area on the print dialog box. It’s set to “Slides” by default, but you can change this to either “Handouts” or “Notes Page.”


If you select “Handouts,” you’ll see options to change the amount of slides per page. The default is 6, but if you want people to be able to read the content on the page, you might want to go with 2 or 3.
For the “Notes Page,” each slide will print on its own page with a series of lines below for note-taking.

,, If you’d prefer the date on the slide remain the same no matter when you show the presentation, type the date into the box that says “Fixed.”

, If you want to standardize a bit of text other than the date, type your desired text into the box. The text you type here will appear on every slide.

, This will add a recurring footer at the bottom of every slide.

, If you want the footer to appear at the top of a slide (like a header), click the footer text until it is surrounded by a dotted box, then drag it to the top of the slide.


This action will not propagate to the other slides in your presentation. You’ll have to move the footer on each individual slide.

Before you write your paper, be sure that you understand exactly what is being asked of you.Some things you will likely need to know include:The length of the paper.
How many sources and what types must be used.
The appropriate topic. Has your instructor assigned a specific topic, or do you choose your own? Does he or she have any suggestions? Are there any restrictions on your choice of topic?
The paper's due date.
Whether you have to turn in any pre-writing tasks. For example, your instructor might ask that you submit a rough draft for peer review or turn in your outline along with your finished paper.
What kind of format you will use. Does the paper have to be double-spaced? Do you need APA format? How are you supposed to cite your sources?
If you are unclear about any of these important details, be sure to ask your instructor.;
, Some people like to write on a laptop. Others may prefer a notebook and pen. Be sure that you have all the materials you require to engage in the writing process. Double-check that your computer is operational and that you have enough supplies to see you through the writing process.


If you require a computer and Internet connection but do not own a computer, see if you can gain access to a computer lab at your public library or university library.

, Research papers often involve many steps, each one of which takes a significant amount of time.If you want to write a good research paper, you will not be able to cut corners. Be sure that you leave yourself enough time--at least a day or two--to complete each step. Having at least two weeks to research and write your paper is ideal. The exact timeline you create will depend on a number of factors, including the length of the assignment, your familiarity with the topic, your personal writing style, and how many other responsibilities you have. However, the following timeline is representative of the kind of timeline you may create for yourself:


Day 1: Initial reading; determine topic
Day 2: Gather research sources
Days 3-5: Read and take notes on research
Day 6: Create outline
Days 7-9: Write first draft
Days 10+: Revise into final form
Bear in mind that research papers vary in complexity and scope. A high school research report may take two weeks, a Master's thesis may take a year, and a professor's scholarly research in her field may take years.

, Some people like to read and write in completely quiet, isolated environments, such as a private study room in a library. Other people are more able to concentrate in places with a bit more activity, such as a coffee shop or dormitory lounge.Have in mind a few places where you might be able to plan and write your research paper. Make sure these places have good lighting (ideally with some windows for natural light) and that there are plenty of electrical outlets for your laptop.

, In many cases, your research topic will be assigned to you by your instructor. If this is true for you, you can simply move on the the next stage in the process.However, if your assignment's exact topic is an open one, you will need to take some time to figure out the topic of your research paper.

, Even if the topic is an open one, you will still likely have some limitations on the topic you choose.Your topic must be relevant to the class you are taking and to the specific assignment you were given. For example, your topic might need to be related to something that was covered in your lecture. Or your topic might need to have something to do with the French Revolution. Make sure that you understand what is being asked of you so that your research topic is relevant.For example, your microbiology professor will not want a terrific research paper on the philosophy of the Enlightenment. Similarly, an American literature instructor who asked you to write about F. Scott Fitzgerald will not be happy if you hand in an essay about Jeff van der Meer. Stay focused and relevant.

, Once you have understood the assignment's parameters, you can begin brainstorming possible topics that fit those parameters.It is possible that a great topic will hit you instantly. It is more likely, however, that you will need to take some time to brainstorm before settling on your specific topic.Be sure that your potential topics are all ones that you find interesting: you will have to spend a lot of time researching this subject, and the task will be more pleasant if you enjoy it. In order to brainstorm interesting topics, you can:


Glance through your course texts and lecture notes. Where there any topics that grabbed your attention? Did you highlight any passages in your book because you wanted to learn more? These might be excellent cues to point you to a topic.
Consider which specific reading assignments you have enjoyed the most so far. They might lead you to a topic.
Have a conversation with a classmate about your course. Talk about what excites you (or what doesn't excite you), and use that as a jumping-off point.

, After you have made your list of exciting topics, take a moment to look at them. Are there any that jump out at you? Do you notice any patterns? For example, if half of your list has to do with weaponry of the First World War, that is a good indication that that is where your interests lie. Other things to consider as you choose a tentative topic include:


Its relevance to the assignment. Does it fit all assignment parameters?
The amount of research material available on the topic. You can be pretty sure that there is a wealth of published information available about medieval French monasteries. However, there might not be a lot of published material available about the way Catholic priests in Cleveland respond to rap music.
How narrow your research topic must be. Some research paper assignments are very specific: for example, you might be asked to research the history of a single object (like the Frisbee). Other kinds of research paper assignments are quite broad, such as if you are asked to survey the way women are involved in warfare. It helps if your topic is narrow enough that you will not be completely overwhelmed by information but broad enough to allow you to engage meaningfully with your resources.For example, you will not be able to write a good 10-page paper on the topic of ""World War II."" That is too broad and overwhelming. You might, however, be able to write a good 10-page paper on ""How Chicago's Newspapers Depicted World War II.""

, Before you have settled on a definite topic, it does not make sense for you to read research materials in any kind of depth. That would be a waste of time. However, it is helpful to do just a little bit of light reading on your topic to make sure that it is viable. You might discover that your tentative topic is too broad or too narrow, or you might discover that your tentative topic will not allow you to make a meaningful contribution. After reading about your tentative topic, you can:


Decide that the tentative topic is viable and pursue it
Decide that your tentative topic requires some tweaking
Decide that this topic is completely unviable, and test out another tentative topic from your list

, Many instructors and teaching assistants are happy to provide suggestions to those writing research papers.If you are not certain whether your topic is a good one, one of your instructors might be able to guide you. Your instructor will likely have office hours for you to attend, which will allow you to talk about your paper ideas.


It is also a good idea to talk to your instructors early in the writing process so that you can take their advice about where to look for resources or how to structure your paper.
Remember to be prepared and articulate when you meet with an instructor about your paper topic. They will want you to have thought carefully about your topic and your ideas before meeting with them.

, Primary sources are the original objects you are writing about, whereas secondary sources are commentaries about a primary source.You are more likely to have primary sources if you are writing a research paper in a humanities, arts, or social science field. A hard science field is much less likely to involve the analysis of a primary source. Depending on the topic of the research paper, you might need to have available:


A work of literature
A film
A manuscript
Historical documents
Letters or diaries
A painting

, Many universities and schools subscribe to searchable databases to allow you to hunt for reference material.These databases might help you locate journal articles, scholarly monographs, scientific papers, indexes of sources, historical documents, or other media. Use a keyword search or Library of Congress subject headings to begin to find published material that is relevant to your topic.If your school does not subscribe to major databases, you can search online for open-access journals or use tools like Jstor and GoogleScholar to begin to find solid research material.Just be wary about sources you find online.Sometimes these databases will provide you with access to the source itself--such as a PDF version of a journal article. In other cases, these databases will simply provide you with a title for you to track down in a research library.

, In addition to searchable databases, your own local public library, research library, or university library will likely have useful sources in their collections.Use the library's internal search engine to begin tracking down relevant subject headings, authors, keywords, and topics.Be sure that you keep a careful list of the titles, authors, call numbers, and locations of these sources. You will have to track them down soon, and keeping careful records will prevent you from having to re-do any searches.

, Many libraries organize their shelves according to subject area. This means that if you are gathering material on a single topic, it is likely that the books will be shelved closely together.The results from your search in the library system's search engine should point you to the most likely place--or places--for you to find relevant books.Be sure to scan the shelves that surround the books you're searching for: you might find relevant sources that did not appear in your web-based search. Check out any books that you think might be relevant.


Be aware that many libraries shelve their periodicals in a separate section from their books. Sometimes these periodicals are not permitted to leave the library, in which case you might need to create a photocopy or digital scan of the article.

, Librarians are very knowledgeable about their collections. Some library systems even have librarians who are specialists in particular areas such as law, the sciences, or literature.Talk to a librarian or a research librarian about your topic of interest. He or she might be able to point you in some surprising and useful directions.

, There is a wealth of information out there, some of which is accurate and some of which is not. It can sometimes be difficult to tell which is which.However, there are some tools you can use to make sure your research sources are not leading you astray:Make sure your sources are peer-reviewed.Peer review is a process by which scholars and scientists test each other's work for accuracy. If a work has not gone through a peer-review process, it is possible that the source is inaccurate or sloppy.
Do not rely too heavily on popular websites. Wikipedia and similar websites are useful sources of quick information (such as an important date), but they are not the best places for in-depth analysis.Take information from popular websites with a grain of salt, and check the information against scholarly sources.Look for books published with reputable presses.If your source is a published book, make sure the book was published with a decent press. Many of the best presses are affiliated with major universities, which is a helpful clue. Do not trust information that comes from a self-published book.
Ask experts in your field about their favorite journals. Some scientific and scholarly journals are better than others. It can be difficult for a student to understand the differences between a top-tier and a second-tier journal, so you should ask an expert for advice about the most reliable sources of information.
Look for sources that have good footnotes or endnotes. While there are some exceptions to this, in general most solid research will have careful citations. If you've found an article without any footnotes, that is an indication that the author did not review anyone else's research, which is a bad sign.

, One of the best places to find ideas for further research is in the footnotes or endnotes of sources that have been particularly helpful to you. Footnotes or endnotes are where an author cites his or her own research sources, which creates a paper trail that you can follow too. If you respect an author's conclusions, it would be worthwhile for you to examine the sources that inspired her ideas in the first place.

, By this point, you should have a number of books checked out from the library as well as journal articles or scientific articles printed out or on your computer. Create a system to keep these materials organized. Create a separate folder on your laptop for relevant journal articles, for example, and keep your research books on a single shelf.You don't want these valuable sources to get lost.

, If you are writing a research paper that analyzes a primary source, you should start by closely examining your primary materials. Read them closely, look at them closely, and take careful notes. Consider writing down some initial observations that will help ground you. After all, you don't want your own thoughts to get lost when you begin reading expert opinions on the topic., Do not assume that every source will be equally relevant to your research topic. Sometimes titles are deceiving, and sometimes you might discover that a study is flawed or completely off-topic. Assume that only about half of the sources you've compiled will end up serving your purpose. Before you begin taking detailed notes, decide whether or not a source is worth reading in depth. Some ways to figure this out quickly include:


Skim over chapter headings and section headings to determine major topics. Flag any specific sections or chapters that might be particularly relevant to you.
Read the introduction and conclusion first. These sections should let you know the topics covered by the author and whether or not they apply to you.
Skim through the footnotes. These should give you an idea of the kinds of conversations the author is involved in. If you are writing a psychology paper and the footnotes of an article are all citing philosophers, that source might not be relevant to you.

, After skimming your research materials, decide which ones are likely to help out your research the most. Some sources will be very useful, and you might want to look through the entire work. Other sources might only have small sections that are relevant to your research.Remember that it is perfectly fine to read a single chapter out of a book instead of the whole thing. Other sources might be completely irrelevant; you can simply discard them.

, It is normal to be overwhelmed with information while writing a research paper. You will be introduced to new concepts, new terms, and new arguments. In order to keep yourself organized (and in order to remember clearly what you have read), make sure that you take careful notes as you go.If you are working on a photocopied article, you can write directly on the page. Otherwise, you should keep a separate notebook or word processing document to keep track of the information you read.Things you should write down include:


The source's major argument or conclusion
The source's methods
The source's key pieces of evidence
Alternative explanations for the source's results
Anything that surprised or confused you
Key terms and concepts
Anything you disagree with or doubt in the source's argument
Questions you have about the source
Useful quotations

, As you take notes, be sure that you indicate exactly which source provided you with the information. Most citations include the author's (or authors') names, date of publication, title of publication, journal title (if relevant) and page number(s). Other possible information to include might be the publisher's name, the website used to access the publication, and the city in which the source was published. Remember that you should cite a source when you quote it directly as well as when you have simply gleaned information from it. Not doing so could lead to accusations of plagiarism or academic dishonesty.Use whatever citation format your professor requested. Common citation formats include MLA, Chicago, APA, and CSE style. All of these have online style guides that can help you cite your sources appropriately.
There are many computer programs that can help you format your citations easily, including EndNote and RefWorks. Certain word processing systems also have citation programs to allow you to build your bibliography.

, As you continue to take notes, you should begin to see some patterns emerging about your topic.Are there any major disagreements that you notice? Is there general consensus about certain things? Have most of the sources left out a key topic from their discussions? Organize your notes according to these key patterns.

, This will be where you outline your paper. An outline is a key step to writing a research paper, especially research papers that are on the longer side.An outline will help keep you focused and on-task. It should also expedite the writing process. Remember that a good outline does not have to have entire, smooth paragraphs. Instead, an outline will only contain the most vital pieces of information for you to arrange later.This includes:


Your thesis statement
The topic sentence, key pieces of evidence, and key conclusion for each body paragraph
A sensible order of your body paragraphs
A concluding statement

, Most research papers will require you to make some kind of argument based on the evidence you've gathered as well as your analysis.You will introduce your argument using a thesis statement, and all of your following paragraphs will be dependent upon your thesis.Remember that your thesis statement must be:


Argumentative. You cannot simply state something that is common knowledge or basic fact. ""The sky is blue"" is not a thesis statement.
Convincing. Your thesis must be based in evidence and careful analysis.Do not posit a wild, deliberately unconventional, or unprovable thesis.
Appropriate to your assignment. Remember to adhere to all parameters and guidelines of your paper assignment.
Manageable in the space allotted. Keep your thesis narrow and focused. That way you might be able to prove your point in the space given to you., Because everything else depends on your thesis, you want to keep it in mind at all times. Write it at the very top of your outline, in large and bold letters.


If you have to tweak the thesis as you go through the writing process, then do so. It is likely that you might change your mind somewhat as you compose your paper.
Other key things to include in an introduction include your methods, the parameters of any studies you performed, and a roadmap of the sections to follow., Many papers include a section towards the beginning of the paper that gives the reader key information about their topic. In many cases, you also need to provide a discussion about what other researchers have said about your topic (a.k.a. a literature review). List the pieces of information that you will need to explain in order for your reader to be able to understand the following contents of the paper., What kinds of evidence do you need in order to demonstrate that you are right? Do you need textual evidence, visual evidence, historical evidence, or scientific evidence? Do you need expert opinion? Take a look at your research notes to locate some of this evidence., Your body paragraphs are where your research and analysis will come into play. Most paragraphs are a few sentences long, and all of the sentences are related to a common theme or idea. Ideally each body paragraph will build off of the previous one, adding weight to your argument.Usually each body paragraph will include:


A topic sentence that explains what the following evidence is and why it is relevant.
The presentation of pieces of evidence. These could include quotations, the results of scientific studies, or survey results.
Your analysis of this evidence.
A discussion of how this evidence has been treated by other researchers.
A concluding sentence or two explaining the significance of the analysis.

, Each body paragraph should stand on its own. However, they all must work together to argue the merits of your thesis statement. Consider how your body paragraphs relate to one another. Think of a compelling, sensible structure for these body paragraphs. Depending on your topic, you might organize your body paragraphs:


Chronologically. For example, if your research paper is about the history of an artifact, you might want to discuss its key features in chronological order.
Conceptually. You might consider the major themes in your paper and discuss each concept one-by-one. For example, if your paper discusses the way a particular film treats gender, race, and sexuality, you might want to have separate sections on each of these concepts.
According to scale. For example, if your paper discusses the impact of a vaccine, you might organize your paper according to the size of the population from smallest to largest population, e.g. its impact on a particular village, then a nation, and finally on the globe.
According to a yes-no-so structure. A yes-no-so structure involves the presentation of one perspective (the yes), then its opposite structure (the no). Finally, you bring together the best parts of each perspective in order to create a new theory (the so). For example, your paper might explain why certain health care providers believe in acupuncture, then why other health care providers consider it to be quackery. Finally, you can explain why each side might be a little bit right and a little bit wrong.
It can be very useful to include transition sentences between your body paragraphs. This way, your reader will understand why they are arranged the way they are., Depending on your field or the parameters of your assignment, you might have other necessary sections besides the body paragraphs. These can vary quite widely, so be sure to consult your syllabus or your instructor for clarification. These sections could include:An abstractA literature review
Scientific figures
A methods section
A results section
An appendix
An annotated bibliography

, A strong conclusion will serve as the final statement that your thesis is correct. It should tie up your loose ends and make a strong case for your own perspective.However, your conclusion might also serve other functions as well, depending on your field. These might include:


Possible downsides or alternative explanations for your results
Further questions in need of study
How you hope your paper has impacted the general discussion of the topic

, Most people experience writer's block at some point in their lives, especially when faced with a large task such as a research paper. Remember to relax and take a few deep breaths: you can get through your anxiety with some easy tools and tricks.

, If you are stuck on your paper, put away your outline for a few minutes. Instead, simply write down everything you think is important about your topic. What do you care about? What should others care about? Remind yourself of what you find interesting and fun in your research topic. And simply writing for a few minutes--even if you are writing material that will not enter your final draft--will get your juices flowing for more organized writing later., You do not have to write a research paper from beginning to end in that order. Especially if you have a solid outline, your paper will come together no matter which paragraph you write first. If you are struggling to write your introduction, choose your most interesting body paragraph to write instead. You might find it to be a more manageable task--and you might get ideas for how to get through the more difficult sections., If you are getting tripped up by a complicated sentence or concept, try to explain it out loud instead of on paper. Talk to your parents or a friend about the concept. How would you explain it to them over the phone? Only begin to write down this concept after you have gotten used to explaining it orally., First drafts are never perfect. You can always fix imperfections or clunky sentences in revision. Rather than getting hung up on finding the perfect word, simply highlight it in yellow in your document as a reminder to think about it later. You might be able to find the right word in another day or two. But for now, just focus on getting your ideas on paper., You don't want to make a habit out of procrastinating, but your brain sometimes needs to take breaks in order to function properly. If you have been struggling with a paragraph for more than an hour, let yourself take a 20-minute walk and come back to it later. You might find that it looks a great deal easier once you have gotten some fresh air., Some people experience writer's block because they are anxious about who will read their paper: such as a teacher who is a notoriously tough grader. To get over your anxiety, pretend that you are writing the paper for somebody else: your camp counselor, your roommate, your parents, your advisor. This might help put you in a better frame of mind and will also help you clarify your thinking."

Break the essay into manageable parts that you can stick to during your allotted time. Allot specific times based on your strengths and weaknesses in writing. Consider using a plan such as the following:9:00 – 9:30 – Consider paper topic and your argument
9:30 – 10:30 – Conduct research.
10:30 – 10:40 – Short break.

15:00 – 15.15 – Check your essay for errors and print;
, Use the introduction to let your readers know what you’re going to say in the paper. Start with a hook, which catches or grabs your reader’s attention and can draws them into the paper.Make sure to clearly state your argument in simple prose, which is the entire point of the paper. Writing a strong introduction may distract your professor from an otherwise terribly written body.An example of a hook could be “A letter from South Africa arrived at an British military government building Hamburg, Germany in November of 1945. The message was from Adam Landauer, a German Jew interned in a camp for enemy aliens near Johannesburg. Max’s letter does not survive, but an index card, nestled among 50 million other such cards, describes its contents and the action taken in response. But the letter, is nevertheless important. It was meant trace his brother, with whom he lost contact during the war. This single letter showed the importance of agencies that could trace missing persons in order to reconstruct Europe after the hostilities.”

, Allow yourself to free-write the “meat,” or body, of your paper. Build on 2-3 relevant points that you’ve learned in class. Then analyzing these points with your thoughts and opinions based on lectures and assigned readings. This can quickly add text and volume to the paper that you can shape with some expert research in the revision process.Write simple sentences, which can simply the paper-writing process. For example, you can easily build off of these four statements: “Roman rulers possessed considerable wealth;” “wealthy Romans used aqueducts built with lead before poorer citizens;” “the lead made the Roman leadership crazy;” “the Roman empire declined before aqueducts were widespread.”

, Revisit what you’ve said in the introduction and body of your paper in the conclusion. Provide a strong impression that you did what you set to do in the paper for your professor by saying things such as, “But Max’s case highlights the binary of humanitarian assistance: it was simultaneously benevolent and political. This challenges earlier scholarship on the apolitical nature of humanitarian aid.” These types of statements may make your professor forget about the haphazard nature of your research and writing., Once you have your base paper, use Internet resources to your benefit. Find quotes and research papers from experts on sites such as Google Scholar or Digital Dissertations. Weaving in bits of information and block quotes can bolster your argument and fill out your paper even more., As you scour the Internet for research on your topic, look out for beautiful quotes or bits of information. You can paraphrasing or weave them into your paper as a separate block quote. Paraphrasing and block quotes can easily and quickly beef up the amount of writing in your paper, getting you closer to the word limit—and end of your panic!, Citations are an important part of any paper that legitimate your work. Cite every fact, quote or block quote you use in the paper. Cite several different works from the same person, which can further beef up your paper. Citations tactics not only can quickly enlarge your paper, but also minimizes the risk of plagiarism., Find pictures and statistical graphics that support or are marginally relevant to your paper topic. Write a couple of separate paragraphs about each graphic or image you use in the paper. The image and your explanation of it can take up a considerable amount of space in the paper, making it easy to BS your way through the writing assignment., Make the thesaurus your best friend while you write. Search for longer synonyms for words and phrases that fluff out your paper even more. Using different words and phrases can be the difference in space of “the ways in which” for “how” and “reinforcing patriarchcal seigneurial norms” instead of “men rule.” In addition, creative use of vocabulary may distract your professor from other issues with the paper., Getting wildly emotional at this point will hinder your ability to write. Instead, focus on what you can do 'now,' which is to do some triage research and write. Staying positive, keeping up your work flow, and having a little determination can help you go far., Remove anything that may cause your mind to wander. Put away your electronic devices and lists of things to do. Sit away from your TV, phone, or other things you can watch. If you are using the Internet for research, place a block on social media sites for a specific time to prevent the temptation of what your friends are doing. Clearing away potential distractions can ensure you stay focused on getting your paper done., Eat a snack and drink a glass of water every hour. This can refresh your body and mind, helping you to compose a better text in a faster time. Avoid filling up on junk food and caffeine because it may cause you to crash and feel worse than you did before you ate. Select the following types of healthy snacks to ensure you have fuel to keep working:Piece of cheese
Fresh fruit or cut veggies
Hummus
Yogurt
A granola bar
Pretzels
Mixed nuts
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich

, After 60-90 minutes of writing, give yourself a 10-15 minute break. Go for a short walk, pace the room, or do some light stretching. Breaks help to refresh and refocus your body and mind.Avoiding breaks can make you more tired, affect your mood, and even less efficient at composing your paper.

, Keep in mind that BSing for a paper will probably be evident to your professor. They were students once and know most tricks in the book. Recognizing that you probably won’t receive a great grade, which is better than a zero, on a BS paper may make it easier to complete the assignment. It can also make it easier to deal with potentially negative comments from your professor.

Readers, by and large, are somewhat picky about what they read and what they don't. If a piece of writing doesn't immediately catch their attention in the first paragraph, there's a good chance they won't bother to read the rest of it. Because of this, it's often a good idea to begin an essay with a sentence that commands the reader's attention from the get-go. So long as this first sentence is logically connected to the rest of the article, there's no shame in being attention-grabbing right out of the gate.


You may want to start with a fascinating, little-known fact or statistic to grab your reader's attention. For instance, if you're writing an essay on the growing danger of childhood obesity worldwide, you might start with this: ""Contrary to the popular idea that childhood obesity is only a problem for rich, pampered Westerners, the WHO reports that in 2012, over 30% of preschool-age children in developing countries were overweight or obese.""On the other hand, if it fits into your essay more logically, you may want to start with a particularly gripping image or description. For an essay on your summer vacation, you might start with this: ""When I felt the Costa Rican sun filtering through the jungle canopy and heard the sound of howler monkeys far off in the distance, I knew that I had found someplace very special.""

, A great first sentence can get the reader's attention, but if you don't keep pulling the reader into your essay, she or he can still easily lose interest. Follow your very first sentence with a sentence or two that logically link the attention grabbing ""hook"" in the first sentence to the rest of the essay as a whole. Often, these sentences will expand on the narrow scope of the first sentence, placing the specific snapshot you present initially in some sort of larger context.


For example, in your obesity essay, you might follow your first sentence as follows: ""In fact, childhood obesity is a growing problem that is increasingly affecting rich and poor countries alike."" This sentence explains the urgency of the problem described in the first sentence and gives it a broader context.
For your vacation essay, you might follow your first sentence with something like this: ""I was deep in the jungles of Tortuguero National Park, and I was lost in more ways than one."" This sentence tells the reader where the imagery in the first sentence comes from and pulls the reader into the rest of the essay by teasing that it will eventually be revealed how the narrator is ""lost.""

, Most of the time, essays aren't purely descriptive — they don't exist solely to tell you what something is in basic, factual terms. Usually, they have a specific purpose beyond this. This can be almost anything. The essay may aim to change the reader's mind about a certain topic, persuade the reader into taking action for a specific cause, shed light on something that's not well understood, or simply tell a thought-provoking story. In any case, the basic purpose of the first paragraph or so of an essay is to tell the reader what the purpose of the essay is. This way, the reader can quickly choose whether to continue to the rest of the essay or not.


In your obesity essay, you might sum things up by proceeding like this: ""The purpose of this essay is to analyze current trends in childhood obesity rates worldwide and recommend specific policy initiatives to combat this growing problem."" This clearly and plainly tells what the essay aims to do. There is no confusion here.
For your vacation essay, you might try something like this: ""This is the story of my summer in Costa Rica, a summer that neither spider bites, nor rotten plantains, nor Giardia could keep from being life-changing."" This tells the reader that they'll be reading an account of one person's journey to a foreign country while teasing specific details about what's in store in the body of the essay.

, Sometimes, it's appropriate to go one step further in the intro to describe how your essay plans to achieve its purpose. This can be useful if your essay can easily be broken down into distinct, specific sections in a way that will make the topic easier to grasp for the reader. It's also useful to know how to do this if you're a student because some teachers will require you to do so. However, specifically outlining the different pieces of your essay in the introduction isn't always a good idea. In some cases, especially for light-hearted essays, this can read as somewhat mechanical and can intimidate the reader by presenting too much information upfront.


For your obesity essay, you might continue like this: ""This essay addresses three main global health concerns: the rising availability of high-calorie food, the decline in physical exercise, and the growing popularity of sedentary leisure activities."" For a straightforward research essay like this, outlining the main topics of discussion is a good idea because it allows the reader to immediately understand the essay's justification for the purpose explained in the previous sentence.
On the other hand, for your vacation essay, you probably wouldn't outline your essay in this way. Since you've established that your essay is lighthearted and playful, it would sound somewhat bizarre to continue with, for instance: ""By experiencing both city life in the capital of San Jose and rural life in the jungles of Tortuguero, I changed as a person during my trip."" It's not a terrible sentence, but it doesn't flow well from the preceding ones because it lay out a strict, rigid structure where none is needed.

, In essay-writing, a thesis statement is a single sentence that describes the ""point"" of the essay as clearly and concisely as possible. Some essays, especially five-paragraph essays written for academic assignments or as part of a standardized test, more or less require you to include a thesis statement as part of the opening paragraph. Even essays that don't require this can benefit from the concise purpose-defining power of a bold thesis statement. Generally, thesis statements are included at or near the end of the first paragraph, though there are no hard and fast rules about where, specifically, thesis statements must be.


For your obesity essay, since you're dealing with a serious topic and writing about it in a clinical, straightforward way, you might be fairly direct with your thesis statement: ""By analyzing available survey data, this essay aims to pinpoint specific policy initiatives as likely paths to global obesity reduction."" This thesis statement tells the reader in relatively few words the exact purpose of the essay.
You probably wouldn't include a single thesis statement for your vacation essay. Since you're more interested in setting a mood, telling a story, and illustrating personal themes, a direct, clinical statement like ""This essay will describe my summer vacation to Costa Rica in great detail"" would sound oddly forced and unnecessary.

, In addition to being your space to discuss what you're going to talk about, your first paragraph or so is also a space to establish how you're going to talk about it. The way you write — your writing voice — is part of what encourages (or discourages) your readers from reading your article. If the tone in the beginning of your essay is clear, pleasing, and appropriate for the subject matter, your readers will be more likely to read than if it's muddled, varies greatly from sentence to sentence, or is mismatched to the topic at hand.


Take a look at the sentences for the example essays above. Notice that, while the obesity essay and the vacation essay have very distinct voices, both are clearly written and are appropriate for the subject matter. The obesity essay is a serious, analytical piece of writing dealing with a public health problem, so it's reasonable for the sentences to be somewhat clinical and to-the-point. On the other hand, the vacation essay is about a fun, exciting experience that had a major effect on the writer, so it's reasonable that the sentences are a little more playful, containing exciting details and conveying the writer's sense of wonder.

, One of the most important rules when it comes to introductions is that shorter is almost always better. If you can convey all the information that you need to convey in five sentences rather than six, do it. If you can use a simple, everyday word in place of a more obscure word (e.g., ""start"" vs. ""initiate""), do it. If you can get your message across in ten words rather than twelve, do it. Wherever you can make your introductory passages shorter without sacrificing quality or clarity, do so. Remember, the beginning of your essay serves to get your reader into the meat of the essay, but it's the sizzle and not the meat of the essay itself, so keep it short.


As noted above, while you should strive for brevity, you shouldn't shorten your introduction so much that it becomes unclear or illogical. For instance, in your obesity essay, you shouldn't shorten this sentence: ""In fact, childhood obesity is a global problem that is increasingly affecting rich and poor countries alike."" ...to this: ""In fact, obesity is actually a big problem."" This second sentence doesn't tell the whole story — the essay is about the rising global incidence of childhood obesity, not the fact that obesity is bad for you in general.

, Though all essays are unique (besides plagiarized ones), certain strategies can help you make the most of your essay based on the specific type of writing you're doing. For instance, if you're writing an argumentative essay — that is, one that argues a specific point with the hope of persuading the reader into agreement — it can be helpful to focus on summarizing your argument in the introductory paragraph (or paragraphs) of the essay. Doing this gives the reader a quick rundown of the logic you're going to use to support your argument.


For instance, if you're arguing against a proposed local sales tax, you might include something like the following in your first paragraph: ""The proposed sales tax is regressive and fiscally irresponsible. By proving that the sales tax puts a disproportionate tax burden on the poor and that it has a net negative effect on the local economy, this essay intends to prove these points beyond a shadow of a doubt."" This approach tells the reader right away what your main arguments are going to be, and this gives your argument legitimacy from the get go.

, Creative writing and fiction can be more emotionally charged than other pieces of writing. For these types of essays, you can usually get away with beginning your essay with a metaphorical bang. Making an effort to be exciting or memorable in your first few sentences is a great way to draw readers into your work. Also, since creative writing isn't based on some of the more mechanical aspects of argumentative writing (like outlining your essay's structure, stating its purpose, etc.), you have room to get creative.


For example, if you're writing a thrilling short story about a girl on the run from the law, we might start with some exciting imagery: ""Sirens echoed through the cigarette-burnt walls of the flophouse. Red and blue flashed like paparazzi's cameras on the shower curtain. Sweat mingled with rusty water on the barrel of her gun."" Now this story sounds exciting!
It's also worth noting that your first few sentences can be compelling without being action-packed. Consider the first few lines of J. R. R. Tolkein's The Hobbit: “In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.” This raises intriguing questions right away: What is a hobbit? Why does it live in a hole? The reader has to keep reading to find out!

, Writing in the arena of arts and entertainment (like movie reviews, book reports, etc.) carries fewer rules and expectations than technical writing, but the beginnings of essays written in this style still benefit from an overarching strategy. In these cases, while you can get away with a little playfulness in the beginning of your essay, you'll usually need to take care to ensure that you describe your the overall theme or focus even as you pinpoint small, specific details.


For example, if you're writing a review and analysis of P.T. Anderson's film The Master, you might start like this: ""There's a moment in The Master that's small, but hard to forget. Speaking to his teenage paramour for the very last time, Joaquin Phoenix's naval washout suddenly tears through the window screen that's separating them and embraces the girl in a passionate kiss. It's at once beautiful and perverse, and perfectly emblematic of the twisted depiction of love the film presents."" This opening uses a small, compelling moment from the film to capture the main theme in a compelling way.

, Of course, not all writing can be wild and exciting. Wit and whimsy have no place in the world of serious analytical, technical, and scientific writing. These types of writing exist for practical purposes — to inform relevant individuals about serious, specific topics. Since the purpose of essays written in these topics is to be purely informative (and occasionally persuasive), you should not include jokes, colorful imagery, or anything else that's not directly related to the task at hand.


For instance, if you're writing an analytical essay on the strengths and weaknesses of different methods of protecting metal from corrosion, you might begin like this: ""Corrosion is an electrochemical process by which metals react with their environment and degrade. Since this poses a serious problem to the structural integrity of metal objects and structures, various means of protecting against corrosion have been developed."" This beginning is blunt and to-the-point. No time is wasted on style or flash.
Note that essays written in this style often contain abstracts or summaries before the essay itself which succinctly tell the reader what the essay is about in broad strokes. See How to Write an Abstract for more information.

, Journalistic essay writing differs somewhat from other essay styles. In journalism, there is usually a great effort made to focus on the pure facts of the story, rather than the writer's opinion, so the introductory passages of a journalistic essay tends to be somewhat descriptive, rather than argumentative or persuasive. In serious, objective journalism, writers are often encouraged to put the most important information up front in the very first sentence so that readers can learn the essentials of a story within seconds of reading the headline.


For instance, if you're a journalist tasked with covering a local fire, you might begin our piece like this: ""Four apartment buildings on the 800 block of Cherry avenue suffered a severe electrical fire Saturday night. While there were no fatalities, five adults and a child were rushed to Skyline Hospital for treatment of injuries sustained in the blaze."" By beginning with the bare essentials, you give the majority of the readers the information they want to know immediately.
In the subsequent paragraphs, you can delve into the details and the context surrounding the event so that the readers who stick around can learn more.

, When the time comes to begin their essay, many writers forget that there's no rule that says that you have to write the beginning of the essay first. In fact, it's acceptable to start anywhere in the essay that suits your purpose, including in the middle and the end, so long as you eventually stitch the entire essay together. If you're unsure of how to start or don't even know exactly what your essay is about yet, try skipping the beginning for the time being. You'll eventually need to write it, but once you've written the rest of your essay, you may have a much firmer grasp of your topic.

, Sometimes, even the best writers run out of ideas. If you're having a hard time even getting started with your introduction, try brainstorming. Get a fresh sheet of paper and write down ideas as they come to you in a rapid-fire fashion. These don't necessarily have to be good ideas — sometimes, seeing ideas that you definitely shouldn't use can inspire you to think up ideas that you definitely should use.


You may also want to try a related exercise called free-form writing. When free-form writing, you begin writing anything — absolutely anything — and keep writing sentences in a stream-of-consciousness fashion to get your juices flowing. The end result doesn't have to make sense. If there's a tiny kernel of inspiration in your ramblings, you'll have benefited.

, First drafts that can't be improved in some way by editing and reviewing are rare to nonexistent. A good writer knows never to turn in a piece of writing without going over it at least once or twice. Reviewing and revising allows you to spot spelling and grammar errors, fix portions of your writing that are unclear, omit unnecessary information, and much more. This is especially important for the very beginning of your essay, where otherwise minor errors can reflect negatively upon your the entire work, so be sure to give your essay's beginning a thorough revision.


For example, consider an essay in which the very first sentence contains a small grammar error. Though the error is minor, the fact that it occurs in such a prominent place may lead the reader to assume that the writer is careless or unprofessional. If you're writing for money (or a grade), this is a risk you definitely don't want to take.

, No writer writes in a vacuum. If you're feeling uninspired, try talking to someone whose opinion you respect to get their perspective on the beginning of your essay. Because this other person isn't as invested in your writing as you are, s/he may be able to offer an outsider's point of view, pointing out things that may not have occurred to you precisely because you were focused on writing the perfect beginning to your essay.


Don't be afraid to reach out to teachers, professors, and other individuals who may have assigned you the essay in the first place. Most of the time, these people will take the fact that you're asking for advice as a sign that you take the essay seriously. In addition, because these people will most likely have preconception the final product, they can give you advice that will guide you into writing your essay exactly as they want it.

Write first and edit later.,
Replace phrases with single words.,
Avoid pleonasms, also known as redundancies.,
Remove repetition.,
Look at the voice of your verbs.,
Avoid excessive hedging.,
Avoid words that do not change the meaning of the sentence.,
Proofread your essay several times.,
Avoid becoming overly attached to your writing.",How to Avoid Going Over an Essay Word Limit," If you constantly worry about word limits, you will often end up discarding ideas that add to your paper. Alternatively, consider adding bullet-pointed thoughts as they arise, in order to feel like your writing is expanding rather than contracting.;
, There are always opportunities to say more with less. For example:


Phrasal verbs such as ""ask for"" or ""put up with"" can often be replaced with single verbs such as ""request"" or ""tolerate"".
Replace ""at the same time"" with ""simultaneously"" and ""by the same token"" with ""similarly"".
The adverb ""immediately"" can be used in lieu of phrases such as ""right now"" and ""as soon as"".
Replace full clauses such as ""It is clear that"" and ""It should be obvious that"" with single adverbs such as ""clearly"", ""obviously"" or ""evidently"".
A sentence with ""the reason why... is that..."" can be rewritten with just the conjunction ""because"". For example: ""The reason why ice floats is that..."" becomes simply: ""Ice floats because...""

,


For example, ""off of"" is always non-standard in written English and it's redundant, except when used with a gerund phrasal verb and ""off"" is part of the phrasal verb. ""Off of the floor"" and ""Get off of me"" are wordy, but ""off of"" is proper when ""off"" is part of a gerund with the article ""the"": ""the breaking off of rock."" This is proper because you would also write, in a different situation, ""the breaking of rock.""
Sentences such as ""Where is she going to?"" and ""Where is the house at?"" have unnecessary prepositions, since they do not have to be overt if they aren't followed by the object in these constructions.

, Try to make each of your points just once. Making your point effectively and succinctly the first time eliminates the need to repeat yourself. This takes practice but it's a skill worth honing; you'll appreciate this skill throughout your life.

, Try writing a sentence in the active voice and then in the passive (or vice versa). See which reads better, has the emphasis that you need, and uses fewer words (but see warnings below about passive voice). Do not automatically assume that the active voice is more concise than the passive. Sentences that omit the agent (the “by so-and-so” phrase) usually use the same number words or even save words. In scientific writing, the passive voice can be used to achieve objectivity without adding words to the sentence. For example:


I administered propylthiouracil to rats in drinking water. (eight words)
Propylthiouracil was administered to rats in drinking water. (eight words)
When the agent is more than one word long, the passive voice is even more concise than the active.

, You sometimes have to qualify statements, especially when discussing theories, predictions, allegations or correlations. Avoid using multiple forms of the same hedging in a sentence.


There is a chance that the man might possibly come today.
The man might come today.
""I think that"" is often an unnecessary form of hedging because your name appears at the top of your page; what you say is clearly your opinion. In a sentence that begins with ""I think that,"" the reason for the person's argument is simply ""I think that."" Instead of writing, ""I think that,"" give the reason why you think so.
I think that variable A will increase variable B.
Variable A will likely increase variable B because....

, Unnecessary words like ""Actually"", ""Really"" or ""Basically"" can be omitted.

, When you first wrote your essay, you might have used too many words without realizing it. This is where crammers and procrastinators can lose out — leaving your essay until the last minute prevents time to reread it and remove the superfluous words, phrases and ideas. (However, some argue that it is only by leaving things till the last minute that they manage not to be verbose!) However, most people benefit from rereading with a red pen without the added pressure of getting the writing done.


Have a peer or friend with good word sense check your work and help remove the unnecessary additions. A neutral set of eyes can often prove more helpful in spotting repetition.
Sleep on it. Time helps you to see errors and repetition. If you complete the essay 24–48 hours before the due time, this gives you time to put it aside and come back to it. In the rereading, you're bound to find redundancy.

, Knowing what to cut is an important characteristic of good writers. Ask yourself: ""Would I want to wade through this? Is it written engagingly and is it to the point?"" If you answer no, then you might have discovered that you're not being direct and communicating well with your audience. Keep the ideas somewhere else for another essay or for free writing inspiration.

Learn the six basic parts of the classical oration model.Classical oration survives today through Cicero’s (106 BC - 46 BC) De Inventione — a manual for how to argue.,
Invite the reader into your argument in the introduction.,
Provide background information in the statement of facts.,
Break down your argument in your thesis.Depending on how complex and long your argument is, your thesis might be one sentence or two to three sentences.,
Show the readers the evidence for your claim in the proof.These are the body paragraphs of your argument.,
Refute the counterargument.After you've laid out your own argument, you should address the opposition position.,
Synthesize your argument in the conclusion.In the conclusion, you should transition back from your refutation of the counterargument into a restatement of your own argument.,
Begin by outlining your essay.,
Fill out your outline.For each point in your outline, fill in the important information that will jog your memory when writing the essay.,
Write your topic sentences into your outline.The first sentence of each paragraph is called the ""topic sentence,"" and it serves as a thesis for the paragraph.,
Use the outline to write your essay.,
Decide when to correct errors.,
Proofread your essay before submitting it.",How to Answer Essay Type Questions in Literature Examinations," Cicero was a philosopher, a lawyer, a statesman — in short, a man who spent a lot of time arguing. Cicero's six-part structure still influences how we argue, whether we've heard of him or not. It’s engrained in our Western culture. The six parts of the classical oration model are:


Introduction (exordium)

Statement of Facts (narratio)

Thesis (partitio)

Proof (confirmatio)

Refutation (refutatio)

Conclusion (peroratio)

The introduction, statement of facts, and thesis are often grouped together in the first paragraph of the answer.;
, Though we call it the introduction now, Cicero's Latin for this first section of the paper was ""exordium."" This ancient word shares a root with the modern word ""exhort,"" which means ""to urge forward.""To capture the spirit of what Cicero advised in opening an argument, you should use the introduction to urge the reader forward into your paper. Many arguments open with an interesting fact or quote — a ""hook"" to grab the reader's attention. Explain why the subject of this answer is so important. Your goal here is to make the reader care enough to want to keep reading.


Another way to think of the exordium is to consider where the word ""introduction"" comes from. The prefix ""intro"" means ""inward,"" as in introspection (looking inward). ""Duction"" comes from the latin root ""ducere,"" which means ""to lead."" This is where we get the modern words duke (one who leads) and orchestra conductor (one who leads together).In the introduction, you want to intro + duce, or lead the reader inward, further into your argument.

, In this section, you give readers all the information they need to understand the subject of your argument. For example, if your readers have never read To Kill a Mockingbird, they won't be able to follow your analysis of the mockingbird symbol. You must first provide a short summary of what the book's about, so they can follow your nuanced argument.


If your reader already knows the background information, you may be able to skip this section.
In Cicero's Latin, this section was called the ""narratio,"" which is where we get the modern word ""narrator."" The narrator is the voice in a book that gives readers information that can't be delivered through dialogue or action.
The word ""knowledge"" itself shares a root with narration: gnoscere.In this section, you give the readers the knowledge they need to follow your argument.

, If this is a short-answer question, the thesis should be a single sentence. If you have three hours to answer this question, it might be two or three sentences. A thesis statement does three things: 1) state your claim/stance; 2) state the key issues you will discuss to support that claim/stance; and 3) provide the order in which those issues will be covered. A good model for the thesis is: I will argue through an analysis of X, Y, and Z. You must address points X, Y, and Z in this exact order.


Cicero's Latin word, partitio, shares a root with the modern word ""partition,"" which means division or separation. When Beyonce sings ""Driver roll up the partition, please,"" she's asking the driver to roll up the window that separates him from the passengers in the back.
So the thesis is where you list out the different parts of your argument — your X, Y, and Z — in list form, separately.

, In shorter answers, the number of body paragraphs can correspond with the number of points in your thesis. If you offered an X, a Y, and a Z, you can discuss each element in a single, brief paragraph. In longer, more advanced essay questions, though, you should feel free to spend as many paragraphs as you need on each point of analysis. If the question asks for external sources, you want to use them in your body paragraphs as the supporting evidence for your claim. Fill your body paragraphs with as many supporting quotes and statistics from credible sources as you need to prove your point.


Note that it's not enough to just list a bunch of quotes and statistics from sources. That's not making an argument — it's restating someone else's information or argument.
The sources you use should only be used to support your own argument. Most of what you write in the body paragraphs should be your own thoughts on the subject.

, Doing so demonstrates that you're knowledgeable on the subject and you know what the people who disagree with you are arguing. It also shows that you're not scared of a fight: your argument is so strong that you can give dissents a voice in your paper without worrying they have a better argument than you. Most importantly, though, you want to demonstrate that you can dismantle the counterargument with your analysis and evidence.


Don't include a counterargument without refuting it. To refute means to ""beat back.""The only reason you include the opposing point of view is to beat it back and strengthen your own position.

, But you should do more than just reword your thesis. At this point, your readers will have read all the evidence you provided. Now, you can explain to them how X, Y, and Z work together to actually prove your claim/stance. You might note that in the thesis you state your points, and in the conclusion you explain how they fit together as a whole.


Do not transition into your conclusion with a signal phrase like ""in conclusion"" or ""in summary."" Find a less obvious, more sophisticated transition.

, Now that you understand how the different parts of your argument work together, you can begin sketching out your ideas. You may be tempted to skip the work of outlining your paper and jumping right into the paper. You should know, though, that this doesn't save you any time. When you outline your ideas, you'll be able to actually write your essay much more quickly than you would without an outline.


Create a bullet point for each point you choose to make in your paper.
Your first point should include the introduction, statement of facts, and thesis.
You should break up the “proof” or body paragraphs into however many points you laid out in your thesis. If you promised three points, create three bullet points. If you promised four points, create four bullet points. Remember that the body paragraphs must follow the exact order of the thesis.
Create a point for the statement of the counterargument. You can either create a new point/paragraph for your refutation of it, or keep it all in one paragraph by making the refutation a subpoint.
Create a point for the conclusion.

, You don't have to write in full sentences or flesh ideas out in detail — just jot down whatever you need to keep you on track when you're lost in your sentences later.


If you're using external sources, you should include them in your outline. You don't want to accidentally leave out a great source because you got caught up in the writing and forgot about it.

, A thesis tells you the scope of what will be argued in the whole paper. A topic sentence tells you the scope of what will be argued in the paragraph. But the topic sentence does more than just point forward to what its paragraph will discuss. It also reaches back to create a smooth transition from the previous paragraph. Transitions can be difficult when you’re in the middle of the essay. When looking at an outline, you can see how all the pieces fit together.


Use transition words like furthermore, similarly, or indeed to transition between agreeing ideas. Use ""conflict"" transition words and phrases to transition between conflicting ideas — like the counterargument and your refutation of it. Examples include however, in contrast, on the other hand, or conversely.

, If you put some thought into your outline, you should be able to follow it line by line to create the content of your essay. Even with a strong outline, you may have trouble getting the writing process started. Especially if the exam is timed, just start writing, even if you think it's terrible.If you just sat there staring into space, you wouldn't have anything down at all. This way, at least you have something to show, and you can always delete the bad material when you find your way to stronger language and points.


Make sure to refer back to your outline repeatedly during the writing process. This is the roadmap of your answer. Don't wander away from it and get off-course.

, Think about what the exam is testing. Are you being tested on your analysis or on your ability to write? The answer to this question will determine how much effort you should put into editing your sentences as you go.


If you're being graded primarily on the content of your argument, leave grammar and spelling editing for your last step.
If you're being graded primarily on your grammar and spelling, by all means, correct your errors as you go!
In most cases, you won't be graded on one or the other. Keep your specific teacher or standardized test in mind. Have a strategy for when you plan to correct your errors before you take the test.

, Hopefully, you have time left over when you finish writing your essay, before you have to turn it in. Use this time wisely. Even if you're sick of working on the answer and you just want to be done with it, use this time to proofread your writing.


If you're in an isolated room, read the essay aloud to yourself to look for grammar errors that sound wrong. It's easier to hear mistakes than see them on the page.Read your sentences backwards to look for spelling errors you might skim over if you were reading the sentences normally."

Know the sources.,
Understand grey water.,
Understand how government initiatives encourage rainwater collection.,
Consider collecting water from plants.,
Gather condensation using a tarp and a container.,
If you collect rainwater or water from another source in a survival situation, never assume it is drinkable.",How to Collect Water1," There are many ways to collect water, and some are more accessible or sanitary than others. Consider the following places from which people often draw their water:


Rainfall: You can collect and store rainwater. It is usually pure enough for drinking, cooking, and bathing. Beware, however, of the chemical contaminants in ""acid rain.""
Groundwater: You can collect water from underground using a tube well or a pump machine. This is usually pure water, although chemicals and bacteria can seep into the water table and contaminate this source.
From a lake or pond: you can collect water from ponds, but this water is not usually potable. It must be purified before drinking. You can, however, use it for watering or irrigation purposes.
From a river/canal/sea: This water can be used for irrigation. This is big source of all water of our daily use.
Water from air: By applying new technology we can get collected water from air. This may be a very small amount, but it could be useful in some circumstances.;
, Water collection can be done in a variety of ways, but the one thing in common that they all have is that the water in categorized as grey water. Grey water is water that has contaminants but may not be necessarily toxic, however it does need to be filtered and processed before it is classified as clean. This grey water can be distinguished further by where it comes from and the one that is most suitable for collection is rain water.


Apart from standard outside water use, grey water can also be used in cooling your house and filtration for more drinking water.

, Reports on water management in various locations should be able to highlight most viable and economic ways to tap and harvest water for use.This includes plans on how to achieve water collection through demonstrative projects confirming the same. Some initiatives includes:


Roof catchments: This can be done on schools, public offices, etc. However, a monitoring plan should be put in place regarding quality, and on the amount of water harvested and used.
Storm water storage and urban parks: Stormwater storage can be developed in a mid-sized urban park to harvest storm water for use during dry seasons after being treated and also for fire fighting not forgetting urban agriculture.
Reclamation of waste-water: The possibility of reuse of waste-water should be considered, e.g for irrigation purposes.

, If you're running out of water and you're around plants, take a plastic bag and tie it around a leafy branch. Make sure that there are no holes in the bag! When plants release water through their leaves in the hot sun, it gathers and pools, and the plastic bag catches some water. Give it some time—maybe a couple of hours.


You can also wait overnight and gather some water from the morning dew. Try finding a smooth, light surface—like a large plastic board—so that the dew can simply slide off into a leak-proof container.

, First, dig a shallow pit in the ground. Then fill it with any vegetation you can find. Put the water-holding container in the center of the pit, then cover everything with the tarp or other waterproof cover. You will want the cover's lowest point to be in the center, over the container. Water will evaporate from the plants, condense on the tarp, and drip into the container, giving you something to drink in the morning.

, Rainwater may often carry chemicals or pesticides from nearby fields or plants, and may also have bacteria or parasites in it. To avoid this, boil the water for about 5 minutes.

Donate.,
Go to Freerice.,
Donate money to the World Food Programme (WFP).,
Recycle.,
Hang on to your trash.,
Reduce vehicle pollution.,
Be a power saver.,
Try motivational speaking.,
Keep in mind - two major resources you have for changing the world are your voice and creativity.",How to Change the World (As a Kid/Teen)," Donations can vary from time to time. You may find yourself in a charity shop donating all your old clothes/shoes/toys or you could simply find yourself putting all your loose change inside a money box outside a charity shop. You don't have to do extreme things like for example donating blood if you're definitely not 100 percent sure about it. Do what you feel comfortable with doing. Money that is donated to charity is usually used to help those that are in poverty or that need a little extra care.;
, It's at: www.freerice.com. Select a category in which you would like to be quizzed. Answer the questions correctly––for every correct answer, you donate 10 grains of rice to someone in need.

, This is useful any time, or during disaster recovery, such as after droughts or typhoons.

, You've most likely heard about it and you might even do it yourself. However, you may want to recycle even more. If you've finished drinking a bottle of water and you're definitely sure that you're not going to use it again, recycle it.


You can recycle many things, quite a few things are: Paper, Glass (may vary from place to place), Cardboard and plastic. You can talk to your current Recycle plan company to find out even more information.

, Time after time you may have found yourself in a position where you have littered. Littering contributes to polluting the planet and is quite hazardous to the people and animals around us. If there aren't any nearby bins, hold on to your rubbish until you find one.


If your rubbish is recyclable, recycle it. You don't have to pick up other people's litter if you don't want to but if you feel that you should then go ahead but take caution; you don't know where it's been, who/what's touched it and what it may have been previously used for.

, It's not only a waste of gas/patrol to drive to a nearby destination but it's also polluting our environment. If your parents (considering you're a kid/teen) offer to drive you school, politely decline their offer and walk instead.


If your journey isn't walkable, you might want to take a bus/train instead. However, it may be best just to let your parents drive you if you don't like to use public transport.

, Ever found yourself in a position where you seem to have run out of space to plug something in? First of all, if you're not using an electrical powered object, turn it off and then unplug it. It's not necessary to have all the sockets occupied at once.


If you straighten your hair every morning, for example, then you might want to change that. Not only are you wasting energy but you're damaging your hair. It's also best to avoid over-charging your laptop, for example, if you use one, because they do take quite a while to charge depending on your performance plan. Another example would be if you use a computer and you find yourself bored whilst you're on it.
A good idea would be to turn it off and consider finding another activity to keep yourself occupied. Also, never leave your computer/laptop on overnight, in that situation, you're not only wasting energy but you're over-heating your computer/laptop and you could increase the chances of a house fire.

, Motivational speakers can have their ideas and beliefs heard and some have been known to have an impact on the world as a whole. You may not want to stand in the middle of your local park and you most definitely don't want to preach too much.


A suggestion could be you recording yourself talking about any kind of problem/issue that there is in the world and uploading it to YouTube. If you're lucky, you may just get the right attention.
Don't give up if it takes time to gain interested listeners or make changes. You could alternatively want to change something and/or address a problem within your local borough by discussing things with your local governor/mayor. It may take a while to grab their direct attention but every effort can lead you at least somehow.
Make sure you seem professional with what ever you choose to do. No one will listen to someone who is speaking in slang or comes across as aggressive and too demanding.

, What do you believe in, and what ideas do you have to improve the lives of others or the environment?


Starting a project or advocacy campaign can be difficult, so the most important step is to share your ideas with someone who can support you and hold you accountable.

Stay true to what you are.,
Maintain your history.,
Give old buildings new life.,
Don't forget the long time businesses.,
Remember historic businesses with new venues: One of Old West Fort Worth’s legendary bars was the White Elephant Saloon, opened in 1884 closer to downtown than to the Stockyards proper.,
Find ways to relive and honor the past.,
Remember who you are.",How to Change a Working District Into a Tourist Attraction," That means stay true to your history. The stockyards and Fort Worth were almost interchangeable terms in the Old West. Fort Worth, which was established as an Army outpost in 1849, was the last stop for ""civilization"" on the Chisholm Trail for cattle drives before crossing into Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) on their way to market in Abilene, Kansas. Soon the town became known as ""Cowtown,"" one the city embraced. The cattle drives camped in the area that later became the stockyards.;
, In other words, make your past your present. With the arrival of the railroad Fort Worth became a cattle market. The stockyards were built to accommodate that market. Some of the maze of pens and walkways used to herd the livestock remains in place today. Some of these pens feature specialty shops such as artist galleries, Texas souvenirs and memorabilia, restaurants, and even a winery; another section is the Cowtown Cattlepen Maze. The steam-engine-driven Tarantula Railroad runs more than 20 miles (32 km) between the stockyards and the town of Grapevine, giving riders a taste of travel when the stockyards – and the Old West – were booming. And, feeding on America’s continued romance with the Old West, the Stockyards today offer daily cattle drives of Longhorn cattle known as the “Fort Worth Herd” and gunfight reenactments.

, The question for many cities becomes what to do with the old buildings that otherwise might fall into urban blight. As the stockyard fell into disuse in the years after Armour and Co. and Swift and Co. meat packers, wooed to the city around the turn of the 20th Century, closed their meat-packing operations by 1971, the Fort Worth Stockyards National Historic District was established. North Side Coliseum, built in the early 1900s to house a rodeo and other events in the Stockyards area, became the Cowtown Coliseum where cowboys still ride bucking horses, rope cattle, ride bulls and participate in other rodeo events. A massive open-air cattle barn for livestock built in 1910 was used for the Southwestern Exposition and Fat Stock Show, which began in the stockyards and continues today as the Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo at the Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum complex across town. The cattle barn, which was enclosed with a tower added in 1936 as a Texas Centennial project, became a major player in the Stockyards’ transformation into a tourist draw when Billy Bob’s Texas, which bills itself as the “World’s Largest Honky-Tonk,” opened in 1979. The massive bar with Texas-sized dance floor can accommodate about 6,000 guests at one time and hosts Country-Western concerts. It also features a bull-riding arena in what originally was a 1,200-seat livestock auction arena.

, Billy Bob’s may have been a good shot in the arm, but a number of businesses in the Fort Worth Stockyards National Historic District remain mainstays, some more than a century after they started. The Stockyards Hotel, which bills itself as “The Old West at its Best,” was built in 1907, when the Stockyards were among the nation’s busiest livestock centers. As the hotel’s website says, “Cowboys and cattle barons, kings and queens of country music, even an outlaw or two have found refuge and romance at the Stockyards Hotel.” Those with a hankering for a pair of homemade western boots can visit M.L. Leddy’s, a family-owned business that offers handmade western boots, which began in West Texas in 1922 and moved to the Stockyards area in 1941. The Cattlemen’s Steak House opened in 1947 and quickly became a Fort Worth favorite.

, That bar, which also featured gambling, housed one of the city’s more infamous shootouts, between Luke Short, who had worked with Wyatt Earp, and former city marshal Timothy Courtright, known locally as “Long-haired Jim,” on Feb. 8, 1887, that left Courtright dead. The business faltered in the early 1900s. In 1976 the name was resurrected on a new bar inside the Stockyards district and about two miles north of the original. (Gambling and gunplay are frowned upon today, unless the gunplay is during a reenactment of the Short-Courtright battle held every Feb. 8.)

, Besides watching a cattle drive or gunfight reenactment and riding a steam-engine-powered trains, visitors to the Stockyards today can also ride a horse-drawn carriage or stagecoach; go horseback riding; or stroll along the Texas Trail of Fame, taking in the 98-acre district's many shops, restaurants, bars and shops where they can have a Texas-sized margarita or eat a Texas-sized steak. They may tour the Livestock Exchange Building - once known as the ""Wall Street of the West"" - that houses the North Fort Worth Historical Society Museum, the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame,Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame, and the Stockyards Museum.

, The stockyards are not high-tech. But they are, as one user-contributor to Yahoo Travel put it, ""A true Texas experience!"" That contributor wrote: ""If you want a Texas experience but has only time to go to one place in Texas, this is it! This place has it all – cowboys, railroads, western music, cattle drives, Old West architecture, and all the Texas souvenirs you may be looking for.” But when you take part in the experience, be sure to watch where you step – especially after one of the cattle drives. Otherwise you might carry a whiff of that scent we used to cover our noses from half a century earlier.

Explain that scientists have measured increasing temperatures and CO2 levels in several ways if skeptics argue that the only real evidence for global warming is CO2 in ice core samples where it's very cold.,
Explain that human's recent contribution to the total levels of CO2 has offset the natural process and have caused the world to warm if skeptics argue that the total human-produced CO2 levels are small compared to natural sources.,
Explain the importance of offsetting human contributions to the atmospheric CO2 levels as opposed to eliminating CO2 if skeptics argue that greenhouse gases are some of the most vital elements of this planet that keep it in order.,
Explain that the wavelength at which solar radiation passes through the atmosphere is not same as the infrared radiation Earth radiates back into space if skeptics argue that the very notion of the greenhouse effect is flawed because UV rays from the sun penetrating the CO2 in the first place ought to be able to escape.,
Explain that troposphere temperatures have been rising .22 to .4° F per decade since 1979 if skeptics argue that the troposphere, the area that would be the hottest if greenhouse gases were causing climate change, is relatively cool.",How to Challenge People About Global Warming Theories," Research with ice cores has revealed that the increases in temperature seen in the last twenty years would be expected to take place over several thousand years. Scientists can measure historical levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature over thousands of years from ice core samples, but this is not the only way. The most obvious and direct way of measuring temperature directly is with thermometers, but weather balloons and satellites are also being used to monitor temperature. Atmospheric CO2 is measured with sensitive equipment as well as flask samples. CO2 can also be measured in seawater. The overall trend of CO2 is that it has been increasing since the Industrial Revolution. Coupled with historical data, contemporary measurements, and computer models, CO2 is shown to have a strong correlation with recent warming.;
, It is estimated that if humans were not present, ninety-five percent of CO2 emissions would still occur. However, natural emissions are balanced by other natural processes that absorb CO2, such as plants and oceans. Additionally, CO2 causes heating through the greenhouse effect even in small quantities. CO2 has a long atmospheric lifetime. Once released, it can stay in the atmosphere for 200-450 years.

, Oceans and volcanoes help produce the atmosphere on a planet. CO2 and other greenhouse gases are vital to our existence on this planet. Explain that we do not want to remove all the CO2 from the atmosphere. It's estimated Earth would be 30° C (54° F) colder without CO2, making Earth uninhabitable. However, too much CO2 can harm the Earth.

, The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824.Greenhouse gases, such as CO2, hinder the process of allowing radiation to reflect back into space. This is the greenhouse effect.

, The troposphere is warming, just like the land temperatures.

Understand the legality.,
Know how to use rainwater.,
Collect rainwater using a gutter system.",How to Collect Water2," Rain collection is legal in most states, but more and more are edging towards outlawing this practice. Might be best to just ""do it"" and let the government agency that cares find out on their own. If you ask the government beforehand, you will likely get a ""no."" You can if you pay collection fees, get your system inspected, and follow any local procedures. Many off-grid homeowners set up a rain catchment system for all their water needs.


The main idea here is to reduce your water use. Avoid washing your car, minimally water your lawn or shrubs, and practice alternative methods of waste disposal.

, Rainwater is very soft water—great for clothes-washing, bathing, hair shampoo, etc. You can get a simple ceramic cartridge filter (""candle filter"") gravity flow system to filter this water and use it for drinking and cooking with no harmful issues. Be careful about collecting rainwater you live in a highly toxic or dense urban area.

, Run gutters around the larger areas of your house or barn, or carport and pipe into a tank. Even a 50 gallon drum will do, but that's not very much water for all the cost of guttering and some piping. You can find 500-800 gallon plastic tanks new for around $500 if you shop online—but be aware of high shipping costs. Just look online for these sellers in your area.


A good rule of thumb is: if you have a one thousand square-foot roof area and have it all guttered and piped into a rain holding tank, you should gather 600 gallons from a 1"" rainfall event.
Metal roofs are best, but shingle roofs can work fine.
Most folks will design in a ""first flush"" device that routes the first 20 or so gallons of run-off into a separate small tank. This ""first flush"" rainwater will contain dust, bird droppings, small leaves, etc that you don't want to get into your main holding tank. But if not, these items will settle to the bottom of your holding tank and won't be a big problem.
Most rain tanks have a 2"" threaded hole on one side just above the bottom of the tank, so you can attach a hose, or a pump to pump for a distance uphill. You can gravity feed from the bottom of the main tank into your system for garden watering. You can also use a small 12 volt electric, ""on demand"" pump. Think about how to protect this pump and piping if you live in a cold climate.

Find a place to store the water that you collect to keep it from spoiling.,
Know how much water you can and should collect.,
Always remember to purify your water.",How to Collect Water3," Always use new, food-grade tanks. If you buy one used, make sure you trust the seller as to what was stored in the tank. You don't want to store your water in a barrel that previously held gasoline, transmission fluid, or another potentially-toxic chemical.

, Determine how much water you need to collect, depending on zoning restrictions and your water needs. Depending on the climate that you live in, a smaller system might be more effective than others.


For example: if you want to water a garden and you have no restrictions on having a collection system, then you might just want to have some 20-40 gallon drums with a spigot at the bottom. Support the drums with cinder blocks. You can hook this up to standard rain gutter collection system).
If you want to be more ambitious—say, a water feature and then some—then you will need: a larger container to accommodate the larger amount of water (or many small containers that make a large system); better supports (a small, reinforced slab); a larger amount of area covered for to gather water; and some pumps.

, You can use iodine tablets, boiling, or other purification methods.

If you are a boy, try the dark shades of green and blue, or the light ones. Baggy pants are an Earth-Boy favourite! Also, collars can rock the look!
Maybe an earthy slogan like ""Save Our Trees"" on a shirt looks good, and all Earth-Boys dig jumpers. Wool is a great pattern, and many like to knit socks out of them. Try hats or caps! No bright colors or neons!
If you are a girl, there are two earth styles for you, so choose which one shows your type of earthy. The first is casual. Bright blue and green, with splashes of pink and yellow look fantastic. Skirts and pants alike are good, and cardigans in a neon colour looks great on any Earth Girl. The second type is dark. This is similar to the boy style, but girly. Collars and jumpers are still favorites, but girls like to wear knitted cardigans or wooly hats.

You can wear dark greens and browns, and Earth Girls love to wear tights! Plain black shoes with no heels are good. Pimple remover is acceptable, and maybe clear lip balm, to ensure that you look presentable, but do not apply makeup. You are a natural girl, not a fashion horse!



, Give friendly waves, and practice giggling or chuckling (depending on gender). Be seen with many smiles, and don't hold grudges. Have many friends, and don't exclude anybody. Be a great boy or girl, and take care of the little kids. Even respect animals, and pet or wash them. Be a role model for people, and show good manners. Listen to your elders, and respect them. This is what an Earth Kid would do.

, If studying seems hard, get over it and keep trying. If you feel like you will never be popular, don't give in so easily! Work hard to achieve your goals, and fight until you drop! If you are putting a plaster on a little kid, don't leave when you see a disgusting green and black wound. Just stick a plaster, and shrug. It is like climbing a mountain; keep climbing until you reach the top!

, Always be positive about the future, and praise people for their work. If you trip over, that is because you did too much running, so monitor how much you run. If you get a bad grade, that is a chance to improve! If you are bullied, it shows that you are innocent and sweet, what an Earth Kid should be. Even if a kid is crying, they are learning the morals of the world. It is important to know how to cope with the bullying though.

, Don't rush! Most people don't date until they are 13, at least. Don't flirt randomly, stay true to the guy you love! When you have found the one, stand your ground. If he tries to coax you into doing something (drugs, shoplifting, illegal driving etc.), say no firmly. Even if he sounds desperate or angry, if you don't want to, don't do it. Even if he says you are a coward, you aren't. In a relationship, make sure to take things slowly.

, Don't do drugs or drink beer. Be nice to everybody, and give people chances. Always smile at people, even the ones you hate. Be mature; be nice and polite, and respect your mummy and daddy. Don't dress like a chav, or wear anything revealing. This is not innocence! Innocent people don't play pranks; they stick to rules.

, Earth kids don't take things harshly. Tell jokes and make silly faces, and brighten people's days. Lightly tease people, and joke around. Sarcastic comments are unacceptable - you need to stick to compliments, Ticking a little kid when babysitting can give the playful air that Earth Kids have. Stay polite, though! Don't be weird, just fun!

, Aim for A's and B's, although the occasional C is totally acceptable! Study hard and be an avid reader. Do your homework every night, and if you want to make it more fun, put hearts or stars on the i's and j's. Raise your hand to many things, and keep trying to answer things until the day is over!

, Don't find war or guns cool; find them terrible, and make sure not to buy guns. Don't make your hobbies hunting or boxing! Try swimming, flower picking, football, tennis, mushroom picking, badminton, horse riding, cooking, acting or singing! Many Earth Kids find this fun, and do these hobbies often. They encourage peace, too!

, If you really want to perfect the art, get the Earth Kid tone. For girls, sound high and fragile, yet soft and pretty. No edges, though! For boys, have a high yet deep voice, that sounds poetic and inspirational. Sing on an average basis, but not in school! Make your own songs and flaunt them!

, Some include Anne of Green Gables, Charlotte's Web, Holes, and other books of your liking! Be smart, and talk about these books often!

], It is important to have good eating habits.

Be persistent.",How to Become an Environmentalist," There are a seemingly unlimited number of interconnected environmental issues out there for you to tackle. Through environmental activism, you can help protect endangered species, clean up pollution, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, encourage conscious usage of resources, help the shift toward renewable energy, restore native landscapes, protect the rainforest, promote sustainable dietary habits, reduce landfill waste, establish recycling programs, or any number of other good deeds. Find out what calls to you. In particular, look for environmental issues in your local region and groups you can get involved in.

, There are a variety of ways to be a committed environmentalist, each of which caters to different sets of talents. Are you a people person? Consider becoming a docent and leading nature walks at your local park. Or perhaps you're an introverted writer? You might prefer writing letters to congresspeople about your issues of concern from the comfort of your own home. Can you play the banjo, bake banana bread, paint faces, or juggle? Volunteer at a local Earth Day fair or environmental fundraiser. Just about any skill can be used to contribute to environmental awareness campaigns.

, Read books and magazines and visit websites about nature's beauty or environmental science. Take as many notes as you can. Figure out what your favorite animal or plant is. A good place to start is National Geographic.

, Certain people have become leaders in the environmentalist community and serve as figureheads for other environmentalists. Write or email people famous for being environmentalists, such as Jane Goodall or Jeff Corwin, about any questions you may have. Different environmentalists will have different areas of expertise - for instance, Jane Goodall is an expert on primate society, while Jeff Corwin is a good choice if you want to know more about a certain animal.

, Environmentalists have an appreciation for natural beauty. Try to foster this appreciation with activities that allow you to experience this beauty first hand. At the park or sanctuary, spot wildlife and take notes on their behavior, size, population, etc. Talk to the people who work there about them. Keep a notebook of activities.

, Litter is everywhere. It can be found on roadsides, at big outdoor events, and in busy places, such as gas stations. Litter sullies the planet's natural beauty and can even harm and kill wildlife. Help keep our home and environment clean by picking litter up and disposing of it properly. Left on the ground, litter may eventually end up in the ocean or in an animal's stomach.

, Environmentalist movements are most successful when they are socially active and community-centered. You might, for instance, make an endangered animal club at your school, organize an Earth Day rally, or teach a workshop on composting. To make the biggest difference you can, get out there and start making allies!

, Warriors for environmental justice must keep their most important weapon - their mind - as sharp as possible to be effective activists. Activists may need to debate supporters of industrial capitalism and/or sway undecided moderates, both of which will require convincing knowledge and persuasive rhetoric. Try to read environmentalist publications and stay abreast of relevant news so that you're knowledgeable and well-informed when it counts.


For starters, try to read books such as Endgame by Derrick Jensen to familiarize yourself with why industrial society itself, rather than individual consumer choices, is the root of most environmental problems. Once you've read books like this and wish to proceed to more radical material, you can move on to books that actually lay out a strategy for dismantling key parts of industrial infrastructure (such as refineries, interstates, electrical infrastructure). One great example of this kind of book is Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet. For extreme environmentalists, some select U.S. military strategy manuals, such as Counterinsurgency, can help illuminate the methods by which the capitalist system will attempt to defend itself from radical environmentalist movements.;
, The goal of an activist is not to change modern industrial society on his or her own, but to build wide grassroots support for serious, radical reform. To begin, try sharing your new stance with your friends and family. See what they think about doing whatever it takes to save the planet and gauge whether or not they would be willing to make sacrifices to preserve the planet that gives them the air, water, and food they need to survive. If so, you have found your first supporters.


Next, you might try attending local political forums, street fairs, and the like to share your ideas with a larger audience. Be prepared for resistance - not everyone will share your love for mother nature.

, Once you've managed to recruit supporters and have formed a core group of dedicated activists, identify people and/or agencies that are facilitating the greatest amount of ecological destruction on a local level. Once these points have been identified, decide amongst your group how best to stop these things from happening - you might try planning protests, gathering signatures for a petition, or a more radical solution.


If you can, directly lobbying politicians may be the most effective way to enact environmental change. The capitalist system encourages politicians to give disproportionate attention to their financial backers at the expense of the larger community and the planet as a whole. Leading a targeted lobbying effort aimed at those in power or, better yet, financially backing a politician with sympathetic environmental beliefs, can be a way to confront the forces of industrial capitalism on their own playing field.

, If you haven't had immediate success recruiting a group of committed environmentalists to help you with the struggle against the industrial economy, do not fear. It will take time, patience, and hard work to gain enough solid supporters to start to enact change. The struggle against global industry lasts as long as it takes to end the exploitation and pollution carried out against the planet Earth every day.


Environmentalist literature can be a recruiting tool and a morale-booster for already-committed environmentalists. Hold discussion groups to review the material in books like Deep Green Resistance and Endgame. Screen resistance-oriented films such as End:Civ or The Wind that Shakes the Barley to grow the spirit of resistance in viewers. Pass out educational flyers that show that industrial civilization is the root of environmental destruction. If you have the time, resources, and energy, you might even want to organize a speaking tour to educate people about being a real environmentalist.

Turn Off your screen saver.,

Have you got an item which you don't need?,
Is it usable?,
Use only products that were NOT examined on animals.,
Reduce the amount of Meat and leather you buy.,
Have you got one of those re-usable canvas bags?",How to Be Environmentally Friendly with Ease," Screen Savers were originally an application used to avoid a static picture from being branded on the screen. However, nowadays' screens don't suffer of that problem, which makes Screen Savers unnecessary- And keeping your screen active wastes energy. Instead of the screen saver, apply the option of Shutting Off Screen after five minutes of being unused, so no energy will be wasted on it while it isn't being used.;
, Black doesn't demand pixels to be activated- Which means there's less energy used for this aim. Seriously, you don't practically NEED for a wallpaper- It is merely an extra, that does not justify the waste.

, Not only they waste way less energy, they also last much longer than heat bulbs. Nowadays you could find Fluorescent with a warm, pleasant light that look just like heat bulbs, so nobody would notice the difference except for your Energy bills.


Make sure to dispose of fluorescent bulbs correctly. They contain Mercury, and thus need to be separated and disposed of along with toxic waste such as batteries. See How to Dispose of Hazardous Waste.

,, They add more oxygen to the air and breath Co2, which means a less polluted air. If you don't have a green thumb, choose something that is rather easy to case. ""Lucky Bamboo"" or Aloe are especially good for that, since they demand nearly no attention. If possible, grow more than one plant.

, This way you'll enjoy more of daylight and won't need for electric lights.

, Before throwing it away, think-, If the answer is Yes, consider handing it to a second hand store or donate it. This way there will be no need to produce another similar item for the use of somebody else.


Is its material usable? If the answer is Yes, consider recycling- Either by changing the item's purpose, or by handing to material-recycling.
Is it organic? If the answer is Yes, separate it from the rest of your trash and give away all your organic trash to someone who has a composter. Or consider getting one yourself. Using organic trash for composts not only saves materials from being wasted, it actually HELPS plants grow better.

, Seriously. Except for maybe medicines, the rest of examinations are no more than just tormenting animals.

, The Meat/Leather industry causes great pollution, on the top of being terribly wasteful. And of course, you'll reduce animals tormenting.

, Good. Don't get more of them. Ironically, producing them creates more pollution than producing plastic bags. This doesn't mean you should use plastic bags- Just don't get more bags than you actually need.

Start a neighborhood watch.,
Organize a garage sale or block party.,
Try a volunteer clearinghouse.,
Contact your local school.,
Ask at soup kitchens, food banks, and charities.,
Try churches, synagogues, or other places of worship.,
Join your neighborhood council or school board.,
Start a petition.,
Speak out in the community.,
Stand for local election.",How to Get Involved in Your Community," If you’re new to a community, take the time to call on nearby houses to introduce yourself. Tell your new neighbors what led you to the area, where you live, and say a little about your life.Walk up to the door and knock or ring the bell.
If or when someone answers, smile, greet them, and say you’re new to the community.
Say something like, “Hi, my name is Mabel. I just moved in across the street to start a new job in the area and wanted to introduce myself.”
If the neighbor seems friendly, try to engage in a bit of small talk. “How long have you lived on this street? What’s the community like? Is it close-knit?”
On the other hand, go out of your way to meet and greet new members of the community. Take a welcome basket to them and introduce yourself.;
, At first, this may seem strange. You might be from a big city or other place where people don’t interact on the sidewalk. However, there are lots of places where it’s polite or even expected to acknowledge, smile, and say hello to others in public. Do this enough in your neighborhood and chances are you’ll start to recognize others, and be recognized.


Make eye contact when you pass someone on the sidewalk. A visual acknowledgement goes a long way.
If the other person returns your eye contact, smile or nod your head. You can also add a greeting, like “Hello,” “Good afternoon,” or “How are you?” “Nice weather today” is another good one.
Keep in mind that this is really only for one-on-one situations, like when you pass one or two people on the sidewalk or walk past a neighbor’s yard. It doesn’t work well on busy streets.

, Neighborhood watches are groups that work together to prevent crime in local communities. The purpose is a serious undertaking and takes lots of cooperation and planning. It’s a great venue to get to know your neighbors better.First of all, try to recruit interested neighbors to form a planning committee.
Advertise and hold an initial meeting to canvass your other neighbors’ interest. You should also contact your local police department or sheriff’s office and invite a representative to attend.
Establish the aim of the program. For instance, determine what sort of concerns your community has on crime. Ideally, the watch will look out for each other’s families and property and contact police in case of any suspicious activity.
If the response is positive, elect block captains who can mediate between the community and police. Work with local authorities so that members get proper training on home security, crime prevention, and crime reporting. Post signs around the area and establish a means of communication, like a phone tree or a regular newsletter.

, The key thing in getting to know your neighbors is to communicate with them. Try holding a big sale or block party, for example, or anything that will lead to interaction, socialization, and cooperation.


Try a block-wide garage sale. Canvas the community to see who might be interested in contributing items or volunteering to work the sale. Make sure to advertise!
Or, ask around to see whether your neighbors would like to hold a block party. Block parties are great for socializing and don’t require that much work. You can make it a potluck or BYOF affair.
If you’re ambitious, ask the local police about temporarily closing your street for the sale or party. That way, you’ll have much more room to mingle and chat.

, Get in touch with a volunteer clearinghouse like volunteer.gov or the Army Corps of Engineers Clearinghouse to get out and volunteer in the community. These organizations match people with volunteer jobs, after first taking stock of their skills and preferences.Usually, a service like this will interview you. Be prepared to answer questions like, “What are your interests?” “What are your skills,” and “Why do you want to volunteer?”
Oftentimes, you’ll have a second interview once you are matched with a specific job.
You may also have to undergo a background and criminal record check.

, Community schools are a great place to be involved. You can work with neighborhood children, interact with families from the area, and know that you’re making a difference by contributing to kids’ education. Call the school first and ask about possible volunteer opportunities. You might get to work as a recess monitor, shelve books in the school library, or help organize fundraisers.
Be aware that to work at a school you’ll have to have an extensive criminal background check. Often, this involves being fingerprinted.
Keep in mind that in some places convicted felons – no matter the crime – are not allowed to work in schools.
If you have children in school, you might also consider joining the PTA or the local school board. Go to meetings, voice your opinion, and volunteer for activities, committees, and functions.

, Many communities have charities that serve the poor or underprivileged, especially in big cities. Soup kitchens but also food banks, shelters, and clothing banks are non-profit organizations that rely on volunteers. Usually, they’re glad for help.


If you’re a people person, see whether you can do something that involves interaction. This might be working the soup line, making food deliveries, or working as a cashier at a charity thrift store.
Introverts can help, too. You might contribute by stocking the food bank shelves or putting together orders, for example.

, Many religious organizations also do charity work. If you feel comfortable, think of looking up a churches, synagogues, temples, or mosques to find opportunities to be involved in the community.


Religious organizations might do things like house temporary shelters for homeless families, such as Interfaith Hospitality Network.They also might run food and clothing banks, soup kitchens, or clothing drives.
Many religious organizations also organize mission activities to volunteer in under-served communities abroad. Enroll in one of these trips, if you have the inclination.
Keep in mind that while many of these charities are openly religious, some do not allow evangelizing., Does your city have councils and school boards? Some do, and joining is a great way to get politically active in your local community. Neighborhood councils usually meet regularly and may get funds for things like crime prevention, roads, streets, sidewalks, and the creation of safe play spaces. School boards manage the local school system.Talk to people in your area to see if you are served by a neighborhood council. If you don’t know, call the city offices and ask about such bodies, how they operate, and how you can join one.
Consider putting your name up for a school board position. Often representatives are chosen in local elections for a number of years.

, Another way to get politically active in your community is to petition the government. Start a petition drive on an issue that speaks to you. Do you think that the community needs a park? Maybe you are sick of dangerous speeding on your street and want speed bumps installed? Petitions are a way to bring your concerns forward.Pick an issue that you care about. Then, start putting together a formal petition. Usually, a petition will start with words like, “We the undersigned...” You can find many templates online.
For example, a petition on speed bumps could start, “We the undersigned are very concerned with unregulated speeding on X Avenue and advocate speed-bumps to protect pedestrians.”
Take your petition around the neighborhood and knock on doors to collect signatures. Even if some neighbors don’t sign, you will have the chance to inform them on the issue.
If your issue is of wider importance, you can also put the petition online on a site like Change.org and reach a larger, regional audience.

, There are other ways you can advocate on issues in your community besides petitions. Do you have a special interest in a topic like traffic control, community schools, or parks? Think about writing an opinion-editorial piece for a local website or newspaper, or even giving a talk at a community meeting.


Take your issue to the local paper. Call the editorial office and say that you would be interested in writing a short op-ed piece on X issue, which is important to the community.
Do you have expert knowledge on a community topic? You might be able to get an audience to listen. Ask to speak at a city council meeting, at the school board, the PTA, or at a community center.

, Some people who get politically active in the community take the next step: they make involvement a part-time or full-time career and stand for local office. You could run for positions like school board representative, city council member, roads commissioner, or perhaps even mayor. To get these jobs, you’ll usually have to run in an election and win.Pick a job that you find important. If education is your passion, start with the school board. If you are sick and tired of poor roads, perhaps the roads commission is for you.
Prepare yourself. Standing for election requires a lot of work, so read up on the requirements. You will probably have to file an affidavit of candidacy by a specific date to run, and there may be filing fees and other paper work.
Run a campaign. Local elections are generally small affairs. You likely won’t have a “campaign team,” but still consider doing some publicity. Canvass door-to-door to get your name out, invest in yard signs, or try, again, to write an op-ed in the local paper.

Save electricity.,
Find alternatives to driving.,
Eat locally grown food.,
Understand the manufacturing process of the products you buy.,
Join a group working to stop air pollution.",How to Be Greener1," Conserving electricity in your home is an easy way to start being greener right away. Electricity-powered lights, appliances and more are require the use of energy that is generated at power plants that pollute the air. Most plants burn fossil fuel or coal and release emissions that make the air less clean. Here are ways you can help today:Turn off your lights when they aren't in use.
Turn off and unplug appliances and electronics when you aren't using them.
Use energy saving lightbulbs and appliances.
Lower your thermostat in the winter, and use less air conditioning in the summer. Insulating your home helps you heat and cool it more efficiently, too.;
, Cars play a big part in polluting the air. The processes of manufacturing cars, fueling them, and building roads for them to drive on all pollute the air in different ways. The best way you can help is to be less reliant on cars as your main mode of transportation. Here's what you can do:Take public transportation. Use your local bus, subway or train instead of driving where you need to go.
Try biking. Many towns are building bike lanes to make it easier and safer to commute by bike.
Try walking where you want to go. It takes more time, but it's the greenest option available. Any place you can drive or bike to within five or ten minutes should also be walkable.
Carpool to work or school.

, Food often has to travel a long way to reach the shelves of your grocery store. It may have spent time on ships, planes and trucks, not to mention your car, before it finally lands on your plate. Buying food that was made locally means reducing the amount of energy and emissions required to feed yourself and your family.Check out farmer's markets for the greenest options. Most farmers can tell you exactly how far the food traveled to get to you.
Why not grow your own food? Check out local community gardens and see about starting your own vegetable plot.

, Every item you bring into your house has a history. Take your new pair of jeans, for example. Do you know what materials went into making the jeans? Do you know how far they were shipped before arriving in a store near you? If you bought them online, how do you think they got to your door? Often the steps required to make an item available require means that pollute the air. Thinking more deeply about what's behind every item can help you make greener choices.Check labels to see how far products had to travel to get to you. If an item came from another continent, a lot of gas was burned to get it to your door. Look for a local option instead.
Buy secondhand. Any time you can do without a brand new item, it's better to get a secondhand version. That way energy isn't required to produce a new item from scratch.

, Many environmental groups are passionate about stopping air pollution by encouraging individuals, companies and governments to make greener decisions. Your personal actions matter, but if you want to make a bigger difference, join up with a group and make your voice heard.See if there are local groups working on ways to stop air pollution in your community.
Or join up with a national group focused on reducing carbon emissions and stopping global warming.

Save water in your home.,
Don't use toxic chemicals.,
Never pour hazardous waste down the drain.,
Find ways to fight local water pollution.",How to Be Greener2," Water is a major resource that we often take for granted. The water that comes through your faucets has to be pumped from a water source to a treatment plant, filtered and treated with chemicals, then pumped to your neighborhood. That process requires a lot of energy. When you conserve water, you do your part to put less strain on your local water sources. This is especially important if you live in an area that's prone to drought. To save water,Don't keep water running while you do the dishes. Use a low-water dishwashing method.
Take short showers instead of baths, which require much more water.
Fix leaky pipes so you aren't wasting water.
Don't water your lawn with fresh water. Either let the rain do the work, or save grey water (like used bathwater) to use.

, Cleaning chemicals are often made with toxic ingredients that wash into the water supply and taint it. This harms humans, wildlife and the environment. Use earth-friendly substances around your home. You can also try making your own.Instead of using a commercial all-purpose cleaner, try a solution of white vinegar and water. It works just as well and isn't toxic.
Baking soda does wonders on stains of all kinds.
Use natural versions of shampoos, conditioners and other body products.
Use natural methods for getting rid of bugs and rodents in your home, rather than using poison.

, Even worse is pouring them onto your lawn, where they'll eventually seep into the groundwater. Paint, motor oil, bleach, ammonia, and other strong solutions should be disposed of properly according to the guidelines of your local sanitation department. Most communities have toxic waste sites for proper disposal., Every community is dependent on a natural source of water to survive. Whether it's a river, a lake, groundwater, or another source, it's essential to protect the water that literally brings your community life. Find local groups working to protect your water and join up so you can help. Here are a few ideas:


Participate in local waterways cleanups to get rid of trash polluting your local streams, rivers and beaches.
Speak out against local water polluters. Loose governmental regulations mean that many water sources are polluted with industrial waste. See if there's a local group working to make things right and keep the water clean where you live."
"
Make less waste.,
Make your yard plant and animal friendly.,
Plant trees.,
Stand up for animals.,
Join a local environmental group to protect your land.",How to Be Greener3," Excess waste leads to overflowing landfills. They pollute land, the water and the air, making life worse for everyone who lives nearby. When it comes to waste, there are plenty of ways to make your habits greener. Here are a few ideas:


Buy goods without a lot of packaging. For example, buy your food in bulk, rather than getting individually-wrapped packets with one serving size each.Recycle and reuse as often as possible. You'll quickly see how much packaging comes into your home when you make the goal of recycling or reusing all of it.
Compost your food scraps. Food scraps are biodegradable, so there's no reason for them to end up in a landfill.

, This is an easy, extremely helpful way to be green. Many wild places have been destroyed by humans, so native plants and animals need all the help they can get to survive. Make your yard a safe haven for any wild creatures that need a home. You'll find that it won't take long for your yard to be alive with wildlife.Don't treat your yard with pesticides or herbicides.
Set aside a section of your yard to leave unmowed. Let the natural grasses and weeds grow as tall as they'd like. This encourages wildlife to move in.
Plant butterfly bush and other plants that attract butterflies and bees.
Set up a birdfeeder and a birdbath. You can also set up a squirrel feeder and a bat box.
Make a small pond to serve as a water source for animals.
Don't kill, trap or scare away snakes, frogs, lizards, moles, raccoons, opossums, or other creatures who want to live in your yard.

, In most climates, the land is healthier when it has plenty of trees. Trees keep soil from eroding, clean the air, and provide shelter for wildlife. Trees also help to combat global warming by shading the ground and keeping temperatures down. Planting tree is one of the best ways to literally go green.Find out what trees are native to your area. Plant them in areas where there are too few trees.
Join with a local group working to stop forests from being clear cut  in your area to make way for developments.

, More animals go extinct every day, and it's up to each one of us to save those who are left. One way to do this is to start thinking of animals as valuable creatures with a right to live and thrive on earth, just like us. Whether or not you consider yourself an animal lover, take these steps to be greener:Take care of wild places, like beaches and forests, that provide habitats for animals.
Make sustainable eating choices when it comes to the way you consume fish and meat.
Speak up on behalf of animals. For example, if a developer in your area wants to put up a cell phone tower directly in an endangered bird species' flight path, find ways to speak up against the development.

, Depending on where you live, your community might be dealing with threats such as mountaintop removal, fracking, clearcutting, strip mining, and more. Educate yourself on the environmental threats in your area so you know how you can best help. Remember that the best way to be greener is to go beyond personal actions and make your voice heard.

Consider becoming a vegetarian or vegan.,
Try growing your own food.,
Make your own cleaning supplies and other products.,
Donate or sell items instead of throwing them out.",How to Be Greener4," Since commercially-manufactured meat is produced under conditions that harm the environment, becoming a vegetarian or vegan is a green choice. Industrial-scale meat production is cruel to animals and causes both air and water pollution. In addition, mass-produced meat is often pumped full of hormones that are unhealthy for animals and humans alike.A vegetarian diet is meat and fish free, while the stricter vegan diet contains no animal products at all. Decide which lifestyle makes the most sense for you.
Ethically produced meat is a good alternative to commercially-produced meat if you don't want to give it up completely. Try eating only meat that you bought from a farm that you have visited.

, Planting a vegetable, fruit and herb garden is a fulfilling experience. Completely eliminating the processing that happens to get commercially-grown produce to your door is a very green choice. If you've never gardened before, start small. You don't need much space to grow enough vegetables and herbs to last the summer. Try these easy plants to start:Tomatoes
Squash
Lettuce
Potatoes
Onions
Garlic
Strawberries
Basil
Dill

, Most cleaning products can be made at home, and they often work just as well as the store-bought kind. In addition to making your own household cleaners, you can make your own body care products, too. You won't have to throw away plastic bottles or wonder what chemicals you're putting on your body. Try these recipes:


Make Disinfectant
Laundry detergent
Dish Soap
Shampoo
Body wash
Toothpaste

, If you've accumulated a lot of stuff in your household, don't just throw it in the trash. Make a habit of donating or selling items that still have some life left in them. You could also trade things you don't need anymore for something you want.


Consider holding a clothing swap with your friends. You can all get new treasures without having to pay a dime.
Or donate items to product exchange communities like Freecycle. Vow not to let any useful item end up in a landfill.

Take an art class.,
Make different kinds of friends.,
Know when to ask for help.",How to Get Involved1," It's easy to just go to class and then go home. But if you want to get more out of your school experience, join an academic club at your school. Each school will have a variety of clubs. Check out what's available at your school, or consider talking to a teacher about starting your own. Common academic clubs include:


Math Club
Foreign Language Club
Geology, Biology, or Zoology Club
Drama Club
Speech Club
Reading or Book Club;
, Clubs should be fun, not extra homework. At most schools, even the academic clubs are a blast, but other clubs might be more appealing. Here's a list of common leisure clubs available at some schools:


Chess Club
Video Game Club
Dodgeball Club
Ultimate Frisbee Club
Drill Team
Gay-Straight Alliance
Knitting Club
Film Club

, Student government allows students to participate directly in the school community. All student governments are run differently, but there are a variety of positions available. Usually, there will be a student council with representatives from all the home-room classes in each grade.


Ask a guidance counselor for more information about student council campaigns at your school. Ask what you need to do to get involved.
You don't have to be the president to get a good student council experience, and student government isn't a popularity contest. The kids who get involved are typically pretty involved and pretty dedicated to academics, which means you might feel right at home there if you do too.

, Athletic teams help students make friends, get physical, and have fun competing. If you enjoy playing sports, trying out for an athletic team at your school can be a great option.


Team sports usually include basketball, volleyball, football, baseball/softball, tennis, and sometimes soccer.
If you're not a big fan of team sports, check out other options. Track and field, cross country, swimming, and other sports are sometimes offered at schools.

, Playing music offers a great outlet for all kinds of students. If you want to learn to play an instrument, you can join band or orchestra and make great friends while you do it. If you want to be musical without an instrument, the choir is a great choice.



Orchestral instruments include violin, viola, cello, and double-bass.

Band instruments include woodwinds like flute, clarinet, and saxophone, as well as brass instruments like trumpet, trombone, french horn, and tuba. Percussion is usually also a part of the school band.
Choir is usually divided by vocal range. Some schools offer performance choirs, which involve dancing, as well as more traditional vocal choirs.

, At some schools, the art department is like a separate school entirely. If you enjoy drawing, painting, photography, or other artistic pursuits, consider signing up for art classes and hanging out with the artsy kids at your school. This can be a great way to find a community and make art.

, Most schools aren't like the movies. The ""jocks"" don't just hang out with the jocks. Real life can be a lot more diverse than what you see on television. To get involved in your school social life, try to make as many different kinds of friends as possible. Open up your worldview by having a large and dynamic group of friends.


Hang out with people in your classes, and hang out with people from the clubs or teams you belong to. Hang out with people from your neighborhood. Hang out with people from different kinds of families than the one you live in.

, At some schools, it's easy to get lost in the shuffle. If you don't want to be a ghost, it's up to you to reach out and get help when you need it. Talk to your teachers and get to know them. Let them get to know you.


Remember, you're at school to learn. That doesn't just mean book-learning. Learning how to admit when you're wrong, admit you need help, and figure out what it takes to better yourself are all important school lessons.

At a minimum, invite neighbors who have a fairly direct view of each other's houses or apartments. For a standard city block, this might include both sides of the street, corner houses that look down your block, and backyard neighbors. Remember the motto, ""We Look Out For Each Other!"".


Four weeks before the start up meeting, visit your neighbors and explain that you are starting a NW program for your neighborhood. Get an indication from them of the best time, date, and place for a meeting. Explain that this start-up meeting will have to be coordinated with the other neighbors and your local law enforcement agency. Ask about any crime concerns or other local issues they may have.;

Gather information.,
Think about your priorities.,
Consider your options.,
Make sure the organization is reputable.,
Ask for advice.",How to Donate to People in Need1," If you already know which organization you would like to donate to, you simply need to phone the office and ask them about their donation procedure. However, if you're like many people, you may be unsure of which organization you would like to offer your resources to. Your first step is to start gathering information about your many options.First, spend some time learning about different types of donations. For example, would you like to donate money? Or would you prefer to donate materials, such as food or clothing?
Once you have decided on what type of donation you would like to make, you can start looking for the right place to donate.
Take notice of your surroundings. Many charitable organizations advertise in public places. Pay attention to the advertisements at the bus stop, or on the notice board at your local coffee shop.
Look for specific information. For example, if you want to donate toys, try asking a local school for information about charities. A local church can usually provide that information, too.;
, There are many worthwhile causes. Since it's not possible to help every group, spend some time thinking about what matters most to you. Is there a cause that is personal to you? For example, do you have a family member who has suffered from cancer? Consider donating resources to cancer research or toys to a children's hospital.Maybe you feel strongly that donating food to the needy is the most important use of your resources. Try reaching out to local food banks to ask them about their needs.
Think about where you would most like to see your resources at work. For example, have you seen people suffering in the bitter cold? Consider finding an organization that accepts winter coats, gloves, hats, etc.

, Once you have decided what type of donation you would like to make, it is time to think about whether you would like to donate locally or globally. If you would like to donate toys to a local school, for example, you will want to donate locally. But if you would like to donate money to a larger cause, like environmental research, you may want to look for a global organization.Giving locally is a logical choice. It is your instinct to help others around you, so don't be afraid to make that choice.
Be aware that giving globally is also a good option. People in developing countries live on much less money per day, so your donation can be stretched much farther.
When you are considering giving to an organization, feel free to ask them to provide some basic information. For example, ask what percentage of monetary donations go to people in need and what percentage is used for administrative costs.

, You want to make sure that your money or materials are actually being given to people in need. There are several questions to ask before you make a donation. For example, you can visit the Internal Revenue Service website to see whether the charity is eligible to receive tax deductible donations.Find out the full name, phone number, and address of the charity. Then, do a basic internet search to make sure that they have not been reported for scams.
If someone phones you asking for a donation, ask for more information. Then, phone the charity to make sure they are aware someone is soliciting funds in their name.
Do not send cash donations. For security and tax reasons, it is safer to donate by writing a check.

, Wherever you decide to donate, you want to make sure that you are choosing a reputable organization. That means that the money is going to help those in need. Ask friends and family if they have a charity that they support.If you belong to a church, you can ask if there are church-approved organizations you can give to.
Neighbors are also a great resource. Post a notice in your apartment building asking if anyone knows of a worthwhile local organization.

Introduce yourself to your neighbors, even if you've lived there for a while. Talk to them. Find out what they do, what they're like, and who they are as people. Just a five-minute chat can do a lot to get you more involved in your community.


try to do this as soon as possible after you move to a new neighborhood, or a new building. Just knock on the door and introduce yourself. If you notice someone new in the neighborhood, bring over a couple beers or a plate of cookies to help say hello.

Consider your own resources.,
Gather your materials.,
Donate your time.,
Contact the organization.",How to Donate to People in Need2," Once you have chosen an organization, it is time to decide how much you can donate. Take some time to think about what you can afford to give. If you are making a monetary donation, take a look at your budget. Make sure that you can afford the amount you choose to give.The same principle applies if you are donating material goods. It's great to donate gently used clothing, toys, and household goods. Just make sure that your own family members are done needing those items.

, Once you have decided what you can afford to give, spend some time organizing your donation materials. For example, if you have decided to donate food, take a few minutes to go through your pantry and look for canned or dry-goods that have a long shelf life. Make sure that the items are not expired.Contact your local food bank to ask for specific guidelines. For example, food banks generally do not except homemade goods or any items in glass containers.
If you are donating to a shelter, make sure to keep personal care items separate from food. You can collect items such as soap, toothpaste, and toilet paper.

, Maybe you are not in a position to donate money or materials. You can still help people in need. Consider becoming a volunteer and donating your time.Use the same process to decide which organization to give your time to. Consider your priorities and what types of resources you have to give.
For example, if you enjoy working with kids, you could consider volunteering for a mentoring program such as The Boys and Girls Clubs of America.

, Once you have all of your resources gathered, call or e-mail the organization you wish to donate to. The business office will be able to tell you the procedure for making a donation. For example, many food pantries only accept donations on certain days and at specific times.Many organizations offer a pick-up service. Ask for more information about this, particularly if you are donating several items, or a large item such as a piece of furniture.
If you want to become a volunteer, ask if there is an orientation session or training program that you need to complete.

Ask for updates.,
Follow the news.,
Make a deduction.",How to Donate to People in Need3," When you make a donation, you might want to follow up and make sure that your money or materials were put to good use. Many organizations can provide data about how they disperse funds and aid. This is particularly true true of international and national organizations.Sites such as JustGive.org can help you find reputable organizations. Well-established and funded organizations may be more likely to be able to tell you how your donation will be used.
Subscribe to the organization's list-serve so that you get e-mail updates. You may also receive materials such as monthly newsletters.

, Keeping an eye on current events can help you keep track of which organizations are helping those in need. For example, when there is a natural disaster, you will often see news reports about the American Red Cross and their efforts.When there is a local disaster, the news will often report on what materials are needed and how to donate them.

, When you make a charitable donation, you can often make a deduction on your tax return. You will need to itemize your donations in Section A of your 1040 tax form. Keep track of all items you donate.Ask your accountant to make sure that you are receiving the proper credit for all of your charitable giving.

Plus, you can add statistics and information to your letters or campaigns. Here are some important ones:



Amount Australia spends on aid: Australia spends about 0.35% of its GDP on aid -- that's 35 cents in every $100.

Amount of aid lost to corruption: Corruption is an oft-mentioned issue, but the size of the problem is smaller than many people believe. It is estimated that 0.028% of Australian aid is lost to fraud.Extent of the cuts: the ""cuts"" essentially amount to a reduction in the rate of aid growth to 0%; it will rise only in line with inflation. As a result, Australia will not meet its commitment to give 0.7% of GDP (70 cents in every $100) to aid, and $4.5 billion of planned growth has been canceled.

Australia's own financial situation: Australia has relatively low debt and the second-highest Human Development Index (standard of living) in the entire world.;
, Keep an eye on the news and social media for updates, or information on campaigns you could join.

, As foreign aid is the responsibility of the federal parliament, advocates need to send a message to politicians that we don't want to see it cut.

, If you're game, get a few like-minded friends together and make an appointment to talk to your federal MP in person.


Be well-informed on the issues so you can talk about them, put forward your opinion intelligently, and answer questions.
More information on meeting your MP, and what will happen in the meeting, can be found online. Find out which electorate you're in, who your federal MP is, and how to contact them. This information can be found on the Australian Parliament House website., Part of your MP's job is to respond to concerns from the electorate.


Remember to address officials correctly; you're addressing the MP as your local MP, so even if they're a Minister, you can say ""Dear Ms Bishop"", for example, instead of ""Dear Minister.""Don't panic! Being polite and sincere is more important than getting every single formal detail right.

,


First, you'll need to find your local Senators. Each state/territory has several Senators - they're not specific to particular areas of the state but can be found on the Australian Parliament House WebsiteThe Senate votes on decisions that have passed the House of Representatives (where your local MP sits), and can often make the difference between a decision passing or failing.

,


Prime Minister Tony Abbott: ultimately responsible for the government. Contact details here

Joe Hockey, Treasurer: announced the aid cuts. Contact details here

Julie Bishop, Minister for Foreign Affairs: with the abolition of AusAID, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is responsible for Australian aid. Contact details here.
Now you're writing to politicians in their capacity as Ministers, so you address them a little differently. The difference is that you should put ""Minister for..."" (or ""Treasurer"" or ""Prime Minister"") on the envelope instead of ""Member for..."", and address them as ""Dear ., Some campaigns are already in place, so join forces to send a more powerful message!

, While none have been organised yet, attending an event in person is one of the most powerful ways to communicate your desire for foreign aid to be maintained, not cut.


If you're organising an event, make sure you check any relevant laws.

, While they're sometimes considered ""slacktivism"", alongside other methods signing a petition can be powerful, especially if it gains enough signatures to be formally presented to Parliament.


At the time of posting, the largest obvious one is Carmen Dos Santos Monteiro's petition on CommunityRun, an off-shoot of progressive advocacy group GetUp., Micah Challenge, a Christian advocacy organisation partnered with World Vision, has a campaign of sending Christmas cards to politicians with messages in support of foreign aid. They encourage people to use charity gift cards (where the purchase of the card is a donation), to add to the message of generosity.


You could also organise group card-signings, for example at family gatherings or after church services.

, Ultimately politicians look for widespread support on an issue, so it's important to ensure you discuss it with others, as well as contacting politicians yourself.


Discuss foreign aid with people who don't agree with it. Use information, remember to be polite and don't expect everyone to change their views.
Some people may be concerned about the cuts, but not know where to start in combating them. In this case, you can use the information on this page to help. You could even direct them to this page!

As of posting, a popular hashtag is #DontCutAid. Adding the commonly-used #auspol (Australian Politics) hashtag will also get your message seen by other political enthusiasts.
Linking to news or advocacy articles about aid can be effective and interesting for your friends or followers.

Tell people what you've done.",How to Clean Up a Stream," You should pick a stream that is important to you or your local community and scout it out before hand. You should try to find a portion of stream that is safe and easily accessible by vehicle or foot. Keep in mind you will be hauling garbage away, it should be easy to get in and out. Try to start small, you don't want to pick somewhere that is too large to effectively clean.;
, If you don't know who owns it, you can find out by contacting your local county auditor or land title office. Get permission in writing.

, Decide on how long you will be there. You should plan on working no longer than four hours at a time. Allow plenty of time to finish up before nightfall even if you are running late. Keep in mind any seasonal weather conditions such as snow or excessive heat that might make work difficult or dangerous.

, Ask for help from friends, family, or other people in your community. Consider putting up posters or contacting local media to promote your cleanup effort and attract more volunteers.

, If you are cleaning up a large area and are likely to collect more than a couple bags of garbage, you'll need to make plans with how to deal with the waste. A pickup truck can be used to drive garbage to the dump, where garbage can be dropped off for a fee often based on weight. Your local waste management might have several options for renting a dumpster. It is a good idea to call the dump in advance to find out costs or what items are accepted.

, Some items to include are gloves, shovels, garbage bags, and wheelbarrows. Don't forget first aid supplies, drinking water, and snacks. Prepare a list of phone numbers you might need, including emergency services, waste management, and environmental departments.

, Reschedule if conditions seem unsafe, such as heavy rain, flooding, or thunder and lightning. If heavy rain is predicted, it's safer to postpone the cleanup since water levels can rise quickly.

, Leave any animals alone and give them space. Depending on the time of year and where your stream is located, fish may be in your stream so avoid disturbing the water. If there are any large animals in the area that could be dangerous, such as bear, cougar, or even deer, it might be best to reschedule your cleanup.

, This will serve as a central area to keep supplies. Have a person there at all times who can watch against theft or direct people.

, There are several things to keep in mind in order to stay safe. Wear suitable clothes, boots, and work gloves. You should always have another person with you in case either of you need help. Don't enter water deeper than your knees, and be careful not to step into a drop off by taking small steps and feeling the bottom with your foot before placing your full weight on it. Practice good lifting technique by lifting with your knees, not your back. If an object is too heavy, get another person to help.

, Wheelbarrows can be helpful for moving larger pieces of garbage. Keep in mind that removing large objects, even if man-made, might be more disruptive to the environment than leaving them there since they may be providing habitat for fish. If a large object is more than half buried, or might kick up a lot of sediment by removing it, leave it there. If a large item looks like it could possibly be dangerous or toxic, contact your local environmental agency to see if it should be removed.

, Do not handle anything dangerous such as leaky batteries, chemicals containers, live ammunition, explosives, syringes, sharp metal objects, or broken glass. Report anything that looks toxic to your local Department of Health or Department of Environmental Management.

, In addition to the garbage you've collected, make sure you take out anything you brought in.

, Let them know how the cleanup went and if there are any issues you discovered that they should know about. Thank them for allowing you onto their land.

, Your volunteers have put in hard work to make this all happen, and deserve some recognition for their efforts. If you were donated anything or received help in some way from someone, thank them.

, Consider contacting the local media, such as TV news or the community newspaper. Showing before and after pictures can inspire others to start or join a cleanup effort of their own.

Meet the requirements.,
Apply.,
Take the next steps.",How to Become a Volunteer Firefighter1," In the U.S., each county runs its own fire department, and not every department has a dedicated website. Run a web search to find email contacts and station addresses or visit the National Volunteer Firefighter Recruitment Center at .Call, write an email, or go down to the nearest fire station. Say that you're interested in becoming a volunteer firefighter.


If you call, make sure to use the non-emergency number! This should be listed on the department website. The emergency line is reserved for fires, and the people at the station won't appreciate a non-urgent call.If you are in the U.S., you can go through your state firefighters' association. Visit the website and look for information about firefighting in your area.;
, Not all stations take volunteers. Even if your local station does take volunteers, it might already have plenty of help. Ask about non-firefighting roles like communications, support, and fundraising.


If there are no current openings, ask if there is any sort of waiting list. The department may need more help at some point.

, The qualifications for volunteer firefighting vary widely from department to department. However, all fire stations do enforce a minimum age requirement.Most fire departments require that you have a valid driver's license and can legally work in the U.S. Make sure that you live within the service area of the fire department so that you can respond to local emergencies!


Most departments require that you are at least 14 years old. Some only accept volunteers older than 18.Some departments only accept volunteers with a high school diploma or an equivalent degree.

, You will need to fill out an application form, and you may need to undergo a background check. Check the requirements! The screening process and the qualifications are slightly different for every fire department. Wait for the station administration to review your application. If they want your help, they will contact you.

, If the department accepts your application, you'll usually be asked to come into the station and meet the firefighting team. There may be an interview, and you may even sit in on a training session. If the fire squad approves you for volunteering, then you will need to get a physical examination before you start your training. Be respectful and engaged. Focus on your goal."

Utilize online resources that find local food banks and food rescue programs based on your location, like these from: http://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank or http://sustainableamerica.org/foodrescue/.
Check out local businesses like grocery stores or dollar stores, which regularly hold food drives for specific groups or events. Sometimes it’s as easy as paying for a few previously selected items at the register.
Consider if anyone you know is struggling with hunger. If you have a neighbor or family member who is out of work or recovering from a major illness, bring over dinner or offer to do some grocery shopping for them.;
, Sometimes there is a shortage of one type of food and an abundance of others. It’s usually safe to assume that most non-perishables, like canned food and uncooked rice or pasta will be accepted, but it is always better to ask.


Consider the nutritional value of donations. When a person’s meals are extremely limited anything helps, but healthier items are the best.Use your best judgement on strange items. If the item in question is something that grosses you out, chances are they might gross out the recipient of the donation.

, Many good candidates for donation can be found in your pantry, but it’s never a bad idea to buy items specifically to donate.

, You do not want to donate food that is past or nearing its expiration date. Make sure your items are at least 6 months within the date of expiration., Do not donate any heavily dented cans, boxes that are crushed, or anything leaking. Although most donation centers do this already, you can save them a lot of time by checking items before donating., Many institutions only collect items on certain days and times. Ask them for this information before you plan to make your drop-off.

You want to wear sensible clothes. Wear shoes you can easily walk in and nothing too tight or otherwise constrictive. You should also check the weather and plan accordingly. If it's going to be very cold, dress in layers and pack a hat., Unfortunately, when protests get chaotic things can get lost or stolen. You do not want to pack too much or bring anything too expensive to a protest.Pack only the things you will absolutely need, such as your phone, keys, and wallet.
Avoid carrying big, cumbersome bags.
Do not bring or wear expensive items. For example, leave your iPod behind and do not wear expensive jewelry.

, On certain occasions, protests get unruly and people end up arrested. On the off chance you have to spend a night in jail, bring any medications you need each day. You do not want to end up without necessary pills if you end up stuck in jail.It may be a good idea to only bring a small amount of your medication. If it gets lost, you do not want to be out of your medication when you get home.

, It's a good idea to bring your cell phone to a protest in the event you need to contact someone. However, you should prepare your cell phone before the big day. Bring a charger, preferably a portable one, in case your phone runs out of battery power. You should also completely charge your phone before you leave.Turn off text preview. If your phone is locked, police officers will not be able to read the context of your texts.
Download the app FireChat. This allows you to use your cell phone like a walkie talkie, so you can talk with your friends even if you don't have service.

, In some areas, police can legally demand that you unlock your phone using your fingerprint. If you do not want police officers rifling through your phone, you cannot legally be requested to give out a passcode. Before leaving for a protest, lock your phone with a passcode instead of your fingerprint. This will keep your information safe from police officers.However, be sure to check regulations in your state or area. In some areas, police may be able to ask you for your passcode.

, Knowing what you can and cannot do is important if you are confronted or arrested. These laws vary by region around the world, so it's important to do your homework and know your rights before you attend a protest.


In the US and many other countries, your free speech is protected, even if your ideas are controversial or unpopular.In the US, you are allowed to demonstrate freely on public venues (streets, sidewalks, and parks) without prior permission in most cases. You generally need written permission from the owner if you wish to protest on private property.Do prior research on the event. Make sure you know who's organizing it, what cause they are defending, and what they plan to do during the protest. Consider the risks and legal implications of participating. Make sure that the organizers have acquired any necessary permits for large rallies.

, Try to attend a protest with a group of friends or likeminded people. Have at least one close, trusted friend with you at a protest. You can keep an eye on one another. In the event one of you is arrested, you will have someone to notify friends and family members of your whereabouts., Social media can be used to help you stay safe during a protest. People may use a hashtag on Twitter or Facebook regarding a protest, letting people know if arrests are being made or if tear gas is being used. This can help you know which areas to avoid while protesting. However, be careful. Rumors can be spread on social media, so do not believe everything you read.If you only see a single tweet or post about arrests being made or tear gas being used, this may be a false report. Authorities sometimes use social media to falsely spread rumors to deter people from coming.
You should also watch what you post. Do not post about anything illegal you see and do not post anything that could be interpreted as a call to action for illegal activities. This could be used against you in a court of law.
If you are photographing/filming an event, respect the privacy of others. Some people may not want to have pictures or videos taken of them, so ask permission first. However, this does not apply to police working in publicly visible areas.

, You do not want to get involved in any illegal activities during a protest. This can put your safety at risk, and may land you in legal trouble. If you notice illegal activities, back away carefully.Stay away from side streets. Remaining in the open will prevent you from getting caught in violence, which often occurs on the sidelines during protests.
If a large amount of police suddenly arrive a scene, this may quickly escalate to violence. Leave the area quickly in this event.
Keep your distance from the black bloc. If you see a group of people wearing all black and with their faces covered, try to march further away from them. They occasionally vandalize symbols of wealth (banks, limousines) and police often respond violently to their tactics.

, Try to move if people are trying to pass you. If the crowd is moving in one direction, go with the crowd if they're not engaging in anything risky or illegal. If you get in anyone's way, you may get knocked over. This can lead to major injuries if a lot of people step on you. Try to stay out of the way as much as possible during protests., Police officers occasionally use violence on protestors. They also sometimes begin arresting protestors quickly, sometimes even peaceful protestors. As a general rule, keep an arm's length away from police officers at all times., If a police officer stops you, it is within your legal rights to ask certain questions. Ask if you're being detained and if you're free to go. If the answer to any of these questions is ""Yes,"" you should walk away. You do not want to speak to police officers longer than necessary, especially if the protest is very politically charged and arrests are likely.If a police officer says that you're being detained, do not give up too much information. However, you should cooperate with the officer to avoid unnecessary legal charges.
If your are arrested, stay calm and cooperate with the police. Don't argue, resist arrest, or attempt to flee. If you believe you have been unfairly prosecuted, discuss your case with a lawyer later.

, If a police officer searches you, say, ""I do not consent to this search."" Police officers are not allowed to search people without a warrant or an arrest, and any evidence obtained illegally cannot be used against you in court.Part of the reason it's good to stay with a buddy is you will have a witness in the event the unauthorized search comes up in a court of law.
If possible, have someone use a cell phone to record this. This way, you will have evidence you did not authorize the search.

, In the event you are arrested, use your right to remain silent. Under stress, you may accidentally say something to incriminate yourself. Therefore, it's a good idea to decline police questions without a lawyer present. You do not have to answer anything after you've been arrested., Resisting arrest can contribute to police becoming violent. It can also result in you getting into further legal trouble. In the event you are arrested, remain calm. Allow yourself to be handcuffed and do not try to fight back., Tear gas is sometimes used during protests. The best way to protect yourself is to back away when tear gas is being used. Maintain your distance from police and from the black bloc. If you anticipate tear gas, or if you plan on getting involved in social disobedience, wear masks and hoods to protect yourself.See if you can use a gas mask. They are not cheap, but if you're protesting with an organization they may provide gas masks.
In some areas, gas masks may be banned. Instead, buy a builder's respirator online or at a hardware store. This is fitted over your nose and mouth. You can also use a small dust mask and airtight goggles.

, Police occasionally use pepper spray against protestors. It's important you stay vigilant and protect yourself against pepper spray. Usually, the best means to avoid pepper spray is to remain 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 m) away from anyone you see carrying pepper spray, including both police officers and other protestors. If you're unable to escape, cover your eyes with your hands or arm."

Volunteer (and bring a friend along).,
Learn about being in and then later leading a small group of people, maybe first in discussions, and then in actually also volunteering.

,
Purposefully develop relationships with people of different cultures and social classes (both higher and lower).,
Mentor, advice, and shrewdly give either to an adult or a young student (maybe through a school program) from the at risk community and pass on life lessons that have helped you succeed.,
Mentor, advice, and shrewdly give to a few more individuals from that community.,
With one or more of these individuals, start or improve a community garden, playground, small library, or community house or center, or computer lab.,
Develop a weekly event that people of the community can attend, have fun at, and benefit from.,
As you develop relationships with individuals who are in equal or higher social classes, introduce your love for at-risk communities, and introduce them to the friends you've made from there.","How to Develop an ""At Risk"" Community"," Learn about at-risk communities in both developed nations as as well as in under-developed countries. Take a class or doing some research or discussion.;
,, Volunteering often involves mundane and simple activities, but these mundane and simple activities are the very things that are vital and missing from that community and contribute to it being at-risk. Take the task with an element of humility and a vision of the larger purpose and plan. Cherish the individuals that you are affecting through your direct efforts.

,, Push your comfort zones.

, (Introduce them to wikiHow!) Adjust those lessons to make sense and work in their specific situation. Be their biggest fan in both their own goals and in their implementing of your advice.

, Each individual will have their own outlook and set of circumstances. The learning and exchange process may even be very mutual. But eventually you may be able to coach one or more these persons to help and then co-mentor with you. Your efforts will begin to multiply!

, Introduce a Habitat for Humanity project into the neighborhood.

, Develop their social network. Start a community watch from this, if there isn't one already.

, Provide them with the incentives that you gained (progress, excitement, appreciation, etc) in order to encourage them to join or support your efforts with regular time or financial support, or with their work expertise. Time and money are both necessary resources to develop individuals, families, and communities.

Socialize, and keep the blues away.,
Pick active volunteering to stay healthier.,
Let yourself feel accomplished.,
Feel less stressed.,
Boost your self-esteem.,
Be happier.",How to Benefit from Volunteering," You may be tempted to just volunteer at one place, and that can be fine. However, volunteering at different places will expose you to different fields in the nonprofit sector, plus you'll get to work different types of jobs.Doing so can help you explore what you'd like to do later in life if you're younger or even choose a different career if you're a little bit older.
For example, volunteering at the library can help you learn what it's like to work in a field that deals with the public and relies heavily on organization. Working with the parks and recreation department to help keep the parks looking nice can teach you about ecology and what it might be like to be a park ranger.;
, Volunteering is the perfect opportunity to build your own skill set because while you are giving your time, you're also learning new things. You're basically working a job, and through that job, you gain experience that you can pass on to your work life.

If you truly want to help yourself gain skills, think about the areas you're lacking in. Maybe you need to build social skills. In that case, volunteer somewhere where you can build up social skills, such as helping patrons at the library.
On the other hand, maybe you need to learn more about technology and how it's used in an office. In that case, maybe you could volunteer in a nonprofit's office.
In fact, it's that reason that many schools are now making service-learning a part of the classroom. Community organizations benefit from students helping them, and students get to learn skills and gain knowledge that they wouldn't be able to learn in the classroom.

, Another way to help work on your career is to use volunteering to help network. Really, you don't have to go out of your way to network. Just talk to people while you're volunteering and get to know them.Don't be afraid to ask someone to socialize after your volunteer work. For instance, if you volunteer with someone you like, see if they want to have coffee afterwards.
All networking is is making a connection with other people that you and they can rely on later, and volunteering can help you do that.

, Studies have shown that people who volunteer are more likely to be hired than people who don't volunteer. In fact, you have about a 25 percent higher chance of being hired if you volunteer than if you don't. If you don't have a high school diploma, that number increases to a 50 percent higher chance.

Therefore, it's a good idea to put your volunteer experience on your resume, bring it up in your cover letter, and/or talk about it in your interview.

, If you're still in high school, volunteering looks great on a college application. It shows leadership, initiative, and commitment, all things colleges love. Just be sure to include it on your application when you apply., Volunteering is a great way to meet new people and make new friends. You're introduced to a wide range of people when volunteering, from other people who are volunteering and staff members to clients you're helping. All of these people have the potential to be new friends.Don't be afraid to strike up a conversation with the people you meet. You never know who's going to be a new friend.
If you can't think of something to say, use the situation you're in to begin the conversation. For instance, you could say, ""Isn't this building beautiful?"" or ""What led you to start volunteering here?""

, Another way volunteering can help your social life is to strengthen relationships you already have. When you volunteer with someone you know, you get to know that person better, whether that person is a member of your family or a co-worker.Pick a place you'd like to volunteer together, then commit to going regularly.
You don't need to do anything special. Just work alongside each other. Take your whole family along to bring you closer together.

, If you're prone to depression, volunteering can help combat depression. Partially, it helps because it forces you to be with other people, which in itself can help cut back on depression, as being socially isolated can increase depression.Make a commitment to volunteer regularly, such as at least once a week. Also, consider working with animals, as that can make you happier, too.

, Many volunteer jobs require you do some physical work, which can help you stay healthier, particularly if you don't get much exercise otherwise. To help your health the most, pick active volunteer jobs.For instance, volunteer with your parks and recreation department to clean up parks or with Habit for Humanity to build houses.
Even working at a food pantry can be fairly active, as you work to move food around and pack it up.

, One way that volunteering contributes to a person's health is that it gives them something to feel accomplished about. If you're volunteering, go ahead and feel accomplished; it will help your health because it boosts well-being and gives you something to feel good about.Volunteering can be especially beneficial to your health if you're retired because it can give you a new sense of purpose. Many people find they feel even more satisfied volunteering than when they were working.

, You may think that volunteering will make you more stressed because it cuts back on your free time, but most people find just the opposite. Most people feel like they have more time when they volunteer, which in turn, cuts back on stress.Stop waiting to volunteer until you have more time. Start now, and you'll start to feel like you have more time than you do.
The same principle applies to money. People who give money away to charities often feel like they have more of it.

, Volunteering can help build up your self-esteem because you are helping other people. To make the effects stronger, pick something where you can see the people you are helping. It also can help to do something where the results are dramatic. For instance, when you volunteer for a place like Habitat for Humanity, you end up with a house for someone to move into, something that dramatically changes their lives.For instance, help in a soup kitchen, where you are working directly with people.
Another option is volunteering at the library.

, Studies have also shown that volunteering just makes you happier overall. From connecting to you people to boosting your confidence, these benefits all come together to make you happier. The key is to get out into your community regularly to help."

Get serious.,
Research the role.,
Make sure that you have enough time.",How to Become a Volunteer Firefighter2," If you're going to be a volunteer firefighter, you'll need to commit to hundreds of hours of training. You must be prepared to step up for your community and take action when there is a fire. Volunteer firefighting can be a rewarding way to spend your time, but you will need to be focused and committed to the role., Visit a local fire department, if you haven't already. Ask the firefighters about what it's like to work there. If you personally know any paid or volunteer firefighters, ask them to explain the risks and rewards of volunteering. Read articles and expert columns at sites like http://www.firerescue1.com/volunteer/.It's important to visit the local fire station. Every fire department is different, and you should make sure that this is a place where you want to spend your time.
Go for a ride-along, if possible. If you're serious about volunteering, most fire departments will allow you to ride along in the fire engine for a day while firefighters are responding to emergencies. This might help clarify your decision., Most fire departments require that you sign up for a volunteer schedule or pledge a certain amount of hours to the program. The training is difficult and expensive, so try to make it count. Be realistic with yourself. If you won't be able to commit to the life of a volunteer firefighter, consider other ways to give back to your community.

"
"
Complete the training program.,
Get fit.,
Be engaged.",How to Become a Volunteer Firefighter3," In the U.S., all firefighters must finish a minimum 110-hour NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) certification course.You may also undergo additional training in order to stay current with new technology. Visit the NFPA website for more information.


If you are going to be physically putting out fires, many departments require that you train in a live fire situation before you start going out on calls., You will need to be in great physical shape. Take care of your physical and mental health so that you can best serve your community. Some departments maintain an actual fitness requirement, while others only suggest it.

, Spend as much time at the station as you can. Part of your informal training is to get to know the other firefighters. You will be working on a team to respond to emergencies with these people, so it's important that you mesh well.

They can usually accommodate people of any age with any health concerns, and often the work is fun. Duties range from sorting fresh produce, to serving food at pantries, to answering phones, and many more., Since hunger is an issue that seems to persist relentlessly, there is always a need for more action.

Start a food drive of your own. This can be as easy as finding a recipient for your donations and getting the word out. Ask at your local donation center how you can make the biggest impact.Encourage your friends, family, and coworkers to join in when you are donating food, money, or time. Most institutions welcome groups of volunteers, and sometimes create healthy competition to make the work more fun and encourage repeat visits.

Every time you encounter another person, recognize that a major percentage of each person is identical to you.,

Recognize the common nature that each person has to pursue personal preservation, personal growth, and personal enjoyment.,
Recognize that each human being is potentially an asset to humanity.,
Recognize the unique contribution that each person can make to the ongoing cause of human progress through imagination and hard work.,
Appreciate your natural desire to look good and to perform well.,
Recognize that you are able to be useful to others, and that others may be useful to you.,
Recognize that we are all on this planet together.",How to Live in Harmony with Others," In turn, appreciate the diversity that comes from the minor percentage of variation. You are a unique configuration of our common human nature. Use reason and good intentions to exercise the will to live, the will to pleasure, the will to superiority, the will to connect and the will to identity, which are all core goals of people the world over.;
, Seek to honor this nature in you in harmony with your surroundings. Have a vision for your life and for humanity. Work toward “the greatest good for the greatest number of people.”


Think about what goal you want to achieve, what dream you want to realize, what destiny you want to pursue, what plan you want to execute, what mission you want to accomplish and dig deep and enlist the support and encouragement of others to shape the future for the better.

, A perceived or actual lack of resources may make another person appear as somewhat of a threat, because he or she would add to the likelihood of some type of shortage arising, but you should realize that most human beings have the capacity to add something of value to the world to a greater extent than he or she depletes its things of value, and keep in mind that we inhabit a very wealthy planet.

, Don’t be overly concerned with another person’s religious or political affiliations but instead ask of the people you meet: Are you making the most of your life? When you look in the mirror, do you like what you see? Can you see yourself in another person and treat the other accordingly? When you lie in bed at night, are you happy with how you spent your day? When you awaken in the morning, are you hungry for higher heights? And for yourself, make the most of your time to live.

, There is much pleasure that can be derived from having an audience, as well as the pleasure that can be derived from being an audience as you enjoy the appearance and performance of other people. The dignity of human beings relentlessly prompts us to carry ourselves in a certain esteemed way. We can bring out the best in each other as a testament to the heights that humanity can ascend to. The unbelievable opportunity to live should be celebrated and maximized to the fullest possible extent by the many facets of the one diamond of human nature because this is who we are. This reality deserves unapologetic expression.

, It is unreasonable for any person to expect to get something for nothing in any relationship. Keep in mind however that sometimes there is no harm in extending assistance to another person simply because you can and that such a gesture could even be a source of personal fulfillment. Indeed, not expecting reciprocation is a large part of the success of giving because your giving then becomes unconditional. You will find most people will reciprocate anyway, especially when you share of yourself with good intent.

, We stand to gain more by working together and with each other rather than working against each other. It has been said by Native Americans, “no tree has branches so foolish as to fight amongst themselves.” Humanity faces many unavoidable challenges that require our best defense without us creating additional unnecessary problems between ourselves. Love is the greatest catalyst of harmony and it always uplifts. As there is always a shortage of enough love, be giving of it always, especially in those times it feels hardest.

Understand that living in peace is both an outward and an inward process.,
Seek to love, not control others.,
Moderate your convictions.,
Be tolerant.,
Be peaceful.,
Reflect.,
Seek forgiveness, not revenge.,
Find inner peace.,
Live in joy.,
Be the change you wish to see in the world.,
Broaden your understanding of peace.",How to Live in Peace," Defining peace is not such a simple thing. But one simple way is to define it as living without violence,(physically, mentally, spiritually, or any other way) and living in a way that embraces respect, and tolerance. This is both out in the world and within each person:


Outwardly: living in peace is a way of life in which we respect and love each other in spite of our cultural, religious, and political differences.
Inwardly, each of us needs to cultivate peace. This means understanding and overcoming fear, anger, intolerance, and lack of social skills that causes violence. For in continuing to ignore the rage within, the storm outside will never subside.;
, Ceasing to seek power over people and outcomes in your life is the first major step to living peacefully. Trying to control people is about seeking to impose your will and reality on others. But by doing so--even with the best of intentions--this forcing your will on others takes away the power from others and causes a great imbalance which can lead to anger, hurt, and resentment. A controlling approach to relationships will likely keep you in conflict with others. The healthy alternative is to seek to understand others before attempting change, tolerate peaceful difference, and use persuasion and leadership in a way that inspires others. It does not mean being a doormat or a pushover or one does not stand up for oneself; it means building relationships rather than trying to overpower.


Peace before power. Gandhi demonstrated that power based on love is more effective and permanent than the power gained through threat of punishment.

As an example, controlling other people through threatening behavior, demeanor, or actions will be responding out of coercion more than respect and love. Typically this will lead to resentment and anger. While one may get his or her ""way"" it will not be with the happiness of those around him or her. This is not a peaceful way to live.
Another example: One teacher may rely on detentions and threat of punishment to keep students in line. Another may reward students for good behavior and the students are made to feel appreciated and inspired. Both may have orderly classrooms...but which one would a student want to learn in? And which one would likely have students learn most effectively?


Learn the skills of negotiation, conflict resolution, and assertive communication. These are important, constructive communication skills that help you to avoid or effectively move through conflict with others. Not all conflict can be avoided, and not all conflict is bad provided you know how to handle it skilfully. If you don't feel that you have enough skills in these forms of communication, read widely on ways to improve them. The clarity of the message is always vital to ensure peace, as much conflict arises out of misunderstandings.
When communicating with others, seek to avoid ordering, moralizing, demanding, threatening, or excessively needling them with questions aimed at eliciting too much information. Each of these forms of communication will give rise to conflict with others who feel that you're trying to control them rather than speak with them as an equal.

Have confidence that others around you are capable of living as good a life as possible all things being equal. In this respect, even giving advice carries controlling tendencies when you use advice as a means to interfere in another person's life, rather than simply offering your own insights without an expectation they'll act on what you think. The Swedish diplomat Dag Hammerskjold once said: ""Not knowing the question, it was easy for him to give the answer."" When we advise others, we risk assuming that we have a full grasp of the problems they're facing when, in actual fact, we usually do not and we're filtering their problem from our own experience. It is far better to respect the other person's intelligence and simply be there for them, instead of trying to impose your experience as the ""answer"" for them. In this way, you will cultivate peace over resentment, respect over trivialization of their viewpoint, and confidence in their intelligence instead of insulting them.

, Thinking in absolutes and holding to convictions without ever considering the viewpoints and perspectives of others is a sure way to live a life without peace. This type of extremist thinking usually leads to reactive, hasty, and driven behavior that lacks the benefit of reflection and deliberative thinking. While this may be convenient because it allows you to act with the confidence of absolute conviction, it blocks out other realities in the world and can easily lead you into conflict when other people fail to agree with your convictions. It's harder work to remain open-minded and ready to review your understandings, yet it's more rewarding because you'll grow as a person and live in greater harmony with those around you.


Moderate your absolute convictions by always being ready to question and to reflect. Accept that your beliefs, faith, passions, or opinions are but some among many other beliefs, faith, passions, and opinions in the world. Follow an ethic of moderation that values human dignity and worth; follow the one true absolute, which is to treat others as you wish to be treated yourself (The Golden Rule).
Find a variety of things to do in your life if you're finding yourself slipping into immoderate stances about other people. It's hard to be immoderate when you're busy doing a range of things and seeing a wide range of people from all walks of life.
Cultivate your sense of humor. Humor is a peace-lover's disarming charm; few fanatics are ever humorous because they're too busy taking themselves and their cause too seriously. Humor allows you to release tension and to show up the repressive tendencies of extremist thinking.

, Tolerance in all that you think and do will make a difference in your life and in the lives of others around you. Tolerance for others is about appreciating diversity, the plurality of modern society, and being willing to live and let others live too. When we fail to tolerate others' beliefs, ways of being, and opinions, the end result can be discrimination, repression, dehumanization, and ultimately violence. Practicing tolerance is at the heart of living peacefully.


Rather than jumping to negative conclusions about other people, change your own perspective and nourish the good in others. In changing your perspective of others, you can initiate change in their own self-perception.For example, instead of seeing someone as stupid or incompetent, start calling them intelligent, effective, and clever. This will nourish them and encourage them to live up to the good you perceive in them. Seeing others as interesting, special, and caring beings underneath their bravado, anger, and torment, can bring about a great change for the better.
Read the wikiHow articles on how to be tolerant to people's opinions, how to be tolerant of others, and how to be tolerant of other viewpoints for more ideas on creating more tolerance in your life.

, Gandhi said ""There are many causes that I am prepared to die for but no cause that I am prepared to kill for."" A peaceful person does not use violence against another person or animal (sentient beings). While there is much violence in this world, make a choice to not let death and killing be a part of your philosophy of living.


Whenever a person aims to try to convince you that violence is okay, stick to your beliefs and politely disagree. Realize that some people will try to goad you by insisting that you're undermining people involved in situations of conflict. You know is not true and that it is a skewed vision that values conflict which leaves many people dead, orphaned, or homeless. The former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, said: ""My experience of conflict is that those who are involved in it long for even a day of peace. To have a day of cessation of violence, that to me is an idea whose time has come.” Be bolstered by the reality that violence is not something even those involved in it want, and that peace for humankind as a whole is a valid wish to hold.
To be peaceful is to be able to act with compassion toward those who are violent. Even criminals deserve to know how compassion works, yet when a society incarcerates, and tortures, and enables violence in our prisons and in our hearts, we are the equal of those criminals. Seek to demonstrate (not just give lip service to) the principles of a just and fair society and from this set the example.
Avoid violent movies, news reports of violent acts, and music with hateful or degrading lyrics.
Surround yourself with peaceful images, music, and people.
Give serious consideration to vegetarianism and veganism as your future way of sustaining yourself. For many peace-lovers, violence toward animals is not conducive to living a life in peace. Read widely on the way animals are treated in the farming, hunting, and pharmaceutical industries, and about vegetarian and vegan lifestyles, in order to settle your own beliefs about other sentient beings. Align the understandings you gain from this research with your living peacefully.

, Reflection of thought is important – many a hasty response has resulted in a tragic outcome because time to think through all of the issues and angles has not been taken. Naturally, there are times when fast action is essential to ensure safety but these times do not excuse the many other times when reacting with care and consideration will result in much better outcomes for all concerned.


If someone hurts you physically or mentally, do not react with anger or violence. Stop and think. Choose instead to respond peacefully.
Ask the other person to stop and think and tell them that anger or violence will not resolve the issue at hand. Simply say ""please don't do that"". If they refuse to stop, remove yourself from the scene or situation.
Just stop yourself. When you feel like the need to respond to something in a manner that portrays your anger, frustration, or irritation, tell yourself ""Stop"". Remove yourself from the situation that is bringing on confusion and inability to reflect. By giving yourself the space, you'll have time to overcome the initial angry feelings and replace them with thoughtful solutions, including not responding.
Practice reflective listening. Spoken language is imprecise, and people under stress often say things that mask the real things they'd like to say. John Powell said that ""In true listening, we reach behind the words, see through them, to find the person who is being revealed. Listening is a search to find the treasure of the true person as revealed verbally and non-verbally."" The importance of reflective listening to living a peaceful life is that you stop seeing people purely from your perspective and start trying hard to dig down into what another person is really saying and meaning. This can lead to effective give-and-take rather than reacting according to what you think you hear by inferring and guessing.

, Where does an eye for eye lead to? Usually to many eyes missing. Pointless and self-perpetuating, given history's lessons we know better. No matter where we live, what religion we practice or what culture we cultivate, at the heart of everything, we're all humans, with the same ambitions and aspirations to raise our family, and to live life to its fullest. Our cultural, religious, and political differences should not provide the backbone to invoke conflicts that can only bring sadness and destruction to our world. When you feel compelled to harm another out of a perceived slight to your reputation, or because you feel that their action deserves an equally abhorrent reaction, you perpetuate anger, violence, and sorrow. Replace this with forgiveness to seek the way of living peacefully.



Live in the present, not the past. Dwelling on that which should have been and reliving past hurts will keep the negatives of the past alive and bring constant internal conflict. Forgiveness allows you to live in the present, to look forward to the future, and to let the past settle gently. Forgiveness is the ultimate victory because it lets you enjoy life again by making peace with the past.
Forgiveness lifts you up and frees you from resentment. Forgiveness is about learning - learning to cope with the negative feelings that arose as a result of the act that made you angry or upset and you learn by acknowledging those feelings rather than burying them. And in forgiving, you empathize with the other person, leading you to understand what motivated them; you don't need to agree with what they did, just to understand.
Realize that it's an insult to mask your anger as being in ""defense of another's honor"". This takes away the autonomy of the people whom you are supposedly defending by speaking and reacting for them (which in turn encourages them to be helpless), and it is a violent excuse for wrongdoing. Where it's perceived that someone else's honor has been compromised, allow the alleged victim to speak their own mind (they may not even see it as you do) and to seek resolution through forgiveness and greater understanding.
Even where you feel forgiveness cannot be given, this is no cause for violence. Instead, distance yourself and be the better person.

, Without inner peace, you'll feel in a constant state of conflict. Trying to fill your life with possessions or improving yourself by social climbing without ever stopping to value your inner worth will leave you perpetually unhappy. When you crave something and you don't have it, you're in a place of conflict. It's easy to forget to be grateful for what you do have when you're constantly striving to upgrade your possessions, career, house, and life. Equally, owning too much stuff will create conflict and prevent you from living in peace because you're always at the beck and call of the ""needs"" of your possessions, from cleaning and maintenance, to insurance and security.


Cut back to the essentials and make conscious decisions about what improves or beautifies your life while discarding the rest.
When you're angry, find a nice quiet place to stop, take a deep breath, and relax. Turn off the TV, stereo, or computer. Get out into nature if possible, or go for a good, long walk. Put on some soft music or turn down the lights. When you feel calm again, get up and get on with your life.
At least once a day spend ten minutes in a peaceful place, such as under a shady tree or in the park, anywhere where you can just sit quietly without distractions.
Living in peace means more than living in the absence of violence. Try to cultivate peace in all areas of your life by reducing stress as much as possible. Avoid stressful situations, such as traffic, large crowds, etc., when possible.

, Choosing to see the wonders of the world is an antidote to violence. It's hard to be motivated to violence against that which you see as beautiful, wondrous, amazing, and joyful; indeed, the greatest despair arising from wars comes from the destruction of innocence, beauty, and joy. Joy brings peace to your life because you're always prepared to see what is good in others and the world, and to be grateful for the wondrous aspects of life.


Don't self-sabotage your right to be happy. Feeling unworthy of happiness, worrying about how others will perceive you if you're happy, and worrying about the potential awfulness when happiness ends are all negative thinking patterns that can undermine the pursuit of joy in your life.
Do what you love. Life is more than your job. While your job needs to be something that ensures your livelihood, you also need to fulfill your life's vision. Thich Nhat Hanh has this guidance: ""Do not live with a vocation that is harmful to humans and nature. Do not invest in companies that deprive others of their chance to life. Select a vocation which helps realize your ideal of compassion."" Decide for yourself how far to take the meaning of his guidance and seek work that helps sustain a peaceful life.

, This isn't just a commonly referred to saying of Gandhi's – it's a call to action. And there are a number of proactive ways that you can become the peaceful change you'd like to see in the world, including:


Change yourself. Violence starts with your acceptance of its possibility as a solution and often its inevitability. So it’s inside you that you need to go to stop violence and become peaceful. In seeking not to harm living beings, to live peacefully, first change yourself, and then change the world.

Be part of the solution. Be a person who loves every person for who they truly are. Make people comfortable around you, and allow them to be themselves with you. You will gain a lot of friends, and gain respect from the friends you already have.
Join and participate in Peace One Day.Make an online, worldwide commitment to celebrate the UN International Day of Peace, an annual day of global ceasefire and non-violence held every 21 September.
Talk to other people about their views of peace. Share ideas about ways to help create a more peaceful world and ways to embrace differences without falling into conflict. You might like to make videos to place online, or write stories, poems, or articles to share with everyone about the importance of peace.
Make sacrifices to help others. The greatest noble cause is to display your desire to bring about peace in this world by your own sacrifice and not that of those who oppose your views. Mahatma Gandhi sacrificed his own lucrative law practice in Durban, South Africa to lead a simple life and to share the pain of the powerless and destitute. He won over the hearts of millions without ever reigning power over anyone — simply with the power of altruism. You too can bring peace to the world by showing your willingness to sacrifice your self-centered desires. Win the hearts of others by showing your willingness to serve causes greater than yourself. At the very least, consider volunteering.
Bring harmony to the world by championing love and peace for all. While this may seem daunting, reflect upon how Gandhi was able to show that a fragile, meekly man of small physical stature could achieve feats of incredible magnitude, all based on a staunch belief of practicing peace through non-violence. Your individual input does matter.

, You're free to choose your own path. Everything you've read in this article is but suggestion. It is not to be followed as a dogma, it is not seeking to impose itself on you, and it may be found as wanting as any other series of suggestions you care to read. At the end of the day, living in peace will be your own conscious, daily action founded on your own strivings and understandings, gleaned from all corners of the world, from all people you've ever met and known, and from your own consciousness and knowledge. Go forth in peace.



Keep learning. This article has but touched the surface of a very deep and ongoing personal and world need. Read widely in the field of peace, especially about peace activists and practitioners from whom you can learn a great deal. Share your learning with others and spread peaceful knowledge wherever you go in life.

Volunteer or donate to charity.,
Shop carefully.,
Take part in blood donations.,
Become an advocate.,
Become an organ donor.",How to Help Change the World1," It's not just about working in a soup kitchen or visiting the old folks' home. Today anyone can volunteer to do anything! Contact the local volunteer organisations in your area and discover a cause that you feel passionate about. Start a petition, donate money, support a charity, fundraise, or be an advocate.


Don't donate to the first charity you come across. There are huge differences in efficiency. If you want to make sure that your money is used to save as many lives as possible, do check out givewell.org. Picking one of their most recommended charities is quick and easy, but you can also read up on why they chose those if you're interested. Other possible sites are BBB Start With Trust or Charity Navigator.
Buy a wristband. They are all the rage in Hollywood, with lots of celebrities sporting the most recent fashion accessory—a charity wristband. Not only do they look cool, they're cheap and a great way to do your bit for your favorite cause.
If you want to help the developing world, the best charities are ones which help people to help themselves. These do the most good by enabling communities to strengthen and improve themselves. Examples of charities that do work like this are Heifer International, Kiva, or Free the Children. Education charities, like One Laptop Per Child, are also good.;
, Businesses are some of the most important and influential organizations in the world today. They are involved with, or in some way influence, almost any issue you can think of and can sometimes be even more influential than governments in those issues. Luckily, you have opportunities every day to encourage businesses to do the right thing. Every time you buy something, you are giving your approval for whatever process was involved in its production. The next time you're in the grocery store, take an extra look at the labels.


Take a close look at your options. Ask yourself questions: ""Do I want to support this type of business?"" ""Are the farmers or factory workers that made this treated well?"" ""Is this product traded fairly?"" ""Is it healthy?"" ""Is it good for the environment?"" ""Does the sale of this product help support an oppressive political regime?""

, Many countries (especially Australia, Britain, Canada, and the United States) frequently experience record lows of blood stores and desperately need more people to donate. It only takes about half an hour and doesn't hurt (much!). Visit Red Cross or United Blood Services for more information.

, Speak up about injustices in the world and get your friends involved, too. Organize fundraisers to help raise money for your chosen charity or cause. If you can't raise money, add your voice to those already campaigning to end poverty, war, injustice, sexism, racism, or corruption in the world. Activism can start at any age. Craig Kielburger was twelve years old when he became an activist for child labour rights. He went on, with his brother, to start Free the Children and Me to We.

, You won't need your organs when you are dead, so why not give them to someone who can use them? Save the lives of up to eight people by placing yourself on the organ donors' register in your country. Talk about the decision with your family and let them know your wishes.

Understand what slow food means.,
Join a Slow Food group in your region.,
Get cooking.,
Shop locally.,
Avoid genetically modified food.,
Buy organic.,
Grow your own food.,
Share your home-cooked meals.,
Cook with the kids.,
Pack a healthy lunch.",How to Get Started in the Slow Food Movement," Slow food is about more than food; it is about a lifestyle that connects our food consumption to the wider social, ethical, lifestyle, political, environmental and spiritual elements around us. Slow food is about taking the time needed to cook good food properly and recognizing that reliance on fast food damages our health, social fabric and cultural food traditions.;
, The Slow Food movement has enlisted over 80,000 members in at least 122 countries, so it's probable you have a group near you.Your local group will be known as a ""convivium"" and you will find your local group via Slow Food Where To Find. Of course, you don't have to join to be a part of the Slow Food movement; it is just a chance to be with like-minded people and to have the chance to share ideas and to participate in events together; benefits that may enthuse you.

, That's right. Stop buying the pre-made selection and start pulling out your recipe books. Look for family heirloom recipes passed down through the generations; many of us can recall delicious meal occasions prepared by family members, or even by ourselves before the need for speed overtook us. Be careful about your recipe choices, however. The fancy cookbooks might call for ingredients that need to be imported from many thousands of miles away; avoid these and favour recipes that let your local produce take centre stage, including veggies and fruit from your own garden.

, Shopping locally is a key element to being a Slow Foodie. Shop at your local farmer's markets, your local fruit and vegetable store and even consider asking for veggies from your neighbours if they're growing some. Not only do you save the wear and tear on the environment from all the energy consumed in long-range transportation but you also know where your food came from and that's a very reassuring feeling. The greatest benefit of shopping locally though? The food is as fresh as possible and that just tastes the best.

, Whilst some companies may put forth a vision that genetically modified food is the promise of the future, there remain many questions about the speed at which such modification is occurring and the means by which it is being achieved. Certainly, we have been modifying our food for centuries but the key word here is centuries, not a matter of years. The Slow Food movement has a fundamental opposition to the use of genetically modified food products because in making a large swathe of common food sources generic, we risk losing the all important diversity and quality of food available around the world and replacing it with mono-crops that become more susceptible to disease, providing less healthy variety and possibly increasing the chances of human-induced disease through over-concentration on a few food types.

, Where possible, prefer organic produce over conventionally grown food. You reduce your exposure to pesticides, fungicides and fertilizer chemicals and you get produce that many studies have suggested are higher in nutrients that bolster the immune system, presumably because plants not treated with pesticides must produce more antioxidants to protect themselves.Organic food is an important part of the Slow Food movement because organic food is low impact and harm reducing, especially when practiced on a non-industrial scale.

, Whether you have space only for a container of herbs or space for a large veggie patch, you can become a direct force in your own food production. For dwellers in small residences, use the windowsill and balcony to grow herbs and fruit trees in pots. For those with larger gardens, plant vegetables in seasonal rotation and enjoy the freshest there is. It is really important to involve children in gardening, to aid their understanding of the connection between soil, food and their own health. Start children with easy-to-grow plants, such as radishes, herbs and peas. Encourage children to eat some of their crop raw, straight from the garden, so that they can taste just how delicious a fresh pod of peas or cob of corn really is.

, Not everybody can cook. Those who are infirm, disabled or simply too busy to consider the value of slow food are just some examples of people who are not in a position to cook. Share your cooking talents around to help out those less fortunate; and if you are trying to convince others about the message of slow food, what better way than by setting the example with your own delicious food? Tempt them...

, The earlier that children get involved in the kitchen, the better. Children who know how to cook are not at the mercy of the fast food industry and know automatically how easy it is to whip up their own fresh food at home. Moreover, in teaching kids how to cook, you share a family tradition together that will bind you closer together and this helps to pass on traditional family knowledge. Encourage kids to enjoy cooking at home by letting their imaginations take a key part in the cooking process; creating shapes and food themes is a fun part of making food for the table, as in this image.

, For work, school, outings and play, take a home-prepared lunch. Soup can be kept warm in a thermos, sandwiches can be kept fresh by pre-cutting the filling but only adding it to the bread at lunchtime and homemade baked goods, cut fruit and veggies, salads and leftovers can contribute to a well-rounded and tasty lunch that lets you spend more time enjoying your lunch hour and keeping extra money in your wallet. Save that extra money for a delicious meal once a month in a restaurant that follows Slow Food principles.

Create barriers.,
Cover with plants.,
For example, if you have a business with a large empty wall, you may plant vines on the roof of the building that cascade down the side.,
Paint a mural or graffiti art.",How to Deter Graffiti1," Install fences, gates, or locks to prevent easy access to an area. If you already have a wood fence that is not working, consider installing a metal fence or a chain link fence that is less attractive to a graffitist.Paint your fence as well. Unpainted fences attract graffitists.Consider a privacy fence or gate to protect your home or small business.;
, Cover a space with vines, plants, or shrubs. Plants add to the beauty of a property and will make it more difficult for someone to reach the surface. Graffitists want an area with easy access.You can also place a sign that says “Beware of poison ivy.” Most people are not able to identify position ivy, and they may avoid the area all together.
Thorny bushes such as roses, barberry, and pyracantha are an extra deterrent. They cover the area and are painful if someone tries to walk through them.,


If you have an exposed fence, you could plant bushes in front of the fence.

, Ask local artists or students to come and paint your walls. If you're a business, ask them to create advertising for you. A covered wall is much less inviting. If you're a homeowner, consider painting on any exposed areas such as walls and fences. Even patterns can serve as a deterrent because they take away the ""blank canvas"" appearance.Involving local artists and high school students also creates a sense of community and provides a positive outlet.

Visit your regional or local Greenpeace website.,
Decide whether you want to work or volunteer for Greenpeace.,
If you decide to work for Greenpeace, check out their website in your local area for vacancies or check out Greenpeace International if you're happy to go somewhere else in the world.,
If you decide to become a volunteer, fill out the form on the ""Volunteer"" section of the Greenpeace website with your current contact information.,
Review the ""Take Action"" section of the Greenpeace website.,
Contribute a tax-deductible donation toward Greenpeace's efforts.,
If you're in the United States, consider applying to complete a semester of college at Greenpeace's headquarters in Washington, D.C.,
Share information about Greenpeace and their initiatives via word of mouth, email and social media networks.",How to Get Involved With Greenpeace," Review the website to familiarize yourself with what Greenpeace advocates for and the ways in which it expresses its environmental activism. Although Greenpeace has a worldwide presence, they may focus on issues particular to your local area and it's a good idea to find out what they're actively working on, to find out if you are interested in becoming a part of such a campaign.


Also check out Greenpeace's news feed and social media pages to see what the up-to-date issues are and to catch any calls for immediate assistance. Even spreading the word of a particular campaign via Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc., can be a big help when others find out more about the issue. Even if all you do is retweet their tweets, you're doing them a big favor!





;
, There are often job vacancies available with Greenpeace but you'll need the specific skills required (such as fundraising, communications and media, project planning, expedition planning, scientist, etc.) and you may need to relocate. Also expect fierce competition for most positions. Alternatively, you may wish to donate some of your free time as a volunteer, in which case you're more likely to be able to participate fairly quickly and in a fairly broad range of activities.


The types of jobs you might be able to get include crew on board a Greenpeace ship, software analyst and developer, campaigner, researcher, financial controller, human resources, database manager, technical manager (of ships), coordinator, etc.
The types of volunteer positions you might be able to get include cyber activist, office work, campaigner, community leadership, sewing, carpentry, marketing, painting, etc. Opportunities can last from a few hours to a year or so., Read through the selection criteria to see if you meet the requirements, then apply as outlined. Avoid simply sending in your resume hunting for a non-advertised job, as you're not likely to get anywhere doing so; it is better to inquire and speak face-to-face with someone about non-advertised possibilities, or to join as a volunteer first and to be alert for job opportunities as they come up.


In the USA, you can find job applications at: http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/about/jobs/.






For Greenpeace International, you can find job applications at: http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/about/jobs/. A second or more languages would probably be helpful for international positions.
For other countries, check your individual Greenpeace website.

, You will be asked to submit an 80- to 100-word statement explaining why you would like to volunteer.


You must be older than 14 years of age to be considered for volunteer opportunities in the USA. This age limit varies by country (for example, it's 18 in the London, U.K. office), so check the website for individual details.






The Greenpeace website says that it has volunteer opportunities for everyone, no matter where they live, although you do need to check passport/residency restrictions for each area to be sure you meet the requirements. Greenpeace offers many volunteer positions that could include traveling and participating directly in clean-ups and other types of activism or working on local campaigns.

Recycle.,
Stop driving everywhere!,
Reduce your impact on the planet.,
Minimize your water usage.,
Support animal welfare.",How to Help Change the World2," It's not something only hippies do! Anyone can recycle, and these days just about anything can be recycled—from newspapers and plastic, to computers and old mobile (cell) phones. Encourage your school or workplace to recycle and to use recycled products.

, You probably already know that vehicle emissions are bad for the planet. What you may not know is how you can reduce your emissions: Start walking to nearby places. Use public transportation whenever possible. You can also do things like riding a bike to work instead of taking a car. If you need to use a car, consider purchasing one which uses a mix of electricity (a renewable energy source) and gas or only electricity.

, Reduce your harmful impact on the planet by reusing items and materials when you can, using green products, buying local food and items (supporting your local economy), and conserving resources such as water. This will help protect the planet and provide a healthy environment for all people who will live on after us.


Help others to do the same by educating them about how they can reduce their impact on the planet. Remember: don't be preachy or self-righteous. You're doing this to help the planet, not so you can be smarter or better than your neighbour.

, Did you know that there will probably be a major water crisis in our lifetimes? The problem is that we consume and use water faster than we can clean old and new water. Help alleviate this problem by taking shorter showers, being careful when washing dishes, not leaving the water running when you brush your teeth, and generally paying attention to how you use water.


Another thing to avoid is watering your lawn in the summer. Collect and use gray water for this purpose, as using clean drinking water to water grass is very wasteful.

, All life should be appreciated if humanity is to step forward in our pursuit for a better society. Spend time supporting animal rights, volunteer at your local shelter, or donate to an organization for animal welfare. Keep in mind that most animal suffering happens to farm animals, not pets. Most people forget this, since they can't see the animals they eat. Consider going vegetarian - it's healthier, helps the environment, reduces animal suffering and might actually be cheaper! If you can't imagine being vegetarian, eating less meat also works. Remember, it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing decision.


However, do your research before donating to organizations such as the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS for short), PETA, or other big-name corporations; sometimes a large percentage of the money will not go to the animals. A great site for comparing charities is http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/

Don't buy animal food for donations. Donating your money directly to the shelter is much better, because the shelter can get food cheaper in bulk and it's hard to plan for donated goods. Fostering an animal for a short period of time is another great way to show your support of animals, and it costs little to no money to do!

Pay it forward.,
Don’t intentionally hurt others.,
Laugh and smile!",How to Help Change the World3," Seen the movie? Well, just like Haley Joel Osment, you can help others by ""paying it forward."" Simply do something nice for 3 people (or, preferably, more and with no limit) without being asked, and in return, tell them to do the same to 3 more people. And so on and so on. Imagine if everyone followed through with this and what kind of world it would be!

, Imagine a society where every single person did not look to harm another individual. You wouldn't have to lock your doors at night and self-defense would be a thing of the past. You may think one person cannot make a difference. The whole world is just seven billion individuals. Just think, you may inspire someone to be like you and start a chain reaction!

, Many believe that laughter is the best medicine you can have. Not only that, but people who are happy are often more healthy and are lots more fun to be around! Sharing a smile and a laugh with someone is easy, completely free, and may just make someone's day! When your happiness is contributing to the happiness and well-being of other people and the planet, that's called sustainable happiness!

Keep property clean and neat.,
Use protective coating.,
Improve the lighting.,
Limit access to your roof.",How to Deter Graffiti2," Properties that are not well kept tells others that you do not care about your property. Vandals are more likely to put graffiti on these properties because they think that they can get away with it. Broken fences, unkempt landscaping, and litter are all signs that you do not care.Keep the spaces around your property clean as well.

, Coat vulnerable surfaces with anti-graffiti coatings to prevent damage. While the coating will not stop someone from damaging the surface, it will be much easier to clean and will result in much less damage. Coatings are either “sacrificial” or “barrier.”Barrier coatings are the most prevalent and they are permanent.
Sacrificial coatings are not permanent and must be reapplied after the graffiti has been removed.
The type of coating you use will depend on the type of surface you are trying to protect. You can find these coatings at hardware and paint stores.These coatings can damage the surface. Speak with a professional at the hardware store or a professional painter or contractor to find the best option for your property.

, Graffiti artists like to work in the dark where other people can’t spot him. By increasing the lighting, you decrease the desirability of your space as a canvas. Motion-detecting lights are a good way to save on energy while still getting the much-needed lighting effect.Place the lights in hard to reach places. You do not want your lights to get vandalized as well.

, If you are a business, move your dumpsters away from the walls of the building. Cover your drainpipes to prevent people from scaling them. Also, check for movable objects such as benches. Graffitists are always looking for items that give them access to lights or signs where they can display their work."

Talk with local authorities.,
Add security cameras.,
Use a local neighborhood watch.,
Remove graffiti quickly.",How to Deter Graffiti3," Let your local police know that you are concerned about graffiti in your neighborhood. Point out any vacant properties dimly lit areas and any other places that are prime spots for graffiti. Ask the police to patrol these areas a little more.The local authorities may also suggest some other methods of deterrence that you have not thought of.
Developing a relationship with your local police creates a team approach to deterring graffiti.

, Good quality security cameras are expensive but even cheaper ones have a deterrent effect because people see them and assume that they are being filmed. Erect them where they are obvious and be sure to secure them well.


Post signs that say “All activity is being monitored.”
You can even add security cameras and never turn them on. People will automatically assume that they are being watched.

, Join up and place the signs about your area. Be sure to do your bit as others help you out too. Attend local meetings to discuss happenings in the area and to come up with ideas for dealing with challenges as a group.You can also contact your local Keep America Beautiful affiliate to create a graffiti awareness program for your neighborhood. Call (203) 659-3000 or email info@kab.org.Suggest graffiti deterrence as a topic for a watch meeting and invite local law enforcement.

, If you become a victim of graffiti, remove it within 24 to 48 hours. If you remove it quickly, there is very little chance of it becoming a reoccurring problem. If the graffiti is in a public area next to your property, call your city and county officials to report it as soon as possible.Graffiti vandals take pride in their work and do not want it to be erased quickly.
Graffiti tends to attract more graffiti. So removing it quickly will prevent others from damaging the area.

Understand what's wrong.,
Identify specific problems.,
See the world.,
Consider what you want to change.",How to Change the World1," Read the news and magazines. Ask questions. Broaden your awareness as far as you can. The world is a wide and wondrous place, and you won't be able to change much if you don't understand what's going on out there.


Don't just read your local news – read news from other cities, other states, other countries. Read opinions and accounts from people who live across the world.
Watch documentaries and TED Talks.Listen to lectures. Focus on specific subject. Try to learn as much as you can.;
, It is one thing to say that you want to change the world because you sense an imbalance. It is another to say: There is war in Palestine; there is a drought in California; there are people dying in refugee camps in central Africa; there are rainforests being burned in Brazil; there are entire island nations in the Indian Ocean that are being evacuated due to rising sea levels. There is a lot to change!

, Travel to foreign lands, if you can, and speak to locals about the way that they live. Visit people in your community who live differently than you – people who make more or less money; who are younger or older; who come from a different ethnic or religious background. Use the Internet to supplement and share your explorations. Try to drink in as much of this planet as you can. Learn to love it.


You don't need to have a lot of money to see the world. Think about how much you can experience just by walking down the block, or visiting a neighboring city. If you truly want to travel, you can find a way.
Try to learn from every experience. When you visit a foreign country, don't cut yourself off from the culture. Immerse yourself!
If the thought of travel for travel's sake seems too hedonistic, think about taking some sort of service trip. Volunteer to build houses or protect an ecosystem; join the Peace Corps, Doctors Without Borders, or another international aid organization; WWOOF and help out local farmers in a work/trade situation. Find a way to give back!

, Try to pick out the issues that resonate most with you. Ask yourself what feels important. Perhaps you want to spend your life battling climate change, or purging slavery from the world, or saving a species from the brink of extinction. You might change the world in one big way, and you might change it in many small ways.


There are many ways to change the world. You can change a rough stone to precious diamond.Just you have to find the way.

Remember that you don't need to do it alone.",How to Change the World2," It is a grand intention, to be sure, and you can certainly find a way to make a difference if you have the will and means to do so. However, it's important to remember that ""changing the world"" usually doesn't mean ""fixing everything about the world."" It typically means something more like, ""encountering a problem and fixing that problem."", Even the quickest and most decisive revolutions take months or years of groundwork.Patience brings Reward. Don't expect to change the world with one big, heroic act. Try to live your values each day, even if you don't see much appreciable change on a day-to-day level. Work hard and don't give up.Be Patient


Even if your cumulative actions don't change the world, you'll be able to say that you lived a life you're proud of. You might inspire or teach others by example. You may find that change occurs when you least expect it.

, Be patient and intentional – but not too patient. Set realistic goals for yourself, but try not to lose your fire in the details. Your desire to change the world is powerful as long as it burns within you.

, There is a quote, often (dubiously) attributed to Pablo Picasso: ""The purpose of life is to discover your gift. The meaning of life is to give it away.""Consider what you love doing: a thing that sets you afire with passion, that consumes you, that holds your focus for hours at the hint of a spark. Do that thing, even if no one else is doing it. Find a way to share it with the world.Consider all the various ways that people have changed the world. Nelson Mandela changed the world by combating Apartheid; Henry Ford by popularizing the automobile; Steve Jobs changing personal computers; Gutenberg by inventing the printing press; Marco Polo by traveling widely and connecting cultures. You can draw inspiration from someone else, or you can forge your own way.
Read about people who have changed the world. Seek inspiration in their stories. These people can be almost anyone that you admire: not just Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Steve Jobs, Jr., but Bill Gates, Abraham Lincoln, or Bill McKibben.

, Try to get to the root of the fantasy in your head. What does it really look like, in your mind's eye, to ""change the world?"" Is it writing a book, patenting an invention, organizing people, saving a species? There are so many ways to make a difference, on myriad magnitudes. No doubt, some of these avenues will catch your fancy more than others.

, Martin Luther King, Jr. made his marches and speeches with the help of hordes of passionate activists. JFK didn't avert the Cuban Missile Crisis single-handedly – he did so with a brilliant board of ministers and advisers. John Lennon may never have helped so many people ""Imagine"" without the rest of the Beatles. Live passionately and create gravity around your values. As you begin to gather momentum, you may draw other passionate people into your orbit.



Organize a club or a discussion group. Gather some of your friends to volunteer with you. Share your thoughts on social media and try to spread the word. Consider that things might happen much more quickly if there are others involved.
Libraries will often let you use their facilities for free to start harmless, non-controversial groups. If you can't do that, check out the price for the community building rental. Or: simply host meetings in your home!
Try joining an existing organization. Volunteer for a nonprofit, or donate to a charity, or apply for a service program. If you don't know where to start, there are a lot of good people already out there making difference.

There are other, less public ways to show your support!

, If you don't have much time to get involved, consider giving a portion of your income or savings to a nonprofit or charity organization. One simple meal can cost as little as 19 US cents to produce – and most groups will take any amount of money that you can spare. Use websites like and to determine which charities are best at churning donations into change.Read about ""effective altruism."" This movement aims to use evidence and reason to find the most effective ways to change the world. For instance, if you already make a lot of money, it might be more logically ""effective"" to donate half (or some large portion) of your income instead of quitting your job to take a low-paying service-oriented position., Attend events focused on a certain cause, or events that are meant to bring thoughtful people together. Ask a local nonprofit if they need any help. If you're really committed, look for jobs with nonprofits and other ""social good"" organizations that might allow you to build a livelihood from your values.

, The depth of your commitment depends on how much time you have. If you can afford to travel to another part of the world to, say, build houses or distribute medicine – do it! If you can only spare the weekends, or a few days a month – do what you can! Giving even a little of your time is more proactive than giving none of your time.


Look into volunteering at local libraries, churches, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and beach cleanups. Volunteer to canvass for a politician that you believe in, or to gather signatures for an important petition. If you don't know where to start, there are websites like that can help connect you with causes you care about.Remember that you don't need anyone else's permission to start volunteering your time. You can do almost anything, at any moment, to promote what you believe in. Consider picking up trash in your neighborhood when you have a free afternoon.

, Think about which sort of job might put you in the best position to change the world. You could be a politician, an activist, a journalist, a minister – there are a lot of ways to get paid for adding value to the world. Start researching on sites like to find jobs in fields that feel valuable.


If you aren't ready to think about a career, consider making a commitment to a long-term service position. Look into the Peace Corps or Americorps. These organizations can be a great way to make a difference, learn about the world,and prepare yourself for an even more impactful future."

Ignore your gut instinct.,
Clarify your value system.,
Research the issue in depth.,
Relate the facts of the issue to your values.,
Go beyond forming your opinion and ask yourself how you would defend your stance on the issue if someone were to question you.,
Advocate for your issue.,
Remain open minded.",How to Make Up Your Mind About an Issue," Your gut instinct is founded on your prejudices and personal experiences, and no matter how hard you've aimed to seek balance in how you perceive your experiences, residing within them are your own interpretations of the world. When assessing an issue for the first time, your prejudices and experiences will make it harder to evaluate the issue objectively. As such, always be aware of what your own biases are, where they come from, and what impact they have on the debate before you. Be prepared to try to suspend your biases while working through your understanding of the issue.


Read How to overcome personal prejudice and How to overcome prejudice for more information.;
, Write down your values, going from what you believe to be most important to the least important. Think very carefully about what each value or expression of that value means to you and how it impacts the way in which you view the world and complex or divisive issues such as the one before you. Part of this exercise is to help you understand the importance of trying to justify your decisions as you make them. Here are some examples of values to consider when writing out your list:


Justice (personal and societal), life/health (including reproductive and mental health), national/cultural identity, freedom, security, morality, human rights, human responsibilities, imperialism, socialism, capitalism, technology, environment, animal rights and welfare, and equality/tolerance.
When creating your value system, remember that you are not just considering yourself personally in many issues. For example, while you may be willing to risk your own life for your own freedom, you might not believe that the same should be required of other people. Therefore in this case you would place ""life"" before ""freedom"" in importance.
Think about what personal things have happened to you in life that have cemented your ideas about certain issues. Being aware that you base some of your values in single occurrences that upset, angered, or scared you is important.

, Research will enable you to go beyond simply repeating the media headlines and what your neighbor, spouse, or parents say. While it's helpful to listen to people objectively, it isn't helpful to be swayed by noisy, repetitive, and emotional hubris based solely on other people's comfort zones and hearsay. By all means listen to what others have to say but be prepared to research the facts hidden under the noise of their agendas or preferences.


Read arguments from varying perspectives. There are usually at least two perspectives to any discussion or dispute but there are frequently more, and many shades of gray in between. Be prepared to read widely across the varying opinions, both ""expert"" and ""general"", and try to see why different people hold differing perspectives, as this will go a long way to enlightening your own understanding of the issue.
Understand the difference between facts and opinions. While opinions are useful guideposts for you provided you think about them critically, facts are the aspects of the debate on which you should be able to rely objectively. Unfortunately, finding the facts is not as easy as it seems, especially if the facts come from research studies which have been colored by the researcher's own values. This means that you need to read more broadly than simply looking to one or two authors/experts/commentators in any field, to ensure that you're not just being exposed to a biased viewpoint. Read about the issue from a variety of researcher's studies, media news, opinion pieces, blogs, peer reviews, history, etc., in order to get a more balanced view.
Even within those holding your own beliefs and values, you will find varying levels of comprehension and perspectives. Which of those match most closely to your own and why? Always be very aware that there will often be convergences between differing opinions and it is prudent to look for those to see where compromises can be made successfully. However, keep in mind equally that convergences in extremist views are generally not about compromise positions but are often based on shoring up one societal group's benefits at the expense of anyone else, with little room for debate. Beware anything that claims to represent the absolute truth or understanding of the issue.

, After you've done the research and reflected over the matter, draw the threads together to firm up your stance on the issue. Ask yourself which solution or side is closest to reflecting your values and beliefs.


When deciding on an opinion, avoid focusing on blame and instead focus on solutions or change that can be made. For example, on the issue of pollution you might decide that humans are responsible, but you should focus on how humans can change their habits or reverse the effects. Taking a proactive approach moves everyone forward, while blame causes everyone to continue debating and to look to the past.

, Ask yourself the opposite questions to see if your answers ""hold water"" when questioned.



Play devil's advocate with someone you can trust and you know you can have a good conversation with. For the sake of being contrary, question everything that they say about the issue and work through it together in this way. It's probably a good idea to let the other person know that this is what you're up to, or they might think you're being rude or difficult!
Here's a hard but effective method: when you have a strong opinion about an issue, write an essay defending your opinion with as much evidence and actual citations as possible. Then, write another essay defending the other side, again with evidence and citations, considering that side's arguments seriously and being scrupulously honest and putting in as much effort as you did for the first essay. How do you feel at the end of writing both?

, Now that you have a well thought-out opinion and the knowledge to back it up, participate in the larger discussion. Publish essays, write letters, demonstrate, or maybe create your own organization to make your goals a reality. Even just talking with family, friends, and community members is an important means for getting out your message and understanding.


If you find your emotions keep getting in the way of your delivery of your opinion, go back to the research information. Draw on that to back up your statements and opinions rather than blathering out emotionally charged vitriol. People respect cool-headed, constructive arguing but emotional tirades are soon dismissed as too much effort and a load of hot air.

, Keep an open mind at every point, even after you've decided on your values and opinions. It's very easy to have made an error or missed something in this process. Moreover, as more information comes to light or as other people argue their cause and perspectives, you may find yourself seeing aspects of their argument that appeal to you that might rightly form a part of your outlook. Being able to accept when your own opinion and ideas need adjustment is a sign of healthy growth and a lively mind, one destined to keep up with events as they unroll rather than remaining mired in a single decision taken once and never budged from again. Ultimately, making up your mind is not a once-in-a-lifetime activity but part of an ongoing process in which your core values continue to hold but your willingness to continue listening and learning informs and updates your opinion.

Take advantage of the season.,
Plant small spring bulbs.,
Plant a garden to create an outward show of natural beauty.",How to Commit a Random Act of Beauty2," Whatever season you're in, it's a beautiful one and you owe it to yourself to see its beauty. Even in the middle of a freezing winter or a searing summer, there is beauty to be found for those who look. To share this beauty, here are a few things you can do:


Point out to people how lovely the day is. Point out the symmetry of the snowflakes, the shimmering haze on the horizon or the changing colors of the leaves. They may not have seen the beauty amid all their troubles all by themselves but you can bring them there through your exquisite shares of real natural beauty.
Enjoy the seasonal events to their fullest. Whether it's Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, or any other occasion, share the joy of that season by celebrating it and sharing tokens of beauty related to the event. The seasonal event provides myriad opportunities to appreciate the beauty of the season.
Make nature craft items that celebrate the abundance and beauty of nature's abundance. There are many possibilities, including making wreaths from twigs and leaves, nut sculptures, leaf prints, photos of landscapes turned into artworks, seed pictures, seed pod figurines, and much more. Give to friends and family after creating, or share your images of your creations on sites such as Pinterest.

, Crocus blends in well with grass and is one of the first flowers to blossom in the spring. You can go further and plant them surreptitiously in your neighborhood park or along a favorite walking path. They're fairly hardy and need no weeding or fertilizer when established.


Of course, never plant pest plants randomly. Always take into account what's native to your area and stick to increasing the amount of that rather than spreading invasive species!

, Many perennials and shrubs are available. As for flowers, their blooms will attract the gaze of passers-by and visitors alike, for there are few people who wouldn't feel joy at seeing flowers in full bloom!


Talk to your local greenhouse or nursery about what plants will do best in your area, as plants used to local conditions will always thrive best. By growing a locally-derived garden, not only are you beautifying the area, you are also providing yet another carbon dioxide recycling area on planet earth.

"
"
Pick up litter whenever possible.,
Beautify a public area.,
Look around.",How to Commit a Random Act of Beauty3," This may also inspire others to do likewise, and the cleaner an area is, the less likely others will litter.


If that voice in your head says, ""I didn't drop that, so why should I pick it up?"", remind yourself that the whole world is your home and backyard. Sure, you may not have made the mess but you care enough to do something about it and remind others of what really matters.
Join in other litter cleaning up efforts, on beaches, in parks and in the countryside. If you see others already collecting litter, pitch in and help.

, If you have the time and skills, find a rundown part of your neighborhood to make more beautiful. Gather some other members of the community, some paint, yarn, gardening tools, whatever and get to beautifying it. While this is probably not quite ""random"", as you'll need to plan a little, it'll seem random and beautiful to most of the community who have grown used to ugly façade and rundown areas of their local area.


Always check that it's okay to start painting or changing something owned by others. If it's a public space, check with the municipality first if the result is likely to be permanent.
Rundown buildings that never get done up can be canvases for people's dreams. Paint with chalkboard paint. Leave boxes of chalk next to the painted walls. And ask simple questions like: Who do you really want to be? or What would you rather be doing? or What should this building be turned into? Encourage a few people to write some lines, then it'll probably get a life of its own.

, Sometimes, the beauty of the world or of human life needs some encouragement or enhancement to be seen by others. Maybe that is your calling; to see what others don't and add to it, then make it clear for all else to see.

Join an organization that supports your cause.,
Volunteer your time.,
Donate money or supplies.,
Reach out to family and friends.,
Promote your cause on social media.,
Lead by example.",How to Become an Activist1," This could be anything from a student club to a national organization (like the American Civil Liberties Union or the National Organizers Alliance).Most activist organizations offer different levels of involvement, so you can do whatever you feel most comfortable with, whether that means attending meetings and demonstrations, making phone calls to your local representatives, or just donating a little money when you can.;
, One of the best ways to make a difference is to volunteer your time. Reach out to organizations in your community that do work for your cause, and ask how you can help.


For example, if you are interested in supporting animals in need, try volunteering at your local animal shelter or wildlife rescue. There are many ways you could help, from caring for the animals to helping with fundraising events or writing content for the web., Most activist or charitable organizations need resources to do their work. If you can’t afford to donate money to an organization that supports your cause, you may be able to donate other things they need, like clothing or canned food.


Be aware that some charities are more reputable than others. If you plan to donate money or goods to support a cause, do some research before you donate. Check out your charity’s rating with organizations like CharityWatch, Charity Navigator, or the BBB Wise Giving Alliance., Tell your family and friends about your cause, and invite them to get involved. If they are interested, share literature about your cause or just talk to them about what you have learned. If you do volunteer work, invite an interested friend or family member to volunteer with you.


If you’re not sure how to begin, start by coming up with a list of five friends or family members you feel you can talk to about your cause. Think about how you would feel most comfortable approaching them (e.g., over email, over the phone, or in person), and reach out to them in the way that feels right to you., You can use social media to help keep your friends and followers informed about the causes you support. Post informative articles, write about what you are doing to stay involved, and invite your friends to attend events or donate to fundraisers for your cause., One of the simplest and most important forms of activism is practicing what you believe in, or “conscious activism.” Practicing conscious activism means incorporating activism into your everyday life by living and acting in ways that directly support your cause (e.g., reducing your carbon footprint, using sustainably produced products, and so on).For example, if you are interested in minimizing animal cruelty, you can start by not using products made from animals (like fur or leather) and avoiding businesses that exploit animals (like circuses or SeaWorld).

Read up on your cause.,
Take classes on issues related to your cause.,
Keep an eye on the news.,
Listen to the people most affected.,
Talk to other activists.,
Look at websites related to your cause.",How to Become an Activist2," Before getting involved in a cause, it’s important to be informed about the issues involved. Check out books related to your cause from your school library or your local public library.Charities or other activist organizations devoted to your cause may be able to recommend some books to you. Check out their websites for reading lists.
Ask teachers or professors you know who may be familiar with your cause to recommend some books.

, If you are in high school or college, you may be able to sign up for classes that will help you understand your cause better. For example, if you are concerned about environmental issues, an environmental science class would be a good place to start.


Taking a class can not only help you become more informed about your cause, but it can also help you connect to others who are interested in the same issues.
Talk to your teacher or professor outside of class to get more ideas about how to get involved or educate yourself further.
If you’re not in school, or if your school doesn’t offer courses that are helpful to you, you might be able to find a free or affordable online course related to your cause. For example, Smith College offers a free online course on Women’s Activism through the edX website., Watch the news or browse newspapers, magazines, or online news publications for information about new developments related to your cause.If you are a member of a charitable or activist organization for your cause, then they may offer a regular newsletter or roundup of recent stories related to the cause.


Keep in mind that not all sources are credible or reliable. Carefully evaluate any sources you read, especially on the internet, and be aware of the author’s possible biases., If you are interested in a cause that affects other people, then one of the best ways to understand how to help them is to listen to what they have to say. If you can’t reach out to them in person, then try connecting to affected people and communities via social media, or read their stories in books or online.For example, if you are interested in helping with issues related to LGBT+ rights, speak to members of your local LGBT+ community about what kinds of issues matter the most to them, and what you can do to help. If your campus has a Gay-Straight Alliance club, that might be a good place to start., If you know other activists in your community who are involved in the cause you are interested in, talking to them is a great way to find out what work is already being done in your area and what you can do to help out.Try connecting with other activists in your area via social media, or attend meetings for organizations in your area.
If you are in school, talk to other students or teachers who are interested in your cause. Find out if there are any student organizations on campus related to your cause.

, Do a search to find the websites of activist or charitable organizations that support your cause. Read their summaries of the issues, read up on what they are doing to help, and look at any information they have about how you can get involved.

"
"
Major in a field related to activism.,
Seek internships.,
Look for activist jobs.",How to Become an Activist3," If you are in college or getting ready to start college, consider majoring in a field that will help you support your cause. For example, you could major in a field like organizational leadership, or you could focus on something more specific to the cause you are interested in, e.g., environmental science or women’s studies., If you're new to the work force, internships can be a great way to begin a career as an activist. During college or just after college, look for internships related to your interests. See if your favorite grassroots organizations and non-profits offer internships. Talk to your college adviser about where to find internships related to activism. Having a few internships completed can put you on the right track to becoming a career activist.Some degree programs may require you to complete an internship to graduate. Make sure you check your graduation requirements and complete an internship if it's necessary for your degree.

, If you are ready to start working, look for jobs that are relevant to your interests. See if there are positions opened at charities and grassroots organizations you believe in that are relevant to your skills. For example, if you have strong writing and editing skills, see if you can work as a copywriter for a grassroots organization. If you have skills with planning and coordinating events, look for work as a volunteer coordinator.Also think about other career paths that would allow you to support your cause. For example, if you are interested in public health, you might seek a career in a medical field.

Contact the appropriate federal agency.,
Draft a petition.,
Call or write your senator or representative.",How to Take Action to Help Stop Human Rights Violations1," Certain federal agencies such as the Department of Justice help enforce human rights law and prosecute human rights violations.


For example, USAIDprovides human rights assistance around the world, as well as humanitarian aid and development assistance in foreign countries. This assistance may be tied to respect for certain basic human rights.The DOJ is interested in human rights violators who have entered the U.S., or U.S. citizens who have violated human rights abroad. If you know of such a person you can provide identifying information to the DOJ. You can remain anonymous if you want.Be prepared to let the agency know the suspect's name and a basic physical description, what they did that constituted a human rights violation, and how you came to know about it.You also may provide information about non-U.S. citizens living in the U.S. to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement at 1-866-347-2423.;
, Getting signatures on a petition can encourage the federal government to take notice of a particular human rights violation.


Before you start your petition drive, research the requirements for a legal petition so you can make sure you're following the rules and that all signatures on your petition will count as legitimate and actually make a difference.
While there are plenty of websites where you can build a petition for free, many of these sites do not check identification of anyone signing. If age and residency cannot be verified, the petition cannot be considered as more than suggestive to any governmental entity., Your federal government representative may be willing to advance your interest in congress.


If the violation is occurring in a different country, you should keep in mind that interventions to stop human rights violations are seldom unilateral. However, you may be able to spur the federal government to work with other countries or work collectively through an organization such as the UN to put an end to the practice.Writing an official can help explain the importance of the issue and persuade her to put her support behind any efforts to stop the human rights violation. If there currently aren't any government actions to fight this particular human rights violation, you may be able to get the issue on the table.
Keep your letter straight and to the point, and stick to the facts. Explain what the issue is, why it is important, and who it affects."
"
Choose the organization best suited to respond.,
Read international human rights law.,
Draft your report.,
Submit your report to the appropriate organization.,
Cooperate with the organization in any follow-up activities.",How to Take Action to Help Stop Human Rights Violations2," While some organizations such as the UN have broader missions, there also are smaller organizations that focus on specific human rights issues such as human trafficking.


For example, the Carter Center's Human Rights Program has been focused on the role of religion in advancing women's human rights. If you've witnessed a human rights violation that you believe falls within that focus, you might consider contacting the Carter Center or one of the activists working in its human rights program.Organizations that monitor human rights include nongovernmental organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. These organizations monitor, analyze, and research human rights in various areas and compile reports for individual governments and intergovernmental bodies to use.While nongovernmental organizations cannot enforce laws or punish those who violate laws, they can put pressure on governments to go after those who violate human rights or enact sanctions against countries with records of human rights abuses.Intergovernmental and governmental organizations can enforce human rights laws and international treaties, but their abilities and enforcement mechanisms may be limited. Many of these bodies such as the Human Rights Council engage in many of the same activities that the nongovernmental organizations.Human rights commissions such as the Commission for Human Rights of the Council of Europe are a third type of international human rights organization. These organizations typically are independent bodies affiliated with another international governing body that report to that body., Particularly if you intend to contact an international organization such as the UN, you must be able to point to the particular part of international law that is being violated.


Basic human rights that most all cultures agree upon are articulated in documents such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.The UN website for the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights also has information on specific human rights treaties and reports on the performance of signatory countries under those treaties., When you write your report to the organization you've chosen, be sure to include all relevant information and as many details as possible.


At a minimum, your report should state all relevant facts in chronological order. Include dates, times, and places of all incidents, along with as many names as you can, both of victims and perpetrators. Include all the contact information you know along with your own.Basically, include anything and everything in your report that might help the organization investigate the report. Even if you think a detail is irrelevant, it could be what leads the investigator to find victims or perpetrators of human rights abuses and bring them to justice.
When you observe a possible human rights violation, write down as many details as possible while it's happening, including taking pictures, to establish a record you can later pass on to the appropriate organization., Most international organizations have an address or toll-free telephone number you can use to submit tips or more extensive reports about human rights violations.


Organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International all have telephone numbers and email addresses where you can send reports of human rights violations., If a representative of the organization contacts you, be prepared to provide additional details, documentation, or the names and contact information of possible witnesses.

"
"
Organize a protest.,
Go to the media.,
Start a social media campaign.,
Volunteer for a human rights organization.",How to Take Action to Help Stop Human Rights Violations3," Talk to like-minded individuals about staging a protest at an embassy or government building to increase awareness of the human rights violation.


You can use a public demonstration to increase public awareness of the issue and build support to stop the human rights violation. If you have enough people joining you, it also sends a message that you have a lot of support to stop the violations.Reach out to other groups who conduct public demonstrations on a regular basis and decide who will be in charge of which aspects of the protest.
Once you've identified the location where you plan to stage your protest, find out what permits you will need to get, how long those permits will be effective, and what those permits will permit you to do. You have the right to protest in the United States, but governments do have the ability to restrict the time, place, and manner of your protests. For example, you may be able to protest outside the office building of a company you believe is violating the human rights of its overseas workers, but you may not be permitted to blast loud music or using bullhorns or megaphones while people in the offices are trying to work., Seek attention from news networks and newspapers to help inform the public about the human rights violation.


If you are in another country when you witness a human rights violation, keep in mind that your telephone or email communications may be monitored. If you do talk to a journalist, be careful not to reveal names or contact information of any local sources over these channels. You don't want to get your witnesses in trouble.You also could consider writing a letter to the editor to major or high profile newspapers or news magazines. Include information on how readers can help join the fight to stop the human rights violations you describe. If your letter is published, you can help raise awareness about the issue among the general public., Creating viral videos or status updates on social media networks can create a groundswell of support to stop the human rights violations.


Although there has been much criticism of so-called ""Hashtag Activism,"" social media campaigns can raise awareness for your issue in a way that forces mass media and the government to sit up and take notice.
Especially if you are someone with few connections and little power to stop human rights violations on your own, starting a social media campaign can be a relatively simple and inexpensive way to get government or international officials to take action to stop the abuses you've observed., If there is already a human rights organization working on stopping the violation, consider volunteering your time to assist its efforts.


For example, Amnesty International has resources online that will allow you to sign petitions, participate in online activism, or volunteer to learn skills and work to protect human rights around the world."

, Perhaps hold a quiz night and party based on the serious topic of democracy! Award prizes for the best answers, and others will be getting an education along the way! (Make sure you know all the answers!) Things to ask people include:


Do you know the difference between the executive and legislative branches of government? Do you know where the judiciary fits in?
Do you know how proportional representation works?
Do you know how to contact your local member of parliament or local representative?
What would you do if a political matter that impacted you personally arose in your electorate?

, This can be a good exercise in finding out information first hand, rather than relying on a journalist to filter it for you according to his or her understandings and beliefs.


Many parliaments broadcast their proceedings on TV, over the radio, and online. Check online first for details, or call your local parliamentary information office.
Use the PARLINE database to easily find the websites of 261 parliamentary chambers of 186 countries around the world: http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/parlinesearch.asp.

, One of the most important parts of being in a democracy is the ability to vote. Exercise your right to vote whenever it is relevant.


Help other people to learn about the value of voting and help them to get to polling booths if they cannot get there themselves.

Define ""fad"" so that its meaning is absolutely clear in your own mind.,
Decide what is more important to you right now.,
Avoid the manufactured demands of advertising.,
Avoid watching or listening to even the best or most interesting advertisements.,
Take a few deep breaths when you are tempted to let the psychological craving and physical excitement of desire for following the leader.,
Be a leader by buying the economical, the classic and the thrifty.,
Tell yourself to wait, when the item isn't an absolute necessity.,
Plan to avoid getting into debt, and/or working longer and harder to afford more unneeded goodies.,
See the benefit of gently pre-loved items.,
Avoid being lured by coupons to purchase things you did not want or need.",How to Avoid Fads," Basically, a fad is a popular practice or interest followed only for a short time with exaggerated zeal, angelic, or enthusiasm. A fad happens when we cry ""Oh, I need that!"" even if it's not something that ever crossed our mind to own, have or use before and where it doesn't meet any particular need in our life. Fads happen in all walks of life but the more ephemeral, transitory and prone to needing replacement or updates, the more likely it is to be a fad. Some fad products and services include:


Toys – every parent knows that toys come and go as fast a child's interest. Unfortunately, giving in hits both the hip pocket and along with it, the last chance to train a child about delayed gratification.
Technology – in particular gadgets, which are the equivalent of children's toys. Tech fads include new gadgets, updates galore to existing gadgets and a perpetual insistence that every new object is faster, sleeker and better than the last. And if you've ever given in to buying a gadget now released in white after a run in black, you've participated in a particularly insidious form of a tech fad, wherein the color alone is the fad.
Dance, exercise and diet crazes – they come, they go and they take your money and leave you bewildered. And diet crazes can actually harm your health when taken to extremes of following.
Household items – for centuries we've needed the basics. But now the basics come in a range of sizes, colors, shapes, materials, textures, patterns and moreover, they've spawned a whole lot of new household items we just can't live without. It's a pity we had to build larger houses just to contain them all and forget we even own them.
Clothing and fashion – probably the most obvious source of fads, clothing
Knick-knacks – not quite toys, not quite tech, although sometimes an amalgamation of the two, these things are not the slightest bit useful, these are the things that you don't know what to do with really or why you're doing it but everyone has to have it; puzzles like Rubik's cubes and Newton's cradles, things permanently stuck in glass paperweights and wall items like singing fish fall into this category.
You name it, it's probable some bright spark is thinking about turning it into a fad so they can convince you it's essential to your life right now.;
, Is it the fad or is it your own sense of choice and putting the money in your savings rather than investing in more stuff needing dusting and an eventual garage sale. Save a lot of money on your own by picking the first option.

, Keep your money and your individual thinking. In particular, do not follow crazes and fads which are characterized by high sales figures for the time for products like clothing, toys, movie related products and games. Be aware too that there is pressure to call you an ""old fossil"" or ""late adopter"" if you don't leap on the ""I want that now"" bandwagon at the same time as everyone else. Think ""so what, at least my money's in the bank still.""

, They're aimed at enticing you and the repetition is deliberate, as it wears you down until you're supposed to feel like the last person alive without one of whatever it is. (Just remember, you're not. And even if you were, that probably makes you the last thinking person left.) Use the mute button with alacrity or just learn to totally switch off. And while you're at it, help your children to do the same and to dissect advertising messages for what they are rather than being serenaded by them.



Avoid buying the brand name fad that is the shown in movies and magazines. Be cool. Be smarter.
Think twice before buying too many items based on some pop singer or movie idol. It's not very individualistic to wear their styles or adopt their ideas. If you really must have their stuff, wait a bit. Most of it ends up in the sales bin within the year anyway, for phases of fame are as fleeting as the fad.
Don't be fooled into being a fan (fanatic) of the singers and movie stars. Their persona on screen and in the media is neither real nor meaningful. And since you don't know them personally, what you're actually adopting is what the marketers want you to buy, not the essence of that person you admire. Remember that what you should admire is the performance, rather than mimicking the performer.
Surf (change) the channels during TV commercials. Or mute and play a card game, surf the internet or read a chapter of a thoughtful book.
Delete email spam while ignoring the promotions.
Block or delete ""pop-up ads"" using a free ad-blocker that you can download.

, The initial rush and high is strong and heady, so why not take yourself to the cafe and sit down with a coffee and a magazine instead. There, think about it if you must but treat yourself to a break in the giddiness of the want first and the rush just may pass.


Resist impulsive purchases when you desire them. Remind yourself that you're likely to make a mistake by purchasing a randomly advertised item about which you know very little and didn't need in your life until you saw it.

, Talk to your friend or spouse and start to live without the latest advertised fad items and be clear of debts and unnecessary possessions. This approach may be the answer to leading a simplified and more sensible lifestyle, which will ultimately be more fulfilling and less panicked about ""keeping yup with the Joneses."" Learn to be a minimalist. Buying for necessity and economy is the opposite of buying desires and craving all the new stuff.

, Think about it while you are waiting, and analyze whether it's something you really do need.


A good rule of thumb is to wait 48-72 hours minimum after seeing the item first. During that time, if you can come up with a really good reason for how this item would benefit you and enhance your life, then it has a slightly increased chance of being a good choice. If not, then let it go.
Sleep before considering the idea of buying into a fad. Instead of giving in to a sales gimmick, learn to plan ahead and get some sleep so you can think more clearly. If a retailer is pressuring you, let them know that you need time to reflect. If they insist it's the ""last one left"", smile sweetly and remember that there is always another one somewhere and if not, well you'll live.

, If you're already in debt, you have an even more pressing need to get your financial house in order and to avoid the gimmicks and fads that lure away your hard won cash. See a budget adviser or a financial planner if you're not sure how to better arrange your finances or how to fix your debt situation.

, At one time, there was shame involved in wearing and using other people's hand-me-downs. In a time of excess though, we've come the realize that such an attitude is not only very old-fashioned but also quite ludicrous when people are swapping barely used for brand new again and again. There are so many ways to get good quality items at a quarter the price they once were, even during the time a fad on the item exists. Some suggestions include:


Shop at thrift stores and garage sales.
Look at eBay and other online auction sites. You'll find people's guilt factor writ large there with their tales of ""I bought this but it doesn't fit/no longer suits me/I preferred the next model in white after I only used this one for two weeks"".

, Coupons are simply another marketing and advertising strategy to get you to buy new products or to prefer different products. While it is possible to save a lot of money if you're into extreme coupon use, it's also a way of chewing up a lot of your time and causing you to focus on shopping and hoarding before all else. Return to buying only what you need from places you know have a decent price and spend the rest of your time expanding your knowledge and happiness.


Try the store brands of products instead of the advertised ones: buy whatever brand is on special. They are usually made by the same company that manufactured the brand labels anyway, so you save and brand snobbery loses out.
Be proud of needing less and then spend wisely.

You should give simply because you want to give, because you've found something you believe in, and because you want to do good in the world. If you're only giving to impress other people or to ingratiate yourself with someone in some way, then you're not really being generous.;
, Though you shouldn't be generous for the sake of furthering your own needs, you should know that people who are generous are known to be happier than those who are not: Being generous helps people feel more compassionate towards others, gives a stronger sense of community, and to establishes a higher self-image. While you are being generous towards others, you can also be generous toward yourself as well.If you're happier, then you'll have more of a positive outlook and more energy to do good in the world. The positive cycle will continue.

, Whether you're interacting with your neighbors or your best friend, take a look at the person you're talking to and see how you'll be able to help that person out. Maybe your coworker is really stressed and needs someone to look after her dog while she's visiting her sick mother in a different town. Maybe your best friend's car broke down and she needs a ride to school. Maybe your mother is overworked and doesn't even realize how much help she needs until you give it. When you talk to someone, start wondering about how you could help them instead of always thinking about how they can help you.

, Being grateful can inspire generosity because it will make you aware of all of the great things you have in your life. Every Sunday, sit down and make a list of at least five things you're grateful for, and take the time to appreciate those things. Think of all the good things people have done for you and never forget to thank them, even if it was for something they did months earlier. Being more grateful will put you in the mindset to be a more generous person.


If you are able to appreciate all that you have, you'll be more likely to share some of those great things with others, to help them appreciate life as well.

, Though volunteering, caring for others, and giving your time is a great way to be generous, you shouldn't forget about yourself completely in the process. Don't forget to listen to yourself and to recognize what you want and need, whether it's a nice meal out or a warm bubble bath. If you neglect yourself completely for the sake of others, you're likely to get burned out and to not have as much to give.


It's not selfish to look for your own needs and to make yourself happy. It is selfish to only care about yourself and no one else, but there is a difference.

, The next time your friend has a birthday coming up, make a big deal of it. Get a big old cake, invite some people over, and throw a party, making the person feel loved and special. Even people who claim to hate birthdays love to be spoiled and celebrated, and you should make an effort to make the people closest to you feel special. You can find any excuse to celebrate someone, from a birthday to a promotion, or just because.

, Even if it just means saying hi to someone you've never met before, giving someone a compliment in line at the grocery store, or holding a door open for someone who is carrying groceries, taking the time to be kind to people you don't know is very generous and easy to do. And if you're in a rush, then taking the time to be nice to strangers is even more generous.

, If your friend is down and needs some company, then you should be generous with your time and should hang out with that person. Make room in your schedule to spend time with that person, whether you're taking a walk, going to the movies, or having a long talk over a cup of tea. No matter how busy you are, there should always be room in your life for hanging out with friends.

, You don't have to make a fortune to donate money to a reputable charity. Even if you're only giving ten dollars a month, you'll be doing good in the world and will feel good about yourself. You should give this amount right when you get your paycheck, instead of at the end of the month, when you see how much money you have left. You'll be surprised by how little you'll miss this money. Even putting some loose change in a tip jar can be a generous act.

, Volunteering your time is a great way to be generous. If you want to be generous, then spend at least an hour or two a week volunteering at a soup kitchen, tutoring adults or children, cleaning up a community park, or doing some other good out there in the world. You can do different tasks, such as volunteering in a bookstore, or helping at a fundraising campaign for charity. Find something that gives you meaning while expanding your generosity.

, If you're with friends, share your food, your clothes, your car, your home, or any of the things that mean something to you. If you're just sharing something you don't care about, then it's not as meaningful. If you have just two delicious chocolates left and give one to a friend, that means more than giving your friend one of a hundred candy bars you don't care about.

, Give your favorite sweater to your little sister. Give your favorite novel to a friend. Give a beautiful notebook to a friend and encourage her to start writing poetry. Giving away something you don't care about isn't really generous because you're not making a sacrifice. But giving away something that means something to you, which you know will do good for others, is the height of generosity.

, Be generous with your kind words and make a goal of giving at least five compliments in a week -- or even in a day! When you talk to someone, look for a way to give a meaningful compliment, or even to say something as simple as, ""I love your necklace"" or ""Those are such cool glasses."" Even the smallest compliment, if it's sincere, can make a difference in a person's day.

, Instead of just sending a ""thank you"" email or even a text, take the time to send a card to someone who has really made a difference in your life. This will show the person how much you care and that you've made an effort to let him or her know how much his or her help has meant to you. Sending thank you cards will put you in a more giving and generous mindset.

, If you can't be there in person, give your friend a call to check in, to say hi, and to show that you care. If you can just spare a few minutes to show that person that you're thinking of him or her and to be kind and sincere, then you'll be making that person's day better, even if he or she is still struggling. Spending time trying to cheer up a person who is in need over the phone is very generous.

, Sure, you've had a long day at work, but that older person standing above you may be even more tired than you are. And the person doesn't even have to be older -- you can just sit up and give your seat to someone else because you don't really need it and because it will feel good.

, If you've had outstanding service, or if you've just been in contact with someone who needed some cheering up, then give a generous tip when the time comes to pay the bill. Write a thank you note at the bottom of the check, letting the person know how much he or she has improved your day.

, Whether you're on a stranger's blog or on your friend's Facebook or Instagram account, leaving a positive, approving comment can make the person feel better and will show that you care. Plus, it will be very generous of you!

, No matter how busy, late, or tired you may be, you should never be too tired to hold the door for someone, or to take a moment out of your day just to be polite and kind to a person near you. This simple act will make you and the person feel better, and you'll see that there's always time to slow down and help out.

, Don't just let those old sweaters or clothes sit in your closet for years. Take the time to sort through them and to donate them to charity so that someone else can find a good use for them. It won't take long to sort through them or to drive them down to where they need to go, and you'll feel good just thinking about someone else finding a better use for your clothes.

, If you see someone who needs cheering up, whether it's a stranger or one of your relatives, take a moment to make that person smile, whether you tell a silly joke, smile at them, or do a sweet favor for that person. Making someone smile can have a big impact on their day, and you'll be generous for trying to make someone happier.

Live kindly.",How to Be Kind to People Worldwide," You may have heard that misery is contagious––it is. And fortunately, kindness and happiness are even more contagious because people would rather feel good than unhappy. By demonstrating kindness in your actions and words as often as possible, you help to feed the reality that kindness is a better way for humankind. You also show others how to be kind through your examples. Spread it by doing it.;
, Kindness grows from understanding others. It is only by taking the effort to learn how others live and what they value that you can grow in understanding and thereby increase your sense of connection and altruism toward others. Try to make real connections, such as online friendships (the old pen pal system), and through undertaking shared projects together online. You will benefit a lot from learning at least one other language too, enabling you to see the culture from the perspective of being immersed in its language.

, Wherever you live, your money can be making lives better somewhere else in the world when you channel it through reputable charities. Choose your charity based on what you value and what the charity is doing to make a positive difference.

, If you have the time to donate your skills as a volunteer, you can spread a lot of kindness through your generosity of time and teaching or helping. Perhaps you have a block of time to travel overseas to a place in need of volunteer workers. Or maybe you would like to do some volunteer work through online means, such as writing reports, filling out grant applications or writing useful instructions for people. There are many online opportunities to volunteer in a way that makes a difference to the world.

, The world is also your own backyard and local community. By finding ways to improve community spirit, sharing and support you can contribute much kindness to other people. Find out what community support systems exist in your area already and what is lacking. Can you assist with existing projects or do you have the energy and time for starting something new? Some examples might include homeless shelters, soup kitchens, community gardens, child-minding facilities, vacation activities for children, sharing skills such as cooking, DIY and living self-sufficiently, etc.

, You can spread kindness through social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc. Leave stories that lift people's spirits, that recognize the good others are doing and that reveal the better side of human nature. Ask your friends to share these stories around to help even more people see what is good about the world and humanity. Crowd out the negative stories (of which there are just way too many) and shine a light on the kind, thoughtful and compassionate actions out there. Inspire others to be kind in turn.


Share amazing experiences you've had through video and photo media. What kind acts, art, sayings and the like have you seen lately? If you captured them by image or video, share them on YouTube, Pinterest, Twitter, etc., so that others can spread the awesomeness!
Take time to leave reviews of blog posts you loved, to leave references for people you know and to give people fan mail. The Internet is well known as a place where appreciation remains silent––help spread kindness by making appreciation louder than the complaints!

, As a tool, the internet itself is neutral when it comes to its use. Unfortunately, there are some users who choose the darker path when it comes to being online, using it as a soapbox for thuggery, intimidation and bullying, aiming to drown out the voices of everyone who disagrees with them. Cyberbullies, online thugs, and trolls do not define humanity. They are people whose own sense of reality is warped by whatever bad experiences they've had and have chosen to inflict on others. Whatever their motivation, don't let them win. Humankind is better than that and it is kindness that will show the way.


Where online contributors or leaders seek to harm others, stand up for those at the receiving end and show kindness as a strength. By being kind and refusing to back down from pointing out the mean-spirited nature of the attack, you avoid falling for the intimidation and refuse to join in or be swamped by it. And by refusing to allow online attacks, you spread more kindness around the world, demanding that kind words and reasoned thinking become the standard for online interactions everywhere. Do not give in!

, A globalized world means that much of what we do at work or in our businesses has an impact somewhere else. Seek to tap into your empathy to help you see the world through other people's eyes and to stop seeing everything as being all about your own problems.


Remember that real people are at the end of your actions, your supply chain, your decisions and your number-crunching. Envisioning real people will help to keep you kind and connected to others. If you don't know how people will be affected by your actions, make the effort to find out rather than block it out!

, There can be little kindness for people living under civil strife or wars. An important goal of humankind is to live together in peace, sharing knowledge and supporting each another. Sometimes we forget that. But you can do a lot if you are outside of a region suffering strife. You can support charities working in these areas, you can offer our skills and knowledge where relevant to help draft new laws, send care packages, negotiate, teach new skills, etc. You can go online and sign petitions, share news and information and support people who suffer from illegitimate actions or human rights abuses. Make peace the rule, not the option, by insisting on kindness and standing up for what's right even where it's inconvenient and unconventional.

, Wherever you are in the world, your kindness has a ripple effect. If you live life caring for other people and beings, you care about the state of the world you and your family and friends live in, and you care about humankind as a whole, your example will light the way for others. And even though you won't be aware of it most of the time, every kind deed and action will impact someone positively, somewhere in the world.


This kindness can include paying attention to where your clothes were made and if people were paid fairly for their labor.
Kindness can also be expressed towards the natural environment. You can choose to live more sustainably.

Read about war in the news, stay up-to-date on current events around the world, and research the historical backgrounds of the war-torn areas you are concerned about., In order to make your protest effective and reach the most possible people, you should carefully choose an event or location. The place you choose will greatly impact how people will receive your message. If you interrupt a church service with your protest, people might be more annoyed and less receptive than if you were protesting outside a local government office.If you want to join a protest that someone else has organized, there are many ways to find out when these events are happening. There are various websites that exist as spaces to document upcoming national and international protests.But you should also contact your local chamber of commerce or other local organizations to find out about protests that are happening in your area.

, You can make them as a big banner, or as picket signs to carry around. No matter how it looks, just make sure it gets the point across. Don't paint the words in yellow, because people won't be able to see this while driving past. Paint it in a dark color, such as black or red. Paint something meaningful on it that will cause people to want to sign your petition, such as, ""People are dying. You can stop it."" This will make people feel guilty for not doing anything, and they will proudly sign the petition to help the cause.


Don't write something like, ""End war or we'll hurt you,"" because this is against what your belief is stating.

, The sad truth is that if no one believes in what you're doing, no one is going to help you. The easiest thing to do is to get most of your friends to join you and then start looking for other like-minded people. Ask your friends to invite other people they know. Post about it on social media and ask your friends to share your post.


If you are staging a protest, the more people you have participating, the more effective it will be.

, Go to a place that is crowded, such as the park on a nice day. Set yourself up at a nice table along with some others who support the cause, and say things loudly like, ""People are dying! Only you can stop it!"" or ""Anti-War, Pro-Peace!"" These things are likely to catch others' attention.If someone comes over, tell them about your beliefs and ask them to sign your petition.


In general, you don’t need a permit to protest in public areas like parks, sidewalks, or streets. If you protest on private property, you need the permission of the property owner. Sometimes permits are required for protests if they occur on federal property or require assistance from the city (like blocking off streets).

, Open a word document, and make a page with the headline ""STOP WAR"" and include some explanations as to what you believe in. Then insert numbers with lines long enough for names. Print out a lot of lines because many people will need to sign it.


You can also create an online anti-war petition that people can sign electronically.
If your goal is to enact change in the government, consider submitting your petition to the White House. Officials at the White House will review your petition if you acquire 100,000 signatures within 30 days., Making a petition is meaningless unless you get other people to sign it. Start with your friends and family, asking for their support and signatures. After that, you can start asking strangers to sign. Post about it on social media websites, walk around crowded areas and approach people about your petition (college campuses are particularly good for this). The more signatures you have, the more credibility your cause will have.

, Take action by voting for the anti-war candidate, and encourage others to do so also. You can encourage your friends to vote for the anti-war runner, but this isn't a good idea for strangers, because they won't appreciate you telling them what to do.


If it is not an election year in your area, try getting involved in other ways. Support the anti-war candidate (or another elected official) by donating money or volunteering your time. This is a great way to support a cause you believe in.
Asking people to sign a petition is okay, but telling them who to vote for and informing them of the candidate will seem more like a campaign. Try to remain personal when asking people to help the cause, and stick to little things they can do.

, If you are serious about ending war, you need to help others believe in this too. You can host anti-war community forums in your area to discuss the issues and educate others. You can create and pass out flyers that discuss your beliefs. You can promote events in your area that support your cause. You can advertise in your local newspaper., Donate to campaigns, volunteer your time, or assist in another way. These contributions will help efforts to end war.Some good examples of anti-war organizations that you can donate your money to or volunteer with include the National Youth and Student Peace Coalitionand the Stop the War Coalition.
You can also raise money for third world countries, and specifically for those affected by war. Host a benefit, organize a raffle or auction, donate your possessions. All of these things will help those suffering from the devastating aftermath of war., In order to start an anti-war movement in your area, you’ll need to recruit other people who believe the same thing as you do. Start by asking your friends, then widen your search. Pass out fliers on college campuses. Research and contact other pacifist groups in your area, including religious organizations. Use social media to your advantage. You can create a group on a social media website and recruit members that way, though they might not all be located in your area.

, All groups have to be based on some ideology or belief. Your anti-war group needs to outline and establish a set of beliefs and goals that all of the members can agree on. These will be the guidelines for membership in the future.

, If you want to really make a difference, you’ll need to start connecting with your community and getting other citizens involved. Your presence in the community must be visible so that others will see you, know what you are doing, and potentially gain interest in your project.


Sponsor an anti-war night at a local restaurant where a portion of the proceeds go toward helping end war. Host a community event that raises money for your cause. Build relationships with local businesses who will help you and allow you to use their business as an avenue for community involvement.

, Demonstrations can be a very effective form of political activism because it shows the public how strongly your beliefs are in the context of an everyday setting. Whether you decide to do a sit in at a local restaurant or chain yourself to the doors of City Hall, your actions will show a lot of people the intensity of your beliefs and perhaps will even inspire them to look into the war more thoroughly."

, You can plant any type of flowers. Flowers make your lawn look nice while they help to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. They also attract honeybees and other cool insects.

, Is your town messy? Fix it! Grab a garbage bag and go around the city collecting waste. Make sure to wear some gloves, because trash can contain chemicals and bacteria that you don't want on your hands.

, It's amazing what can be in a river or ocean! You can find tires, chairs, shopping carts, and more. Picking out the trash will keep our fishy friends and other water-born animals healthier.

, Some states have an no idling law, which helps reduce the amount of methane gas being released into the air.

, Do not use compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs). LEDs are much more energy efficient than halogen bulbs and CFC bulbs, and last much longer. Purchase LEDs at hardware stores(like Home Depot) or online and use them in your house.

, Over 100,000 pounds of plastic bags are thrown into landfills every week. Change this by carrying your own reusable cloth bags, or, if necessary, using paper bags. Paper bags are made of wood, which is a renewable resource, but it still damages the environment when harvested. So, it is more advisable to use cloth bags because they can be reused many times and are very strong.

, If you don't need your lights on to do your work then turn them off. Try using natural sunlight by opening your blinds/curtains!, Get solar panels, start a compost pile, drive an electric car, or buy earth-friendly clothes.

Find out a bit more about the environment and the Earth's natural systems, so that you know just what is going on around you.,
Change little things you do in your everyday life.,
Be eco-friendly in the bathroom:


Turn the tap off when brushing your teeth.,
Think energy savings:


Turn off the light whenever you leave the room, even if you are going to go back in a couple of minutes.,
Think about what you throw away and what you could use more than once.,
Plant trees.

,
You could even make this a family thing.",How to Be Eco Friendly," Books and the internet are good places to find information, and they can provide loads of good tips too. Be sure to look for sound and factual material, not opinionated rants.;
, Small things can make a huge difference. Of course, you don't have to give up everything that you like and are used to. Read up on things that you can substitute that won't use as much energy or resources as the things you're currently using; doing this can lower your impact without causing you to lower your lifestyle.

,
Have quick, refreshing showers instead of water wasting baths. Just think of all that water going down the drain when it could use as much water as 3 showers in 1 bath! Showers are just as good as baths.

, It saves energy and saves fossil fuels, which are irreplaceable. Fluorescent or LED lighting is more energy efficient than incandescent bulbs.
Don’t have unnecessary energy running when you won’t use or need it. Switch off that CD player, and limit your TV to only about 2 hours a day (maximum!).
Turn off the computer when not in use.
Keep radiators off when it's not terribly cold. If it's cold, wear extra clothing.

, Be careful too. Scraps of wrapping paper and material would be ideal, unique additions to a scrapbook. Grab a piece of scrap paper to scribble down a note. And implement the 3 R's! Reduce, reuse, and recycle:


Reduce the amount of waste that is being produced, use things more than once, and give things to others that you don’t want any more. Don’t go shopping every weekend or when you get the chance to (you can reduce the amount of waste in packaging by not shopping more than 2 times a month).
Reuse things that can be used more than once, instead of chucking them away after one use. Take plastic bags, an organic cotton bag or a big bag of your own to the store. Giving things you don’t want any more to the charity shops and using materials like postcards, old Christmas cards and notes for craft all count.
Recycle more. Paper, cardboard and cards can be made into something new. Put them into your recycling bin and make sure the contents are collected when full. Who knows, those old, scruffy notes could be turned into a new notebook next fortnight! Think of new things being made out of new materials and you get the idea.
Compost organic waste in your garden instead of sending it to a landfill or incinerator. You would be giving back to the environment and having a compost pile will improve soil for gardens.

,, Encouraging the younger generations into playing outdoors will help them connect with nature and be more aware of our environment.

Understand what animal rights means.,
Familiarize yourself with the key issues.,
Read an authoritative book on the subject.,
Subscribe to related journals, magazines, and/or newsletters.,
Attend a lecture, seminar, or conference.",How to Be an Animal Rights Activist1," Many people confuse animal welfare with animal rights. While there may be some overlap in their causes and campaigns, the underlying philosophies of each are significantly different. Animal welfare poses humans as the protectors of animals and argues for their ethical treatment. Animal rights are based on the principle that all species are equal and deserving of the same rights.For example, animal welfare advocates might argue for the humane treatment of farm animals or pets, but animal rights activists believe that it’s wrong for humans to breed, keep, or eat animals at all.;
, Since animals are found practically everywhere on Earth and touch so many elements of our daily lives, animal rights include myriad causes. Understand the breadth of issues by recognizing the main global contexts in which animals are exploited or harmed.Some of the major areas of concern for animal rights activists include wildlife protection, domestication of animals, lab animals, and animals used in food, clothing, and other industries.
Take time to understand the dimensions of each area of concern by doing an online search for related articles, videos, and websites.

, The best way to get a solid introduction to animal rights is to get a book written by an animal rights expert, researcher, or scholar. Purchase a book or check one out from a library that provides a general overview of the theoretical concerns and practical issues involved in the animal rights movement.


Some authoritative introductions to animal rights include Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation, Paul Waldau’s Animal Rights: What Everyone Needs to Know, Clifford Sherry’s Animal Rights: A Reference Handbook, Julian Franklin’s Animal Rights and Moral Philosophy, and Paola Cavalieri and Catherine Woodllard’s The Animal Question., Getting periodicals related to animal rights is a great way to keep up to date on the current events and debates related to the cause. It also helps support the research and education initiatives of the animal rights groups who publish them.


If you’re looking for a print publication, try magazines and journals put out by related organizations, such as Animal Times (PETA), The UFAW Journal, The Animals’ Voice, or Friends of Animals.
Many animal rights and welfare groups, like PETA, ASPCA, the International Society for Animal Rights, Animal Welfare Approved, and many more, also issue weekly or monthly email updates. If you’d rather read online, subscribe to related organizations’ e-newsletters by signing up on their websites with your email address.

, Sometimes the best way to learn about animal rights is to hear from the experts in person. That way, you can ask questions and meet other people (in the attendees) who are interested in the subject.


If there are no lectures or seminars near you, try searching the internet for videos and documentaries related to animal rights instead. Be sure that you check the credentials of the authors and producers to make sure they are animal rights experts, researchers, and/or scholars.
Consider enrolling in a course or MOOC to get a substantial foundation.
Attending conferences can be pricey and time-consuming, but there’s no better way to get access to a huge variety of animal rights experts and activists in so short a period of time. Besides hearing panels and talks by vetted presenters, you’ll also have the opportunity to meet and have conversations with a bunch of like-minded, active people who could be potential collaborators in the future."

Become a vegan or vegetarian.,
Practice cruelty-free consumerism.,
Make animal-friendly investments.",How to Be an Animal Rights Activist2," If you believe in animal rights, start acting on that principle in your daily life by taking animal products off your plate. This means learning to eat a mostly or entirely plant-based diet. Doing so puts your belief into practice while refusing to support industries that exploit animals.There are many variations of plant-based diets. The most basic distinction is between vegetarians and vegans. Vegetarians generally don’t eat meat or products that come from the body of an animal. Vegans avoid all animal-derived products, including eggs and dairy.
Many products, like gelatin or artificial food colorings, contain animal byproducts that you wouldn’t think. Take time to educate yourself about which surprising foods and ingredients you should be avoiding with the help of the Vegetarian Resource Group: http://www.vrg.org/ingredients/.

, Don’t purchase products that contain animal byproducts or patronize companies that perform animal testing.PETA publishes a list of companies that employ animal testing available here: http://www.mediapeta.com/peta/PDF/companiesdotest.pdf. Avoid these brands when you’re shopping and instead opt for ones that explicitly advertise that they’re vegan or cruelty-free.
Be especially wary when it comes to your clothing and fashion. Many materials, like leather, silk, down, and wool, are animal-derived and their production processes involve high levels of animal cruelty. Instead, look for alternatives like cotton, hemp, faux fur, pleather, and other synthetic materials., Don’t invest in companies that create animal-based products or use animal testing. Instead, put your money where your mouth is by investing in companies that are certified as cruelty-free. That way, you will have a direct impact on changing industries to observe animal rights.PETA also publishes a helpful list of animal-friendly companies that are worth buying from and investing in. Check it out here: http://www.mediapeta.com/peta/PDF/companiesdonttest.pdf.

Weigh in on the issues.,
Donate to an animal-rights-related organization or cause.,
Get involved in an animal rights organization.,
Participate in an animal rights campaign.,
Use your skills and talents to make a difference.",How to Be an Animal Rights Activist3," Now that you’ve learned about the issues and committed yourself to tackling them, it’s time to make yourself heard. Start by stating your beliefs about animal rights in influential public forums.For example, sign on to petitions, write letters to decision-makers, and send editorials to newspapers. If there is a hearing about a particular issue, such as the development of wetlands, sign up to give testimony.

, Animal rights groups need monetary backing to support their good work. Pick an organization that is running campaigns that you believe in and that are garnering measurable results.Most organizations make it easy to donate by having secure, online tools for making one-time or monthly contributions.
If you choose a registered nonprofit, your donations are tax-deductible.

, Join and/or volunteer with a group that’s dedicated to animal rights. Membership usually involves paying dues, attending meetings, being on their contact list, and participating in sponsored events and campaigns. Check locally to see if there are organizations that are active in your area. The site Their Turn has a handy locator tool for tracking down a group near you that’s available here: http://theirturn.net/animal-rights-group-locator/.
If you’d like to get involved with a major player in the cause, here is a helpful online list of the biggest animal rights groups internationally with links to each: https://speakingofresearch.com/extremism-undone/animal-rights-activists-organizations/.

, If there’s a specific issue, such as factory farming or cosmetics testing, that speaks to you, get involved. There are plenty of ways, large and small, to lend a hand.


Some informal ways to get involved include signing a petition, sharing information on social media, or attending a demonstration.
Some more formal ways of participating include attending organizing meetings related to the campaign, volunteering your time to a related event or effort, or taking on a leadership role.

, The best activism takes advantage of the knowledge and experience that you already have. Ask yourself how you can use your education, career, and/or hobbies to help the cause of animal rights.


For instance, if you are an artist, do a show or exhibition that engages the public in the cause. If you’re a businessperson, set up a seminar to inform people in the industry about why investing in cruelty-free companies is good business.

Set up a meeting to discuss a plan of study with your assigned counselor. Discuss how best to prepare for the rigorous math and science demands of climatology coursework at the university level.


For example, ask your counselor something like, “To be accepted to a climatology program, how much math, science, and computing coursework do I need?”

, Look into after-school clubs and organizations that focus on science, math, and computing activities. In addition to improving your chances for college acceptance, taking part in these groups can expose you to ways in which your studies can be used outside the classroom.


Ask your counselor about joining a local club sponsored by 4-H,which is an organization that provides after-school professional development programs to middle- and high-school students."
"
Consider possible career paths.,
Select a course of study.,
Match departments with careers.,
Choose a school.",How to Be a Climatologist2," Before choosing a course of study, think about what type of job you would like to have. Much climatology work done today focuses on climate change science, and involves developing models to predict future climate trends.


One area of specialization, paleoclimatology, studies how climates have changed over time, which helps us to better understand current climate trends.If you’d prefer to do research, plan to stay in school long enough to get a doctorate.

, Courses related to climatology are offered through a variety of academic departments. Most of these fall under the heading of the atmospheric sciences, of which climatology is a branch.University academic departments that offer studies in climatology-related subjects include departments of Earth System Science,Environmental Science,Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences,and Meteorology and Atmospheric Science.Other areas of study that can prepare you for work as a climatologist include physics, geology, chemistry,computer science, and geography., Before you choose a school, it will be necessary to find a course of study that can train you for the field you want to work in. Call academic departments to ask whether the coursework offered through their majors is meant to train students for particular types of work.

, When deciding where to pursue studies in atmospheric science, take into account the department’s reputation,and whether it offers courses related to the branch of climatology you’d like to work in. On the department’s website, look for information on internships as well, since this will be an important part of your professional development.


Use the following resources to search for an academic department in the atmospheric sciences: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Library,and the American Meteorological Society's Colleges and Universities Index.To get a sense of a department’s strengths and emphases, call the department to ask about where recent graduates have found work.

"
"
Talk regularly with an academic advisor.,
Apply for an internship.,
Apply for fellowships.,
Pursue an advanced degree.",How to Be a Climatologist3," Once you enroll at a university, get in touch with the department that offers the climatology-related major you intend to pursue. Ask to speak with the department’s undergraduate advisor, who should be able to help you arrange the first quarter’s or semester’s coursework in line with your career interests.


As you progress in your studies, your professional interests may change. Meet with your advisor at least before each registration period to discuss adapting your coursework to other careers.

, It's never too early to start looking for an internship once you've begun your university studies. Be sure to ask your academic advisor about the internships offered through the department in sectors of professional climatology that interest you.


Many internships are available through the same government-supported agencies that employ about one-quarter of climatologists nationally, such as NOAA,the EPA, NASA,and NCAR/UCAR., A fellowship can provide partial or full funding for your undergraduate or graduate studies, offer placement in a government agency, or link up postdoctoral scientists with research positions.Talk to a professor or advisor about how you can take advantage of fellowships to advance your career in the field.


The EPA offers a range of fellowships that undergraduate, graduate, or post-doctoral job-seekers can take advantage of., Jobs in climatology are more widely available for people with a graduate degree. A master's degree is required for many positions, and a Ph.D. is typically necessary in order to do research.Job competition for climatology positions is expected to increase, as graduates will increasingly outnumber job openings. Holding an M.A. or Ph.D. will significantly improve your job prospects."
"
Consider government jobs.,
Look at working in private industry.,
Join a professional organization.,
Be prepared for your interview.,
Maintain IT skills.",How to Be a Climatologist4," About one-fourth of atmospheric scientists are employed by government agencies--primarily by the National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Armed Forces.Many of these jobs involve research, for which you'll need an advanced degree. These agencies offer a number of internships that can give you an employment advantage once you've received your degree.

, In the near future, the most jobs in the atmospheric sciences will be offered by private companies.Taking basic courses in business administration and economics can help strengthen your resume for job possibilities in the private sector.


Companies are hiring climate forecasting and modeling teams to help them prepare for the severe weather that is increasingly disrupting business.
Also, as utilities companies use more solar and wind power, they are hiring climatologists to help them forecast when they can sell their excess power, and when they'll need to buy power., There are several associations of people working in the atmospheric sciences. These groups mainly promote climate- and weather-related research, and they are also an excellent way to form a professional network with scientists in your field. The more fellow climatologists you know, the more likely you’ll find out about a job possibility through them.


Consider becoming a member of organizations such as the World Meteorological Organization,the American Meteorological Society,the Royal Meteorological Society,the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society,the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society,and the American Association of State Climatologists., Once you’ve been offered an interview for a position, learn as much as you can about the company, organization, or other institution offering the job. Get a good sense of the job duties as well, since you’ll likely be asked about your knowledge of and experience with specific tasks.


Ask a friend or colleague to help you do a mock interview. Have them ask you questions such as, “Why would you like to work for our company?”, “How did you become interested in climatology?”, and “Explain how your background has prepared you for this job.”

, Taking refresher courses to brush up on the computer science skills you learn as an undergraduate can be a valuable asset for your job search. Consider enrolling in the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research program called COMET, which offers students and professionals online courses for keeping up-to-date on the latest technology developments in the atmospheric sciences."

Yet, responsible eco-travel is not difficult and is generally about being considerate:


Travel as lightly as you can
Choose transportation that minimizes your impact
Stay in accommodation that aims to minimize its impact on the environment
Choose vacation activities that are eco-friendly
Be conscious that your small actions do add up, such as unplugging your charger when it's done
Be considerate of the social impacts and support the local economy, interact appropriately with the locals and if possible, contribute to local environmental projects in some way.

, There's no need to have a hair shirt mentality about eco-vacations. Eco-friendly accommodation and activities are now commonplace and often have very high standards. It's easy to find eco-travel opportunities using the internet, so you don't have to research the hard way anymore. And there is also a range of prices from budget to top end prices, so you can choose the price according to your available funds and still have a great experience.

, Email and the internet make it easy to ask in advance for the qualifications or accreditation of places you want to visit and stay at. Prefer places that use the accreditation of independent auditors rather than simply stating ""eco"" in front of their services. Always check the labels to avoid green washing.

Reuse bedding and towels. If the hotel offers this as a feature, be sure to do as instructed so that the items are not taken away by cleaners each day.
Recycle all products that are recyclable. If the place you're staying in doesn't seem to have recycling facilities, inquire at the front desk about where you can find them. Most green hotels and resorts will use in-room or nearby recycling bins to assist you.
Only charge as much as needed and then remove the charger from the plug. Once the charger indicates that your batteries have been recharged, leaving them in any longer is a waste of energy.
Wash your clothes by hand in your room or use an efficient local laundromat rather than resorting to dry cleaning services.
Switch off lights and appliances before leaving the room. When in your room, only use those lights and appliances that you really need to use. Perhaps you can open a window instead of turning on the air conditioning, or just use a bedside light instead of the overhead lights.
Treat water as the precious resource that it is. Use only as much as you need to shower/bathe and to clean your teeth and flush. If the hotel or resort is experiencing water shortages, follow the instructions for saving water as indicated by the establishment. Do your bit to ensure that other people can enjoy what you're enjoying.
Share books instead of buying new ones. Once you've read your book, leave it at the place of stay for the next traveler to enjoy. Many places now provide for this exchange of books, allowing you to pick up a new one for free to read as well.

Join a Christian environmental movement.,
Hold environmental information seminars at your church.,
Be an environmental steward.,
Spread the word with fellow Christians and non-Christians alike.",How to Be a Christian Environmentalist," Nature is of value in itself because God created it. We are disrespectful when we do not heed this. Genesis 9:12-13. And God said, ""This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will he the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.;
, God did not place us here to destroy but to protect, to use well, to hold things in trust for each generation. A good Christian will recycle, be frugal and care for the environment as a matter of course, without even having to call these actions ""environmental"". Luke 12:15,23,34. And He said to them, ""Beware and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does life consist of his possessions. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

, There are many in every country; be with like minded people who share both your faith and your cause. Exodus 23:2. Do not follow the crowd in doing wrong.

, Even Sunday School classes can teach students about God's creations in an environmental context. Leviticus 26:3-4,6. If you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands, I will send you rain in its season and the ground will yield its crops and the trees of the field their fruit... and I will grant peace in the land.

, This is what the Bible states that God expects from us, not to be environmental vandals who destroy all before us:


Lev. 25:23-24. The land is mine and you are but aliens and my tenants. Throughout the country that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
Ezekiel 34:2-4. Woe to the shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves! Should not the shepherds take care of the flock? You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you did not take care of the flock! You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally.

, The environment needs our care and we are in charge of fixing the damage which we have done. Revelation 11:18. The nations were angry and your wrath has come. The time has come for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverence your name, both small and great - and for destroying those who destroy the earth.

Consider the many other ways that you might be able to minimize your impact when traveling and plan accordingly.",How to Plan an Eco Friendly Vacation8," Some of these ways won't be apparent to you until you are actually traveling, so be ready to adjust your approach as you go. A few of the things you might like to consider in advance include:


Avoid using disposable containers and items wherever possible. Eat at places that either have eco-friendly options or where you can use your own reusable container.
Take a bottle for your water and avoid buying bottled water where it is safe to do this. Where it is not safe to do so, at least see if it's possible to refill a reusable bottle at safe water locations. Only resort to bottled water where your health would otherwise be compromised.
Stay on walking trails, don't touch cultural artifacts and the like when told not to and use your common sense about preserving human and natural heritage.
Pack it in and pack it out. Never leave your trash anywhere than the appropriate disposal places.
Never buy plant or animal products that are endangered.
Consider offsetting your unavoidable carbon footprint. Choose a reputable carbon offsetting program to do this.

Pre-schoolers require fairly simple, concrete ideas. Ideas such as saving water, planting flowers, recycling, or cleaning up trash outside works better than more abstract ideas like species extinction or climate change.
Teach children aged 5 to 11 can take on more complex projects. They may still thrive on simple Earth Day activities, they can also go deeper into ideas and do more complex ideas. For instance, they can measure how much water a bath takes versus a shower. Or learn the finer points of gardening. Or calculate how much money they will earn by redeeming 25 soda cans.
Pre-teens and teenagers can get deeper into sciences, activism, and community service projects. They can also be more self-directed, choosing interests and connecting them with the world as a whole. For example, your fashion-savvy teen can look into purchasing summer clothing from companies that use sustainable materials and processes. Or ""upcycle"" thrift-store finds to reduce waste. Or perhaps take old concert T-shirts and create fun throw pillows, rather than throw them out.

, If a family decides they want to reduce car use, then make sure everyone has a bicycle, scooter or other alternative transportation source. Plan to take shorter showers and time everyone for a week or turn off lights and create a fine jar for any family member who does not.

, Choose a project that is easy to accomplish for the child's skill level. The following are great craft options:


Go through your recycling bins to look for containers, such as tin cans, that can be used as flower planters. Find soil and seeds to plant and grow your own herbs, flowers or vegetables. Egg shells and milk bottles can also be used, when their tops are removed.
Encourage children to bring a little of the outdoors indoors. Have them gather rocks and paint them for paper weights. You can also make ornaments out of pine cones or cover them in peanut butter or seeds for bird feeders.
Make a paper mache globe by gathering newspaper and other paper from the recycling bins. Mix up a batch of paper mache glue with household materials. Use a blown up balloon for the center. Once the project is dry, paint it with land and water using non-toxic paint.

, Find aluminum, plastic and other materials and give each child a bag full of mixed recycling. Give prizes to the fastest and most accurate recyclers.


It is OK to keep it simple, even for teenagers. Picking up trash at the beach is a simple activity, but it is appropriate for nearly all ages. So is gardening, or shopping at a secondhand store, or going for a bicycle ride. In fact, there is a powerful message when families and communities do simple acts together to help the environment!

Obey official warnings.,
Stay away from scum.,
Know your seafood.,
Protect your pets.,
Limit your fertilizer use.,
Reduce runoff.,
Promote water flow.,
Report potential blooms.,
Learn about cyanobacteria.,
Know why HABs are increasing.,
Recognize signs of possible exposure.",How to Avoid Algae Bloom Toxin," As the number of Harmful Algal Blooms has increased in recent years, government agencies have become more proactive in identifying problem areas and releasing warnings to the public. Before heading out to your preferred saltwater or freshwater location, check for posted warnings by the relevant local, state, or federal public health or environmental protection agencies.During the summer months, the list of impacted bodies of water can grow extensive and seem like “overkill”; in turn, you may be tempted to “take your chances.” Don’t — the problem and the risks are real and should be taken seriously. If you are advised to stay out of a lake due to an HAB, play it smart and safe.;
, HABs caused by cyanobacteria can take several forms, or may not even offer any visual evidence. However, a “scummy” foam on top of the water is often a telltale sign of an HAB. If you see it, avoid contact, stay out of the water, and contact the relevant government agency for testing.HABs can also create a noticeable odor, but that is also not always present. As cyanobacteria dies, it can emit an odor similar to rotting plants. If you smell this in the water, assume an HAB is present.
In addition to the scum and odor, cyanobacteria blooms often make water appear as though green paint has been spilled in it, or give it the look of pea soup. Sometimes, though, the coloration can be red or brown, or there may be no visible clues to the existence of the HAB. That is one reason why keeping tabs on public warnings is so important., HABs are not only a concern for people and pets, they can also have a devastating impact on aquatic life as well. Large algal blooms reduce the amount of oxygen in the surrounding water, which can negatively impact all manner of life in the water. In addition, shellfish like clams can absorb the toxins and possibly retain it in sufficient quantities to affect the health of people who consume them.While the small risk of ingesting harmful amounts of algal toxins by eating seafood should not stop you from enjoying fish and shellfish, it always makes sense to be an informed consumer. Being aware of the sourcing, freshness, and sustainability of your seafood can protect you from a range of possible contaminants and help preserve the aquatic ecosystem., While HABs can present hazards to human health, the danger is even greater for smaller animals, including pets. Among common pet species, dogs in particular have been prone to adverse impacts due to toxic exposure, for reasons including the algae sticking to their fur (which they inevitably lick) after being in the water, as well as their propensity to drink even foul-smelling algal bloom water.Keep your pets away from bodies of water when HAB warnings have been posted, and do not permit them to drink smelly, scummy, foamy, or discolored water that may contain HABs. If you discover that your pet has consumed HAB-affected water, contact your veterinarian immediately.
Signs of cyanobacteria poisoning in dogs can include: loss of appetite; decreased energy; stumbling when walking; foaming at the mouth; diarrhea; convulsions; seizures; and a host of other possible symptoms. Early intervention is important.

, Cyanobacteria feast upon nitrogen and phosphorous, which happen to be key components of agricultural fertilizers. Large-scale agricultural runoff is a far more significant cause of the recent increase in HABs, but even runoff from your backyard garden can increase the likelihood of toxic algae blooms in a nearby pond or a lake or ocean far away. (Consider, for instance, that 41% of the continental U.S. drains into the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River system.)Always use the minimum amount of fertilizer possible to achieve your growing goals. Also consider growing native flowers, vegetables, etc., which are more likely to thrive in your climate without the assistance of added fertilizers.
On a related note, look for low-phosphorous detergents for cleaning your clothes, dishes, etc.

, Along with reducing your usage of materials that are high in nitrogen and/or phosphorous, you can also work to create barriers that limit runoff into bodies of water. Allowing dense, preferably native vegetation to grow along the edges of ponds, creeks, etc., helps to limit the amount of runoff that reaches these bodies of water. Think of them as natural filters that are happy to sop up the nitrogen and phosphorous for themselves.Human waste also contains significant amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous, so if you have a septic system, make sure it is operating properly, not leaking, and emptied as needed. This can reduce the amount of leeching into the water supply.

, The churning action of moving water helps to keep oxygen circulating more effectively and creates a less hospitable environment for cyanobacteria growth. Particularly if you live in close proximity to a stagnant pond or similar body of water, consider ways in which you might increase water movement in order to reduce the possibility of HABs.While methods to improve water flow are often large-scale efforts that go well beyond the means of an individual, you can also add your voice as an advocate for such projects. These can include altering or removing dams, rerouting creeks and streams, installing mechanical circulation devices, and other options.

, Government agencies rely on the public to help identify possible HABs, in part because of the resources that are required to patrol the many bodies of water that can harbor toxic algal blooms. If you suspect that there is a cyanobacteria bloom in a body of water, don’t sit back and assume it’s “the government’s job.” Contact a local, state, or national environmental or public health agency to alert them to the possibility of an HAB. Be as precise as possible as to its location within a body of water.In open bodies of water, look for signs of discoloration (often green, but sometimes red, brown, or other colors), foaming or scum, and an unpleasant odor. While HABs rarely make it through the water treatment process, if your home water supply has a musty smell or taste, contact your local water authority promptly., Commonly known as blue-green algae, cyanobacteria is the most common cause of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). Cyanobacteria is actually a diverse genus of bacteria that can thrive in various types of warm, slow moving water, including seawater and freshwater. Cyanobacteria blooms can grow rapidly in part because they are often unpalatable to zooplankton and similar organisms that might otherwise consume them.Most cyanobacteria blooms do not produce toxic compounds, yet blooms can go back-and-forth from being toxic to non-toxic with little explanation or warning. Only frequent testing can determine toxicity.
The toxic compounds that are produced by some cyanobacteria blooms can contain possible carcinogens, and may also cause neurological problems when consumed. HABs have been reported to have killed waterfowl, livestock, and pets, and in a few rare instances, humans.

, Human activity bears great responsibility for the marked increase in HABs throughout the United States and globally. Cyanobacteria feed on nitrogen and phosphorous, which are major components of fertilizers, sewage, and organic waste. When such products reach the water supply, they create a more hospitable environment for cyanobacteria blooms.Cyanobacteria also prefer warmer water temperatures, so the rise in global temperatures, which is at least partly due to human activity, also facilitates the growth of HABs., Harmful exposure to HAB toxins can be hard to diagnose in humans, both because it is still a rare phenomenon and because the range of possible symptoms is quite diverse. Symptoms can include (but are not limited to): nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea; blood in the urine or stool; muscle twitches; general lethargy; headache and fever; upper respiratory infections; and even progressive muscle paralysis.If you are experiencing unexplained symptoms after exposure to water that may possibly have contained an HAB, contact your physician immediately. When you seek medical treatment, you may want to bring along the physician reference card produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hsb/hab/HABSphysician_card.pdf.

Use washable plates and utensils.,
Go organic.,
Use cloth.,
Use natural gas-powered grills.,
Rely on natural light.,
Avoid theming a party.,
Get the guests sorting.,
Consider providing live acoustic, rather than amplified, music.

,
Send out electronic invitations.

",How to Host a Green Event," It is always best to use what can be reused again and again, so prefer crockery over disposables. Alternatively, many stores now carry recycled, compostable plates that will go right into your composter or can be thrown away. They biodegrade quickly so they won't take up landfill space. You can find sturdy plastic cutlery made from corn or other plant sources everywhere, or visit a thrift store and buy up big on old metallic cutlery just for your green events. Whether you use plastic or metallic cutlery, be sure to tell guests to put the cutlery in the wash and not the bin so that they can be reused many times. It helps to leave a container with water and suds in it for people to put their used cutlery straight in.;
, Preservatives and substitutes like high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated oils aren't doing your body any good. Find certified organic food at most grocery stores. Better yet, find a farmer's market where you can talk to the farmer directly and ask questions about where your food came from. You can complement your fresh, organic food with a little organic wine! These days you don't need to be a sommelier to find a good bottle of organic vino. If you don't want to cater yourself, hire a local caterer who is well versed in using local, organic produce and supports the concept of sustainable dining.

, Prefer cloth items instead of paper napkins. They last a long time, are easy to wash and guests enjoy them a lot more than paper napkins. There is also a natural tendency to be territorial about one's cloth napkin and use it throughout the night, whereas paper napkins are considered used up with one wipe and people have a tendency to reach for extra ones, thereby encouraging waste.

, Unfortunately charcoal adds more than flavor to your food - charcoal could contain coal dust and sodium nitrate. The lighting fluid can make your food taste funny. The chemical effects of these products on your body and the environment are nothing to laugh about. Natural gas is the cleanest and the most energy-efficient method to barbecue. For an authentic wood flavor, soak a few hickory chips in water and throw them on the grill right before your food.

, Go outdoors and leave the lights off for as long as possible. Rely on sunlight and beeswax candles for lighting.

, Unless you can theme your party creatively using items around the house already, it is a good idea to avoid purchasing extra items to make a theme, as these will be disposed of at the end of the event and will add to the landfill. If you have items in your home that can create a theme, however, by all means, use these to decorate and then put them back in their place after the event.

, Leave recycling bins and compost bins next to the garbage bin. That way, guests are obliged to consider their throwaway choices carefully. This also saves you from having to comb the garbage bin afterward!

,,"
"
Recycle your trash.,
Make items out of clean trash.,
Compost!",How to Be  Green1," Not doing so will build up landfills, but if you do recycle your trash you will be helping the environment! Many items can be recycled, including:


Cardboard boxes such as pizza boxes, egg cartons, milk cartons, juice cartons, pet feed in boxes, etc. But before recycling the cardboard boxes you should first flatten them.
Plastic bottles and containers such as dish washing liquid, bleach bottles, foam soap bottles, salt containers, milk bottles, ketchup containers, etc. Before recycling these you should rinse them out and remove the lids.
Unclassified paper such as magazines, newspaper, etc.
Glass bottles and jars such as alcohol bottles, vinegar bottles, jam jars, sauce jars, etc. Before recycling these you should rinse them out and remove the lids.
Metal cans such as soup cans, surface polish cans, soda cans, tuna cans, etc. These should be rinsed before recycled.;
, Look at the item with a creative eye and turn that old boot into a planter, turn that egg carton into a toy dinosaur or come up with your own unique ideas!

, Composting is a great way to reduce food waste from the kitchen.


A vermicompost is essentially a box full of dirt and worms used to compost kitchen scraps like leftover fruit, vegetables, and other food waste (not meat) and is very good for composting when you live in a small space
There are plenty of ways to compost food, so consider researching a few to find one that could work for you!

Pick up trash.",How to Be  Green2," Some places where you could go to look for trash are the beach, the park or just around your neighbourhood. Cleaning up in public areas is great for the environment.

"
"
Cars are huge energy consumers, especially SUV's.,
Stop using your car.",How to Be  Green3," If your car is old, consider buying a new car that is better for the environment. Some good choices are:


Electric cars.They don't release emissions and are becoming popular throughout the market. They can cost a lot, but after that you don't have to pay for gas.
Hybrids.They do consume gas, but release less emissions. You can find them just about anywhere. Plus, they cost only $20,000 to $40,000.
Hydrogen cars. Like electric cars they do not release emissions. However, they are quite rare.
If none of these ring your bell, try hypermiling, carpooling or living without a car.

, If you decide to do something other than drive, consider the following choices:


Walking. Do this for short distances such as walking to the nearby shops or taking your kids to school. Walking also works well for people who are strapped for cash. Although walking instead of driving is quite slow, it's worth the effort and walking is actually really good for your body!
Biking. A good bike normally costs between $50 and $100 and folding bikes are portable and small enough to fit in your storage area. Just like walking, biking is very good for your body!
Catching the bus. The fares are dirt cheap and eco-friendly buses are the way to go. But be aware of traffic jams, they can ruin your day and you may have to wait on a cramped bus filled with noisy people!

Turn off all lights when you leave the room.,
Use less water.,
Wash your clothes by hand.,
Take short showers instead of baths.,
Reduce the usage of fans, air conditioning and heaters.,
Invest in a multi-purpose water ionizer.",How to Be  Green4," Lights use a lot of electricity and most of the time you don't need them! During the day, open the curtains and during the night, turn off all lights! You will be sleeping during the night anyway.


You could purchase some motion sensor switches or use led lights or compact Fluorescent light bulbs (CFL). They last 12 times longer and consume 80% less energy. But take caution using CFL's, they contain mercury. You could also get a sunroof for natural light if you wanted too.

,


Take shorter showers and turn off the taps properly and when you are not using them, especially when you brush your teeth!
Putting a big bucket underneath the shower to collect water while the shower heats up is a wonderful way to conserve water and can then be transferred to the garden or used to wash clothing.

, Instead of using a washing machine, when you hand wash your clothes you are saving plenty of water and sometimes it's quicker to wash the clothes yourself.


Also be conscious of the detergent you're using: there are greener alternatives to generic detergents, such as Method, who makes refillable bottles for their detergent
Hang dry your clothes instead of putting them in the dryer. This way you will be saving energy and all you need to do is peg the clothes on a clothes line and wait until they dry! The only time you could use a dryer is if it is rainy out or you could hang your clothes under shelter.
If you are going to use the washing machine, make sure you put in a full load and set the water to cold. This way is greener than washing a small amount of clothing and turning the water to hot.

, Baths use a large amount of water whilst a short shower doesn't. Showers are also quicker so think twice before taking a bath.

, Fans, air conditioning and heaters all use a lot of energy and you don't need them! Instead, when it's cold, put on an extra jumper and when it's hot, wear thinner and less clothing.

, Not only will you save water and money long term, but you will also reduce carbon footprint which is over drinking bottled water.

Purchase drought resistant plants.,
Grow your own food!,
Start gardening.,
Water your plants, trees, and grass in the morning or afternoon.",How to Be  Green5," These plants need less water which means you will be saving plenty of water. When you do water your plants, water them lightly and don't soak them!

,


This can be a long and sometimes frustrating process, but growing your own fruits and vegetables can save you both the time it took to drive to the store to buy them and the money spent trying to buy organic.

, Plants filter out carbon dioxide and release oxygen whilst we do the opposite. Planting a tree or flower is a great help to the environment!

, If you water your garden during the day the water is dried up from the sun meaning your grass, trees, and plants get less water.

"
"
Escape the modern world and get out and about.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Consider going vegan or vegetarian.,
Reduce the amount of time you spend on electronics.",How to Be  Green6," Take your dog for a walk around the neighborhood, visit the park, go for a hike, walk on the beach, etc. Plus, walking is a great exercise for you.

, Foods you should eat are fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, etc. Cut down on sugars and fats and try to avoid processed food or too much meat and only eat a fast food once every two or three weeks as a treat. Home cooked meals are always the best and fruits and vegetables are very healthy for you!

,


The impacts of eating meat on both the environment and on people are undeniable and hugely negative. Do your research and consider what exactly you are truly putting in your body and whether or not you're okay with it. There are plenty of meat alternatives that don't involve the abuse of the animals.
If being a vegan or vegetarian is not an option for you, consider limiting your meat intake or researching to find free-range farms that kill their animals with more concern for the level of pain and fear they experience. Unfortunately, places like McDonald's and Burger King do not buy meat from the ethical meat industry.

, Instead of watching the news on TV, read the newspaper or instead of researching things on the computer, go to the library! Books are very handy and reading is a great habit and time passer.

"
"
Use paper properly.,
Reuse bottles.,
Use your own bag instead of a plastic bag.,
Buy sustainable and ethical clothing!",How to Be  Green7," Try writing a full page or using both sides of the page, millions of paper are wasted every year just by throwing away unused paper.

, Instead of purchasing a bottle from the shops and throwing it away all the time, reuse the bottle by filling it up with water and putting it in the fridge.


Keep in mind that bottled water should only be used when going out somewhere where there is no available water such as the park or to the beach.

, When shopping, it's more green to use your own reusable bag instead of a plastic bag which will be thrown away as soon as you get home.

,


Unfortunately, almost all clothing is made from sweatshops that abuse and mistreat their workers. There have been several incidents of terrible working conditions, including protests that took place in Cambodia against Walmart and the collapse of several sweatshop buildings, one of which killed over 1,000 people. Ethical clothing brands include Eth-ics, Stella McCartney, Naja (lingerie), Krochet Kids, People Tree, etc. These brands will be significantly more expensive (with the exception of Naja, whose prices are about equal to Victoria's Secret), but worth it to buy sustainable and ethical clothing.
To find out more, watch The True Cost (a documentary on Netflix), and check out their website to find more sustainable clothing makers.

Take a spare rubbish bag with you whenever you visit the beach.,
Encourage each family member to do the same.,
Look for local conservation groups who run regular beach cleanups.,
Participate in special events aimed at cleaning up the coastline.,
Get involved when there's an oil spill.,
Encourage others to help keep the beach clean.,
Help others who clean up beaches by making donations.,
Take food in reusable containers.",How to Participate in a Beach Cleanup," Take along a garden glove also if you don't want to pick up anything by hand, or a mechanical grabber in case you spot syringes and other nasty things on the beach. Make it part of your beach visit to collect at least 5 minutes worth of rubbish off the beach before you leave.


Always dispose of your rubbish bag in a proper place of disposal. If you cannot find a proper bin near the beach, take the rubbish home and dispose of it using your own waste disposal methods.;
, While showing by example, also encourage them to do the same. Teach children how to safely pick up rubbish without harming themselves.


If an area is known for drug use, don't have children picking up rubbish. For yourself, wear solid shoes to avoid getting an accidental needlestick injury. And wear proper gloves and carry mechanical litter pick-up devices.
Teach children to never stick their fingers inside anything, be it a container, shell or whatever else that creates a possible hiding spot for an animal that might sting, bite or shoot barbs. Some animals, such as the blue ringed octopus, live inside human rubbish like drink cans and can deliver a fatal bite or sting if handled unawares.

, Join up and be a regular volunteer helping to keep your local beach clean. Attend their meetings to learn more about what they're doing, where they're focusing and for rubbish collection tips.

, There are several special events every year targeted at caring for the ocean, the shoreline, beaches and other seaside related areas. Some of these activities may include replanting sea grasses or dune grasses to help conserve the dunes and shoreline and to provide fish breeding habitats, so it's not all about rubbish!

, When oil spills happen, they inevitably end up on shore killing wildlife and harming the beach environment. You can often become part of the cleanup operations by joining groups that need and train volunteers in cleaning birds, cleaning the sand, and other helpful ways of cleaning up. Check the websites of local conservation organizations and local government environment sites for details specific to the event as it happens.

, Inform people where the rubbish bin is when you see them throw litter on the beach. Encourage people you know to get involved with beach cleanup events; even often to drive them there or to buddy up with them.



Volunteer some of your time to help shepherd school students doing beach cleanups. You can explain to them what to do and keep an eye on their progress to help out the teachers bringing them to the event.

, Most societies, organizations and groups that clean up beaches need funds and help at all times, so your donations of time and money will always be appreciated.

, Have a picnic or a barbecue at the beach but make it one where everything you take goes back home with you and you leave no trace of your meal. This can be a reward after a beach cleanup, especially for a group but make sure everyone understands the importance of bringing along sustainable food and eating gear.

Eat less animal products.,
Buy locally-sourced products.,
Recycle and reuse what you can.",How to Take Action to Reduce Global Warming1," Since animal meat and animal products take a lot of energy, water, and other resources to create and transport, you can lower your carbon footprint by reducing your consumption of them. Instead of eating animal products, consider adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet. To do so, refocus your diet on fresh fruit and vegetables., By minimizing the amount of products you consume that are made far from you, you’ll not only help your local economy, but reduce your overall carbon footprint. Look around your community for products made locally.Visit farmers markets for locally-grown produce and other food.
Buy products, like furniture, from local craftsmen.

, Since it requires a lot of energy to create certain materials from scratch, recycling and reusing will lower the amount of energy needed to make new products. Use recycle bins provided by your local government. If you don’t have access to them, collect plastic, aluminum, and paper products and periodically bring them to a recycle center near you.Donate items you don't want instead of throwing them away.
Use cloth towels, reusable plates, and silverware instead of paper towels, paper plates, and disposable silverware.

Drive less.,
Ride a bicycle.,
Maintain your automobile.,
Insulate your home and major appliances.,
Use compact fluorescent or LED bulbs.",How to Take Action to Reduce Global Warming2," Since driving is one of the biggest ways people contribute to global warming, minimizing how much you drive will make a huge impact. There are many ways you can do this:Carpool to work with others.
Using mass transportation. Consider riding the bus, using the subway, or taking a train.
Plan weekly or monthly shopping trips, instead of going out whenever you need something.

, Buy a new bicycle, a used one, or refurbish one. While you don’t need to bicycle everywhere, you can use it to get around town, exercise, and to visit friends. In the end, you’ll save energy and get in shape., If you can't live without a car, then use it in a way that minimizes global impact. By regularly maintaining your vehicle, you’ll save money on gasoline and on future repairs.



Keep your car tires adequately inflated. Under-inflated tires can reduce fuel economy by up to 3% and are subject to increased wear and tear. Check them monthly.

Change your air filter. Check your car's air filter monthly. Cleaning your air filter improves your mileage and reduces pollution because it makes it easier for your car to take in air and maintain a proper fuel/air mixture., Insulate anything that uses energy to stay a different temperature from its environment. You can buy insulation from hardware stores and in many varieties.


Keep your water heater insulated to save up to 1,000 lbs. of carbon dioxide a year. Avoid using units fitted with continuous pilot lights, and you will save 200 kilograms of greenhouse gas emissions yearly.
Re-insulate your whole home to reduce heating and cooling costs. If your insulation is old or inefficient, replace it. Consider the attic, crawlspaces, basement, walls, and ceiling. If you have awkward spaces, be aware that cellulose or fiberglass insulation can be blown in by a professional contractor.

Weather strip your home. Weather strip your doorways, windows and HVAC system. This could save up to 1,700 lbs. of carbon a year., Walk around your home and count how many incandescent light bulbs you have. Then, go to the store and buy compact fluorescent or LED bulbs to replace them. By replacing your old lightbulbs, you’ll save a lot of power.A standard compact fluorescent bulb will save around one third of a ton of greenhouse gas over its life.
LED lightbulbs are the most efficient and can save a lot of power. However, they may be costlier.
Consider substituting as many energy efficient bulbs as you can, and give them as gifts to family and friends. Donate a set to a local charity to refit their office.

Contact your representatives and urge them to fight global warming.,
Inform people about the dangers of global warming.,
Join an advocacy group.",How to Take Action to Reduce Global Warming3," Since political leaders have a lot of power to change the system, one of the most effective ways to reduce global warming is to pressure them to do something about it. Start by finding out who represents you at the local, state, and national level. Then, contact them and share your concern about global warming. Ask your representatives to:


Promote mass transportation projects.
Help fund alternative energy projects.
Support regulation that limits carbon emissions. For example, let your representatives know you support a tax on carbon emissions.
Enter agreements with foreign nations to limit carbon emissions, like the Kyoto Protocol., Take initiative and share your concern about global warming with the people around you. Simply by talking about it, or mentioning it, you may inform others about how it could impact their lives or the lives of their children or grandchildren.Tell people why you do certain things, like adopting a vegan or vegetarian diet.
Let people know about things they can do to reduce their carbon footprint – like insulating their home or reducing the amount they drive.
Don’t be pushy. If someone doesn’t want to talk about global warming, that’s okay. There is no reason to alienate people who don’t share your perspective.

, Look around your community for organizations and groups that share your concern. Chances are, there are many groups around you that work to educate the public and make real change to reduce global warming. Some national and international groups that take action to fight global warming include:Green Peace
Citizens Climate Lobby
The Environmental Defense Fund
Green America
The Sierra Club
Idle No More

Conserve water at home.,
Use fewer chemicals.,
Dispose of toxic waste the right way.,
Help identify large-scale water polluters.",How to Help Save the Earth1," Wasting water is one of the biggest ways individuals impact the health of the planet. Taking measures to use less water is something you can start doing right away. If you live in an area with a water shortage, this is even more important for the health of your region's environment. Try to check off as many items as possible from this list:


Check and fix any water leaks. A leaky faucet can waste a lot of water.
Install water-saving devices on your faucets and toilets. A low-flow showerhead could be a good start.
Don't wash dishes with the water running continuously. Use a method that requires less water to get the dishes clean.
Turn off washing machine's water supply to prevent leaks. It doesn't need to be on all the time.
Replace old toilets with new ones that use a lot less water.
Wash and dry only full loads of laundry and dishes. Doing a half-load wastes water.
Don't use too much water to water your lawn.
Don't leave the faucet running while you brush your teeth.;
, Chemicals used to wash our bodies, homes, cars and everything else get washed down the drain or absorbed in the grass, and eventually end up in the water supply. Since most people use heavy-duty chemicals for all sorts of things, chemicals are doing real damage to waterways and aquatic life. The chemicals aren't good for humans, either, so do your best to cut back on them. Here's how:


Learn about alternatives household cleaning items that do not use hazardous chemicals. For example, using a solution of 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 water works as well as most commercial cleaners for basic cleaning jobs. Baking soda and salt are cheap, nontoxic cleansers, but should be used in moderation.
When no good alternatives to a toxic item exist, determine the least amount required for an effective, sanitary result and use a minimal amount each time you clean. Paying close attention to the requisite amount will help you reduce and also save money.
Instead of using chemical-laden shampoos and soaps, try making your own.
Instead of using pesticides and herbicides, find natural ways to get rid of weeds and pests.

, Paint, motor oil, ammonia, and a host of other chemicals should not be poured down the drain or directly into the ecosystem. They'll soak into the earth and end up in the groundwater. Contact your local sanitation department to find out about best practice for disposing of hazardous waste and toxic chemicals. , Individuals can only do so much when it comes to keeping water clean. Businesses and industries are often the culprits when it comes to water pollution. In order to protect the earth's water, concerned citizens should speak up and find ways to stop pollution at its source. Join a local environmental group that works to clean up the water in your area, whether it's a river, lake or ocean.
Contact your local representative to speak up about your views on keeping water chemical-free.
Volunteer to help clean up beaches or riverbanks.
Help others get involved in efforts to clean up the water in your area.

Become an air pollution activist.",How to Help Save the Earth2," Coal and natural gas are the most common sources of energy that gets turned into electricity. The burning of these substances is a major factor in world air pollution. Reducing your reliance on electricity is a great way to play a part in saving the planet.Here's what you can do:


Use solar power for home and water heating.
Shut off electrical equipment in the evening when you leave work.
If you have central air conditioning, do not close vents in unused rooms.
Lower the thermostat on your water heater to 120.
Turn down or shut off your water heater when you will be away for extended periods.
Turn off unneeded lights even when leaving a room for a short time.
Set your refrigerator temperature at 36 to 38 and your freezer at 0 to 5 .
When using an oven, minimize door opening while it is in use; it reduces oven temperature by 25 to 30 every time you open the door.
Clean the lint filter in your dryer after every load so that it uses less energy.
Wash clothes with warm or cold water instead of hot.
Turn off lights, computers and other appliances when not in use.
Use compact fluorescent light bulbs to save money and energy.
Plant trees to shade your home.
Replace old windows with energy efficient ones.
Keep your thermostat higher in summer and lower in winter when you are away.
Insulate your home as best as you can.

, Another big source of air pollution that has led to global warming is emissions from cars, trucks, planes and other vehicles. The manufacture of the vehicles, the gas needed to run them, the chemicals they burn, and the production of roads all play a part. If you can drive and fly less often, you'll be doing a lot to help save the planet.Walk or ride your bike instead of driving, whenever possible. Find bike routes in your town and use them!
Join a carpool or vanpool to get to work if biking or walking isn't an option.
Report smoking vehicles to your local air agency.
Maintain your vehicle properly. Purchase radial tires and keep them properly inflated for your vehicle. Paint with brushes or rollers instead of using spray paints to minimize harmful emissions.

, Buying local helps combat air pollution in two ways. You don't have to travel as far to get what you need, and products don't have to travel as far to get to you, either. Making smart choices about where your food, clothes, and other goods come from can help make a dent in air pollution.


Shop at farmer's markets and buy food that was produced as close to your home as possible.
When you're online shopping, pay attention to how far the items you order will travel before they arrive. Try to find items that won't have to travel long distances.
Pay attention to where your clothes, electronics, home goods, and other possessions were made. As much as possible, buy items that were made in your region.

, Industrial farming practices are not only harmful to individual animals, they're unsafe for the planet itself. Factory farming produces a lot of air and water pollution. You can address this issue in a personal way by doing the following:


Eat more vegetables. This simple change is a way of opting out of the factory farming industry.
Question where your meat comes from.
Buy only locally-sourced meat from a small farm.

, Identify local groups working to combat air pollution, and find a way to get involved. By educating yourself and others about the problem, you can have a greater impact than you'd have by simply making lifestyle changes.


Join a group that plants trees to help clean the air.
Become a bike activist. Work to have safe paths built in your city.
Contact your local representatives to speak up about issues particular to your region. If there's a factory spewing pollutants into the air, for example, get politically active to put a stop to it.

Produce less waste.,
Make your own stuff.,
Compost.,
Plant trees and don't cut them.,
Work to stop clearcutting and mining.",How to Help Save the Earth3," Everything you throw in the garbage, tie up and take out to be collected is going to end up in a landfill. Plus, all that trash - plastic, paper, metal, and whatnot - was likely manufactured using unsustainable practices that hurt the health of the earth's land. By making less trash, you can reduce your impact. Try making these changes:


Buy products that you can reuse. Get glass containers instead of flimsy plastic ones, for example.
Don't use plastic bags - use cloth.
Maintain and repair durable products instead of buying new ones.
Avoid products with several layers of packaging when only one is sufficient. About 33% of what we throw away is packaging.
Use reusable plates and utensils instead of disposable ones. Use reusable containers to store food instead of aluminum foil and cling wrap.
Buy rechargeable batteries for devices used frequently.
Copy and print on both sides of paper.
Reuse items like envelopes, folders and paper clips.
Use e-mail or texting as a substitute for paper correspondence.
Use recycled paper.
Mend clothes instead of buying new ones.
Buy used furniture - there is a surplus of it, and it is much cheaper than new furniture.

, When you make your own dinner from scratch or mix up your own cleaning supplies, you naturally make less waste. Single-sized TV dinners, shampoo bottles and the like can really add up in the trash can! Here are a few things you can make on your own:


Food. If you're really ambitions, grow your own! Otherwise, do your best to make as many meals as possible from scratch. Buy ingredients in bulk to cut back on packaging.
Body products. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, toothpaste etc. - you name it, you can make it! Try replacing a few things at first, then work up to making most of what you use. Hint: coconut oil is a brilliant replacement for lotion, deep conditioner and face wash.
Cleaning products. Everything from window cleaner to bathroom cleaner to oven cleaner can be made using all-natural supplies.

, This is an excellent way to cut back on waste and improve the health of the land you're living on at the same time. Instead of throwing your food scraps in the trash, compost them in a bin or a pile. After tending the pile for a few weeks, you'll have rich soil you can spread on your grass or use to make a delicious vegetable garden. The land around you will be healthier and more vibrant for your efforts.

, Trees protect land from getting eroded, and they're an integral part of the ecosystem. In saving trees you'll be protecting not only land, but water and air, too. If you have room in your yard, consider planting a few trees to invest in the future of your neighborhood.


Do research to figure out what trees will be most beneficial to the environment where you live. Plant native species.
Aim to plant trees that will grow tall and provide shade., These practices raze and gut the land so that it's no longer healthy enough to provide a home for plants and wildlife. Join up with a group working to protect your region from industrial practices that damage the land."

Make your property a haven for wildlife.,
Eat sustainably-caught fish.,
Respect animals.,
Work to protect animal habitats.Whether there's a particular type of animal you want to work to save, or you'd like to work for the health of all of the planet's endangered species, there's an animal rights group out there that could use your energy and time.

",How to Help Save the Earth4," All types of animals, from birds to deer to insects, have lost some of their habitat to human developments. You've probably seen birds bathing in oil-tainted water and deer wandering through suburbs because they have nowhere else to go. If you have the space, try to be welcoming to animals who could use a helping hand. You can make your property hospitable in the following ways:


Plant shrubs, flowers and trees that attract wildlife.
Put out a bird feeder and bird bath stocked with clean food and water.
Let beneficial snakes, spiders, bees, bats, and other creatures live. Having these animals around is a sign your ecosystem is in good health.
Install a beehive if you have the room.
Use cedar chips or aromatic herbs instead of mothballs.
Don't use chemical pesticides.
Use humane traps instead of rat and mouse poisons and insect killers.
Use an electric or manual lawnmower instead of a gas-powered one.

, The oceans are being depleted of large fish populations due to overfishing and pollution. Up to 90 percent of the ocean's large fish are now gone.You can do your part to protect marine life by only eating fish that is in season and caught using sustainable practices.

, Many animals that are thought of as pests are not causing real harm. Other animals that live in wild places aren't usually in human view, so we tend to forget about their needs. With dozens of animal species going extinct every day,they need all they help they can get. Try being more mindful in the following ways:


Let creatures like moles, groundhogs, and squirrels live instead of trapping and killing them. They may cause a little inconvenience in your garden, but they have a part to play in your region's ecosystem.
Don't disturb wild places like forests, beaches, wetlands and other areas where animals make their homes. When you visit such areas, stay on trails so you don't accidentally cause damage to an animal's habitat.

Reflect on the meaning of Christmas for you and your family.,
Allot time.,
Choose the most eco-friendly Christmas tree option for you.,
Make your own decorations.,
Make your own gifts.,
Buy eco-friendly gifts if you're not making them.,
Be considerate of paper.,
Buy locally grown food.,
Create a recycling point in your house for collecting bottles, cans, paper, packaging and cards.,
You can give plants in pots as a present.",How to Have a Green Christmas," If the meaning of Christmas is lost beneath the rush to prepare for it and excessive spending, getting deeper into debt, boastful exchanges of gifts, and even feelings of anger and deprivation when gift recipients can't have ""what they want"", then it's hard to celebrate wholeheartedly. Whether you celebrate Christmas for religious reasons or as part of a secular tradition, Christmas as a merchandising opportunity is neither green nor fulfilling. Reining in the excesses isn't about depriving you or your family of the enjoyment and beauty of Christmas. Rather, it's about taking back the real spirit of Christmas and putting excess in its place while still appreciating the accompanying gifts, decorations, food, and other elements of Christmas in a way that is considerate of family calm, our environment, and of what Christmas is truly about.


As part of your reflection, consider how you can celebrate Christmas in ways that cut down on excess spending, packaging, eating, et cetera. As a reward, you'll find focusing on less will bring about a more fulfilling experience for everyone.;
, One of the key problems at Christmas is the lack of time and the excuses we make as a result. It's easier to drop into the dollar store and to buy up excessive amounts of decorations shipped all the way from China, made from resource-intensive materials because they're cheap, plentiful, and right under our noses as we stock up at the last minute. Gone is the joy of sitting down together as a family to craft our own traditional decorations, cards, gifts, etc., from materials that are renewable or recycled, and gone is the creation of family heirlooms. While it is unrealistic for most busy families to handcraft everything for Christmas, marking a little time on your family's calendar to make a few things by hand can create a new family tradition, and gives everyone involved a sense of personal pride and achievement at having contributed something personal themselves.


It's recommended that as part of celebrating a green Christmas, you or your family set aside a little portion of time and choose one or two discreet projects to complete as a family or individual. This could be something like making this year's cards from last year's cards, making gift tags from old cards, sewing felt toys, making 3D snowflakes, etc. Whatever takes your fancy and is something that those participating will enjoy doing.

, The Christmas tree debate can be a difficult one and needs to be resolved according to your own conscience. While some people advocate artificial trees because these can be reused, their downside can be that they have a limited lifespan, need to be replaced when they wear out, and many are made from non-renewable resources. Cutting down living trees from forests is only sustainable where it involves harvesting trees that are going to be removed anyway because of forest thinning or where the forest was created just for the purpose, such as on managed Christmas tree farms. Yet, some people are concerned that even with a Christmas tree farm, the manner of growing the trees might be an issue if industrial chemicals were used rather than eco-friendly growing options or if mono-culture is replacing local biodiversity; always ask how the farm is managed to find out if eco-friendly practices are being used.


Consider purchasing a living Christmas tree. This option has the benefit of not removing a tree for a temporary use and allows you to plant the tree in the garden or in another suitable place after use. Read How to choose a living Christmas tree for details on how to choose a suitable tree.
Be sure to compost a cut tree after use. If you don't have a garden or you're not able to hire or borrow a wood-chipper machine, check with your local council to see if it has a scheme for chipping or composting trees. Many municipalities in North America have taken to collecting trees for direct chipping and composting rather than simply dumping them at the tip.
Avoid overdoing the plastic decorations and the cheap dollar store decorations. Affordability doesn't mean you should indulge in them – and don't forget the clutter you'll end up with in storage! Cheap decorations come at a high environmental cost, while simple and fewer decorations can be very effective and elegant.
Turn off the tree lights after you go to bed and while you're out. Try putting your indoor and outdoor lights on timers if you can't remember to do this manually. Doing this will also prevent fires.

, If you've managed to allot some time, make your own Christmas decorations as much as possible. Making your own decorations is fulfilling because it's personal to you and lets you use your hands and imagination to the fullest extent. And remember that this isn't a race to compete with the commercially produced, molded mass produced decorations; it's simply about making your decorations rather than making them expertly. There is a lot that you can do at home with existing materials or using recycled materials, and many of these things don't take much time:


Use recycled materials (such as colored paper, old magazines, ribbons, etc.), reuse old decorations and build on them, to create decorations. Read wikiHow's Christmas decorations category for a whole range of inspiring crafty how-to ideas.
Make edible ornaments. Half the fun is cooking them, eating bits as you go, and decorating them. The other half is admiring your handiwork spinning on the tree. Ideas include popcorn and cranberry strings, or simply stringing these food items onto thin gauge wire and shaping it into stars, hearts, etc. And cookie ornaments are a lot of fun for kids, in all sorts of Christmas shapes such as gingerbread men, stars, Santa, reindeer, baubles, etc.
Use the garden or natural items from the outdoors for ornaments. Collect pine cones, twigs, berries, sprigs of evergreen plants, red apples, oranges, etc. to create wreaths, centerpieces, simple ornaments, etc. Simple clusters of pine cones, berries, and evergreen pieces can look very effective and beat their plastic counterparts hands down; after Christmas, simply toss them back outdoors, no need to clutter your house storing them.
Twist corn husks around and around in a circle to make a beautiful Christmas wreath. Weave in some evergreen twigs if you want to add a little green.

, Making your own gifts at Christmas time is an excellent way of ensuring they're eco-friendly and well within budget. There are many possibilities but the important thing is to draw on your own strengths and talents, so that whatever you make is enjoyable for you and results in a gift-worthy item for the recipient. For example, if you have kids, consider making a puppet theater or toys and dolls. Read How to make your own Christmas gifts for more ideas.


Make food. Giving homemade food beautifully presented in eco-friendly packaging is a delightful gift, part love and part delicious! How about homemade jam or bread? Read wikiHow's Christmas cooking category for more ideas.
Consider putting together cherished items to make an album. Albums aren't just for photos, although a photo album that has had your personal time lavished on creating it can be a great gift in itself too. Use albums to collect family loved recipes, vacation collectibles, craft patterns, science project instructions, detailed suggestions for a future family vacation, scrapbook mementos, trading cards collected from cereal boxes, etc.
Give the gift of time. Could someone you know use help around the house? Would someone love to learn something you could teach? Make homemade coupons or promise certificates, and be sure to follow on what you've promised!
Keep in mind the interests of each recipient and the need to reduce waste by using eco-considerate products when making the gifts.

, There are plenty of choices to purchase ""green"" gifts. Look at the many online eco-focused stores or visit stores offering eco-friendly gift options, including such items as durable water bottles, organic clothes for babies to adults, books, recycled paper products, etc.


Another great gift idea is that of donating money to a charity, buying a ""gift that keeps on giving"" such as a cow or farm pack for people in communities that need help to access drinking water, grow crops, live sustainably, etc. – look for your favorite charities that provide this service. It can be a family choice if wished, with all of you choosing the gift online and having it sent in your family's name.
Buy garden products. Things to till the garden with, seeds, seedlings, plants, planter pots, soil, etc., are great eco-friendly gift choices. Be sure to choose plants wisely – opt for natives and locally grown varieties and food crops over exotics. Heirloom seeds can be an enormously successful gift for a garden-lover.
Reusable grocery and shopping bags are always handy.
Biodegradable, organic, and health conscious cosmetics, body and bath products are a burgeoning industry now, including soaps, shampoos, bath oils, bath salts, perfumes, etc., that are made from ingredients known to be safe to both humans and the environment. Making up a small basket of such products can be a great way to introduce a friend or family member to new products that have less impact on their health and the environment.
For a young couple with a baby, pay for a diaper service to spare them endless diaper washing and to lure them away from disposables a bit longer.
For kids, think science kits, solar power gadgets such as radios and flashlights, books about ecology, or tickets for a trip to a local nature reserve, museum, or zoo to see conservation in action.
Think about gifts that can help family and friends whose eco-consciousness is newly emerging. You can give them books on the topic, or be bolder by buying them items for the house that they can start using and noticing benefits from immediately, such as a water-saving device for the toilet, a solar light, a thermostat for their heating, insulation, hose nozzles that shut off water automatically, etc. These are the sorts of things people love to consider but don't necessarily make the next step to purchase for themselves. This is a great way to enable them practically. Be sure to explain energy savings they'll experience, if relevant!

, When it comes to cards, gift tags, and wrapping, there is a lot of waste involved; in the UK alone, it is estimated that 1 billion cards end up in the bin, with an average of 17 cards per person. And any eco-conscious gift recipient will know the unpleasant feeling of awkwardness at seeing virgin paper ripped off gifts and unceremoniously tossed aside, never to be thought of again while still wanting to appreciate the joy experienced by the gift recipient! Sidestep this dilemma by making eco-friendly wrapping choices from the outset.


Recycle cards. Read How to out old greeting cards to use for more ideas, such as making new cards from old, and making gift tags from old tags. And don't forget to use your origami skills to turn old cards and paper into new tags!
Use recycled wrapping paper. If you have last year's paper still, give it a quick iron under a towel to remove the worst of the creases (do this at the same time as your regular ironing of clothes, to lessen energy waste). Look for paper products that state that they're recycled, or use simple recycled brown packaging paper and make it more interesting by adding decorative elements of your own, such as stamping with cut vegetables, sticking on old cards, or drawing on it. Old magazines, newspapers, old posters, or brown paper bags can make stylish wrapping too.
Make tags from recycled items.
Lessen the amount of cards sent by using electronic cards over the internet. This can also save you time as you don't need to buy or make cards, address the envelopes, add the stamp, etc. Be aware that some people won't like this though, especially older people who continue the tradition of card sending, so be sure to send them a real card still.
Instead of using tape, use string, ribbon, and leftover tying material to keep presents wrapped. For a pet, wrap with a leash or collar.
Use an item of clothing, fabric, a bandanna, a handkerchief, a scarf, or a tea-towel to wrap gifts in. This saves on paper completely and looks really pretty and novel sitting under the tree. The wrapping is a gift and won't be tossed away. Other ideas include placing the gift inside a cookie jar, mug, pillowcase, lunchbox, tote bag, bucket (great for garden gifts), flower pot, etc. And quilters love receiving gifts wrapped in quilting fabric!

Make fabric gift bags and reuse them year after year within your family. Make it a family tradition to gather up the cloth bags after gifts are opened and to return them to their storage basket; this habit won't take long to be reinforced and expected by everyone.

, Christmas is the ideal time to buy locally. Visit your local farmers' market is with a list of the food needs you have for Christmas. The food will be fresher and the shorter transportation distance from field to fork will significantly cut down on carbon emissions.


Avoid buying food that is overly packaged. Items bought loose or in bulk will taste just as good as their cellophane-wrapped competitors.
Minimize your food waste by not buying excessive amounts. Simply confirming how many people are eating will prevent you from preparing too much. Avoid throwing out any leftovers, the majority of foods can be kept for several days if refrigerated.
Consider having more vegetarian food at Christmas. Eating more grains, vegetables, and fruit is not only healthy but will help to reduce your energy consumption, for meat takes a lot more water and energy to produce than plant foods.Be sure to use up the leftovers completely. You'll save money doing so, and cut down on waste.

, The main source of extra rubbish post Christmas are all things that can be recycled. Check with your council to find your nearest recycling center, or to see which days they collect - don't forget this may differ from usual over the festive period.


If you have any unwanted presents, don't bin them, donate them to your local charity shop instead.

, It would really cheer up the receiver.

Check what is on your required list.,
Ask politely to change items if you feel restricted by the school list.",How to Choose Eco Friendly School Supplies1," Then find out how much room to move you have on the recommended supplies. If you don't have to choose the exact same items listed, then you can swap them out for eco-friendly versions.


In some cases, the school supplies list may already have taken eco-friendly needs into account. If so, you're all set!
In other cases, you may find it hard to substitute some items, such as the plastic pockets mentioned in the above list. In this case, find out if you really do need them, or what alternatives you can find.;
, If you present your case politely and reassure your teacher that you won't be substituting with inferior quality, you may just get the nod to change to different supplies.


Your parents may be able to help here. If they're environmentally-conscious too, they may be able to discuss this directly with the teacher or school. All the same, it is good for you to learn how to ask for yourself too!

Be proud of your work.",How to Become a Red Cross Volunteer," Before you join the Red Cross as a volunteer, make sure you understand the organization and the people it serves. The Red Cross was founded over a century ago to alleviate human suffering in times of disaster and danger. Though the organization is known for helping in times of crisis, it also supports local communities all over the world in the day-to-day.Check out the Red Cross website.
Read about the history of the organization.;
, Working for the Red Cross is noble, and the efforts of volunteers are crucial. However, there are only so many hours in the week, and you probably have other things to worry about, like work, school, or family obligations. Be honest with yourself about the amount of time you have to dedicate to the Red Cross, and where it will fit into your schedule--whether that’s for a couple of hours a week, an entire day once a month, or as-needed for disaster relief.


It might help you to take your paper or electronic calendar and mark the free time you have during the week.

, The Red Cross is a behemoth of an organization, and many types of volunteers are needed to keep it running smoothly. This is great for you: it means there’s probably a position that suits your passions and talents. There are over 30 types of opportunities, depending on location. Here are some of the most common.If you are good at administrative work, choose a clerical function. You can assist with mailings, grants, and special events.
Investigate a stint on the Board of Directors if you have good leadership and fundraising skills.
If you like to teach, volunteer as an instructor. The Red Cross uses volunteers to teach babysitting, life guarding, first aid, health, and water safety.
If you want to volunteer in the field, sign up as a disaster prevention or response volunteer. You will have the opportunity to assist communities as they prepare for, prevent, and respond to disasters, but you may have to travel.
Work as a volunteer on special services provided by the Red Cross. If you are especially interested in HIV/AIDS prevention, blood drives, homeless issues and humanitarian work, focus on that. Choose a project, and get involved in education, training, and other services.
If you are eager to travel, and have foreign language skills and a large chunk of free time in your future, you can look into international volunteering opportunities.

, Find the number on your country’s national Red Cross website; for instance, here is the chapter listing for the US Red Cross. Each local chapter is different, depending on the needs of the community. It stands to reason that you will best learn exactly what you can do to help by talking to the chapter itself. The chapter should be able to connect you to a volunteer coordinator, whose job it is to make sure you’re informed. Ask plenty of questions.


”What kind of time commitment do you ask?” You should know how often you should come in every month, and for how long they seek to retain volunteers.
”Is there an area in which you’re looking for volunteers right now?” You might want to be a swim instructor, but don’t set your heart on it. If your chapter is glutted with swim instructors and is looking for someone to pass out snacks at blood drives instead, it’s best to go where you’re needed.
”Is any special certification required?” Most Red Crosses will provide the training you need to volunteer, but if you’re already, say, CPR-certified, you’ll be ahead of the game.

, Once you’ve got an idea what it’s like to serve your local Red Cross, and you understand where you’re most needed, then sign up! Many countries’ Red Cross websites have a tool to match you up with appropriate volunteer opportunities. It should be easily accessible from the national website.


Enter your location and field of interest.
Include a few special skills that you have.
Note the distance you are willing to travel.
Mention whether you are open to working with kids, teens, seniors, or large groups.
Be willing to wait a week or two for processing.

, Especially if you are volunteering with kids, the Red Cross may ask if they can run a background check on you. This is commonplace for volunteer positions of all kinds, so don’t be offended if you’re asked to complete one.It’s really just to ensure that everyone the Red Cross serves (including you!) is safe.

, If you’re volunteering in a field that’s already a specialty of yours, you may want to refresh yourself so you’re in top shape to serve the organization. So do a review! Practice swimming or first aid, or review old textbooks to make sure you know the basics of your subject.


If you’re teaching, try a practice lesson on friends or family members.Check your existing certifications. Many first-aid certificates expire after a few years, so you may need to renew., In some cases, before you do in-person training, you can study up on your chosen volunteer post with a course on the Red Cross’s website. After you receive your volunteer placement, Google it to see if the Red Cross offers any resources online. For instance, here is the orientation for blood drive volunteers.


Make sure you understand everything you learned in the orientation--if it helps, you can quiz yourself with the ""knowledge check"" at the end of certain sections.
Review any area that you are unsure about.
Bookmark the orientation when you’re finished. It might be helpful later.

, Your local chapter will let you know what kind of learning opportunities are required, and which are optional but accessible. Most offices will be able to train you in first aid and local disaster relief, which entails responses to things like house fires and accidents.You may also have the option to get trained in national disaster relief, which involves larger-scale events like hurricanes and floods.
For in-person training, be professional: arrive promptly, pay attention, and stay the whole time.Think about other training you’re interested in doing, even if they don’t directly pertain to your post. A well-rounded volunteer is a good volunteer.

, Never be afraid to get in touch with the volunteer coordinator. After all, it’s their job to make sure that all volunteers are equipped to serve the Red Cross to the best of their ability.Reach out to them if you have questions about your duties, schedule, or the structure of the organization. They’re there to help.


If you need to cancel a shift, let the coordinator know by calling as soon as possible and saying something like ""Hi, it's Ruby, I won't be able to make my normal swimming class on Tuesday due to illness. Please let me know if I can help with finding a sub.""
If you're feeling a little overwhelmed and want to know ways to be more effective, you can say ""I've appreciated the First Aid trainings I've done with the Red Cross, but I want to learn more about how to stay mentally calm and collected during an emergency. Do you know of any books or courses that might help?""

, As a volunteer for the Red Cross, you’re doing some of the most important work in the world. It’s incredibly important to approach your commitment to the organization as seriously as you would approach a paying position.(Perhaps even more seriously--people’s lives are at stake!) This means sticking to professional and courteous behavior. Take steps to make sure you:


Arrive on time and stay for your full shift.
Honor your commitments. If you say you’re going to do something, then make sure you show up and do it.
Do the best work you can. You can’t phone it in here--bring all the energy you can.
Be kind and build relationships. Help out staff and fellow volunteers when you can, because it’s nice. In addition, you may want to ask for a reference in the future., The Red Cross is needed because disaster can strike at any time or place.As a volunteer for the Red Cross, you need to be ready for this. Plan ahead so you’re ready to help whenever the moment calls for it.


Keep a charged cell phone with you for alerts.
Trade phone numbers with fellow volunteers. You may need to call them for backup, or to fill in if you’re sick and have to miss a shift.
Pack a backpack you can grab with supplies that you’ll need. This may include clean water, a radio, and medications., You may have finished your initial training, but there’s so much more to discover! Keep reading up on the organization’s history and your particular function within it. Remember to review and advance your existing certifications when necessary.


If you’re working with a more experienced volunteer, ask questions.
Broaden your horizons by taking additional non-required training. You might even discover a whole new area you want to volunteer in.
Stay aware of current events. It's important to know about natural disasters that threaten other parts of the world, as well as your community.

, Red Cross volunteers are some of the kindest and most dedicated people around. Though not everyone you meet will be your new best friend, it’s still worth your time to get to know the people you’re working alongside. You can teach each other a lot, and you’ll probably have a lot more fun on your shifts if you know your cohort.On your shifts, ask your fellow volunteers (non-invasive) questions about their lives. What motivated them to start volunteering?

Hold a skill share. If you work with several other volunteers, get together and learn! You can show each other cool skills that have to do with the Red Cross, or focus on other ones.
Socialize outside of work. Go bowling or organize a potluck--anything that the group will enjoy.

, The volunteers are the heart of the Red Cross, but it has other needs as well. In addition to volunteering, you can sign up to give blood, or make a donation to the charity.For your birthday or the holidays, ask for donations to the organization in lieu of gifts.Involve your friends and family, too. You might recruit new volunteers among them.

, The Red Cross is an organization with a long and wonderful history. It has accomplished amazing feats over the course of its existence, and a lot of this is directly due to the efforts of volunteers like you. Keep doing what you’re doing--you are becoming a small part of history.

You can find many ways to volunteer to make a difference as a child advocate. Your first step is to research organizations that offer child advocacy services.Consider a national organization. One of the largest is Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA).
Go to the website casaforchildren.org to find out if there is an organization office near you. If there is not, ask if there is another local organization that is similar.

, Once you find the right organization, find out what it takes to be a volunteer. Contact the volunteer coordinator for information. Take note of all of the requirements.Many programs will ask for a certain time commitment. For example, programs involving children will often ask you to commit to 1-2 years as a volunteer.
You might also need to make yourself available for a certain amount of hours each week or month. Get specific information about how much time you are expected to volunteer during a given period.
Be prepared for a background check. Many organizations that involve children require prospective volunteers to go through a thorough background check.

, There are likely many different ways to serve as a volunteer. Ask the volunteer coordinator to tell you about each of the different roles that are offered. You can then chose the one that best fits your strengths.If you want to work directly with children, make that clear. CASA and other organizations utilize volunteers as advocates who work with individual children.
Maybe you want to help children, but are not emotionally prepared to work with children in distressing situations. Consider taking on a different role.
For example, you could become a fundraiser. If you excel at planing and coordination, you could find great success raising money for worthwhile causes.
Do administrative work. While you are training to become an advocate, you can find other ways to help the organization. You can answer phones and distribute fliers around the community.

During your training, you should ask as many questions as possible. This is also a great time to get to know other volunteers.

, After completing your training, you are finally ready to volunteer. If you are a CASA volunteer, this means that you will begin working with children. As a volunteer, you will work to get to know the child that you are assigned to.Volunteers work to learn information from the child. You will ask about placement, about school, and other aspects of life.

Change a child's life.,
Support other family members.,
Practice self-care.,
Remember your own needs.",How to Become a Child Advocate3," Whether you are a professional advocate or a volunteer, you will make a significant difference in many people's lives. Child advocates make a big impact on the children they work with. There are many benefits to having child advocates involved in a case.Child advocates help keep children out of foster care. They also help prevent drop-outs and help to raise performance on test scores.
Child advocates help individual children and society as a whole. Advocacy leads to better school environments and less juvenile crime.

Give yourself permission to take a break. Maybe at the end of the day, you want to turn your phone off and take a bubble bath. That's okay.
Take a day off from work when you need to. Everyone needs a mental health day every once in a while.

Trust in your vision.,
Often times there are media sources at these meeting.,
Once you announce your goals and visions, you must continue to keep up the action role, until the goal is accomplished, or you decide that you want to stop pursuing it.

","How to Become a Community Activist, at Any Age"," If you believe in your heart that you can make a change, you will. But being an activist is not all about vision; action is required too. Without action, vision becomes merely a pipe-dream. Start off by listening to that inner voice telling you to explore your World and find ways to improve upon it. Once you have discovered in your heart what you would like to change / improve in your Community, you can then start the process of putting action into your goal.


For example: You see that there is a large 2 acre parcel of land that your Town owns. The Town Mayor is asking the Community members for suggestions of how to utilize the vacant land lot.
The Mayor has given you a great opportunity to open up and introduce yourself to your Community.
Once you are convinced that you have a healthy idea for the use of the Town owned lot, you must begin the process of thinking out a plan of action.
You now have to set the stage for action. You must act on the request of the Mayor and attend the Town meeting at the Town Hall. There you will have the opportunity to be heard by the Town's government officials, and other Community members, along with members of the press / media.;
, You never know, the newspaper writer might be interested in covering your idea.


Example: You suggest that the Town allow it's resident's to create a Community Garden.
The next thing you know, you may end up on the cover of your local newspaper, and maybe the Associated Press will pick up your story too. That is how you ""break the ice"" and announce to the World ""I am here, and I am here to make a difference in my community by doing my part!"" Also, you will be showing others in your community how to be a voice as well. One person can influence many others to follow their lead and accomplish creating a better community together.

,, When you are consistently not late, your boss will know he/she can count on you as a trustworthy and reliable employee.

,,, If you cannot get over there that fast, stop by and smile and say, ""Hi folks, I will be right with you,"" so they feel welcome and acknowledged.

, If a table wants to chit chat, that's fine, but keep it short and sweet because you do have other things to do. Most tables don't want to talk to their server much, so this really isn’t an issue most of the time. Be available to help them, but not in their personal space.

, Reason being, they may have told you something wrong, this way you can get the order incorrectly.

, When you see a glass halfway empty, get a new glass of their beverage out to them or refill their glass. Don't make them have to ask you.

, If they order something that takes a long time, tell them it will take a little bit longer, or if something is taking way too long, get your manager involved. It is not your fault if the kitchen messes up. That's why you want to get your manager over there to basically cover your situation on that problem, and so they don't base your tip on a mistake made by the kitchen.

, Having a great attitude helps a lot, also in helping you have a better day sometimes.

, You never know, your next table may leave you a whopping tip for you just being friendly. A guy in the bar who isn’t even your guest might give you $20 just for bringing him a basket of bread.

, Every time you interact with a guest, the way you come off to them will affect what they tell their friends about their experience at your restaurant.

, If your manager says to do things a certain way, don't try to make a shortcut! You will seem more professional if you do things the right way the first time, plus it will give you some job security if you ever have any crazy guest complaints, because sometimes people will complain just to get something free. If you do everything by the book, your table can't write a complaint letter about you, literally.

, Everybody helps the shift run smoother by helping however they can. Do all you can to help out your co-workers and guests, even if they are not your guests. Just think -- they may be your guest next time.

,,, Do not turn down a table because you want to text on your phone (better yet, leave your cell phone at the host stand.) The more tables you can turn, the more money you make.

, You will make a lot of money there.

,, If you eat a heavy meal, you won’t want to work.

A ""Good job!"" or ""You're getting better every day"" can really lift a patient's spirits.

, For example, if the patient feels they are not being responded to in a timely manner:


""I understand you must feel frustrated by that. Is there anything I can do?"" is a good answer;
""All the doctors and nurses are busy; they'll get to you when they can” is not.

, Don't goof off-- treat your volunteer position as you would a job. This is the best way to keep your volunteering position, or even turn it into a paid position down the line.

, Don’t have an ego about the position or come in acting like you know more than you do.Observe the professionals you will be working with and learn from their example.

, Be polite, but try to stay to the point, as doctors and nurses have busy schedules.


A simple “What’s the best way to do this?” can be used in many situations and save you lots of time.
“What should I do if…” can prepare you for a lot of incidents or patient behaviors that may come up.

, This is both a great way to get noticed and will provide valuable help to the hard-worked doctors, nurses, and other staff. The more responsibilities you show you can handle, the more the workers will trust you.Don’t demand, but ask politely: “I’m enjoying the challenges I have now, but I feel like I could do more, if it would help.”

, There is a good chance you will make a mistake this way. If you act outside the duties assigned to you, the responsibilities for something going wrong fall on you and not the hospital."

Practice good communication skills.,
Enjoy it!",How to Be a Good Prefect," Prefects have advantages over teachers in that the younger children look up to them, as a result keeping the rules is a much easier job for Prefects than it is for teachers.;
, Prefect is one of the top roles a student can have at a school. You are now working with the teachers to create a better place to learn, and a mature, helpful prefect is sure to be trusted.

, The knowledge that there are Prefects willing to help will be very reassuring to newer pupils, and they will count on you to live up to their expectations and as someone who can help guide them through their school life.

, The kind and friendly prefect will gain the most respect. Offering help to those that might need it is better than waiting to be asked, and more often than not your offers will be taken up appreciatively.

, Prefects are given a lot of responsibility in the form of organizing and running events for parents and pupils of the school. It raises your prefect profile and impresses teaching staff, and also puts you in good stead for the future. Colleges and employers are keen to see examples of people that have been involved in voluntary school activities.

, The key is to be approachable, whether it is to students, parents, or visitors. The steps above require communication to be clear and confident.


A confident prefect sometimes needs to be something you learn how to become. Meeting with fellow prefects, teachers, visitors and parents and making presentations can help build up your confidence within the school. Observe how they react to you, and change your communication skills accordingly to become the best prefect you can be.

, Many new students are very impressionable and meeting a confident, helpful prefect can be something they will remember when they apply for the position in years to come.

Get a good Unix distribution.,
Learn how to use the command line.,
Learn some popular programming language until you reach a more or less satisfactory level.,
To be more productive, learn NetBeans or some other similar integrated development tool.

,
Learn and use advanced editor like vi or Emacs.,
Learn version control.,
Find a suitable small free software project which you could easily join to get experience.,
Contact the administrator of the selected project.,
Carefully read the rules of the project and more or less follow them.,
Work in this project for several months.,
Do not stick with the underground project for too long.,

As we are doing a serious jump now, be ready for the far cooler acceptance.,
Take and do a serious task.,
If you can, apply with your serious task to the Google's ""Summer of Code"" to get some money from this adventure.,
Look for a suitable conference happening nearby (""Linux days"" or something similar) and try to present your project there (all project, not just the part you are programming).,
Search the web for announcements about an install party happening nearby and try to join it first time as a user (watch for all problems and how hackers solve them) and next time as an installer.

,
Complete the task, cover with automatic tests and contribute to the project.,


,
For better understanding, look into a real example of the development history for a free software project (above).",How to Become a Free Software Hacker," GNU/Linux is one of the most popular for hacking, but GNU Hurd, BSD, Solaris and (to some extent) Mac OS X are often used.;
, You can do much more with Unix-like operating systems if you use the command line.

, Without this, you cannot contribute code (the most important part of any software project) to the free software community. Some sources suggest to begin at once with two languages: one system language (C, Java or similar) and one scripting language (Python, Ruby, Perl or similar).

,, They have a higher learning curve, but you can do much more with them.

, Version control is likely the most important cooperation tool for shared software development. Understand how to create and apply patches (text difference files). Most free software development in the community is done creating, discussing and applying various patches.

, Most of such projects now can be found on SourceForge.net. The suitable project must:


Use the programming language you know.
Be active, with recent releases.
Already have three to five developers.
Use version control.
Have some part you think you can immediately start implementing without modifying the existing code too much.
Apart from the code, a good project also has active discussion lists, bug reports, receives and implements requests for enhancement and shows other similar activities.

, In a small project with few developers your help will usually be immediately accepted.

, The rules of the coding style or necessity to document your changes in a separate text file may first appear ridiculous to you. However, the purpose of these rules is to make the shared work possible - and the most projects do have them.

, Listen carefully to what the administrator and other project members say. Apart programming, you have a lot of things to learn. But if you really do not like something, just go away to another project.

, As soon as you find yourself successfully working in that team, it is time to look for the serious one.

, Most such projects are owned by GNU or Apache organizations.

, You will likely be asked to work for some time without direct write access to the code repository. The previous underground project should, however, have taught you a lot - so after several months of the productive contribution you can try to demand rights you think you should have.

, It is time. Do not be afraid. Go on even after you discover that the task is lots more difficult than you initially thought - in this step it is important not to give up.

, But just do not care if the application is not accepted as they have far fewer funded positions than really good hackers.

, After you tell you are representing a serious free / open source project, the organizers frequently release you from the conference fee (if they do not, the conference is likely unsuitable anyway). Bring your Linux laptop (if you have one) and run demos. Ask the project administrator for the material you may use when preparing your talk or poster.

,, You are done! To be sure, try to meet some hackers of the project physically and have a glass of beer.

,, Each raising curve represents a contribution (lines of code) from a single developer. Developers tend to become less active over years, but the project frequently even accelerates as new people join. Hence if you already come with some useful skills, there are no reasons why the team would not invite you.

Focus on causes you feel strongly about.,
Look for more than just the ""standard"" volunteer organizations.,
Use a volunteer site to find a good match.,
Talk to friends and family.,
Pick an organization that will teach you something new.,
Volunteer overseas.,
Identify your skills.,
Review your weekly schedule.,
Establish the length of time you'd like to volunteer.,
Volunteer in person or online.,
Treat the application like a job.,
Ask what's expected of volunteers.,
Complete any needed training.,
Start volunteering slowly.,
Move organizations if needed.. You shouldn't stay in a volunteer position you're unhappy with.",How to Volunteer," When you decide to volunteer, you may want to plug into the first volunteer opportunity you come across. However, you're likely to be happier and volunteer longer at an organization that supports a cause you care about. When looking for an organization to volunteer at, try to pick one with a cause that riles your passions.For example, if you're passionate about animal welfare, maybe you want to volunteer at an animal shelter. If you believe in literacy, maybe you want to volunteer at a library or a school.;
, When you think about volunteering, your mind may focus on organizations such as soup kitchens, homeless shelters, or food banks. While those organizations are very worthy of your time, you may find other opportunities better fit your personality or skill set, ones that you may not think of immediately but that still need help.For example, you may find that volunteering with your local parks, at a prison, with youth organizations, or even for disaster relief may be more to your liking.

, Much like job search sites, you can use volunteer sites like Volunteer Match or Serve.gov to help you find volunteer opportunities in your area. Organizations list volunteer openings on their website, and you can search through and narrow them down, much like you would job listings., If you still can't narrow down where you want to volunteer, start asking people you know where they volunteer. You may find one of them has the perfect opportunity for you, and it can make it easier to volunteer with someone you know the first time.Volunteering with friends can make it less scary and more enjoyable because you're with people you know and have fun with.

, The first objective of volunteering is helping an organization and your community. However, volunteer opportunities can also benefit you. For one, they can give you career experience you don't have. Some organizations will also offer you training and career development. Consider how volunteering at a particular organization may benefit you in the future.For instance, volunteering at a clinic can teach you some about the healthcare system, while volunteering at library can teach you about community programs, literacy initiatives, and library organization. If you volunteer with the park system, you'll learn about park management.
You could also choose organizations that would develop skills you already have. For instance, if you are partially fluent in another language, you could offer your skills as a translator to community organizations, improving your skills along the way.

, While you'll find plenty of opportunities to volunteer in your own community, volunteering overseas is also an option. When you volunteer overseas, you can do everything from assisting at a pop-up health clinic in a remote village, assisting scientists on a biological expedition, or building schools in an impoverished area.When volunteering abroad, you can go on short, week-long excursions, or you can commit to much longer periods.
You could even join an organization like the Peace Corps for a long-term experience, where you can volunteer in fields like agriculture, education, health, economic development, and youth development., When thinking about where you want to volunteer, considering your skill set is important. Organizations are always looking for people with different skill sets, so no matter what you're good at, you should be able to find a place that can use those skills. First, though, you need to identify those skills.For example, maybe you have stellar people skills, so you'd do well at a place where you interact with people often, such as a soup kitchen or homeless shelter.
On the other hand, if writing is more your style, look into opportunities that can put that skill to use. For example, maybe you could write brochures for local nonprofits.

, You don't want to say that you can volunteer five times a week only to bail on the organization after a month. You need to be realistic about how much time you can give to an organization based on your other commitments.Try not to over-commit yourself. If you try to do too much, you're more likely to give up.

, Maybe you really only want to volunteer at a place for a month. On the other hand, maybe you're looking for a place to volunteer for the long term. Either is fine, but you need to figure out what you want and be upfront about it with the organization.Knowing the length of time you want to commit to can also help you choose an organization and type of volunteering. For instance, if you only want a short-term commitment, you might want to help organize an educational talk at the local art museum. On the other hand, if you want a long-term commitment, you might become a docent at the museum.You can even find one-time volunteer opportunities, such as volunteering at a pet adoption event, helping at the library's annual sale, or joining a group park cleanup.

, Some people have the time to go in person to an organization to volunteer. If that's you, great. If it's not, think about volunteering remotely by doing work online. Many organizations are now looking for people who can help with things like writing and PR work, most of which can be done online.You'll find there are all kinds of ways to volunteer. You can run in a marathon to raise money for an organization, work as a big brother or big sister, or organize food at a food bank.
If you do want to volunteer online, you'd still need to find the right organization. You could send emails to local organizations and offer your writing or design skills, for instance, though they will probably still want to meet you in person at least once. You could also do things like tutor kids on the internet who are in need of homework assistance.

, While some volunteer opportunities will be relatively low-key when it comes to the application process, others will want many of the same things an employer would want. For instance, many will have you fill out an application. They'll likely want to talk with you, as well as check your references. Be courteous and professional throughout these interactions.Spend some time preparing for the interview, much as you would for a job interview. Be ready to talk about yourself, your background, and what you have to offer to the organization.Remember, the interview is also a time for you to assess whether the organization is the right fit for you. Don't be afraid to ask any questions you may have.

, Organizations are going to have certain objectives for their volunteers. Some may require training or a certain number of hours per week. Some may have a rigid volunteer schedule, while others may be more flexible. The important thing is you know what you're getting into ahead of time.For instance, volunteers at a museum may be expected to learn parts of the galleries to give tours, while volunteers at a clinic will be expected to maintain certain privacy standards.
If you're helping with a 5K charity run, you may find volunteers are expected to do things like sign people in, assist at water stations, or help organize the crowd.

, For some organizations, training will be minimal. You may need to attend a short orientation, for instance. In other organizations, it may be more extensive. One suicide crisis organization, for instance, requires its volunteers to take a training course and get certification that costs $250, though you may be able to get assistance with the cost., That is, you don't want to immediately commit to volunteering three times a week for a year only to find that you hate your volunteer position. Of course, you can always back out, but it's better to commit to just a little bit of time at first to see if you like volunteering at the organization. Once you've volunteered there for a short period and decided you like it, you can commit to a longer period of time., If you are unhappy, try asking about how your work could be shifted within the organization. If that doesn't work, consider finding another opportunity somewhere else."

Click on the “adopt a soldier here”.,
Prepare for a short waiting time.,
Make a 'special' request.,
Remember, all the soldiers who register are in a combat situation so there is no guarantee that all soldiers will write back or thank you for care packages that are sent.",How to Adopt a Deployed US Soldier," Fill out your registration form, being sure to include your complete email address correctly so you can be directly connected with a soldier. After you register, the system puts you into a “validating” group and you will be sent an email with instructions on how to validate. Once validated, you have access to the forum and other features on the site. All you do next is WAIT for the AAUSS volunteers to send your soldier information via your email. This is the perfect time to visit the forum, and 'how to send' and 'what to send' areas of the site!;
, There has been an average 3-5 day wait usually. When there is a program on TV, an article in the paper, a blurb on the radio about adopting a soldier, or it is close to major holidays, there is a huge influx of registrations in a small amount of time. If you wait more than 2 weeks and you had no special requests and have not heard anything from the organization and have looked on the forum under your profile name, contact them to ensure that there is no problems with your registration. Also, ensure that your email is set to accept those from Adopt a US Soldier.

, Preferences, like gender or branch of service can be fulfilled. However, it is VERY difficult to fill requests beyond that as there is limited information available on the soldiers. What the soldiers put on their registration form is all the information available, and that information is given to you when you are assigned a soldier.

, Of course, it is hoped that they will, but many do not or cannot. This is not to gain a pen pal or mate. With that being said, there are thousands of supporters who have heard back and have become extremely close to their assigned soldier. It is suggested to include a self addressed (no need to stamp) envelope in your letters and care packages...it makes it easier if they want to respond! Please keep in mind the soldiers first responsibility is the war and staying safe!

Obtain the information on adopting a highway so you can present the facts to your organization.,
Go through the appropriate channels to get your organization, family, or cooperation involved in litter control.,
Fill out the application to acquire a section of highway for litter control.,
Wait the required number of weeks as the paperwork is processed.",How to Adopt a Highway,"


Most adopt-a-highway programs are for 2 to 3 years for 2 mi (3.2 km) of highway. Some areas may have a 1 mi (1.6 km) minimum, while some urban locations are for .5 mi (.8 km).
You may have to fill out waivers and permits.
A safety briefing for all participants is often required.
Most highway adoption programs request that the organization be prepared to pick up litter 4 times a year with a 1 week advance notice to the Department of Transportation so garbage collection can be arranged.;
, You may have to present the idea to the CEO or president of your company or organization. You may also be called to present the facts to certain individuals or before the organization, and you may have to wait for a vote to be taken.


Be prepared to discuss what section of highway your organization may want for litter control and the time commitment involved.
One person will need to be the Department of Transportation's contact person.

Locate a hospital with a baby cuddler program.,
Read up on the volunteer requirements.,
Gather all material needed for the application.",How to Volunteer As a Hospital Baby Cuddler1," Complete a Google search to determine if your local hospital has a volunteer baby cuddler program. For example, you could search “volunteer baby cuddler programs in Toronto.” This will provide you with a number of hospitals in the area that have volunteer positions for baby cuddlers.


You can also contact your local hospital and ask if they accept volunteers directly for the position of baby cuddler.
Most hospitals will indicate on their website which volunteer positions need to be filled. If baby cuddler is not listed, you can email the volunteer coordinator to find out if they are accepting applications for that position.;
, Once you have located a hospital that contains a volunteer baby cuddler program, you will need to read up on the volunteer requirements. Most hospitals include a list of requirements on their volunteer webpage.For example, volunteers need to be at least 18 years of age, they need to be able to volunteer a minimum number of hours each week, complete a health assessment, have a criminal background check performed, provide an up-to-date vaccination certificate, etc.
Some hospitals will also have student volunteer programs for individuals under the age of 18.

, Once you have determined what information is required in order to volunteer at this hospital, you will need to gather all of the relevant material. For example, you may need to get a criminal background check completed in order to be accepted as a volunteer. You may also need to get an annual flu shot.


Make sure you have all of the information needed before applying.

Fill out an application.,
Find references.,
Complete an interview.",How to Volunteer As a Hospital Baby Cuddler2," In order to apply for a volunteer position, you will need to fill out an application form. These forms will ask a number of questions including:Name, address, phone number, date of birth, education, employment information, volunteer experience, availability, etc.

, Most volunteers also have to provide the hospital with the contact information for two to three references. These references should not be family members or close friends, unless you have worked for them in the past. In some cases your references are expected to fill out a form answering questions about you. In other instances the hospital will contact the reference and ask them a few questions about you.Choose references that will speak highly about your work ethic, reliability, friendliness, and professionalism.
For example, you could ask a current/former boss, employer, or volunteer coordinator that you have worked with.
Always notify your references before you include them in an application. This way they will be expecting the hospital to contact them.

, Most hospitals interview potential volunteers before accepting them. This allows the volunteer manager the opportunity to get to know the applicant and assess them in person. In order to prepare for the interview, you should make sure that you have all of your required documents completed. You can also create a list of questions that you would like to ask during the interview.For example, you may want to ask “What does the training program entail?”, “Can I request to work in a specific area of the hospital?”, “Do baby cuddlers require any additional training?”
Arrive for your interview on time and dress in a professional manner.

Complete volunteer training programs.,
Request a position as a baby cuddler.,
Add your name to the wait list.",How to Volunteer As a Hospital Baby Cuddler3," Once you have been accepted as a volunteer, you will likely need to complete some form of training program. This could include watching health and safety videos as well as learning about the policies and procedures of the hospital environment. Baby cuddlers may need to complete additional training concerning bedside manner and how to handle infants.Take your training seriously. Pay attention, take notes, and ask questions if you need clarification.

, If you are mainly interested in working as a baby cuddler, you should speak with the volunteer coordinator. Ask if there are any openings available in the NICU for volunteer baby cuddlers. Alternatively, you could let your supervisor know that you are interested in the baby cuddling program.

, Baby cuddling is a highly sought after volunteer position in hospitals. As a result, many of these positions are filled. Ask if you can have your name added to the waiting list so that if a position opens up in the future, you will be considered.


Continue to volunteer in other areas of the hospital in order to demonstrate your enthusiasm.

Form a restoration team.,
Outline your restoration project to the relevant clubs, places of worship, societies, etc.,
Ascertain the level of decay and the type of work that needs to be done.,
Seek government and municipal grants for restorative work.,
Find a drawcard.,
Direct the restoration team.,
Hold an unveiling ceremony.,
Maintain the restoration team.",How to Restore an Abandoned Cemetery," Many decaying cemeteries are found in our once bustling townships in country and rural areas. Some are roadside cemeteries and others are neglected plots behind long-abandoned churches in cities, towns and villages. Perhaps there is one near you, or maybe you remember one from your regular vacation town. Wherever it is, make sure it is easily accessible to you so that you can visit it regularly and without too much distance or other disincentives that might stop you from being an active part of its restoration. If you are not a resident of the area in which the cemetery is located, this may cause red tape problems, but that will depend on the area and the responsible parties.;
, Orphaned cemeteries are still owned by someone or some entity and often it will be a municipal responsibility. Start by asking at your local government office and move from there. Even if a church appears to be responsible for a cemetery, sometimes the church has ceased to tend it through lack of funds or having moved its current cemetery to other places due to space constraints and nobody has thought to keep tending the old cemetery. In many cases, there may be as few as 5 - 10 headstones and where there are few remnants of the past like this, people tend to forget. You may find that there are trustees of cemeteries who are no longer able to keep up their ""perpetual care"" owing to age, death or funds having run out. Be sure to find out who may have custody of any remaining cemetery records, plots or maps. Older cemeteries often have no remaining record of who is buried there. If the gravestones are still extant and legible, write down as much information as you can, take digital photographs of each grave marker, index them by full name, surname first, and give a copy to the local heritage/historical society, www.usgenweb.org and/or local library. If you want to be really fancy, you can include GPS coordinates too. Genealogists will thank you! Do some research on the Internet, in the local library, or at www.familysearch.org and in government offices.

, This task may be performed either before or after you have formed a team to help with the restoration. Sometimes permission can be the impetus for forming a group of devoted restorers; sometimes having the restoration team in place is the only motivation that will put in train the ability to get a permission for restoration. Play it by ear and do some preliminary homework as to logistics of permission and team formation first.

, The team's task will be to voluntarily restore the graves, gravestones and any other relevant cemetery features to their former glory. Some of the sources from which you may be able to draw interested persons include:


Place of worship - the congregation of a place of worship attached to a neglected cemetery may be interested in forming a restoration team, contributing members or even funds
Historical and cultural societies
Museum groups
Local residents' organizations
School groups and youth groups

, In each case, you will need to talk the to those in charge of groups. Although an in-depth restoration plan is best left to the restoration team and its own brainstorming meetings, you will need a blueprint to show others and convince them why the cemetery should be restored. Keep it short and persuasive in tone. Emphasize the historical, cultural, faith and community benefits of loving restoration of our human past.

, This is about drawing up a plan. The plan must include:


Assessment of the problems and things that need to be fixed
Assessment of the costs to do restorative work
Potential funding sources (government, events, raffles, donations, collections etc.)
Responsibilities for managing the restoration team, any legal and insurance issues and its finances (hint, keep this as simple as possible and ask for pro bono legal and financial advice)
Meeting dates for discussion, regular dates for restoration work, including that most mundane of needs - feeding the volunteer helpers!

, Many heritage and restoration grants are offered by government and local government. Look at websites for national, regional and local governments in the areas of the arts, heritage, environmental restoration, cultural, and community services. Contact your local politicians for information and support.

, This means finding something of interest in the cemetery that will give you media coverage and draw in more interest and donations to the cause. Ask these questions:


What is the cemetery known for?
Do burials in the cemetery reflect a certain famous event in history? For example, deaths by disease during transportation to the colonies, deaths by a virulent flu ravaging a country, deaths from a shipwreck etc.?
Is the cemetery neglected because of language or cultural changes? For instance, in Quebec, Canada, many English graveyards in the Eastern townships have been neglected as the social balance changes to more French-speaking inhabitants than English-speaking inhabitants.
Is there one famous, infamous or relatively important burial in the cemetery?

, Set specific tasks for the team, such as:


Restoring fallen over headstones;
Restoring misplaced headstones;
Mending broken gravestones and statues;
Remarking the borders around graves;
Polishing gravestones;

Weeding and replanting;
Moss and lichen removal (unless your group considers this to add a pleasant touch)
General tidy-up

, When the restoration team has completed its restoration task, hold an event that will attract locals, history buffs, the curious and the media.


Have a commemorative plaque made for unveiling that specifies the reason for the restoration, the name of the restoration team, the date and any other pertinent details.
Send out press releases to the media.
Have snacks, drinks and music on hand to make this a real social occasion.
Ask the local mayor or some other local dignitary to give a speech.

, Do not disband when the restoration is complete. Continue to tend the cemetery. Continue to hold events to attract funding and to maintain interest in the site. Post information online to attract history buffs and link this with the local community's tourism industry. Heritage tourism is a fast-growing industry and restored cemeteries are a definite part of such touristic activities.

In fact, 90% of positions require it.An associate’s degree may be enough if you have the necessary work experience, too.


If you can and are interested, study agriculture, forestry, or environment. Having a background in these areas can make you an obvious candidate for these understaffed areas.
All education positions require a minimum GPA of 2.5.;
, Your application will be very strong if you’ve taken college level French or Spanish. About 35% of countries require either two years of high school or one year of college level French (or other Romance language), or four years of high school or two years of college level Spanish.If you do get posted in a country that requires Spanish or French and you don't know the language, the Peace Corps does offer you language training at the beginning of your assignment. It is paid for and is included in the 27 month arrangement.

, The Peace Corps is looking for individuals who have demonstrated a love of helping others. If you come in with volunteer experience – whether it's at a hospital, a soup kitchen, or tutoring kids – you're showing that you already have a grip on what's expected of you. It tells the Peace Corps that you have the right character for the job.


It doesn't matter what it is! Getting involved in your community not only proves your work ethic and character, but it'll help prepare you for the basis of the work you'll be doing with the Peace Corps. It's that feeling of helping people that you can become accustomed to with volunteer work, whatever it is.

, When on assignment, you'll be working with locals, often on your own. Coming into the Peace Corps having already had a leadership position or two makes your application that much stronger.So whether it's leading a group of volunteers, leading your sorority or fraternity, or leading your school band, include it on your application.


Any work you do autonomously is good, too. Showing you're independent and can take care of yourself are two huge qualities the Peace Corps needs in their volunteers.

, The online application is easy to understand and takes less than an hour. Before you do it, you may want to take a gander at the FAQ section, the personal bios, and get a feel for the program, however. It's better to take a little time at the start than to waste an hour applying for something you're not actually interested in!


If you don't want to fill out the application online, or have further questions, you can call their toll-free hotline at (1) 855-855-1961., This is easily done in 10 or 15 minutes, and is available immediately after you press the ""submit"" button of your online application. This is a comprehensive form that asks questions about your health history.


It is important to fill this out to the best of your knowledge, since it affects which forms are sent to you during your full medical review.

, A quick look on the Peace Corps website will show you pages and pages of openings. You can specify by region and job category, too. The Peace Corps has six departments – you will get placed in one of the following areas:Education
Youth in Development
Health
Community Economic Development
Agriculture
Environment

, Concurrently with doing your medical kit you will also be contacted by your regional Peace Corps Office to confirm a date for your interview. This is to get a feel for which department you'd be good in and what countries would best suit you. The officer then suggests where he or she thinks is best for you to placed and files the paperwork for you.


Don't stress about it. All of the recruiters are former volunteers and are very, very nice, so if you genuinely want to join the Peace Corps, having a one- to two-hour conversation about the possibility of going abroad and serving will be no problem.

, Your recruiter will nominate you for a program. Unfortunately, you don't get to know what it is. After this point your file and everything that you do will be through the National Peace Corps Office in Washington, D.C. It will take a long time to hear anything (around 6 months usually). But it will come! Once you get your nomination, contact your local office to accept.


If you don’t like your assignment, you can reapply. However, you have to go through the process again and likely wait another 6 months.

, This is the only part of the process you’ll have to pay for, from the initial application to flying to your destination. After you are nominated, you will be sent an extremely comprehensive medical packet. Make an appointment with your doctor, multiple if you can. You will need multiple blood tests, a physical exam, pap test for females, and numerous other tests for males and applicants ages 50+.


Make sure the entire packet is filled out and signed. If something is missed, your medical officer will request any additional needed documents, but this can further lengthen your application process, and even possibly push back your departure date.

, Joining the Peace Corps is no small decision. Many people go for the wrong reasons and end up returning home a few months later. Here’s a few things to consider.


Don’t join the Peace Corps because you want to travel. You’re there to work. You may even be in a location where traveling is incredibly difficult. What’s more, money for travel is not included in your living stipend.
Don’t join the Peace Corps because you want to change the world. You won't. You'll change the worlds of a few, sure, but not the whole world.
Don’t join the Peace Corps because you don’t know what you want to do. The Peace Corps requires a very specific type of individual. Not knowing what you want to do does not mean you're ready to live in third-world conditions and succeed.

, There are a few basics to a Peace Corps assignment that apply to every program. Everyone's experience is different, but a few things remain the same. Here’s how it works:


Each assignment is 27 months. There are shorter ones (part of the Peace Corps Response program), but those are generally reserved for seasoned professionals and/or veteran Corps volunteers.You will get money after you complete the 27 months for adjustment (around $8,000 pre-taxes). This sounds like a lot, but it quickly disappears, especially if you travel after your assignment is up.
If you have student loans, they can be deferred while you’re away. Up to 15% of federal Perkins loans can be absolved per year of service.

, The absolute best way to wrap your head around what you may be about to do is to talk to someone who’s already done it. You can read bios or blogs on the Internet, call up your sister's friend's old babysitter, or contact volunteers through the website or through your recruiter.


Some people will tell you it was the greatest thing they've ever done. Others will tell you it was painful and they counted down the days until they could come home. The experience of a Peace Corp volunteer all depends on the individual – keep that in mind when you're talking with one.

, Peace Corps volunteers make differences on local levels, not on the world level. This is something most volunteers don’t realize going in – to find the difference you make, you may have to really look. It'll be in a child's English skills, or a small village's farming capabilities. Remember: these things do matter. Especially to them.


Plenty of people tend to think that being in the Peace Corps is about something it's not, whether it's traveling, or changing the economic outlook of a country. On the individual level, it's smaller than that. And that's fine. By just being a part of it, you're doing all you can.

, At the very beginning, you’ll know no one. When you hear English being spoken, your ears will perk up and you’ll go running in that direction. You'll miss hanging out with friends, eating, drinking, and all the things you took for granted back home. In time you'll adjust, but many experience extreme homesickness. The Peace Corps is only for those who can handle this separation.


You will make friends. It'll take some time, and you may not have a lot of options, but you will make friends. There will be other volunteers working with you. You'll have free time, too, to spend with them. They may be the best friends you ever make.

, While on assignment, it’s very likely that you’ll be in place where you’ll be stared at and even potentially harassed. You'll be alone and sometimes even feel like you're in a zoo, on display pretty much 24/7. This is hard to get used to, and some can't handle it. It takes a strong individual to thrive in these conditions. If you can do just that, you're perfect for the peace corps.


This is especially true for women. It’s very possible you’ll be in a country where gender equality is still an evolving idea. You may be the butt of jokes and harassment from time to time. Very unfortunately, this is common in certain areas. More unfortunately, there is often little you can do but deal.

, This is especially true at the beginning, when you're learning the language and getting situated. Bring a hobby with you, like a guitar or knitting. Even if you don’t play guitar or know how to knit, you’ll have time to learn!


This doesn't necessarily mean you'll get to travel, but it can. However, keep in mind that ""traveling"" may mean staying in a dirt hut and getting there by flagged-down banana boat!

, We’re not talking you’ll need to shop at a different grocery chain, we’re talking not having running water or electricity. You won’t have things to do on Friday night and you might not even have friends to turn to. Dirt may get into nooks and crannies of your body you didn't know existed, you may not be accustomed to the weather, and you'll feel like an outsider in your own world. In many ways, this is a wonderful thing. It's just remembering that it's wonderful that's the hard part!


That being said, volunteers now generally have a different experience than the volunteers of yore. Only about 1 in 4 volunteers don’t have running water or electricity anymore. Times, in a sense, are getting easier.

Be attentive wherever you are for opportunities to help someone.,
Do something nice for someone you don't know (or don't know very well).,
Spread the word.,
Pay it forward.",How to Pay It Forward," Perhaps you have an elderly or disabled neighbor who is too proud to ask for help with their yard work or maybe you're in a restaurant and see someone who looks like they could use some kind stranger to pay for their meal. You can change people's attitudes about the world through your unobtrusive acts of kindness.;
, It should be something significant, and not for a person from whom you expect a good deed—or anything at all, for that matter—in return.

, If the person thanks you and wants to ""repay"" you (that is, pay it ""back""), let them know that what you'd really like is for them to pay it ""forward""—you'd like them to do something nice for three people they don't know, and ask those three people to do something nice for three more people. The idea is to consciously increase the goodness of the world.

, When you notice that somebody has done something nice for you, make a note in your mind to practice three acts of kindness towards other people, as described in Step 3.

Understand what Knowledge Philanthropy really means.,
Consider, generally, how a person can be a Knowledge Philanthropist.,
Be creative.,
Practice and reflect on quality.,
Experiment, observe and read widely.,
Contribute generously, but be wise.,
Use your skills.",How to Be a Knowledge Philanthropist," Philanthropy, as a word, comes from Greek root words, phil for loving (such as phil-o-sophy, meaning love of wisdom) and anthropos , for humanity (such as anthropology). Knowledge has mixed roots. Know is an old Germanic word with the older meaning now largely obsolete, but has closer roots with the word acknowledge as we use it today as well as the word gnosis. To know, means to recognise, identify or perceive and to declare that perception. Today, to know means to understand.;
, A knowledge philanthropist not only wishes to share their knowledge, but share it for the benefit of others. It is important to remember that philanthropy simply means giving out of goodwill for other people. You want people to be able to be more free from the intellectual puzzles and problems of life, as well as resolve and act effectively to the physical challenges they may experience throughout life.

, Knowledge can too easily become limited and constrained. Many aspects of society become risk averse and, so, become dependent on qualifications, citations and other formal designations, simply to act as a security mechanism and provide assurance that the knowledge provider has special, high-level training or experience. There are applications where this is certainly important, such as when there is a gas leak and you need a qualified person who can safely repair the pipe. However, no one needs a qualification or citation of authority to be able to write and enjoy poetry, paint art, cook, enjoy the scenery or experience life more broadly.

, Quality is an ambiguous term and always will be a subjective one. The word itself comes from a Latin source, meaning ""of what type or category"" and qualify, being a related source word is about identifying the type. In later terms, it means a degree of goodness. The practical application is simply to share your knowledge as well as you can, in the best form it can be.

, Knowledge ultimately comes from experience. We may be told in a science class what happens when we mix a metal with an acid, but only when we perform the experiment and observe the results, can we really see for ourselves what happens. The same applies for knowledge that we may learn in our day to day life at work, school, home and in the community. Knowledge Philanthropy does not necessarily limit a person to what they have experienced, but the best insights come from understanding a thing you have tried and tested for yourself and not limiting yourself to the information you have been told by another.

, Be involved in wikis, in your local community and other services that may be in need of your knowledge. Age is one of the several classic prejudices a person will face, so a dedicated philanthropist should be aware of the challenges. When too young, an older person will seldom acknowledge them, as so often the young lack experience; when old, the young will think they are out of touch. In the middle, no one notices them. When a person has an agenda, a prejudice, an inflexible personal idea, or some other concept or method they prefer, in many cases it is fine to leave them be, for they are not always able to learn and share as easily as others.

, If you may not have much knowledge in cookery or mechanics but can improve the grammar, images, and quality of the article, that is just as important as the original work. Using your skills to contribute and improve will make the difference and by teaching others your skills, you are helping to improve the world.

Understand the different forms of human trafficking.,
Look for visible indicators of trafficking.,
Know the profile of a trafficked person.,
Ask questions if you suspect an individual is a victim.,
Take part in human trafficking awareness training.",How to Take Action to Fight Human Trafficking1," Human trafficking generally takes on one of two forms. In any form of trafficking, however, traffickers take individuals against their will and use the individuals for various illicit reasons. Often, traffickers recruit people by making fraudulent advertisements and promising legitimate jobs.The first type of human trafficking, sex trafficking, occurs when victims are exploited and forced to perform sexual acts against their will. Trafficking victims can be forced to work on the street or in establishments that offer sexual services (e.g., brothels, strip clubs, and pornography production houses). These establishments are often disguised as massage parlors, escort services, adult bookstores, modeling studios, and bars.


The second kind of human trafficking, labor trafficking, occurs when individuals are forced into indentured servitude. Usually, labor trafficking victims end up in sweatshops, commercial agricultural situations, domestic situations, construction sites, and in restaurants.;
, Trafficking victims are kept against their will through the use of intimidation, fear, abuse, and physical control. While each scenario of human trafficking can differ, there are some common threads that have been found to be good indicators that human trafficking is taking place. If you are in a location where you see indications of trafficking, report the activity. Examples of visible indicators include:Heavy security at commercial establishments. This might include barred windows, locked doors, isolated locations, and electronic surveillance. Often, women will never be allowed to leave without an escort.
Victims will often live at the same location together and will be transported to work sites by guards. In labor trafficking scenarios, workers will not be allowed to leave and they will likely be guarded by traffickers.
Victims will usually be kept under surveillance at all times (e.g., when going to the doctor). In public places, guards will disguise themselves as friends or interpreters.

, Most trafficking victims will never admit or volunteer information about the situation. This happens because the victims are scared and concerned for their safety and well being. However, trafficked individuals usually take on certain characteristics that make them identifiable as victims. Look for these types of indicators when you speak with or come across individuals you think might be human trafficking victims. Remember, just because an individual exhibits these indicators does not mean they are 100% a trafficking victim. However, if you notice that an individual exhibits some of these indicators, you should report the activity. Law enforcement will investigate the possible trafficking in more depth. The following characteristics may be exhibited by those being held against their will as victims of human trafficking:Health characteristics, which include malnutrition, dehydration, poor personal hygiene, sexually transmitted diseases, signs of sexual abuse, bruising, broken bones, critical illnesses, and psychological disorders.
Other signs that an individual is being controlled by someone else, including individuals that do not hold their own identification documents, who suffer from verbal or psychological abuse, and those who do not carry or control their own money.

, If you are in a location where you believe someone is the victim of human trafficking, ask yourself some common questions to get a better idea of the situation. If the answers you think up lead you to believe someone is the victim of human trafficking, contact law enforcement as soon as possible. For example, if you see someone or something that exhibits signs of human trafficking, ask yourself:Whether the person looks free to leave
Whether the person looks physically or emotionally abused
Whether the person has valid forms of identification and whether he or she is in possession of those documents
Whether the person seems to be getting paid for their work
Whether the individual lives at home or somewhere near the work site
How the individual arrived to the work site (i.e., on his or her own or did someone else take them)
Whether the person or their family seems to have been threatened
Whether the person fears leaving the job

, The U.S. Department of State offers online training materials to help you identify victims. Because human trafficking is such a hidden crime, the first step in helping victims and catching criminals is being able to identify the victims. The training video will walk you through what human trafficking is, how to identify it, and common themes of trafficking (e.g., recognizing vulnerable populations).


Take the class when you have a chance so you can learn about human trafficking and how to fight it."
"
Incorporate information into your professional materials.,
Write your government representatives.,
Distribute helpful materials.,
Host awareness events.,
Encourage schools to teach about human trafficking.,
Keep up-to-date on human trafficking news.,
Contact your local paper.,
Start a petition.,
Provide opportunities for victims.,
Be a conscientious consumer.",How to Take Action to Fight Human Trafficking2," One easy way to teach your community about human trafficking, which will in turn help combat its causes and effects, is to incorporate information into your conferences, trainings, manuals, and other relevant materials.For example, the American Bar Association has created best practices for businesses, training for lawyers and members of the law enforcement community, and has boosted awareness for pro bono opportunities to ensure victims are well taken care of., Meet with, or write, your government representatives to discuss human trafficking. Consider contacting everyone at the local, state, and federal level. Let them know that you care about human trafficking in your community. Furthermore, ask what they are doing to address human trafficking. Request the introduction of bills, discussions in committees, a particular vote on a particular bill, and other means of taking action., Make people in your community aware of human trafficking by legally distributing trafficking materials in public spaces.For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services offers newsletters, campaign materials, and contact information that you can use and distribute to help raise awareness.In addition, the Department of Homeland Security has launched the Blue Campaign, which strives to protect the victims of human trafficking and bring those responsible to justice.The Blue Campaign offers a resources page where you can find media printouts, videos, and campaign materials that you can print and distribute., Try to get a group of concerned citizens together to watch a recent documentary on human trafficking. If you cannot find a documentary or do not have access to one, watch training videos and other materials offered online. After you watch the videos, discuss them and open up a dialogue. See how people might feel about human trafficking and how you might be able to get more people involved with the fight against it., A lot of school curriculums fail to recognize and address current issues facing the world. Even if schools do address some of these current issues, human trafficking is often left of the list. Encourage your school to incorporate the issue into their curriculum.Some organizations, for example Frederick Douglas Family Initiatives, actually has a curriculum teachers can incorporate directly into the school day.Take this knowledge to your local schools and ask them to introduce the information to their teachers and students.


In addition to teaching children about human trafficking, talk with parents, teachers, and administrators about the risks of human trafficking on school-aged children. Bring materials issued by the U.S. Department of Education to show them., You can do something as simple as setting up alerts on your phone and computer to receive up-to-date news on human trafficking.For example, you can set up a Google Alert about human trafficking. After the alert is set up, you will receive notifications whenever a news article arises that concerns human trafficking., Write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper discussing the issue of human trafficking in your community.This can help bring awareness to another group of individuals that may not get online or walk around public spaces where you might be handing out resources.

, The internet allows you to start a petition and circulate it to millions of people instantly. Using sites like change.org, you can create your own petition calling for a specific action to be taken on human trafficking (i.e., starting task forces, creating victim hotlines).Get online and create one of these petitions. Once you do, send the link to everyone you know and ask them to sign it. If your petition gains enough traction and signatures, community members might be forced to listen to your concerns., If you are a business, refuse to allow traffickers to use you. In addition, provide internships, job/skills training, and hire victims of trafficking to help them get on their feet. If you are a medical provider, extend low-cost or free medical services to victims of trafficking. If you are an attorney, offer pro bono services to victims and anti-trafficking organizations., Encourage companies to get rid of forced labor by investigating and eliminating trafficking within their supply chains. Ask that companies publish their findings and what they are doing to fight traffickers.Some websites, for example chainstorereaction.com, offer pre-written letters that you can send for free to companies of your choice. These letters discuss human trafficking and what companies can do to combat it.The U.S. Department of Labor even keeps a list of goods that have been produced using forced labor.Check this list often and refuse to buy anything produced through forced labor.
You can also take a survey to find out about your ""slavery footprint."" Using the website and taking the quiz can help you discover your unintended connection to human trafficking."
"
Join anti-trafficking coalitions.,
Volunteer your time.,
Donate funds and items to worthy organizations.,
Join or start human trafficking task forces.",How to Take Action to Fight Human Trafficking3," Coalitions are groups of individuals brought together because of a common interest. Search online for coalitions on human trafficking in your area. If one exists, contact them and ask them how you can get involved.If one does not exist, consider starting one. When you start a coalition, contact influential people in your community that deal with human trafficking. Ask them to be involved and help you. Set up meetings and email lists so people can be made aware of what you are doing., If an organization exists in your community to help fight human trafficking, contact them and ask if you can get involved. If you have some professional skill, let them know that you are willing to volunteer your services. For example, if you are an attorney, let them know you can offer legal services for free. If you are a doctor, let them know you can provide free healthcare services to victims in need. If you are a grant writer, let them know you would be willing to write a grant application for them every so often. If you simply have extra time on your hands, let the organization know that you would be willing to pass out fliers or other resources to the community.


Nonprofit organizations rely on their volunteers to survive. You will always be able to offer something of value so do not hesitate to contact a local anti-trafficking organization. They will most likely be willing and able to put you to work immediately., If you cannot donate your time and expertise to a nonprofit organization, consider donating your money and goods.All nonprofits rely on cash donations to keep their doors open. If you have some extra money to use, give it to a worthy organization. Most organizations will take online donations, which will make it extremely easy for you to make one.


In addition to donating money, consider donating goods. For example, if a nonprofit organization takes in trafficking victims, consider donating personal hygiene products, coats, sleeping bags, and other materials that can help victims get back on their feet.

, If you are a part of the law enforcement community, ask to join or start a human trafficking task force.These task forces help to identify and rescue human trafficking victims through proactive investigations. They can also help bring together multiple agencies so efforts can be coordinated. In some circumstances, you might even be able to get funding from state and federal governments."

Call the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC).,
Get help from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).,
Contact the Department of Justice (DOJ).",How to Take Action to Fight Human Trafficking4," If you think someone is in immediate danger, always call 911. However, if you think you have information about a trafficking situation, the main hotline to call is offered through the NHTRC. They can be reached at 1-888-373-7888. In addition, if you have access to a computer, you can submit information online. Once the information is submitted, it will be passed along immediately to the proper law enforcement authorities. When you call or submit information online, you will be asked to provide the following information:The type of trafficking taking place
The victim's country of origin
The number of potential victims
The location of the trafficking
Who the victims are (e.g., male, female, adults, or minors)
Any additional comments you think might be helpful
Your personal information (if you want to be anonymous just check the appropriate box or tell the operator)

, DHS also has a hotline you can call, and an online report you can use, to provide information about trafficking activity. If you prefer to call DHS you can dial 866-347-2423. Whether you are contacting DHS online or over the phone, you should be prepared to submit the following information:Your personal information (unless you want to remain anonymous)
What the suspected violation looks like (i.e., human trafficking)
The location of the criminal activity
What the violator looks like
Where the violator is located

, The DOJ can also help get important information to the correct parties. You can contact the DOJ at 1-888-428-7581. Explain what you have seen and the DOJ will forward the information appropriately. If you are a victim, you might even be eligible for service and immigration assistance."

Talk with friends and colleagues.,
Speak to local civic groups.,
Publish editorials voicing your opinion against the death penalty.",How to Take Action to Abolish the Death Penalty1," First, you need to be sure to educate yourself on the issue. Learn as much as you can on the topic of the death penalty, and then share your research with others. After you are confident that you fully understand the issue, and you can speak clearly about it and defend your ideals, it is time to begin spreading your opinion. Start with a small circle of friends, family, or coworkers. Talk about the topic openly and try to gain support for your opinion. As you discuss the topic more, you will find which people want to support and join you as you take the matter to a broader stage.


Realize that the death penalty can be a divisive topic, with many people taking strong opinions on one side or the other. If you meet someone with an opposite viewpoint, keep your conversation civil. You can hold to your convictions, and focus the conversation on factual matters. By discussing facts, rather than opinions, you can keep the conversation informational rather than confrontational.;
, Seek out civic organizations or groups that share your view on the topic of the death penalty. Join with them, or see if you can attend a meeting sometime and speak on the issue. To find groups that would be interested in a discussion or presentation on the topic, try the following:


search online for ""death penalty speakers"" to find discussion groups or lecture series on the topic
network with friends and colleagues
contact a local college or university to see if a student group on human rights would be interested in hosting a speaker
contact local civic organizations like Kiwanis or the Rotary Club
Reach out to religious groups (e.g., churches, pastors, priests, rabbis)

, You can either send letters to established print media, such as local newspapers or other regional publications, or you can post your own information online. The Internet provides a very broad opportunity to reach out to people and share your views.

Start a petition drive with a strong statement of your position.,
Include a statement of the rationale for your position.,
Study the rules in your state or area for a viable petition.,
Set goals for your signature gathering.,
Find enough volunteers to help you collect signatures.,
Provide the volunteers with training and materials.,
Organize your petition drive.,
Collect the completed petitions and deliver them to the appropriate government office.",How to Take Action to Abolish the Death Penalty2," A petition can be a powerful tool to show the government not only that you are opposed to the death penalty but also that many other people feel the same way. You can begin by writing out a clear statement of your position, something like, “We, the undersigned petitioners, strongly oppose the death penalty in this country/state and encourage the government to abolish it immediately.”, A strong petition statement will include a few sentences that support your position. This will be based on your prior research.You may say something like, “Recent research demonstrates that the death penalty is biased against _______ race of people, as ____% more are killed than whites.”
You might also include statistics on the number of deaths: “In 2015, ____ people were put to death. This number is outrageously high.”

, If you are trying to present a petition that will be binding on the government to take some action, you probably have to follow certain rules. Some of the rules that generally apply to governmental petitions include the following:a minimum number of signatures for the petition to be valid
whether you must use specific forms or petition sheets
whether you need printed names along with signatures
whether you must include addresses for each signer, or any other information
deadlines for submitting the petitions to be considered on an upcoming ballot

, Based on what you find regarding the petition rules in your area, you will need to establish goals and expectations for gathering names. It is usually recommended that you try to collect up to 50% more names than the minimum requirement.It has been found that in most petition campaigns, many signatures are either invalid or unverifiable. Collecting many extras will ensure that your petition will be accepted.

, You are not likely to be able to collect all the signatures that you need on your own. Think about the number of signatures that you need, and then figure out a reasonable number that can be collected by one person. This will let you know how many volunteers you should have., You will need to get copies of the official petition sheet, sufficient numbers of pens to collect signatures, and clipboards for each volunteer. If you are able to set up a collection station at a fixed location, you may also choose to get a table and promotional materials as well. Be sure that all your volunteers fully understand the cause and are ready to talk on the issue when they approach people to sign the petition., You want to be sure that your volunteers are not approaching the same people over and over to gather signatures. Organize their efforts with assigned locations, either as fixed stations or in neighborhoods to visit door-to-door. It would also help to arrange common times to collect signatures., When your petition drive is complete, find out where you need to send the petitions, and have them delivered.If you are just trying to influence the votes of your legislators, then you will want to send copies of the signed petitions to your state or federal representatives and senators.
If you are trying to get a specific question placed on the ballot for a vote at the next election, there will be very specific rules you must follow. You will have to provide the original and certain numbers of copies to the Secretary of State's office. If this is your plan, make sure that you research the procedure very carefully ahead of time.
If you are just trying to raise awareness of the public's views on the death penalty, then fewer rules apply. You will want to share copies of the completed petitions with news outlets, both in print and on television.

Understand the purpose of initiatives.,
Write a proposed law.,
Submit the proposed initiative to the secretary of state or attorney general.,
Allow for public review.,
Format your petition.,
Obtain the required number of signatures.",How to Take Action to Abolish the Death Penalty3," Some states offer their citizens an opportunity to directly propose and enact state laws and state constitutional amendments. This process, called the initiative process, can be used to outlaw the death penalty in your state. While there are quite a few states that offer an initiative process, California and Oregon are two states that utilize the practice often., The first step in the initiative process is to draft the proposed law you would like enacted. As the petitioner, you can certainly choose to write the language yourself. However, your chances of success will increase drastically if you hire help. If you are writing the language on your own, make sure you do some research into how statutes and constitutional amendments are worded. A poorly drafted law is unlikely to get the support necessary to make it on the ballot. The proposed law should be persuasive, succinct, and it should follow general legal rules of construction (e.g., where to put commas, sentence structure, etc.).


If you want to pay to get help, hire a lawyer. Lawyers have a unique understanding of how laws are worded and drafted. If you do not know any lawyers, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. After answering a few general questions, you will be put in contact with qualified lawyers in your area. Try to find a lawyer who has experience with your state's ballot initiative process. In a state like California, you may even be able to find a lawyer who specializes in this area of the law.
If you cannot afford a lawyer, or you want to take a different route to get help, consider petitioning your state's legislative counsel to help you. In Oregon, for example, the Legislative Counsel will assist you in drafting a proposed initiative so long as you get 50 or more signatures from electors requesting help and the Legislative Counsel Committee determines that the initiative is likely to make it on the ballot.If you get help from the legislative counsel in your state, they will draft the law with your input.

, Once the proposed law has been written, you need to submit it to the state government for review. For example, in California, you must send in your proposed law, along with a written request asking that a title and summary of the proposal be written.


As a part of your proposal you will also have to submit certain declarations and certifications promising that you are proposing the initiative for proper purposes. For example, in California, you will have to declare, under penalty of perjury, that you are a citizen of the US and California and that you are over the age of 18. Also, you will have to sign a certification promising that you will not use any signatures you collect for improper purposes.
When you submit your proposal to the state, you will have to pay a fee. In California, for example, the fee is $2,000. The fee is placed in trust and will be refunded to you as long as your initiative makes it on the ballot within two years. However, if your initiative fails to make the ballot, you will forfeit the fee., Once the state government reviews your proposal and creates a working title and summary, they will post your proposal on their website and facilitate a 30-day public review process. During this 30-day period, any member of the public can submit comments about your proposal. The government will provide you with these comments and give you an opportunity to amend your proposal.


Make sure you amend your proposal quickly as you will only have a limited amount of time to do so. In California, for example, you will not be able to amend your proposal once five days have elapsed since the public comment period ended., After the public review process, you will have to format a formal petition, which will be the document you circulate in order to gather signatures. The format of your petition is dictated by state law. For example, in California, your title and summary must be at least 12-point bold font and the body of the petition must be at least 8-point font. There must be a heading, title, summary, the entire proposed text, and a signature section.Check with your state to ensure you follow the directions. If you fail to create an adequate petition, your initiative will not move forward.

, In order to qualify for the ballot, your initiative must be signed by the required number of qualified voters. For example, in California, you will have to get somewhere between 365,880 and 585,407 valid signatures. This will be done by circulating your petition throughout the state and having people sign it. You can hire circulators, get volunteers, or collect signatures through other means so long as it is allowed by your state.


Each signature must be given by a registered voter who lives in the county where the petition is being circulated. Each person signing must personally place his or her signature, printed name, and address on the petition.
Once you think you have obtained the required number of signatures, you will submit your petition to the state government for review. The government will ensure that each signature is real, accurate, and not a duplicate.The government will always invalidate some signatures for various reasons so it is always a good idea to get more signatures than just the minimum. If your petition is granted, your initiative will be placed on the ballot.

Decide the objective of your event.,
Meet with supporters to choose an event.,
Find out the local requirements for your event.,
Delegate the work.,
Plan the details of the event very carefully.,
Advertise early.,
Conduct the event.,
Follow up with people after the event.",How to Take Action to Abolish the Death Penalty4," Anytime you want to conduct some sort of public event, you need to have a goal in mind. Are you going to conduct a rally to gather signatures on a petition? Or a parade to raise general awareness? Or a strike in front of the state legislature to influence votes? You need to consider the possibilities and then proceed with an event that is targeted to your objective.

, If you want to do something public to gather support and attention for your anti-death penalty position, you will need to begin with a planning group of supporters. Get together and decide what kind of event you want to hold. Some ideas might be:A parade
A picket strike or rally
A fundraising concert
A lecture at a school or hall

, You may need a permit to conduct the event you want. You may need police details for crowd control. Depending on the location and duration, you may need to rent portable toilet facilities. You need to meet with your planning group and consider these sorts of details., Don’t try to do everything by yourself. Among a small group of supporters, assign different people to do different tasks. One person can be in charge of obtaining the permit, while another person can begin working on advertising and press releases. A well-organized project will keep everyone active and involved, without overworking anyone., Make sure that you are a step ahead of everything. You should know how the time is going to be filled and what will be happening during the full event. If you are having a speaker, who will make the introductions? How long will each person speak? What is your overall objective for the event, and how will you know that it has been achieved? Spend time thinking of questions and answering them, well in advance., Give the public plenty of time to hear about your event and to plan to attend. Be clear in your advertisements about the date, time and location. If the event has clear start and stop times, let people know this. On the other hand, if it is a rally that starts at a particular time and lasts as long as people are interested, you can say that.Make use of multiple outlets for advertising. You may consider posting flyers, taking out newspaper, radio or television ads, or blasting announcements on social media.

, On the day of your event, be sure to arrive at your location early. If you have guest speakers or notable attendees, be sure to have someone ready to greet them. Oversee that details are put in place, like sound equipment, staging, etc. Stick to your original plan, but try to be ready with alternate contingencies if necessary., If you were able to get contact information for the people who attended your event, you should reach out to them afterward with telephone calls, postcards, or email messages. Thank them for attending, offer to get them involved in future events or activities, or provide them with additional information that may help encourage their support to abolish the death penalty."

Use the Internet and social media.,
Write editorial letters to local or national newspapers.,
Contact television sources.",How to Take Action to Abolish the Death Penalty5," The Internet and the various social media outlets are very strong tools in building public opinion. If you know someone who is good at web design, you may even create a site of your own to post information, share research, and gather public opinion in support of your cause. You can also make strong use of Twitter or other outlets to reach a wide section of the population.


For example, the latest efforts in the ongoing civil rights movement have become universal through Twitter and Facebook with ""#blacklivesmatter."" The creation of a catchy phrase and a hashtag gets instant attention when the topic goes viral.Another topic that caught wide attention through social media was the Occupy Wall Street movement. Organizers gained wide recognition with the creation of @OccupyWallSt on Twitter. That single name alone received over 200,000 followers., While computerized social media is quick and efficient, there is still a large proportion of the population that reads newspapers and gathers opinions from regional or national printed sources.

, The idea of a group of people coming together on a topic as emotional as the death penalty is usually enough to catch the attention of the local news. You should contact regional television news stations and notify them of any events you are holding, notify them of your petition drive before it begins (this will encourage some people to look for you to sign the petition), and notify them of opportunities to join your campaign."
"
Organize your research around certain facts and topics related to the death penalty.,
Research the subject thoroughly.,
Learn about both sides of the issue.,
Respect people with different opinions.",How to Take Action to Abolish the Death Penalty6," The death penalty is a very emotional issue for many people, but you are not likely to bring about serious change based solely on emotions. You need to research factual articles to learn some of the details about the death penalty. Some of the topics you may wish to research are:


The number of prisoners put to death over a given time period.
The countries or states that do and do not use the death penalty.
The countries or states that have recently changed their position on the death penalty.
Details on costs associated with the death penalty.
Factual information about prisoners who have been exonerated before (or after) being put to death.

, There are numerous agencies and storehouses of information that exist just to support research on the death penalty. You can make use of their resources to begin your research. Some leading sources that may help you begin are:


The Death Penalty Information CenterThe Pew Research CenterThe National Academies PressThe Heritage Foundation, To be responsible in your presentation, you must be prepared to consider both sides of the issue. Read articles that are in favor of the death penalty, as well as those that are opposed to it.Sometimes, your best research will consist of reading books or articles that do not take a position on either side but, instead, report facts and details., To argue well on any topic, you must at least respect the opinion of the opposing side. Showing respect does not require agreement. It means that you recognize the possibility of holding an opposing view, and you will treat the subject seriously. It will make you work harder to present your side of the issue, but in the end, your argument will be strengthened."

Keep informed about a broad range of related issues.,
Consult with other advocates against capital punishment.",How to Take Action Against Capital Punishment in Your State," It may help you to focus your efforts on a couple of current capital cases in your state. Focusing your work on a couple of specific cases may be more effective than tackling several cases or state laws as a whole. However, you should also stay on top of general issues related to capital punishment. Combining this knowledge can help you become a very informed participant in the action against these cases, which in turn may help alter capital punishment laws.


Find a list of upcoming executions at those executions carried out at http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/execution-list-2016. Look for cases from your state and pick one or two about which to inform yourself and around which you can start to build your action against capital punishment. Since cases tried are a matter of public record, you should be able to access trial proceedings and other information. You might consider contacting lawyers or other advocates who worked on the case, though you should recognize that they may not give you information pursuant to data privacy laws in the United States.;
, In the United States, death row inmates are not allowed to have contact visits with other individuals. They may also not be permitted to have non-contact visits. For this reason, the most feasible way to get the perspective of a death row inmate is to write the person, which is allowed by law.Locate a potential inmate using an online service. This search will allow you to filter out things such as age, gender, location, and religion. Consider writing to both men and women to see if there are any differences in their experiences.Be honest about your intentions. For example, “Dear John, I found your profile online and am interested in writing you. I’m against the death penalty and am very interested to hear your thoughts on it as well as your experiences.” Make sure to include that you would like to learn more about the inmate’s life before prison or any wishes and dreams he or she might have.

, Many groups will organize rallies when there is an execution scheduled or decision on a capital case being made. Attending a local or even national demonstration may help promote the fight against capital punishment. You can also take part in marches such as the Annual March to Abolish the Death Penalty.See what rallies or demonstrations are being held on the websites or social media accounts of organizations or individuals taking action against capital punishment. Many have information on local and national demonstrations and how you can participate.
Ask a fellow advocate if there are any events that you can attend. He or she may also be able to tell you if there is anything that you can do in support of the event.
Be aware that while it is your right in the United States to protest capital punishment, you must do so peacefully. Using any type of violence can put you at risk of arrest or prosecution., Capital punishment laws are carried out in each state. Because of this, discussing the issue with your local and state legislators or representative can be important to the fight against the death penalty. Talk to the person about his or her position on the matter and present your views. This can help the person get a better grasp on the issues which could set in motion the wheel of change in your state.Locate your local and state representatives by using the service from Common Cause at http://act.commoncause.org/site/PageServer?pagename=sunlight_advocacy_list_page.
Schedule a meeting with your legislator. Take notes on specific points you’d like go over during your meeting. This focuses conversation and keeps information at hand should the legislator have questions. Remember to not push your agenda too vociferously by being overly argumentative. Simply getting your point across may be enough to plant a seed in the legislator’s mind about the disadvantages of the death penalty in your state.
Volunteer to work in the campaign of an elected official who takes action against capital punishment. Attending the person’s political events may also help bring further attention to your fight against the death penalty. You might even consider protesting officials who support the death penalty.

, There are sometimes events scheduled to take action against capital punishment in additional to political demonstrations. Going to lectures, marches, and even fundraisers are another way to help effect change in your state’s laws on capital punishment. In addition, you may even help out someone sentenced to death.Check any websites, email updates, and social media account of individuals or organizations who are actively fighting against the death penalty. Many will post or send information on lectures, fundraisers, and marches you can attend or petitions you can sign.Some events may require that you pay or make a small donation. These often help to defray administrative costs or may be used in a specific action against capital punishment.
Consider organizing or hosting an event against capital punishment in your local area. You can do a variety of things such as taking people to scheduled executions to protest, having a fundraiser to donate to a larger organization that fights against the death penalty, or hosting a lecture at a local organization. Advertise your event on social media or in the local news.

, Personal or professional commitments may keep you from giving the amount of time you want to taking action against the death penalty. Making a donation to a local representative or group or a national organization can also be a way to take action against capital punishment.Give as much money as you are able to the organization or consider splitting up the money among a couple of groups. Remember that your donation is tax-deductible.

, You might be a firm believer in the fight against capital punishment. If this is the case, consider applying for a job with a local or national organization that works to abolish the death penalty. This could make a bigger difference in actions against the death penalty and give the organization needed support and skills.Think about how you could fit within the organization’s structure. Many groups have people who work on the legal, educational, and advocacy parameters of opposing the death penalty. For example, if you like research and are good at it, you could put these skills to use in a law library.
Compose a letter of interest detailing your interest and skills and send it along with your resume to the different organizations you’ve identified as potential employers.

, Consider volunteering with an organization or legislator that takes action against capital punishment. Offer to work as much as you can to continue the fight to abolish the death penalty. Make sure to let the organization or legislator know about your interest and what specific skills you have that may help in actions against capital punishment.

, Another way to take action against capital punishment is to raise public awareness on the issue. Because the Internet targets the global community, you can use it to publish information about issues related to the death penalty. You could start a blog and/ or post stories or pictures about capital punishment on your social media accounts.


Ask another advocate to help you set up your online presence. This person can suggest effective ways at expressing your message.

, A position paper is usually 1 to 1 ½ pages long. It details your various positions on the death penalty. Taking some time to consider why you oppose the death penalty can help you more easily put together your position. It will also help you at events or in other forums in which you take action against capital punishment.List your reasons why you opposed capital punishment. This could be for reasons such as you think it’s not adjudicated fairly across socio-economic divides, that it is “cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the 14th Amendment, that it’s not right to take another human life, or that it’s not a deterrent to violence.Consult sources such as encyclopedias, academic journals, government reports, association and institute reports, or newspapers and magazines., Most position papers are very short and consist of two parts: the introduction and the counter argument. Both parts allow you to express your views on why the death penalty should be abolished. The first part usually has three short sections including an introduction to the topic, background to explain its importance, and your specific position on capital punishment.Remember that your introduction has two purposes: to inform your reader about the topic as well as arouse his or her interest in it. Use a “hook” such as a case study to introduce your reader to the topic. For example, “On January 5, 1978, the state of Texas executed Bill Nimitz. Until his death, he maintained his innocence in the brutal murder of a local girl. Thirty years later, forensic evidence proved that he was innocent.”
Provide background on the death penalty in the United States and your state so that your reader understands why this topic is important. Your local library or an Internet search may be able to point you to texts or articles about the history of each.
Use a separate paragraph to assert your views on capital punishment. Focus the paragraph on the two most important issues to you so that you can explain these in a more comprehensive manner. Having too many of your viewpoints can dilute your arguments opposing capital punishment.

, Just as it’s important to discuss your viewpoints, it’s also important to address counter arguments. Refuting counter claims can help you bolster your own position. It can also come in handy if you are at an event and faced with someone who opposes your views.Figure out counterarguments by asking yourself what someone opposed to your position might say. You can then think about how you would respond to that person’s claims.
Provide a summary of any counterclaims as well as supporting information for them. This shows that you’ve considered other positions and their validity.
Refute the counterclaims based on your own position. Make sure you use not only your informed opinion, but also factual evidence to oppose counterclaims.

, Finish off your position paper with a short conclusion. You should restate your arguments against the death penalty and provide a plan of action without introducing new information.Use different words to restate your position than you did in the introduction. After this, discuss the implications of your position and how best to take action.
Remember to keep your conclusion as brief and simple as possible.

, Once you’ve constructed your position paper, let it sit for a day or two. Then pick it up and review it for mistakes and to be sure your arguments are consistent throughout the paper.Look for any typos or grammatical issues. Reading your paper out loud can help you locate any issues. It can also make sure the text flows logically.
Ask a friend or another advocate opposing the death penalty to read your position. These people can also help point out potential problem areas in your paper.

, Capital punishment is a fairly complicated issue—legally and, for some people, morally. Your efforts to take action against capital punishment in your state are very admirable. However, if you are new to the fight and are unsure about how to advocating against capital punishment, it’s important to get a sense of what is at stake so that you can be a convincing advocate.Having the wrong information about capital punishment before you begin your fight could have serious consequences such as offending others or impeding your efforts to take action in the future.

, Although the federal government broadly allows for the death penalty, each of the 50 states has its own law. As a result, your state would need to repeal its law, not the federal government. However, it’s a good idea to get a sense of the federal and state legal landscapes as they relate to capital punishment.Realize that the federal government lists 41 capital offenses punishable by death. Most of these are related to murder, but are not limited to this.However, Article III of the US Constitution states that a crime committed within a certain state must be tried in that state. This puts the legal impetus on the state.Keep in mind that each state within the US may hold its own trials pursuant to its laws. Currently, 31 states authorize capital punishment.In general, states in the South have a higher rate of handing out capital sentences and executing them.You can find individual statistics and information on the death penalty in your state at http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state_by_state. It may also be useful to have a general ideas of other states’ laws, which may help you in your own efforts to take action against the death penalty.

, Capital punishment touches on a wide and complex variety of issues. This includes things such as the constitutionality of capital punishment, civil liberties, states' rights, jury selection, the methods of execution, and the efficacy of capital punishment in deterring future crimes.Staying abreast on issues related to capital punishment can help you better understand them and more effectively take action against the death penalty.


Get news updates from different organizations that fight against the capital punishment. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Death Penalty Information Center, and Amnesty International have a lot of resources on their respective websites that can keep you informed on specific issues, initiatives, or even upcoming executions you may want to protest.Many organizations also have mailing lists that will send you information or publications on the death penalty.
Think about the positions of groups who support the death penalty. This might be counterintuitive, but having information on their viewpoints may help you more effectively counter their efforts—and capital punishment. For example, if you plan to protest an execution, there may be people on site who also vocally support it. Anticipating any potential arguments through research can help you quickly come up with counter-arguments., Many individuals and organizations have taken action against capital punishment for decades. Talking to people, groups, or even officials who are actively taking action against capital punishment can deepen your knowledge of specific issues as well as inform you of ongoing initiatives and rallies or protests in which you can participate.


Locate other advocates by getting in contact with organizations that actively take action against capital punishment. Most organizations have email and phone numbers at which you can contact them for more information. These groups may also have local advocates or chapters with whom you can take action.Use social media to find out if there are any local groups or individuals who want to take action against capital punishment in your state. Keep in mind these people can also add to your knowledge base on the issues.

Contact your state office of the ACLU.,
Choose the activities in which you're interested.,
Fill out an interest form.,
Sign up for email alerts.,
Speak to a volunteer coordinator.",How to Support the ACLU1," To volunteer with the ACLU, you must sign up with the field office that conducts activities in your state. Do an online search for ""ACLU"" followed by the name of your state to find the website for your state's ACLU office.Depending on the size of your state, there may be an office in the city where you live. If there is, you may want to stop by that office and talk to people in person there about volunteering with the organization.
Some states only have ACLU offices in a few major cities, or in the state's capital. If you don't live close to any of the cities where ACLU offices are located, you still can volunteer with the organization.
The ACLU accepts adult volunteers, as well as mature teens who are interested in joining the fight to protect civil rights and liberties.;
, Each state office has a variety of different opportunities where you can volunteer and work for the organization. The interest form will have a list of general activities. Think about your skills, background, and education, and choose the areas where you think you could be of the most benefit.On the interest form, you have the opportunity to select specific areas of interest, such as voting rights, LGBTQ equality, or racial justice. You can check as many areas as you want.
You also should select the types of activities in which you're interested. Keep in mind that some of these activities, such as researching civil liberties issues or hosting events, may require specific background or education.
Think about the time you have to commit and your location. Some volunteer activities, such as hosting an event table or knocking on doors, require you to spend time in a particular place. Other activities, such as researching civil liberties issues, typically can be done at home on your own time.

, To let your state or local chapter know that you are interested in becoming a volunteer, you may be able to complete an interest form online. If you live near an ACLU office, you may want to go in person and fill out an interest form there.You must provide your name and address on the interest form. It isn't necessary that you live in the same city where the office is located.
There also are spaces for you to provide your age and phone number, neither of which are required. A phone number will make it easier for the office to contact you. Don't worry about including your age unless you're under 18 or it's relevant to some area of interest.

, When you sign up for email alerts, the ACLU will send you periodic updates that typically include a call to action so you can sign a petition, call a legislator, or take other action to support the ACLU's efforts.If you complete your interest form online, you'll notice a check box at the bottom of the form that says ""Fight for Freedom."" If you check this box, you'll receive periodic emails informing you of issues of interest to the ACLU and the fight to protect civil rights and liberties.
If there's no specific interest form available for your state office, there may be an email listed that you can contact if you're interested in being a volunteer.

, When you submit your interest form, a volunteer coordinator will be in touch with you to discuss your background and interests and figure out how you could best fit into the organization.If you provided a phone number on your interest form, you may receive a call from someone at your state or local office.
Filling out an interest form in person at the office may mean you get to sit down with a volunteer coordinator right away and talk to them about what you can do.
Depending on the type of activities you're interested in doing, the volunteer coordinator may take more information from you, or direct you to show up at a particular place in time to learn more about the volunteer process.

Send a letter to members of Congress.,
Send a message to private businesses.",How to Support the ACLU2," The ACLU has a national website (aclu.org) where you can find information about all the organization's active projects, and learn what you can do to help. Even if you aren't able to volunteer in person, you still can do your part to support the ACLU.The website provides extensive information about the different activities of the national organization, as well as links and information to activities spearheaded by particular state offices.
You also can find out information about your rights under the Constitution, and learn about various actions that threaten those rights.

, This tab will take you to a page that lists the specific issues in which the ACLU is actively fighting to protect the civil rights and liberties of Americans. You can scroll through the various campaigns to find one you want to support.When you click on each issue listed, you will be taken to a page that provides background information about the issue and how civil rights and liberties are threatened.
In addition to a specific call to action to support the ACLU's efforts, there also may be links on the page to other resources so you can learn more about the issue as well as find other organizations that are involved.

, For many issues, you have the option of signing a petition that indicates your support for the people whose civil rights or liberties are being threatened in that particular context. The petition is distributed to lawmakers with the power to stop those threats.Petitions are used to demonstrate citizen support for taking a particular action, or stopping a particular action that is currently taking place.
While signing a petition in and of itself doesn't necessarily cause any changes or stop the threat to civil rights and liberties, it sends a message to government officials.
A significant amount of signatures on a petition can put pressure on elected officials to take action in regard to the specified problem.
Read the petition carefully before you sign it and make sure you agree with it and want officials to take the action requested.

, For issues that involve the passage of a particular piece of legislation, you can send a letter to your congressional representatives that urges them to vote a certain way regarding that legislation.While you may have taken steps to write letters to your elected representatives before, sending a letter through the ACLU is somewhat different.
This letter is not unlike a petition, in that it may include the signatures of a number of different people. However, unlike the petition, a letter is specifically addressed to congressional representatives and calls on them to act in a certain way – typically, to vote for or against a particular piece of pending legislation.

, Some issues involve private businesses acting in conjunction with government authority, or granting government agencies access to data held by those companies. The ACLU fights to protect Americans' constitutional privacy rights.For example, law enforcement agencies can use social media analytics and search data to monitor activists exercising their First Amendment rights. This activity violates the constitutional rights of these Americans. The private companies who run social media platforms do not have to allow law enforcement agencies to use their services in this way.
If this is an issue that you feel strongly about, you can send a message to social media companies imploring them to block access to their platforms so that it cannot be used to conduct surveillance of people who are exercising their constitutional rights.

These employees may work in different locations, however, as long as at least 50 employees work within 75 miles of your workplace.
For you to be eligible for leave under FMLA, you must have worked for your employer for at least a year and clocked at least 1,250 hours during that time.
You also must have requested FMLA leave for an eligible reason. If your employer asserted that the reason for your leave request wasn't covered by FMLA, you may have to do some additional research to determine whether your employer's assessment is correct.
Keep in mind that many employers run afoul of the FMLA because they fail to recognize serious health conditions and deny employees coverage as a result.
The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) provides an employee's guide to the FMLA which may answer most of your questions. You can download the guide online at http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/employeeguide.pdf.;
, While you should send your employer a written letter regarding your dispute, you also should arrange to talk to someone face-to-face about what has happened and the fact that you consider it a violation of FMLA.Maintain a professional tone in your letter, and stick to the facts of your dispute. If you have any medical reports or doctor's statements that support your request, you may want to attach these to your letter.
State that you believe you are entitled to leave under FMLA, and that your employer's decision or actions violate your rights under the law.
Request an appointment when you can sit down and discuss the matter with your employer with minimal disruptions. Offer to bring any information or documentation your employer needs to reassess the situation.

, If you are unable to resolve the situation with your employer by yourself, an experienced employment attorney can help you enforce your rights under the FMLA.The DOL has partnered with the American Bar Association to create an attorney referral system for employees with FMLA complaints, and this can be a good place to begin your attorney search. You can access the system at https://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_referral/resources/attorney_referral_system.html.
Keep in mind that many employment attorneys are willing to work on contingency, meaning you won't have any out-of-pocket expenses to pursue your lawsuit. Additionally, if you win your case, the court must award reasonable attorney's fees in addition to your award.
You should try to interview at least three attorneys before you make your final choice. Most attorneys who specialize in FMLA violations at least give free initial consultations, so you can introduce the attorney to your dispute and learn more about the process and your options.

, Before your attorney files a lawsuit, his or her first step probably will be to send a letter to your employer demanding that your rights under the FMLA are recognized.An attorney's demand letter may go farther toward resolving your situation than you were able to accomplish on your own. Most employers are wary of getting involved in lawsuits, and an attorney signals that you are serious about your claim and will go to court if necessary to enforce your rights.
Although not required to enforce your rights under the FMLA, your attorney also may recommend filing a complaint with the DOL's Wage and Hour Division.

, If the demand letter doesn't lead to satisfactory results, your attorney will start gathering information with you so you can file a lawsuit against your employer.Under the FMLA, you may sue in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction over your employer – typically the court in the county or district where your workplace is located.
Your attorney may discuss this matter with you, but ultimately he or she will know whether it's better for you to file your lawsuit in state or federal court under the circumstances.
Generally, your complaint will introduce you and your employer to the court, then list the facts of your case in the form of allegations that together constitute a violation of the FMLA.
Your complaint also includes a calculation of the amount of money and any other relief, such as reinstatement of your employment, to which you believe you are entitled as a result of your employer's FMLA violation.

, To start the litigation process, you and your attorney must take your complaint and any other required paperwork to the clerk of the court where you want your lawsuit to be heard.The clerk will stamp your complaint with the date it was filed and give it a unique case number. This number will be used on all other documents filed with the court.
The clerk also assigns your case to a judge and issues a summons for your employer to appear and respond to the complaint by a deadline included on the summons.
If your attorney is working on contingency, the filing fees – which typically are several hundred dollars – will be added to your costs and deducted from any settlement you receive along with your attorney's fees. If you go to trial and win, your employer will be required to pay those costs in addition to any monetary award.

, Once your complaint is filed, you must follow the proper legal method of delivering, or serving, the complaint on your employer so he or she has notice that you've filed the lawsuit.Federal court complaints typically are hand-delivered by a U.S. Marshal, while state court complaints are served by a sheriff's deputy.
Although most courts require hand delivery of complaints, some allow service using certified mail with returned receipt requested.
After service is complete, the individual who delivered your documents must complete a proof of service document and file it with the court.
You only have a certain amount of time to serve your employer after you've filed your complaint – 120 days in federal court and a similar period of time in state courts.

, Depending on the court, your employer has typically between 20 and 30 days after being served to respond to your lawsuit.In most cases your employer will file an answer denying most if not all of your allegations, and perhaps also asserting various defenses. Given that you've been unable to resolve the matter through other means, this should be expected.
If your employer misses the deadline and fails to respond to your lawsuit, you may be eligible to win a default judgment. This is not a common outcome in FMLA cases, however, particularly if your employer has fought you up to this point.

, If your employer files a motion to dismiss, you must pass this hurdle before you can continue litigating your case.The hearing for a motion to dismiss can become almost like a miniature trial, but without a jury.
To successfully fend off a motion to dismiss, you must be able to prove to the judge's satisfaction that your complaint has merit, that you have evidence of the allegations in your complaint, and that those allegations add up to a violation of the FMLA.

, Throughout litigation, even from the moment your employer receives your complaint, you may receive an offer to settle your case.Your attorney must present all settlement offers to you, and will give you his or her advice on whether you should accept the offer – but keep in mind the final decision is always yours.
Since the terms of settlements typically are confidential, and don't involve anyone admitting fault, your employer probably will be keen on settling your case.
This will be particularly true if your case is revealed as particularly strong over the course of litigation, or if some extremely damaging evidence or testimony is discovered. Often you can use this to your advantage to improve a settlement offer through negotiation.
Keep in mind that even if a settlement offer is significantly lower than the amount you've asked for in your complaint, a settlement has advantages of certainty and immediacy, since you're never guaranteed to win everything you ask for in a lawsuit.

, Through the discovery process, you and your employer will exchange information and evidence related to your claim so you can better prepare your case as well as gain an understanding of your employer's defenses.the discovery process typically begins with written discovery, which consists of interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production. The written responses to these questions help you and your attorney build your case and identify potential witnesses.
Through requests for production, you can get copies of your employer's written policies, internal communications regarding your FMLA request and leave, and other personnel records. Your employer also may request medical records from you and other information related to your leave request.
The other part of discovery is taking depositions. Depositions are interviews with parties and witnesses regarding various aspects of the case. The person deposed is under oath, and the interview is recorded by a court reporter who will produce a transcript of the deposition for later reference.

, As litigation progresses, the judge may call the parties to court for hearings or to discuss the status of the case.The judge typically will hold at least one scheduling conference, if not several – depending on how long pretrial litigation lasts. In these conferences, the judge meets with the attorneys to check in on the status of the case and set deadlines for the phases of litigation that will keep the case moving and keep either party from stalling.
Either you or your employer may at various times during the pretrial stage need to file motions asking the court to order various things, such as to compel discovery if the other party is dragging its feet in producing a response to a reasonable request.
Often if the motion deals with something procedural, the judge will make a decision without holding a hearing in open court to discuss the matter.

, Some courts require litigants to at least attempt to resolve their dispute through mediation before a trial will be scheduled.In mediation, a neutral third party – either someone assigned by the court or chosen from a list of court-approved mediators – facilitates negotiations between you and your employer in the hopes of arriving at a mutually agreeable settlement of the dispute.
The discussions that happen during mediation, as well as the terms of any settlement produced, are confidential. If you are unable to reach a settlement, nothing said during mediation can be used at trial.
If you and your employer reach a settlement through mediation, the mediator will draw up an agreement for both of you to review with your attorneys and sign.
Keep in mind that although you're expected to participate in mediation with good faith, there is no requirement that you reach a settlement, and you don't have to accept any settlement offered by your employer.
If you and your employer are unable to resolve your dispute through mediation, your attorney will meet with you to discuss trial strategy and prepare for trial.

Set an example.,
Speak out.,
Talk to people you know.,
Contact people with the power to stop injustice.,
Contact the media.,
Vote against injustice.,
Vote with your dollars.,
Make a contribution.",How to Stand up to Injustice1," An important first step in standing up to injustice is making changes in your own life.This can be hard, but to the extent that you can, avoid contributing to things you think are unjust and try to be just in your own behaviors.


For example, if you are concerned about racial discrimination, do some soul searching and think about how you can be more fair to people of other races in your own life. Are there racist stereotypes that are affecting your own behavior? If so, you can make a conscious effort to treat people more fairly.
Nobody is perfect, and in the complex world we live in, it's difficult to avoid all injustice. If you pay taxes, chances are, some of that money is going to go toward something you disagree with, regardless of your beliefs. Do your best not to contribute to injustices in any way you can avoid, but don't let yourself be immobilized by a need for perfection.;
, When you see injustice happening in daily life, don't just let it happen. Speak up and let the person behaving unjustly know that you think what they are doing is wrong.


If you have friends who make jokes that are racist, for example, think about how you can let them know that you don't appreciate this.If you are in a position where you influence hiring decisions in your workplace, do your best to ensure that discrimination isn't occurring in that process.
If you see someone being bullied, you can stand up to this injustice by telling the bully to stop. If the bully doesn't stop, you can help the person being bullied out of the situation by walking them to somewhere safe or finding an authority figure who can stop the bullying behavior.Speaking out against everyday injustices takes courage, and can be difficult at first. If it's something really care about though, you will feel better for not keeping silent when it comes up.

, Tell people you know about the injustice you have learned about. Many people probably won't be aware of the issue. Some people may know about it, but not see it in the same way you do. Talking to others is a good way to promote more justice in the world.For example, if you are concerned about a new tax your city is considering that you think will make it hard on certain people or businesses, tell your friends about it. If you think it's wrong to eat meat, tell your friends and family about why that is. You may help them learn something, or you may even find other people who also want to take a stand on the issue.
Be aware that some people are not going to want to hear what you have to say and are unlikely to change their views no matter what you may tell them. If someone is clearly not interested or doesn't want discuss an injustice, don't press the issue. You can make people mad and waste a lot of energy talking to someone who is unwilling to consider your views.

, If you are serious about taking a stand against injustice, you need to make your views known outside your social circle. A great way to start is by contacting those responsible for the injustice.


You can write a letter to the person or institution you think is responsible for the injustice, or that has the power to do something about it. For example, you can write a letter to your elected representatives urging them to do something about an injustice. Or, you can write to a company that you think is doing something unjust as part of its business practices, sharing your concerns and asking them to make a change.
You can also sometimes make a phone call that serves the same purpose.
Note that even in this age of electronic communication, many people still take old-fashioned paper letters more seriously than an email or online comments. Taking some time to print and mail a letter to your congressperson, for example, may make his or her staff more likely to take your comments seriously., You can also use the news media to let people know about injustice. You can write a letter to the news media, such as a letter to the editor.


Newspapers often publish well-written letters to the editor in both their print and online editions. This can be a great way to use media to let others know about injustices you care about., Some injustices that are political or economic in nature can be affected by voting. It takes some time to learn about where your elected officials stand on the issue you have identified as an injustice. Use your power as a voter to promote more just government.If you have the option, vote for candidates who want to do something about the injustice you have identified. If you think abortion is unjust, for example, research anti-abortion candidates you can support. If you think the minimum wage is unfairly low, look for candidates who have plans to raise the minimum wage.

, In some cases, you can make purchasing decisions that promote justice. Don't buy from people or companies you believe are doing something unjust. Look for a way to use your consumer power to support justice.


You can boycott, or refuse to buy from, companies that do things you think are unjust. Look for alternative options you can support instead.For example, if you think that people who work in overseas factories are mistreated, look for companies that produce goods under conditions you think are more fair and don't buy from those you think abuse their workers. If a company contributes large sums of money to political campaigns you think are unjust, avoid supporting it.

, Another way you can take a stand at an individual level is by contributing money to a group or campaign that is trying to correct an injustice. If you can afford it, consider a financial contribution to a group you think is doing good work.Do some research and find a group you like. There are groups out there working on almost anything you can think of, whether its bullying in schools, gender discrimination, homelessness, or issues related to international politics.

"
"
Research groups dedicated to the issue.,
Attend a meeting.,
Go to rallies or protests.,
Volunteer.",How to Stand up to Injustice2," Many people find it most satisfying and effective to take stand alongside other people who feel the same way they do about an injustice. If you're interested in doing this, go online and research groups in your area that might be suitable.There may be several groups, and you can choose the one that you like best. For example, if you think homelessness is unjust, you may find that there are both secular and church-based groups working to help the homeless in your community. Depending on your religious beliefs, you can choose the group you like best.
On the other hand, you may find there isn't a group in your area dedicated to standing up to the injustice you are concerned about. If this is the case, you might want to consider starting your own group. There might be people you know who would be willing to join as you first get started, and you can build the group from there.

, After you find a group you think you might be interested in working with, find out when they meet and go to a meeting. This is a great way to learn more about the group and the people in it.


Going to a meeting will give you a better sense of whether this group is right for you and if you want to be involved in the types of work they do to combat injustice.
It's also a great way to meet people who feel the same way you do about the issue, which can help you feel more inspired to take action yourself., Depending on the specific injustice you are interested in standing up against, some groups will organize large public events to speak out. Attending one of these can be a great way to take a public stand, and can be a lot of fun, too.


Many organizations will set up marches or rallies and encourage the public to join in. This can be powerful way of attracting attention to an injustice and putting pressure on the government or businesses to do something about it.Many protests are entirely peaceful and legal. Some groups, however, will engage in illegal actions to promote what they see as a more important form of justice. Some people will get themselves arrested in non-violent civil disobedience, for example, sitting down in an intersection and refusing to leave as a means of calling attention to an injustice.Some will even destroy property at protests.
Think carefully about what types of actions you are comfortable with. Are you willing to be arrested for your beliefs? Are you compelled enough by some injustice that you think more militant actions are appropriate? This decision is a personal one, but take some time to consider the consequences of any action you take before breaking the law.

, It may not be as exciting as a protest, but most organizations taking stands against injustice need people to work on other tasks as well. Volunteer to do anything you feel comfortable doing to contribute to the group's efforts.


This could include any number of activities, from collecting signatures for a petition to raising money, from stuffing envelopes to making phone calls, or even just helping set up and put away chairs before and after meetings.Sometimes, this work might not feel much like you're taking a big stand, but by contributing to an organization that is doing important work to remedy an injustice, you are making a difference.

"
"
Research the issue.,
Study all sides.,
Learn about possible alternatives or actions to correct the injustice.",How to Stand up to Injustice3," Determining what is just or unjust is often a complicated matter. Regardless of the issue, understanding it thoroughly will make your voice more effective in standing up to injustice. Spend some time researching things you think are unjust on the internet or at your local library.


Being informed will make you a more eloquent speaker on the subject. People will be more likely to listen to you when you speak out.Doing research on any issue, whether it's bullying, unfair labor practices, political corruption, or international relations will also help you develop an understanding of who or what is responsible for the injustice, and who has the power to do something about it. This can help you more effectively take a stand by directing your efforts at the appropriate parties.

, Take some time to understand both (or all) sides of the issue. Understanding the opposing view will also make you more effective and help you understand the issue better.Try to keep an open mind when doing your research. You may find injustices where you didn't realize there were any. Or, you might find that something you thought was an injustice may not be one after all.
Be fair to all sides, and let them speak for themselves. Try to find material online that presents both sides in an even-handed way, or pieces written by people who hold opposing views. You will understand the issue better if you read information from multiple, diverse sources.For example, if you think abortion is unjust, don't just get your information from conservative sources that oppose abortion. If you are concerned about gun violence, don't just get your information from liberal sources that support gun control. Otherwise, you may end up with a distorted view of the issue, or miss key information.

, When someone stands up to injustice, people often ask: ""what's the alternative?"" Spend some time looking into alternatives to the way things are that other people have suggested or are trying to put in place.


For example, if you think the existing tax structure is unfair, look into other ways taxes could be collected and organized. If you think the way your government treats other countries is unjust, find out what alternative courses of action have been suggested by foreign policy experts.
Saying ""no"" to injustice is an important first step, but being able to offer an alternative, positive vision can make your message more powerful.This can also help you find ways to make a difference in your own life.

The more disparity these groups have and the greater differences these classifications highlight, the higher the chances for animosity to form between these groups. Bipolar societies which have mainly two categories of classification, such as Rwanda, lack the variety of mixed or complex classifications and are at especially high risk.


Listen for “Us and Them” thinking. All groups are susceptible to groupthink and will often identify in terms of “ingroup” and “outgroup” classifications.These groups often only see the ingroup (characterized by the terms “us” or “we”) as right, and the outgroup (characterized by the terms “them” or “others”) as wrong.Take note of groups that discourage individual thinking in favor of conformity to the group. This can be particularly observable when groups interact online using social media platforms and forums. This is sometimes referred to as “hive mind” thinking.Classification is the primary factor in dividing a society and creating a power struggle between groups.;
, Groups will give symbols or names to the classifications, either to their own group, opposing groups, or both. This alone does not lead to genocide but is a marker of further division among classifications and reinforces behavior which can lead to discrimination. These visual and language-based identifiers are used to make it easier for groups to reinforce their own biases by pointing out differences while reducing the ability to observe people apart from their classifications.Pay attention to the names that groups give to classifications. These names usually highlight a point of division and divergence. For example, German vs. Jew: non-Jewish Germans called themselves Germans but referred to Jewish Germans only as Jews. This language reinforced the negative idea that Jewish people were not a part of the German identity even though they lived in Germany and were legal citizens.
Often the names used are informal, shortened, disingenuous, and stigmatizing in ways intended to show disrespect, hatred, or cause offence (for example, slurs such as Jap, Gypsy, or Kaffir).
Take notice when groups identify themselves by their colors or dress. This often manifests as self-adopted uniforms, clothing styles, tattoos, or tribal scarring which are intended to distinguish their group apart visually in public spaces.
Symbols are often adopted and used to represent group superiority, pride, or dominance, much like the swastika, while other symbols can be forced upon members of pariah groups to denote inferiority, much like the yellow star forced upon Jews living under Nazi rule.

, The dominant group will use laws, customs, or political power to deny the rights of other groups. This is often accomplished legally under the existing state’s political framework by either adding, dismantling, or altering existing laws. When political unrest is high, exploiting special circumstantial or temporary scenarios of power and rule, such as martial law or declaring a state of emergency, are often used to deny rights to the victim groups despite public disapproval. Countries and governments that do not have preexisting laws banning discrimination of any kind or laws ensuring citizens the right to sue or challenge their own government’s laws are at particularly high risk. Common actions of discrimination are:


Boycotting businesses owned by the victim group.
Segregation; separate housing, schools, transport, and eating places.
Prohibiting the group’s right to vote.
Banning the group’s right to work in certain professions or industries.
Requiring passes for travel.
Revoking citizenship.

, As the powerless group’s rights are taken away and their quality of life declines rapidly as a result, the dominant group will deny the humanity of their victims. This helps the dominant group rationalize their inhumane treatment of the oppressed group and over time they will no longer come to regard them as human. Dehumanization overrides the normal human revulsion against murder and plays a large role in propaganda and hate speech.


Listen closely for the powerless groups being described or referred to as animals, vermin, or diseases.
Identify the rise of popularity in this hateful language in political rallies, speeches, radio, or TV.
Watch for euphemisms in ideological language as they often hide the horrible nature of their implications. Words like “purification” or “ethnic cleansing” which sound vaguely sterile or almost positive often disguise the sentiment of hate and murder that is under the surface.

, Genocide is a group crime and therefore requires planning and organization. Often the state, group elites, or the controlling regime will begin making plans to fund and train troops or special units that will eventually carry out the genocide. Plans for a ‘final solution’ to exterminate the victim group are started. Often forces are formed using third party militias so the state or controlling group can maintain deniability after the impending atrocities are later carried out. Other signs of organization to look for include:


Informal organization such as the gathering of armed mobs or the recruiting of youth militias led by local militants.
Decentralized organization such as forming terrorist groups or cells that operate independently.

, In this stage, extremism drives the groups further apart with increased propaganda and violence. Laws are passed cementing the “us vs. them” mentality by banning many forms of association between groups, such as intermarriage or even social interaction. Hate speech is normalized and large propaganda events such as demonstrations and rallies are held.


Independent news sources not sponsored or run by the state or the controlling group’s propaganda campaign are either discredited, vilified, boycotted, taken over, or banned outright.
Moderates within the dominant group are silenced through intimidation, imprisonment, or assassination. This is because moderates of any group are not as invested in the group’s controlling ideology and are often in the best position to de-escalate extremist views and actions.

, The controlling group leaders finalize their plans and disclose them to those who will then conduct the genocide in the language of propaganda and euphemism. The plan is framed as a final push for justice and self-defense as the only remaining “solution” to the “question” or “problem” that the targeted group poses.


The goals are described as “cleansing,” “purification,” or even “counter-terrorism,” to mask their true nature.
Propaganda is employed heavily to indoctrinate the populace to fear the victim group. “If we don’t kill them, they’ll kill us.”
Military production is ramped up to faster speeds while forces are built up to greater numbers. Supplies and weapons are stockpiled.

, At this stage, Death lists are drawn up and victims of the persecuted group are separated out by their symbolic identifiers (see the step “Identify the signs of symbolization). They are forcibly removed from their homes and either made to relocate themselves or relocated using transportation.


Their property and possessions are seized and taken by the controlling group.
They are relocated to camps, ghettos, or confined to famine-struck areas where they are forced to either provide grueling labor or starve.
Massacres and killings during this stage can happen sporadically when members of the victim group do not cooperate and attempt to rebel or escape.

, Once relocated, the killing of the victim group begins and quickly becomes the mass killings that are legally defined as “genocide.” Once this stage starts, it can only be stopped through swift and overwhelming armed intervention by a heavily fortified third-party force.


It is referred to as “extermination” because the killers do not believe that their victims are fully human. Rather, they think they are “cleansing” their society of “impurities” or “enemies.” For this reason they are often tortured and killed inhumanely.
Most genocides are committed by governments. While funded or sponsored by the state, the armed forces carrying out a genocide often work with local militias in an attempt to hide or mask their involvement.
Methods to expedite and automate the killings are often employed. Mass graves are dug and the victims are forced to line up next to or inside the grave where they are shot so the bodies don’t need to be transported later. For example, the Nazis constructed large gas chambers and crematoriums to both kill large numbers and dispose of their bodies.

, Denial always happens during and after a genocide along with an effort to cover up the crimes. Mass graves are often dug up and the bodies are burned. The controlling group often attempts to rewrite the narrative through the use of continued propaganda by denying that the killings ever took place or blaming the victims for what happened.


Evidence is destroyed and witnesses are silenced by intimidation or assassination.
The controlling group will block investigations into crimes surrounding the genocide.
The group leaders responsible will continue to govern unless they are driven from power by force.
Perpetrators of genocide will only face justice if pursued by forces with strong political will. All too often, those responsible flee and hide in countries which do not recognize international courts or their jurisdiction and can evade justice.
If caught, those who are responsible will be brought before international tribunals or criminal courts and tried with whatever evidence can be brought against them.

Find gun rights organizations.,
Get an application.,
Pay the fee.,
Become an activist.",How to Protect Your Gun Rights1," The National Rifle Association (NRA) is the most prominent national gun rights lobby in the United States. However, you might also want to join other national organizations, or even local or state-level gun rights organizations. For example, the Second Amendment Foundation is a national organization committed to promoting the public’s understanding of the Constitutional right to firearms.To find organizations, you can type “protect gun rights” into your search engine.
To find state-level organizations, type “your state” and “gun rights” into the search engine.;
, You typically have to fill out an application to join any gun rights organization, though you can often submit your information online. To join the NRA, for example, you will need to provide the following information on their webpage:your name
your address
an email address
your phone number (optional)
your date of birth (optional)

, Most organizations are member-funded, so you will need to pay some money to join. Typically, gun rights organizations will have different membership tiers. For example, the NRA offers the following membership options, which you can pay for with a credit card on the website:One-year membership. Currently $25.
Multi-year memberships (for two, three, or five years) for $50, $70, or $100.
Life member. For $1,500, you can become a lifetime member of the NRA. You have the option of making quarterly payments of $25 per quarter.
Junior member. You can join as a junior member for $15. Junior members can also get a junior life membership for $550.
Distinguished member. Available for those 65 or older, as well as for veterans. Cost: $30 a year, or $750 for a distinguished lifetime membership.

, Financial support helps these organizations fight for gun rights. But many organizations also give you the chance to increase your participation. They will send frequent alerts telling you how you can bring attention to gun rights. Your activism could take many forms:


Contact your elected representatives and express support for bills that increase gun rights.
Write letters to your newspaper, in which you discuss the importance of gun rights and explain why your community should reject gun restrictions.
Campaign for candidates to state and federal office who support increasing gun rights.

Advertise your carbon neutrality.",How to Buy a Carbon Offset," You can't reduce or offset your carbon emissions if you don't know what they are or where they're coming from. Once you've identified sources of carbon dioxide production in your daily life, you can come up with ways to reduce your dependency on those sources.For most people, driving is the main source of their carbon dioxide emissions. Other sources for carbon emissions include air travel and household energy consumption.
You also should look at the products you buy and use. If they were shipped long distances to get to you, carbon emissions were involved in their transport. Carbon emissions also occur when products are built in factories. If you buy those products, you are also contributing to carbon emissions that way.;
, Once you've made a list of all the various sources of your carbon emissions, search online for a carbon footprint calculator that you can use to get a rough estimate of the size of your carbon footprint.Just do a search for ""carbon footprint calculator"" online, or check the website of a nonprofit environmental organization to see if there's one they recommend.
Since these calculators may vary in their methodologies, you may want to use more than one and average the results.
The more information the calculator allows you to enter, the closer to reality the estimate will be.

, Since driving typically makes up a large portion of your carbon footprint, one easy way to reduce your carbon dioxide emissions directly is to use your car less. Take public transportation, walk, or ride a bike when you can.Try to do multiple errands at once so you take fewer trips, and start a carpool at work.
There are ways you can increase the fuel efficiency of your car, or you may want to consider living without a car altogether.
If you're in the market for a new car, you can reduce your carbon footprint by buying one that is hybrid or fully electric.

, The carbon dioxide produced by the electricity or other fuel that you use to light and heat your home is another big source of carbon dioxide emissions.Simply lowering your thermostat a degree or two in the winter (and turning it up a degree or to in the summer) can substantially reduce your carbon dioxide emissions.
You also should turn off lights when you aren't in a room. Open curtains and blinds so you can use natural light rather than electricity during the day.
Buy energy-efficient light bulbs, which also will save you money on your electric bill and last longer than regular light bulbs. If you have the ability to do so, you also should consider replacing older appliances with newer, more energy-efficient ones.
If you're feeling ambitious, you can try using solar energy to heat your pool or making your own electricity.

, If you own your own home, getting better insulation and energy-efficient doors and windows can help you conserve electricity. Some governments also offer tax incentives for you to make these home improvements., Transporting food grown in distant locations causes significant carbon dioxide emissions. Food prepared and processed in plants also results in the emission of a lot of carbon dioxide. Organic food grown locally will help reduce your carbon footprint as well as being more healthy for you.You also can potentially save money by shopping at a local farmers' market.

, If you want to reduce your carbon footprint and support a clean and healthy environment, avoid using disposable products that cause waste. Reuse things as much as possible, even if they were originally designed to be thrown away after one use.With household items such as toilet paper that cannot effectively be reused, consider buying products that contain a large percentage of post-consumer recycled material.
Buy larger quantities of products to reduce the amount of packaging. Reuse containers or set up recycling for materials such as plastic, metal, and paper that can be recycled.
Avoid printing documents unless you absolutely need a paper copy. Sign up for electronic billing rather than receiving a paper bill in the mail. Use both sides of every sheet of paper and recycle any paper once you no longer need it, instead of throwing it in the waste bin.
You also might want to look into composting your organic waste such as food scraps.

, Since producing and shipping consumer products adds to carbon emissions, limiting the new things you buy can help reduce your carbon footprint. Before you buy something, think carefully about whether you really need it.Try to buy products from companies that are carbon neutral or at least strive to be environmentally responsible.
Buy used when you can. For example, you typically can find used books or used clothing at thrift stores that will suit your needs just as well as something new. Used items also typically are less expensive than buying something brand new.

, You've reduced your carbon footprint, but you can't eliminate it entirely. To become carbon neutral, you can buy carbon offsets to balance your carbon dioxide emissions.With carbon offsets, your money goes to support a project happening somewhere else in the world that reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Tree planting and soil management projects actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, while energy efficiency projects, such as wind and solar farms, reduce overall emissions.
Projects are undertaken all over the planet, so you have your choice of projects to support with your carbon offset dollars. Choose a project based on your own personal interests.

, For a carbon offset to be effective, it has to be something that is legitimately happening in the world. If the project is not currently in existence, make an effort to understand why the project has not yet started and what barriers have prevented it from getting off the ground.For example, suppose a carbon offset provider claims they are paying farmers in the Amazon not to cut down trees on their property or allow lumber companies to cut down those trees. You need to find out how many farmers are participating, how much land is involved, and how the number of offsets the company is selling are measured and allocated.
Since individuals typically don't have the resources to visit many of these far-flung locations in person, you typically must rely on third-party observation or reports from the carbon offset provider to determine whether their projects are legitimate.

, The project your carbon offset funds should be intended as a permanent change in the environment. The company or organization in charge of the project should have safeguards in place to protect it from damage or destruction.For example, if the project involves planting trees, steps should be taken to ensure that those trees will grow to maturity. Obviously a forest can't be 100 percent protected from fires or natural disasters, but some sort of safeguards should be in place to reduce those risks.

, There are third party organizations that verify the legitimacy of carbon offsets, as well as the protections for the project or penalties in effect if others involved don't follow through with their promises.For example, if the carbon offset provider is paying farmers in the Amazon to protect trees on their property from loggers, there should be a hefty penalty if a farmer takes the carbon offset money and then sells the trees on his property to a logging company anyway.

, ""Additionality"" is a word used in the carbon offset industry, and generally means that the offset must provide additional protection for the environment.A carbon offset is not legitimate if your money is going for something that would have happened anyway. For example, if the carbon offset provider is paying farmers in the Amazon to protect trees on their property from loggers, but one logger had no intention of allowing loggers to harvest trees on his property anyway, your carbon offset hasn't done anything that wasn't already going to be done.
You also have to be on the lookout for leakage. Preventing deforestation by paying farmers in the Amazon to protect trees doesn't really do anything additional to protect the environment if a logging company can simply cut down the trees next to that farmer's property.

, Independent nonprofit organizations as well as government authorities in many countries offer certification programs that independently evaluate and verify carbon offset projects.Some of these organizations, such as Climate Action Reserve, are standard-setting groups that establish specific rules and protocols that offset programs must follow.
There also are retail certification programs, such as Green-e Climate and Gold Standard, that can help you identify reliable carbon offset vendors.
Many national governments also have review boards and set standards for carbon offset programs. For example, in the United States you can look for carbon offset programs endorsed by the U.S. EPA Climate Leaders program.

, The project typically will be audited on a regular basis by the same organization that provides certification for the product or vendor. These audits are just like financial audits conducted by any company or organization.If an offset provider is a nonprofit organization, you typically also can access the organization's financial reports. Through these reports, you can learn exactly how much of the money paid for an offset is going directly to the listed projects. For-profit offset providers rarely make these reports available to consumers.

, The cost for carbon offsets varies greatly depending on the expense of the project as well as the general laws of supply and demand. You can expect to pay anywhere from $10 to $50 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions.Keep in mind that just because one offset is more expensive than another, that doesn't necessarily mean it's better quality. Do your research on the projects independently of price, then choose a high-quality offset that best fits your budget.

, Many utility companies sell carbon offsets to their customers that will help offset the carbon dioxide produced by your use of electricity in your home or office. Because these are measured and sold directly, this option may be more convenient for you.Typically, you are charged a premium on your regular utility bill that offsets the carbon dioxide produced by your average energy use for that month.

, The type of project you support depends largely on your own personal interests. However, many projects have additional, non-environmental impacts on the area around the project.For example, a reforestation project in a developing country will create jobs, train workers, and improve the economy of the region. In addition to sequestering carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, this project has other environmental benefits including an improvement in local air quality, creation of wildlife habitats, and prevention of soil erosion.

, You can't claim the benefit of your carbon offset until it is retired. Once the offset is retired, it cannot be resold to anyone else. Retirement indicates that the specific amount of carbon dioxide you purchased has in fact been reduced or eliminated.For smaller-scale transactions, you typically don't have to worry about retirement – retailers automatically retire the carbon offsets when they're purchased. However, in the case of a larger purchase of carbon offsets, it may take some time before retirement can take place.

, Once you've decided with carbon offset project you want to support, you typically can purchase your offset online using your credit card. Determine how many offsets you want to purchase and make sure the provider has that many available.Make sure you get a receipt for your purchase. In some countries, carbon offsets may be tax deductible.

, Airplanes contribute considerable global carbon emissions. Many airlines as well as travel agencies provide the opportunity for you to purchase an offset when you book a flight.These offsets are calculated for you personally based on the environmental impact of the flight you're taking.
If you purchase an offset through the airline, typically the cost for the offset is simply added to the price for your ticket.

, Particularly if you're buying carbon offsets for a small business, your customers will want to know that your business is socially and environmentally responsible.Avoid advertising carbon neutrality until your carbon offsets have been retired. You also might consider having your carbon neutrality certified by a third-party organization.

Understand the prohibition on felons owning guns.,
Read about your state restrictions.,
Meet with a lawyer if you are accused of a crime.,
Go to trial.,
Petition to get gun rights back after a conviction.",How to Protect Your Gun Rights2," Your state and the federal government can limit your rights to own a firearm. The most common limitation is the federal prohibition on felons owning a gun if they were convicted of a crime that could result in imprisonment for more than one year. You do not actually have to serve more than a year in prison. It is enough that, under state or federal law, you could have been sentenced for that crime to more than a year in jail.Federal law, however, makes an exception for misdemeanor convictions if the crime would not result in imprisonment for more than two years.
The misdemeanor exception does not apply if you were convicted of a domestic violence offense.

, States can also limit who can own guns within their state boundaries. These limitations may be in addition to the federal limitation on felons owning guns. You should understand the effects of any misdemeanor conviction in your state.


To find your state laws, you can visit your nearest law library, which could be at the courthouse or at a nearby law school. Ask the librarian to help you find the laws regarding gun ownership in your state.
You can also visit the website of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Although this is an organization dedicated to limiting your gun rights, they have helpfully collected information about state gun laws. Click on any state on the map and then read up on that state’s gun laws., You will face pressure to take a plea bargain in order to make a prosecution go away.However, if you agree to plead guilty to a felony, then you could lose your gun rights. You also could lose your gun rights if you plead guilty to a misdemeanor which could carry a term of imprisonment for more than two years.


Before accepting a plea deal, you need to meet with an attorney. Tell the lawyer that protecting your gun rights is very important to you and ask the lawyer how you can go about doing that. The lawyer might be able to talk the prosecutor down to charging you with a misdemeanor.
If you need to find a criminal defense lawyer, then contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral. If you have a public defender, ask him or her how pleading guilty will affect your gun rights.

, The prosecuting attorney might not let you plead to a misdemeanor. Instead, they might insist that you plead guilty to a felony. In this situation, the only way to protect your gun rights would be to go to trial and win your case. If you aren’t convicted, then you can generally keep your gun rights.


Talk with your lawyer about how hard you should fight the prosecution. It may be possible in your state to have your gun rights restored after you serve your sentence. Because this depends on your state’s law, be sure to talk to your lawyer.

, If you are convicted of a felony, then you may be able to petition your state to restore your gun rights.Each state has its own policies, and in some states you can’t get your gun rights back no matter what. However, you should talk to a lawyer about how your state handles restoring gun rights to ex-felons.

The process of erosion happens through natural forces including water, wind, and ice.Geological erosion and man-made erosion are the two major classifications of erosion.There are two major classifications of erosion: (1) geological erosion, and (2) man-made erosion.
Geological erosion occurs naturally when the distribution of soils is disturbed in some manner, either through soil formation or soil removal.Man-made erosion happens when humans alter the land and it can accelerate the natural erosion process. This is a common type of erosion at construction sites.;
, There are many factors than can contribute to erosion including climate and topography. Knowing about the factors that cause erosion will help you identify the source of your erosion and develop the best plan to control it.


Factors than can contribute to erosion include soil characteristics, climate, rainfall intensity and duration, vegetation or other surface cover, and topography.
Understanding the factors that affect erosion makes it possible to predict the extent and consequences of onsite erosion.When people remove vegetation, disturb the soil, change natural drainage patterns, or cover the ground with surfaces such as buildings or pavement, this can also cause erosion., Before you cultivate your land or undertake any construction projects, assess your land for erosion potential. Checking vegetation, drainage, and considering climate will all help you avoid any problems with erosion later on.


If you are comfortable that you know enough about erosion, you can make the assessment yourself.
You can also hire a professional to assess your land and identify any areas that might be prone to erosion.
If there are any areas on your land about which you’re unsure, consult a professional so that you don’t have any problems down the road.
It’s best to control erosion when you notice it. Early action will ensure that a small problem doesn’t become a big issue., By checking your land often, you will be able to see the early signs of erosion and act accordingly before the problem occurs or deteriorates.

, Erosion appears differently depending on the natural features in your region, but there are a few fairly universal telltale signs.


Look near areas where the land has been disturbed by construction or natural occurrences that might have washed away the soil. You’ll often find erosion near culverts, pipes that move water under a trail or road.The best time to check for erosion is after heavy rains or other forms of extreme weather such as tornadoes or ice storms.
Check for spots without vegetation. Hillsides and slopes often have places where no trees or plants grow. You might see a buildup of soil below them.Look for exposed plant roots. The soil might be washing or blowing off the top of roots that aren’t normally exposed to the elements.Look for exposed rock. If you notice new boulders that seem to be getting bigger each year, the soil might be receding around them.Look for channels and gullies. These are areas where water and wind have been able to cut through the soil, forming shallow channels or deeper gullies. This is a major sign of erosion that can lead to big problems if left unaddressed.Look for muddy or dirty water. This is a sign that soil is running off and likely eroding., A heavy rain will indicate where the water is forming channels and washing away the topsoil. You need this information in order to know how to best protect your land from further erosion. Here’s what to look for:


Watch where the water runs. On healthy land, the blow of each raindrop is absorbed by a plant before it hits the ground, where it is then quickly absorbed. In problem areas, where there’s no groundcover, it pounds the ground and breaks up the soil, then washes it away. Watch which direction it seems to be running and where it collects.
Look for standing puddles that are muddy or dirty. Muddy puddles where the water isn’t being absorbed correctly could be a sign of erosion in that area.
Look at the color of the water in streams. In a healthy area, rainwater should be quickly absorbed into the ground and surrounding streams should run clear. In areas with erosion, you might see the streams get very muddy from soil runoff during a rainstorm., The only real remedy for erosion is stabilizing the soil and returning it to its natural state. The process by which you go about this task will be different depending on the state of your land and the location of the erosion.If you have light sheet erosion, which occurs on relatively flat areas of land, you can plant vegetation right away. You’ll start with temporary groundcover to hold the soil together, then gradually move on to adding native plants that will restore the land to its naturally healthy state.You may want to protect certain areas from further erosion by erecting barriers, such as rock piles.
If you have channels on your land, they’ll need to be broken up in order to prevent them from creating gullies.
If you have gullies, it will be necessary to use structures and digging techniques to support the soil before you can plant anything. If you try to plant seeds in a gully, they’ll just wash away in the rain.

, If you’re not sure how to proceed, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) can be a great resource for developing an erosion control plan.


You can use the NCRS website at http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/site/national/home/ .
You can also call the NRCS local service centers for your area to discuss your erosion problem. The NCRS website has a list of all local service centers at http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/contact/local/ .
You may also ask them to dispatch an expert to help you determine the best way to control your erosion. http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/landscape/


, You can plant emergency cover immediately on bare soil that is relatively flat and doesn’t have deep channels or gullies. Emergency cover plants are usually grasses or other groundcover plants that grow very quickly, putting down thick roots that will hold the soil together so it doesn’t wash away during the next rain.


Check with your local nursery to figure out which fast-growing ground covers work well in your region. It’s best to plant a mix of plants, rather than just one, so that you have backups in case one type doesn’t take hold.
Use a hoe or garden rake to work compost or manure into the soil. You can also use a light fertilizer if you want. This will help nourish the seeds and give them the best chance of growing.

, Mulches and mats will add a layer to your soil and help it retain moisture. They also promote an environment for starting and growing plants.


Mulches can be made out of grass clippings, leaves, straw, sawdust, bark chips and straw.
For hillsides and places where you fear the mulch will wash away, lay a brush mat over the area to protect the seeds.Here’s how to make one:
Lay out long pieces of brush in a vertical pattern.
Lay more brush pieces horizontally across the vertical pieces.
You can attach them with small pieces of thin wire or twine or even use an organic glue or wood fiber.

, Once the groundcover has grown, you can plant structural trees to further stabilize the land. This will also help prevent further erosion.


Make sure to plant trees native to your area to ensure that they can survive in the climate. In general, willow trees, black locust trees and elderberries are good selections for this purpose.Space them so that the entire area under threat will be served by the tree root system. You don’t want to choose trees that require digging a big hole and disturbing the soil, because it’s still too fragile for that. Rather, choose a type of tree that roots easily from a cutting and grows quickly.Growing a line of trees around a farm, if possible, can be a good idea for preventing most mechanical methods of erosion.
A special modification of this is the riparian vegetation that is grown at the interface of any land and water line. The intention is to prevent the soils from migrating into the water line, or to prevent the water from seeping onto the land and carrying the soils away with it.

, After several seasons, when you’re confident the area is stable, plant more permanent vegetation. Make sure to plant native species in the area or that will thrive in your climate.


Talk with an expert at your local nursery to find out which plants and trees grow well in your region. It’s important to stick with native species, since they’ll have the best chance of surviving and preventing further erosion from occurring.
Trees, grasses, and shrubs are all excellent types of permanent vegetation that will help stabilize the land.
You can also speak to the NCRS about the most optimal vegetation to plant., If the erosion on your land is serious, you may consider using barriers to control erosion. But this can be a risky measure that further damages your property or that of your neighbors. It’s best to consult with professionals on that matter.


The NCRS local service office can suggest a professional to help you deal with the erosion on your land., If you decide to erect your own barriers without the help of a professional, you need to choose the appropriate kind of barrier for your land. Erosion controls often involve the creation of a physical barrier, such as vegetation or rock, to absorb some of the energy of the wind or water that is causing the erosion.


On construction sites they're often implemented in conjunction with sediment controls such as sediment basins and silt fences.
Other types of barriers are: dikes, dams, rock lining, sediment traps, and storm drain outlet protection.

, Rock lining, also called riprap, will protect channel or waterway banks from water flow that erodes it.


Use riprap to stabilize stream banks or below concentrated flows of water. You can also use it on slopes.Riprap is made of from different kinds of rock including granite or limestone. Some places may also use concrete as riprap., This technique is useful if you’re worried that water runoff will wash the seeds and mulch away down a hillside. A contour trench is a shallow trench dug along the contour of a hillside so that it runs perpendicular to the flow of water. The purpose is to catch the water and give it time to sink into the soil before it runs off the hill.


Dig a few short trenches around the side of the hill. Each one should be 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep and 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) apart.Groundcover can be planted below the trenches and this will protect them from being washed out.

, A channel is a spot where running water cuts into the soil and forms a rut. By filling the channel with compost or manure, you will help prevent further erosion.


If a channel increases in size with each rain, it can eventually form a gully, which is harder to address.
Stop a channel before it turns into a gully by using a hoe to break it up. Fill it in with compost or manure and rake the area so that it’s flat and smooth.
After breaking up a channel, replant it with vegetation according to the system outlined above.

, Gullies are channels that have cut deep into the earth. By reducing gullies, you’ll not only control erosion, but also allow the surrounding vegetation to thrive.


Once enough topsoil and subsoil has been washed away, there’s no barrier to keep heavy rains from washing away soil. When a gully cuts below the water table, it sucks away the water from the surrounding area, killing trees and vegetation on either side.
Reduce the amount of water pouring into gullies by addressing the situation at the top of the gully. There are probably bare spots and other signs of sheet erosion that you can work to fix by planting groundcover immediately. This will help the water absorb into the soil instead of flowing into the gully.
While some people recommend building diversion channels to make the water flow elsewhere, this usually just creates a new problem - namely, a new channel that could become a new gully. It’s better to work on fixing the gully once and for all.

, In addition to controlling water, it’s important to stabilize the land, including the bottom of a gully, to keep it from getting any deeper. To do that, build a check dam, which is a small series of dikes that slow water flow so that the ground can recover.


Choose your dam material. You can use rocks, poles, planks, or another sturdy material. You can pack holes with straw or brush. Each dam will be about 2 feet (0.6 m) high.
Dig the first dam into the sides of the gully. Construct your dam by placing material across the gully so that it touches the bottom and digs into the walls on either side, so that the water can’t flow around it.
Make a notch in the middle. The middle of the dam should have a space where water can get through; otherwise it’ll just find a way around the dam.
Make a rock apron on the other side. The water needs a place to land on the other side so that its impact is reduced. Put a bed of rocks in front of the dam.
Construct more small dams or dikes to form a series. Depending on the size of the gully, put in several more dams. The system works most effectively if the dams are close together, so the water can’t pick up much speed in between them.

, Once your check dam is in place, level out the gully. The aim is to gradually level the gully by grading the sides so that the bottom fills in over time.


Use a shovel, a pick axe or another appropriate tool to begin knocking dirt from the sides of the gully into the bottom. It can take weeks or even months to finish the job, because each new rain is a bit of a setback.

, Any time there is bad weather, check your work to make sure it is holding and not causing more erosion. If more dirt slides down the sides of the gully, keep working to level them to a gentler angle.


Make sure the check dams are working sufficiently. You might need to add more small dams, adjust the length of the sides, replace the aprons, and so on to ensure that water isn’t still cutting the gully deeper when it rains.

, When your dam and leveling work has sufficiently slowed the gully’s growing cycle, you can plant it using the process above. Start with groundcover, use fast-growing trees to stabilize the area, and after a few seasons of healthy growth, plant native species that will return the land to its natural state.

, As much as possible, try not to disturb the soil in the area under concern. Removing trees and plants, driving heavy equipment over the area, clearing an area larger than you need, and many other practices used on construction sites can lead to erosion., The predominant technique agriculturists use for erosion control is the no till method. This method, also known as conservation tillage, is farming practiced with a minimum amount of tilling.


The tillage process, while enriching for the crop, also displaces the soil layers and makes it loose. Such a loose soil layer is more prone to erosion. Agricultural practices that can produce a good crop without necessitating tilling are being put into use as a measure for erosion control.

, Contour farming is very commonly practiced on sloping land areas. This form of agriculture is effective at controlling erosion because it slows the runoff of rainwater considerably.


In contour farming, planes of land are constructed by cutting off the land according to its contours. Small plane walls, called bunds, are erected along the contours of the land. Agriculture is practiced in the areas that these contours create. The effectiveness of this form of agriculture lies in the fact that the horizontally flat lands, together with the bunds, slow the runoff of rainwater considerably.

, Erosion control is not just about preventing the soil from getting washed or swept away. Methods to enrich whatever soil is present are also covered under erosion control practices.One example is keeping the land fallow. Here, after three or four successive seasons of farming, the land is planted with a cover crop for one season. During this time, the soil can regenerate, gaining back some of the nutrients lost in the previous seasons.
Another method is to grow a single crop before the main cropping season in order to provide nutrients to the soil. Growing a leguminous crop can provide nitrogen to the soil because these crops can harbor the beneficial nitrogen-fixing Rhizome in their root nodules.

, Methods like adding mulch, fertilizers, etc., all contribute to increasing the productivity of the soil, and are also covered under erosion control."

Conserve water at home.,
Use fewer chemicals.,
Never dump hazardous waste materials down the drain or into the grass.,
Help fight local water pollution.",How to Be Environmentally Friendly1," It takes a lot of energy to bring water from rivers, groundwater, or whatever your local water source is into your home. Water must be pumped to a treatment plant, filtered and treated with chemicals to clean it, then pumped into your neighborhood so you can use it home. Saving as much water as possible reduces the stress this whole process puts on natural bodies of water in the environment.Here are a few ways to conserve water:


Use the low-water dishwashing method. Instead of having the water running the whole time, fill one sink with hot soapy water, then turn off the water and scrub the dishes. Dip them into a second sink filled with clean water, then dry and store them.
Install a low-flow shower head and take short showers. Long showers and baths use a lot more water.
Use water-saving appliances, like a dishwasher and washing machine.
Fix leaks in your pipes so water isn't constantly coming out.
Don't leave water running while you brush your teeth.
Don’t water your lawn. Let rain do the work instead of pumping clean water into your front lawn. If it's legal in your area, save grey water or collect water rain barrel to use. If you want a green lawn, plant native plants or low-water plants like moss instead.;
, Chemicals washed down the drain or applied directly to the grass can taint the water supply, causing problems for wildlife and humans alike. Figure out which chemicals you can replace with something else so you can avoid washing toxins down the drain.


Use alternative cleaning solutions. Try white vinegar and baking soda to clean your kitchen and bathroom.
Reconsider your personal body care items. Replace shampoos, conditioners and soaps with natural versions. Your body will thank you, too.
Try natural pesticides and herbicides. Instead of spraying for weeds, try planting native species that naturally take care of the problem.

, Paint, motor oil, ammonia, and other strong chemical solutions should not be dumped down the drain or into the yard, because they'll seep into the groundwater. These items need to be disposed of properly. Check your local sanitation department's website to find out how to dispose of hazardous waste. You may be instructed to take them to a toxic waste site for proper disposal.

, Changing your personal habits regarding water and chemical usage is a great first step. By conserving water in an everyday way, you're doing your part and setting a good example for other people. But to truly make an impact, consider taking your efforts a step further. Here are a few ways to do it:


Participate in a waterways clean-up day. If there's a local stream, river or beach that's littered with trash or polluted, there's probably a local water conservation group trying to clean it up. Next time there's a clean up day, join in. And if you can't find a group, organize one yourself!
Speak up against water polluters. Thanks to loose governmental regulations, our waterways are often polluted with industrial waste dumped by corporations. Oil and chemical dumping kills aquatic life and the surrounding environment, and it makes water unsafe for people to drink as well. Investigate to see if there's a campaign for clean water in your area, and sign up to help however you can.

You can do this by always remaining respectful, and report crimes when they occur. Being honorable means that you stand for the right thing, regardless of whether it impacts you negatively.To prevent people from being scared of you, an outgoing and positive attitude may be best.
Try to motivate others to live a better life.;
, Being a real life superhero means that you're taking on a responsibility to your community and the people around you. Bravery means that you're willing to put your well-being on the line to keep others safe. That means stepping in and speaking up when you see an injustice or crime committed. Before you intervene, make sure that you contact the police. While putting your life on the line is extreme and not advised, stepping in and stopping an assault or theft are potential things that you could do.


Be careful not to try to stop crimes completely by yourself, or you may be labeled as a vigilante to authorities.
Always try to talk to the criminal before taking physical action.

, Many real life superheroes fight for a particular cause. Think about what you care about personally, such as protecting people from domestic assault, providing food for the homeless, or keeping your community safe. Do not try to take on serious crimes like assault or murder by yourself. Contact the authorities if a serious crime is taking place.


Light Step is a hero that helps people with common problems like fixing a flat tire or providing socks and gloves to the homeless.Bike Batman is a guy in Seattle that prevents people from stealing other people's bikes., Many real life superheroes use real protective material like kevlar as part of their costume.Create rough designs for your costume by sketching designs in a pad at first. If you have costume design or tailoring experience, it's possible that you can then create your costume based off your sketches.


Draw inspiration for your name from things that you've experienced in your life or things that you admire in comic book heroes that you've read about. Try to keep your name on the shorter side and make sure that it's memorable and easy to pronounce.
Real life superhero names include Captain Ozone, Mr. Xtreme, Master Legend, and Nyx.If you're not sure how to create a costume read Make a Superhero Costume.
Pheonix Jones wears a yellow and black mask with a kevlar vest while he patrols the streets of Seattle, Washington., While you may eventually help prevent crimes from taking place, the vast majority of your time will be spent talking to people. You will have to talk to criminals, civilians, and the police. Make sure to practice effective listening and try to understand where people are coming from. Focus fully on the person who is talking and allow them to tell you what is going on from their perspective. Show them that you're paying attention and that you understand. Then make the appropriate move depending on if they are committing a crime.Be aware that everyone is different and that someone's intention may not necessarily be nefarious.
Read people's non-verbal cues, and get a good understanding of what someone looks like when they are upset, nervous, or angry.

, Patrolling your neighborhood is especially important if it's prone to crime, there is not a regular police presence, or there is a lack of a neighborhood watch. It's important to try to de-escalate any potential altercations or violence that you see, but try not to get directly involved or put yourself or anyone else in danger. Your mere presence should be enough to dissuade people from committing crimes like robberies or car thefts.


It's best to sit back and wait for the cops to provide backup instead of taking criminals head on.
The Guardian Shield has been patrolling neighborhoods in Beaverton, Oregon., Giving to the less fortunate is a something that many real life superheroes decide to do. Some heroes provide visits and donations to terminally ill patients in hospitals, while others provide food and clothing for the homeless. Find something good to do in your city or town and make sure to give back to the community.


There's a good chance that your community will be more accepting if you actively give to charity or donate your time as a volunteer.
Zac Mihajlovic worked for the Make a Wish Foundation and visited young children that were terminally ill., Being a real-life superhero may not always entail stopping crime. Sometimes it involves helping people in everyday things. Try to be as helpful as you can when you see that people need help. Don't turn the blind eye when everyone else is.


Examples of doing a good deed can include giving people directions or helping the elderly across the street.
Be open and receptive. Keep an eye out for anyone in distress.

, There are times where you can potentially stop a crime without putting yourself in danger. Use your own discretion when approaching situations. De-escalate the conflict by carefully listening to both sides of the story and saving judgment on either party. Focus on people's feelings. Allow people to talk it out. Devise a plan that will make both people happy, and ensure that everyone is safe.For instance, if you see a bunch of kids illegally smoking cigarettes, you could try to talk to them instead of calling the authorities or turning the blind eye. Try to be productive as you help people, not disruptive or violent.

, Being a real life superhero can become stressful over time. It's important that you keep yourself mentally healthy so that you're able to help others resolve their problems. In addition to mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and addiction, stress can lead to physical problems like high blood pressure and promotes the formation of artery-clogging deposits.Don't obsess over your new role as a real-life superhero. Take breaks and take nights off. Communicate with close family and friends and do something that makes you relax.


Practice things like meditation, yoga, tai chi, and deep breathing to reduce your stress.If you feel overwhelmed or obsessed over being a real life superhero, consider seeing a therapist or psychologist to discuss your thoughts.

, You'll need strength to look like a superhero and to defend yourself as a last resort. Go to the gym or work with a personal trainer to develop your strength. If you are already athletic or work out regularly, concentrate on developing meaningful strength by doing weight exercises.


Exercises that can increase your strength include the deadlift, leg press, bench press, squats, and pushups.Working out three days a week and giving yourself rest in between will help build your strength., Being a real life superhero means that you're going to be actively walking around. This can become difficult if you're wearing a heavy costume while trying to stop crime. Good exercises to increase your stamina include running, jogging, walking, cycling, swimming, and doing circuit exercises.Work on your cardio at least three times a week.Change the exercises you do so you don't get bored.
You can combine strength and cardio training when you work out.
Remember to stay hydrated if you are patrolling the neighborhood.

, While you shouldn't actively try looking for fights, learning how to defend yourself in serious situations is probably something that you should learn how to do. Criminals don't want to be caught for their criminal activity, and informing the police of their deeds may cause them to direct their anger towards you. Look for reputable martial arts or self-defense gyms in your area and consider signing up for classes.


Some popular self-defense martial arts include, Krav Maga, Sambo, and Brazillian Jiu Jitsu., If you eat unhealthy foods it will be harder for you to maintain your superhero physique and physicality. Eat foods that are conducive to an active lifestyle like nutrient rich vegetables like red and yellow peppers and dark greens like spinach and kale. Protein is also another important aspect of staying on a healthy diet. Eat things like lean or low-fat cuts of beef or pork, skinless chicken, turkey, and seafood.Use whole grain options when eating starchy carbohydrates.The average man should eat 2,700 calories per day and the average woman should eat 2,200 calories per day."

Conserve electricity at home.,
Become less reliant on cars.,
Shop locally.,
Eat more vegetables and other foods that were locally grown.,
Join a group working to combat air pollution.",How to Be Environmentally Friendly2," It's one of the first ways many of us are taught to be environmentally friendly, yet we all need help remembering how important it is to do things like turn off the lights when you leave the room. Everything that's powered by electricity requires the use of energy generated at power plants. The plants usually burn either coal or fossil fuel, which produces emissions that cloud up the air and make it harder for everyone to breathe. That's a heavy consequence for forgetting to shut down your computer. Here's what you can do:


Lower the thermostat in the winter. Instead of heating the house so it's blazing hot and snowing outside, heat it just enough so that you're comfortable. Insulating your home helps keep the cold out more efficiently, too.See if you can switch to wind or solar-powered electricity, which produces fewer emissions.Use less air conditioning. In the summer, see if you can handle going without air conditioning on days when it's not that hot. Save it for the sweltering days.
Turn off appliances and electronics when not in use. Computers, TVs, coffee pots, and more should be turned off and unplugged when you aren't using them.
Use energy-saving light bulbs. Incandescent bulbs (the old-fashioned kind) require more energy to burn.

, From the manufacturing of cars, to the extraction and burning of the gas that powers them, to the oil and other materials used to build the roads they drive on, there's no doubt that cars and all their trappings are a major source of air pollution. Cutting back on your car use is a great way to be more environmentally friendly.


Take public transportation. Get familiar with the bus, subway or train schedule in your city, and start using public transportation more often.
Find the bike lanes in your town. More and more cities and towns are putting in new bike lanes connecting all the major neighborhoods. Saving money on not getting a gym memberships and getting free exercise is an added bonus of using bike lanes.
Make time for walking. If you have time for a stroll, why not walk instead of driving? Any place that's five or ten minutes away by car should be within suitable walking distance, too.
Carpool to work or school with other people instead of driving by yourself.

, Your shopping habits might not be the first thing you question when you're coming up with ways to reduce air pollution, but what people buy has a big effect on the environment. How a product was made, where it was made and how it was packaged all play a role.


Look into manufacturing processes. Was it made with sustainable materials, or did its production involve the use of plastics or other chemicals? Product manufacture is also responsible for using (and wasting) a lot of water, so this is an important question to ask for more than one reason.
Check labels to see how far items traveled. If it had to travel by boat, plane, and truck to get to your store or door, a lot of gas was burned to allow you to purchase the product. See if you can find a good replacement that is created closer to your home,

, You can really show that you support the environment by changing some of your food buying habits. Shopping local instead of buying food that was shipped in from far away both supports local farms and cuts down on your carbon footprint.


Shop at farmer’s markets. During the spring, summer and fall, most towns have farmer's markets with selections of local food.
Try growing your own food. Join a community garden or make a plot in your backyard or on the patio.
Practice ""Meatless Mondays.""Meatless Mondays is a worldwide movement. Followers do not eat animal-based protein on Mondays. This movement helps to minimize water usage as well as reduce greenhouse gases and fuel dependence., Once you start being more aware of how everyday habits affect the quality of our air, you might want to take action do do something about air pollution. Look for local and national groups working on ways to reduce carbon output and combat global warming. See what problems are being addressed in your area, and encourage others to join in.

Create less waste.,
Plant trees.,
Let your yard grow a little wild.,
Respect animals’ lives.,
Join a group working to protect your land.",How to Be Environmentally Friendly3," Some communities produce so much trash that they're running out of places to put it. If you want to take good care of the land that you, your friends and your family call home, reducing the amount of garbage you throw away is a good place to start.


Buy minimally packaged goods. Avoid getting products that come wrapped in layers of plastic, since it's not usually biodegradable.
Recycle and reuse. When you do buy containers made of plastic, as well as containers made of glass or other reusable materials, try to find other uses for them instead of just tossing them out.
Start a compost pile instead of throwing out your food scraps.
Make things instead of buying them so you don't have to keep buying new bottles.
Cook at home instead of getting takeout, which often comes in plastic or styrofoam containers.

, Trees are essential for the health of the environment. They keep the land from eroding, they clean the air, they provide shelter for animals. Trees are so powerful they even bring our stress levels down when we live among them.Do your part to help trees in these ways:


Plant native trees that will help the soil and provide shade.
Don't cut down trees unless it's completely necessary. Save as many as you can.
See if there's a local group you can work with to save patches of forest from development.

, If you have the space and inclination, consider making your yard a haven for plants, trees and animals. So many wild places have been taken over that wild creatures need as much space as they can get. As a reward, you'll get to live next to plants and animals most people don't see everyday. Here's what you can do:


Don’t use pesticides or herbicides. Let your yard be completely organic.
Grow plants that attract bees and butterflies.
Have a birdfeeder, a squirrel feeder and a bat box.
Consider beekeeping.Provide a water source for animals, like a birdbath or a garden pond.
Let moles, opossums, raccoons and other animals thought of as pests live instead of getting rid of them.

, With so many animal species going extinct every day, it's time to rethink the way we see animals.Realizing that every creature is valuable and deserves a spot on Earth might change the way you interact with and talk about animals, and the choices you make in your everyday life. If you care about animals, try doing the following:


Make sustainable eating choices. Eat fish that were caught in a sustainable way, and pay attention to where your fish comes from by checking a source like Seafood Watch. Try to buy all animal products from sources you know and trust.
Take care of wild places, like beaches and forests, which are habitats for animals. If you're out for a hike and you see a sign instructing you to stay on the trail, do it.
See if your local state forest or park needs volunteers to help protect animal habitat.
Help spread awareness about endangered species. Let others know that you care about animals, and educate them on how important it is to keep them safe.

, Join up with an environmental group working to save the land where you live from destructive practices like clearcutting, strip mining, mountaintop removal and fracking. These practices affect not just the land, but the trees, wildlife, air, water, and human life that depends on it.

When you feel like your free speech speech rights have been violated, you can search for a remedy within the court system or outside of it. A qualified constitutional lawyer can help you determine the best course of action to ensure your rights are protected.


Talk to your friends and family about lawyer recommendations. Lawyers are usually well known and involved individuals in the community and you may know one yourself, or know someone else who does.
If you cannot get a solid recommendation, visit your state bar website and use their lawyer referral service. After you answer a series of questions about your legal issue, you will be put in contact with a number of qualified lawyers in your area.
Before you hire someone, sit down with your top candidates and conduct initial consultations. During your initial consultations you will want to ask each candidate about their history practicing constitutional law (specifically free speech law). Even though a lawyer might practice in the constitutional arena, they may focus on a different area of the law that you don't need help with. For example, some lawyers might focus on defending protesters and demonstrators, while others may focus on the free speech rights of the media. In addition, some lawyers might focus on litigation while others might focus on administrative actions. Be sure you find the lawyer that best fits your needs.
Be sure to ask about fees. Lawyer fees will vary greatly and some lawyers can be expensive. However, you usually get what you pay for.;
, You might want to talk with nonprofit organizations, in addition to hiring a lawyer, in order to get help with your battle to protect free speech. Talking with nonprofit agencies dedicated to protecting free speech rights can also be a great way to find qualified lawyers. Nonprofits will often have staff attorneys that might even take your case for free. These lawyers are usually well-trained in very specific areas of the law and will fight for your free speech rights vigorously. Nonprofits will also usually have robust media teams that will help make your story a nationally recognized one.


For example, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) protects free speech rights through litigation, media campaigns, and legislative lobbying. You can contact the ACLU if you believe your free speech rights have been diminished.The Thomas Jefferson Center is another organization like the ACLU, although this one is dedicated solely to the protection of free speech rights. The Thomas Jefferson Center offers educational opportunities, they participate in litigation, and they lobby for the protection of free speech rights. Contact the Thomas Jefferson Center if you believe you have an issue they would be interested in., The media, like you, has a protected right to free speech (called the freedom of the press). Therefore, the media can be a great resource for you when you want to get a message out to the public. If you think your right to free speech has been restricted in any way, contact your local media outlet or talk to a nonprofit organization about starting a media campaign. If you hire an organization like the ACLU, they will likely put together a media plan for you. They even have their own media department.When you talk with the media, explain your issue clearly and concisely. Explain to the media outlet, and to the public, how your right to free speech has been burdened and how you want it remedied. Make a plea for help from others who are struggling with the same issues. Help will usually come in the form of donations, legal assistance, and/or help paying for costs associated with your fight. The more people you get on your side, and the more vocal you are, the more traction your story will get.

, A central part of your First Amendment rights is your ability to assemble. The Constitution protects and allows you to gather in groups for peaceful and lawful purposes. You can use this right to advocate publicly for free speech protection. In general, you will be able to assemble in public forums and advocate for your rights. In some circumstances, you may need a permit depending on the type of activity you plan on undertaking. You can also hand out leaflets and other literature to people walking by.


Freedom of speech allows you to express yourself without constraint from the government. When a legislature creates laws that burden your free speech rights, they have to have a valid justification. The government may also have a right to prohibit some speech that incites violence, advocates for illegal activity, or is obscene.If you are out campaigning and advocating for your free speech rights and you are stopped by police, stay calm and do not resist. If you are arrested, keep a log of any actions taken and contact a lawyer as soon as possible. If your free speech rights have been violated, you will have a valid cause of action against the government., Another way to protect free speech rights is to lobby for quality legislation on the issue. The constitutional right to free speech applies to governments and the laws they create. Because laws are created by the representatives you elect, you should reach out to them about issues you feel strongly about. Write letters to your state and federal legislators and make your position on free speech known. Your letter might help block a bill from becoming a law if that bill would have lessened your free speech rights. In addition, your letter might help get a bill passed if it strengthens your free speech rights.


Your letters can be very persuasive considering you are one of the many individuals that vote to have each representative elected to office. If the representative does not listen to your concerns, you might choose not to vote for them and they may lose reelection. Letters can be sent to any legislator as well as the executive branch (i.e., the President or Governor).
When you write a letter, be as specific and clear as possible. If you are concerned about a bill, name the bill and lay out as many specific concerns as you can. Also, always be sure you let the representative know what you want them to do. For example, if the bill is being voted on, tell them you want them to oppose it and vote no.

, Some states allow you to protect rights through a ballot initiative process. To start this process, you will draft language stating what voters would be voting on if your initiative made it on the state ballot. For example, if a state law was just passed that restricted speech in public parks, you might draft an initiative that allows for the law to be rejected.


The actual process of creating and circulating a ballot initiative brings free speech issues in to play. For example, as a matter of free speech, you have a right to urge people to sign the petition or oppose it. In addition, you have the right to circulate your initiative in public places, to explain your position, and to ask for signatures.
If a certain number of signatures are received, your initiative will be placed on your state's ballot and will be put to a vote., In some situations, if your free speech rights have been violated, you may be able to bring an administrative action against the person or entity who violated those rights. When you bring an administrative action against someone, you are essentially filing a complaint with an administrative agency. The agency will then investigate your complaint and may even ask you to take part in an administrative hearing. In the end, if the agency finds the other party liable for violating your free speech rights, the agency may impose penalties on that party.


For example, if an employer restricts your ability to openly discuss wages and working conditions, you can file a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB protects workers' rights and, under federal law, employers cannot restrict your right to engage in certain speech activities(e.g., discussions about wages and working conditions). When you file a complaint with the NLRB, they will investigate it and may even hold a ""trial"" in which an administrative law judge will hear your case., When you choose to file a lawsuit, the first decision you must make is where to file that lawsuit and what law to allege was violated. While state courts will generally have jurisdiction over most cases, federal courts only have jurisdiction over certain types of cases. In order to get into federal court, you must either have a federal question or meet the standards for diversity jurisdiction. You have a federal question when your claim arises under federal law, which includes the Constitution. You will meet the diversity standard if you and the defendant are from different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.Because free speech is a constitutional issue and commonly comes up when federal laws are created and/or violated, you will usually be able to get into federal court by claiming you have federal question jurisdiction. Going to federal court in order to litigate your free speech case will usually be advantageous because the federal courts will usually have a better understanding of the laws at play. Federal courts will also have more experience litigating these types of cases.

, Your lawsuit begins by drafting a complaint, which is a legal document that tells the judge and the defendant how and why your free speech rights were violated. You will also tell the court what remedy you want. In general, your complaint will need to include the following information:

The case caption, which will include each party's name and the court's information.
Your basis for jurisdiction, which explains that you are in federal court because you have a federal question.
The nature of your suit, which will explain what the subject-matter of your suit is. In this instance, you will explain that your suit is about a violation of free speech rights.
The cause of action, which is the specific violation you are alleging occurred. For example, if a federal statute was violated, state that and cite to the statute in question.
The amount in controversy, which is the amount you want the court to award you in order to remedy the illegal activity.

, The summons is a document that tells the defendant to respond to your lawsuit. The summons document is usually available online at your court's website and all you need to do is fill in the defendant's name as well as the amount of time they have to respond to the suit. The amount of time a defendant has to respond to a suit will depend on what type of suit you are bringing. In general, the window will be about 30 days from when you serve the defendant., When you complete your complaint and summons, you will take them to the courthouse and file them with the clerk of courts. When you file in-person, the clerk will look over your documents and ensure everything is completed in a satisfactory manner. Some federal courts also allow you to file your lawsuit by email as well. Check with your court to determine if this is an option.


Once the clerk looks over your documents you will be required to pay a $400 filing fee. If you cannot afford the fee, you will have to file a motion to proceed in forma pauperis. This motion asks the court to waive the filing fee.
If you pay the filing fee upfront, the clerk will stamp your documents ""filed"" and you will be handed copies of the lawsuit. The official summons will be issued at this time.
If you do not pay the filing fee, your lawsuit will be stamped ""filed but you will not receive the official summons until the judge has ruled on your motion in forma pauperis., Once your case has been opened, you will have to tell the defendant a case has been brought against them. In order to do this you must serve them with a copy of the complaint and summons. Every defendant in the case must be served within 120 days of you filing the case. You will be responsible for ensuring someone 18 or older either hands a copy of the lawsuit to the defendant or send it via the mail., Once service has been completed, the person who served the lawsuit will complete a return of service section on the back of the summons and return it to you. You will then have to file that document with the court., Once the defendant has been served, he or she will have around 30 days to respond. When a defendant responds to your lawsuit, they will generally draft an answer and have it served on you. The answer will explain why the defendant thinks they are not liable and might even include cross-complaints if they sue you fro something else.


The answer is a valuable document and will give you some insight into how the defendant plans to fight your case. Read it carefully so you can plan your next course of action.

, During discovery, you and the other party will have an opportunity to exchange information in order to get ready for trial. You will be able to gather documents, talk to witnesses, and figure out what the other side is going to say. In order to achieve these goals, you will be able to use the following discovery tools:Depositions, which are formal in-person interviews conducted with witnesses and other parties. The interviews are conducted under oath and the answers given can be used in court.
Interrogatories, which are formal questions written to a witness or party. These questions must be responded to under oath and the answers can be used in court.
Document requests, which are written requests asking the other party to hand over documents that would not otherwise be available. Examples might include emails, internal memos, and photographs.
Requests for admission, which are written requests asking the other party to admit or deny the genuineness of a document or the truthfulness of a statement.

, As soon as discovery concludes, the defendant will likely try to end the litigation by filing a motion for summary judgment. In order to be successful, the defendant will have to show the court there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the defendant will have to persuade the court that, even if all assumptions were made in your favor, there is no way you could win.


To defend against this motion, you will need to file affidavits and evidence with the court persuading it that there are factual issues in dispute that need to be hashed out in court. If you are successful in your defense, the case will continue toward trial., As trial nears, you may want to consider trying to settle with the other party. If your case goes to trial, the costs and the time commitment increase greatly. Start by taking part in informal discussions with the other party about your concerns and what you would see as an acceptable solution. Listen to the other party and see if you can make an agreement. If no agreement can be reached, you may want to try one of the following alternative dispute resolution options:


Mediation, which involves having a neutral third party sit down with you and the other party to discuss finding common ground. The third party will not take sides and will not offer opinions about the case. They are only there to help facilitate the discussion.
Arbitration, which involves having a judge-like third party sit down and hear each party's case. Once the third party listens to both stories, he or she will take a side and offer an opinion about the case.

, If a settlement cannot be reached, you and the other party will take part in one final pretrial conference in order to set the trial schedule. During this conference, you and the other party will sit down with the judge and discuss all of the issues that are agreed upon and which ones are still in dispute. The issues that are still in dispute will be handled at trial.


At the end of this conference, the judge will issue a pretrial order, which will be the road map for your trial. It is important to discuss every issue at this conference because any issue that is left out will not be able to be heard at trial., If you chose to have a jury in your complaint, your trial will begin with you choosing that jury. This process is called ""voire dire"" and you will be given the opportunity to ask questions of potential jurors to get an idea of their mindset and biases. If you believe a juror is going to be biased, you may be able to have them removed. At the end of this process, the final jurors will be empaneled and the trial will begin.If you waived your right to a jury, your case will be heard by the judge alone. If this is the case, you will skip this step.

, Your opening statement should explain your case to the court and offer a road map of the trial. This is your first opportunity to connect with the court and tell them why you have a winning case. While your opening statement should be strong and passionate, make it quick and succinct. In addition, do not discuss evidence at this point and do not introduce anything the court is unlikely to understand.


The defendant will have an opportunity to make an opening statement after you. In some circumstances, the defendant may hold off on making the opening statement until after you have presented your case.

, You will have the opportunity to present your case to the jury first. When you present your case, you will call witnesses to the stand and present evidence through them. To be admitted, all of your evidence must comply with the Federal Rules of Evidence. Be sure you read and understand these rules so your case is presented smoothly and effectively.


With each witness, you will ask questions until you are satisfied with the information you receive. Once you are done asking questions, the defendant will have an opportunity to cross-examine your witnesses. You will then have an opportunity to ask follow-up questions related to the defense's cross-examination., After you have rested and presented your case, the defense will have an opportunity to do the same. After the defense asks questions of their witnesses, you will have an opportunity to cross-examine them. During cross-examination you want to try and poke holes in their testimony and make the witness seem untrustworthy and biased. To do this, you will try and contradict statements they made when the defense was asking them questions.


For example, if the defense witness says one thing during trial but said the opposite during a deposition, you should bring up their deposition statements and make them reconcile the two.

, When both parties have rested, you will have the opportunity to make a closing argument. Your closing argument should touch on all the important pieces of evidence you discussed throughout the trial. It should be a passionate plea asking the court to rule in your favor. Remember, this is your last opportunity to make an impression on the court.


Once you have finished, the defense will have an opportunity to make a closing argument as well.

, When the trial is over, the judge or jury will deliberate and discuss the case. When the decision maker in your trial has come to a conclusion, it will be read in court. This conclusion is called the verdict. If you win, the court will award you damages in a specific amount. If you lose, you will be awarded nothing but you may be able to appeal."

Stop to help when and where you're needed.,
Support your local economy.,
Recycle and compost.,
Save energy and water.,
Be less reliant on your car.",How to Help Your Community1," It's a simple way to make your community better and help to create the kind of vibe that makes people feel safe and happy. If you see someone in need of assistance, come to their aid instead of averting your eyes. Do for others what you'd want them to do for you if you were in their situation.


If you see a mother struggling to get her stroller down a set of stairs, offer to help her carry it.
If you notice someone looking lost, help them get where they're trying to go.
Figure out how you can help the people who ask for money in the street, instead of passing them without looking them in the eyes.
Be the person who helps out in an emergency, instead of the one who assumes someone else will do it.;
, Healthy communities have healthy local economies. People work together to help each other make a living and thrive. You can help improve the health of your local economy in many different ways, from changing your shopping habits to starting a business of your own. Consider these different ways to help:Buy your food from local vendors. Try to get most of your produce from the farmer's market, where members of your community go to sell food they've worked hard to grow.
Shop at local businesses whenever you can. For example, if you have the choice to buy a new pair of jeans at a chain discount store or a small business owned by a member of your community, choose the latter. Change your mindset from buying the cheapest available product to leveraging your purchases to provide the most community good. Knowing that your money will go toward boosting your local economy and building a strong, vibrant community is worth the extra effort and expense. Help others to see the light and help them come aboard to help you boost the local community's financial health.
Consider starting your own business. You can serve your community by offering a great product and possibly even hiring employees.

, Many communities are experiencing problems with landfills that are getting too full. Producing too much trash pollutes the environment, and that's not good for your community's long-term health. You can do your part to help improve the situation by recycling and composting as much of your waste as possible.


If you want to go above and beyond, you could also spread awareness about how to recycle, or start a recycling program at your school or place of work.
Composting is useful in more ways than one. It allows you to dispose of your food waste without putting it in the trash, and as a result you end up with rich soil you can use in your garden. Once you learn how to do it, show others how easy it can be.

, Using excessive electricity and water strains community resources.Saving energy and water is good for the planet as well as your local environment. Do your best to conserve energy and water and it will become an investment in your community's long-term health.


Turning off your lights when you're not using them, using energy-saving appliances, decreasing your reliance on air conditioning, turning down the temperature on your water heater, and unplugging your computer when you power it down are all ways you can help save energy.
Taking shorter showers, making sure your pipes aren't leaking, limiting your lawn watering, and using a low-water method of washing dishes are all ways you can help save water.

, Communities that rely heavily on car transportation often experience elevated air pollution levels.Air pollution is not only detrimental to plants and animals, it causes major health problems for humans, too. Using your car less often decreases your carbon footprint, which helps your community. Here are alternatives to try:


Walk or bike where you need to go. It takes a little longer, but you see more along the way.
Use public transportation. Even if your area doesn't have a great subway or elevated rail system, you probably have bus lines nearby.
Carpool to work or school, instead of driving places by yourself.

Stop offering to volunteer if you do not have the time.,
Decline if you are already over-committed to volunteering.,
Avoid volunteer activities for which you don't have the temperament.,
Be careful of taking on volunteer work that can re-traumatize you or hits ""too close to home"".,
Be aware that there are certain stages in your life when volunteering is not a good option for you.,
Avoid volunteering for something just because a friend is volunteering.,
Don't be bullied, coerced or co-opted into volunteering.,
Question authorities who seek to over-rely on volunteers.,
Find other ways to help out that do not sap your time/ energy/ finances/ good will.,
Don't risk your safety.,
Be wary of any organization that asks you to pay them in order to volunteer, especially if you are strapped for cash.,
Volunteering should not displace financial well-being.",How to Know when Not to Volunteer," If you cannot devote the necessary time, be aware you only have so much time to devote to anything. Volunteering is no different. You can create problems for other volunteers by not turning up often. It is also disruptive to have your absences occur at key moments when you said you'd do something but were unable to follow through. It's better not to offer at all than to let someone down.

Recognize that if you commit to a certain amount or time, you sacrifice something else. While it might be something worthwhile, other times, it may be something valuable like helping your children with homework or spending time with them.
Be cautious about visiting nursing home residents. Lonely elderly people will quickly become dependent on your visits and won't understand if you stop showing up.



 

;
, If you are already on a parent's board, making cookies for each bake sale, and helping adults to learn English, in addition to working full-time, the added stress may have a negative impact on your life. Do not feel obliged to take on more, even if somebody asks. Volunteer overload is not good for you, your family, or your work colleagues, and it certainly isn't good for the volunteer organization that can't rely on your attendance because you're overbooked. You may explain to the asking organization why you cannot extend yourself at the time, and remind them that you are open to volunteering in the future, when your current obligations have been met. However, you do not owe any explanation whatsoever. You can simply say ""I am not available"".

, Don't become a volunteer firefighter if you're afraid of fire or you lack physical fitness. Don't become a volunteer health assistant if you faint at the sight of blood. Don't volunteer in your child's science classroom if you don't relate well to children. Let others take the roles that you're not suited for. Hunt around for roles better suited to you. Or tell the volunteer organization what your skills are and let them find a position better suited to your aptitude and interests. It's far more helpful to devote a few hours to doing something that you can do well rather than volunteering many hours towards something you're not suited for.

, You may want to help others who have dealt with issues you have, but sometimes this can end up being too intense. You may be confronted with an issue that is still very raw for you. This is not to say that you shouldn't find catharsis in facing the issues head-on through volunteering but it does mean that you must feel strong enough in yourself to cope with the feelings as they are presented back at you from someone else suffering them. Good volunteer organizations will talk this through with you at the beginning.


For example, working with sexually abused children when you yourself were abused may re-trigger the memories, feelings and so on you experienced. This may not be helpful and cause you distress and may hinder recovery for you.

, Although temporary, there are certain times in your life when your volunteer activities will need to step down and take a backseat to your own life. These times include: death of a family member; exam time; birth of a baby; illness (see below); and moving house. Each of these activities rate highly and you are well within your rights to put all your efforts into seeing yourself and your family through the temporary disruption. In time, you will have recovered or moved on from the hard part and be ready to return to helping others. This is about knowing when to let others help you for a short time! On the other hand, volunteering can sometimes be the only reality you have to hang onto to provide you with stability, such as when you're going through a divorce or you've lost your job. Carefully weigh up your personal physical and emotional demands as compared to what energy you may have remaining to spend expend on others; be honest before overdoing things. You'll be a better volunteer if you take time out to strengthen yourself first.

, You must care about the volunteering that you take up; a reason such as ""my friend is doing it; so I should also,"" is unsound. By all means join with a friend if both of you truly are keen on the work involved, but if you only do it for your friend's sake, you may end up resenting the volunteer work and perhaps even your friend. Tell an over-enthusiastic friend that you support him or her, but that your volunteer efforts are being placed elsewhere.

, It is not unusual to be elected at a meeting which you do not attend, or to be pushed along by a crowd unwilling itself to take on a position that a club/school/organisation needs filled. If you are present at such a vote, vocalise strongly your refusal. State clearly that you are too busy, too unwell, too over-committed etc. to take on this position at this point in time. If it happens in your absence, send a gently worded letter refusing the position to the board, setting out brief reasons why you do not accept the nomination. Or simply say you do not accept. You must want to undertake the volunteer work, otherwise you may damage your self-esteem, time management and other commitments.

, Of course you want to support your local schools, or museum, or library. But it is one thing to be supplemented by volunteers and another if vital services are relying on unpaid labor. If you feel that an organisation, school or other place is asking too much of volunteers, speak up and say that this work ought to be performed by paid persons. Exercise your letter-writing or phoning skills and ask the school principal, the local municipality or your locally elected member why the funding is so low for certain activities and ask that paid employment be considered or additional financing provided to ease the pressure off of over-worked volunteers

In particular, stay at home parents are sometimes subjected to inordinate pressure to take on more volunteer work than they feel able to cope with. Being a full time stay at home mother or father is a real full time job. Sometimes this population is made to feel they ought to volunteer because they are not working outside the home--as if that means they are like retirees or unemployed--rather than honor this very difficult albeit unpaid job.







, If you really want to volunteer but you can't, think of other ways to help out. If you have money but no time, donate the money. If you have no money, but have the time, donate your time. If you have neither, donate your messages of goodwill and support. Be creative. Even writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper to tell of the good deeds being done by others is a great volunteer exercise, often overlooked by many. Thoughtfulness, praise and encouragement for those who are volunteering is the most important contribution of all.

, If you feel unsafe, consult the person in charge and let them know. For example if you are asked to venture into an unfamiliar part of town, late at night and alone, ask to have someone go with you. If you are on a building site without a helmet or gloves, ask for safety equipment. Trust your instincts. If you are denied any of the safety precautions you requested, you are within your rights to leave.

, There are many other worthy organizations out there that do not charge, and will provide more hours for less effort.

, Helping out others should never be at the expense of your own financial independence. Volunteer work is often more rewarding and more flexible than a typical job, and it can be tempting to want to volunteer rather than work in a paid position. Unfortunately, this can lead to a situation in which a person is not building a career and may be living off family rather than building an independent life.


Volunteer work can help lead to paid work through resume and network building. It should not prevent you from taking a paid position.
There are opportunities for careers in charity work, which can be a fulfilling opportunity to have meaningful work while making a wage. Although the nonprofit sector typically does not pay as much as others, it is entirely possible to make a living this way.
Some disabilities can make typical jobs difficult or impossible to perform, but not work on a volunteer basis. For example, a man with panic disorder may not be able to work yet, but is able to help do some website work for a local food shelf.

Meet people.,
Do some research to identify the needs of your community.,
Learn about organizations.,
Identify ways you would like to help.",How to Help Your Community2," Knowing people in your community is a great way to start learning what you can do to help. In order to get to know a community even better, start building your network by getting out and meeting people. Go to local events, frequent local coffee shops, and get to know your neighbors. The more people you know in your community, the better.


To break the ice with your neighbors, bake some muffins or cookies and wrap them up. Then take them door to door and introduce yourself. This will make it easier to strike up a conversation with a neighbor or invite them to your home for dinner.

, Before you can help your community, you should take time to do a bit of research and find out what the community needs. This step is especially important if you are new to the community or if you have not been very involved in the past. Maybe there's a river flowing through your city that's so polluted no one can swim there. Maybe the schools in your community need more resources to buy books and computer equipment. Maybe the homeless population in your community needs assistance. Whatever it is, figure out what needs to be addressed where you live.


Use the internet to run some basic searches to find out what your community needs. Try pairing the name of your city with key terms like “community needs,” “volunteer opportunities,” and “problems.” Try other keyword searches to find out more.
Read the local newspaper every day. The local newspaper will help you to get to know the community and learn what people are doing to address problems.
Talk to people who have lived in the community for a long time. Ask questions, such as, “What is the biggest problem facing this community? How are people addressing that problem?”Try not to get overwhelmed by the size and scope of the problems your community is facing. Pick one thing that you care about changing, one thing that ignites your passion, and go from there.
See if anyone else feels the same way you do. Is there an organization addressing this need? Do you know anyone who's as passionate as you are about creating change?

, Find out as much as you can about local non-profit organizations and charities. Visit their webpages and find out what they do, who they serve, why they do it, how they are funded, and what types of volunteer opportunities they have available. Keep track of organizations that you’d like to get involved with at some point. Websites like Idealist, Volunteer Match, and Serve.gov can also help you to find out about organizations that are looking for volunteers.

, Once you have taken time to learn about your community, start identifying ways that you can help. Think back to what you have learned about the community, your interactions with people, and the needs organizations in the community. Male sure to ask yourself some questions before you get started.


What community issue are you the most passionate about?
What can you do to help that will best use your talents?
What sort of time commitment are you able and willing to make?
What do you need to do in order to start helping?

"
"
Choose a way to help out.,
Set some reachable goals.,
Outline a plan for getting things done.,
Get other people involved.,
Commit to following through.",How to Help Your Community3," Once you've identified the problem you want to solve, figure out how you personally can start working to fix it. Even if you do not believe that one person can change the world, you should realize that one person can make a difference—one step at a time. How are you going to make a difference?


Find the place where your passions and skills intersect. For example, let's say your city has too few trees and you want to help. You can use social media to spread awareness about the problem by sharing what you know with as many people as possible and encouraging people to plant more trees.

, The problem you've identified isn't likely to be solved easily; it'll probably require a lot of work; maybe years of work. It's even possible that after years of work, the problem still won't be entirely corrected. However, if you set manageable goals and start working toward them step-by-step, you'll eventually be able to look back and see the progress you've made.


Set short-term goals. You can define short-term in a way that makes sense and is motivating to you. What do you want to have accomplished in one week, one month, or a year?
Set long-term goals. In five years, what do you want your community to look like? What about ten? What seems doable in that amount of time?

, To accomplish your goals, you're going to need an action plan. And to execute an action plan, you'll probably need some help and funding. Write up a plan that details everything you're going to need to accomplish a given goal, including the following:



People - Include the skill-sets that will be involved, the hours of work that they'll need to put in, the minimum number of volunteers or spokespeople that will be necessary to accomplish your goals.

Resources - These might include such things as: buses to take people downtown for a river cleanup; garbage bags, shovels, protective gloves, and masks for the volunteers; pizza, sodas, and a salad to feed them at lunchtime. Think it through down to every last detail.

Money - Create a budget and detail how much it's going to cost to execute your plan.

, Ask around to find out who else is as excited to make a difference as you are. Try to form a core group of activists committed to carrying out the plan to improve your community. Everyone will have something to contribute, and together you'll be able to start getting things done. Even just telling other people about your goal and what you are doing to accomplish it can help you to achieve it.To find passionate volunteers and spread the word about what you're doing; share information via social media. Go public with your plan to make a difference, and tell people how they can get involved. Hold meetings to discuss how to put your plan into action.
Some people prefer to help by by donating money instead of their time. Don't be afraid to ask for donations or hold a fundraiser to make money you can put toward your cause.

, Now that you have goals and an action plan for meeting those goals, it's time to get organized and put in the real time and effort it takes to create change. If you back out now, your community might never see the solution of your dreams. It's not going to be easy to make things better, but every bit of effort you put into your project will make a difference.

"
"
Volunteer for a group that does work you admire.,
Attend community events.,
Get civically active.,
Beautify your public spaces.",How to Help Your Community4," Every nonprofit or community organization in your area is probably in need of volunteers.Donating your time is an excellent way to have a positive effect on your community, and to strengthen your relationships with your fellow community members, too. Find a group doing work that interests you and give them a call; chances are, they'll have a list of ways you can start helping out right away. Just be aware that becoming a volunteer is a serious commitment. It costs organizations a lot of time and money to train volunteers, so make sure that you will be available and willing to help out on a long-term basis. Here are a few examples of volunteer opportunities available in most communities:


Helping out at park, river or beach clean-up days
Answering phones at phone-a-thons to raise money
Playing with cats and dogs at the animal shelter
Serving meals at the soup kitchen or homeless shelter
Working at a crisis hotline
Being a counselor at a camp for kids

, It's likely that other people and organizations in your community are also taking steps to help improve it. They probably hold festivals, cleanups and meetings in an effort to make the neighborhood a better place. How often do you show up to community events? Start going to as many as you can. Just showing up is a way to help people in your community because it lets them know that you care. When you feel comfortable enough, you can even start volunteering to help out at these events.


For example, if someone you know is trying to hold a ""Bike to Work or School Day"" on Monday mornings, and you've got a bike, why not give it a try? Bring a friend along, too. Show people in your community that biking is fun.
Participate in fundraising walks and runs. Many nonprofits hold community walks and runs to raise money. Paying the entry fee directly benefits the nonprofit, and participating in the event helps spread awareness about the cause.
Go to concerts, festivals and other events put on by local businesses or organizations. If no one shows up to these types of events, they might stop happening altogether.

, A great way to help your community is to participate in community decision-making. Stay up to date on activities that impact your community, and form educated opinions on important matters. For example, if your city is deciding whether to cut down a few acres of forest to allow a supermarket to move in, read up on the subject and decide what you think. Would it be better to keep the forest there, or does your community really need a new supermarket? Having an informed perspective and making your voice heard can have an effect on what direction your community takes. Encourage others to engage as well because civic engagement is crucial for a healthy democracy.Voting is an important way to influence your community. Read up on the candidates and issues and vote in all local elections.
Contact your representative about issues that matter to you. If you don't want that patch of forest to be cut down, or you think it a new supermarket could really help the community, call your representative or write a letter stating what you want to happen and why.
Show up for community meetings at which decisions are being made. Take the opportunity to speak up about what matters to you. Would your community benefit from having more crosswalks on busier streets? Are there too many potholes on your block? Do you have an opinion on how the city should handle increasing levels of crime? Say so.

, If you look around and see trash in the street and graffiti on the windows in your neighborhood, you know where to start helping out. Making the spaces in your community feel brighter and cleaner will bring people out and result in better quality of life for everyone. The work you do will depend on the specific needs in your community.


You can help to make your neighborhood more beautiful right away by picking up trash on your own. When you walk down the street, pick up trash you see and throw it away or recycle it. If there's too much for you to tackle on your own, get some friends involved to help you.
Scrape off or paint over graffiti to freshen up buildings and fences. If you're good at painting, you could eve create a mural on a public wall for everyone to see. You might have to get permission from the building owner or city first.
Do landscaping in areas that are overgrown with weeds. Mow them down or pull weeds by hand. Plant flowers or trees wherever you can. Adding more natural elements to urban spaces can help make them look and feel safe and inviting.Create a community garden, where everyone can have a plot on which to grow vegetables, herbs or flowers. Ask people to pitch in to help break ground and lend their tools for the project.
Always make sure to check with the owner of a piece of property before you do anything to it.

Donate money.,
Donate items.,
Provide food.,
Donate recreational items.,
Volunteer your time.",How to Help the Homeless1," The easiest way to help the homeless is to donate your money to a nonprofit whose mission is to serve the homeless. This ensures that social workers and professionals who best understand how to help the homeless will have the resources necessary to do their important work.Consider leaving a donation to an organization that supports the homeless in your will.You can also donate to local churches, temples, mosques, and other religious institutions that offer help to the homeless.;
, Donating your used or new items is another easy way to help. Donate these items to local organizations that house the homeless or otherwise support them. Alternately, you could provide such things to your local homeless population directly. The best items to donate include:Winter weather clothing (such as hats, mittens, coats, and boots)
New underwear and socks
Travel-sized hygiene items (toothpaste, soap, etc.)Professional clothing (a hurdle to overcoming homelessness is looking presentable at job interviews)
First aid items (such as Neosporin, Band-Aids, antibacterial cream, and hand sanitizer)
Secondary medical items (such as sunscreen, heavy duty lotions like Bag Balm, allergy medication, and tissues)
Bus passes (great for helping them get to job interviews)
Linens (i.e. twin sheets, towels, pillows and pillow cases)

, One of the constant struggles of homelessness is finding enough to eat. Donate canned or boxed goods to your local soup kitchen or homeless shelter.Before making your donation, contact the homeless organization and find out which items they need most.
Alternately, you could buy (or make) lunch for a homeless person you encounter on the street., In addition to practical items like clothes and hygiene products, you might want to provide toys for the children of homeless families. Homeless children often have few possessions of any kind, and may not have any toys at all. For adults, you might want to donate books, magazines, or other reading materials.Donating toys is an especially good idea around the holidays, when homeless kids often have few gifts to look forward to.

, If you cannot donate money or goods, sign up to work with a homeless organization. The sort of volunteer opportunities available to you will vary depending on the organization you contact and the organization’s needs. You might be able to:Pack boxes with foods for distribution to homeless people
Serve hot food at a soup kitchen
Help homeless people transition to working a job and paying bills
Train homeless people in a skill like gardening or playing an instrument
Use your skill set to assist the homeless in other ways (for instance, by giving homeless people free haircuts or tutoring homeless kids)

When you're well educated, you can get better jobs and contribute more to the economy. You can also be better informed and make good decisions when it comes to voting and other civic activities. Pay attention in school, get good grades, and try to go to college.;
, No matter what job you have, working hard is an important part of being a good citizen. When you work hard, you provide services to others and you earn money, both of which contribute to a stronger economy in your area.


If you find yourself unemployed, seek out your local unemployment office for help in finding a new job. Googling ""unemployment office"" and the same of your state should bring up the information, if you don't know it.

, Read the news and stay fully informed on issues that affect you, your area, and the rest of the country. And the word ""fully"" is key here: listen to what people say on both sides of the party line and try to stay impartial. Most issues are very complex and go beyond the basic black and white of party politics.


Get involved in planning processes too. Have your say in whether new supermarkets, box stores and housing estates have their place in your corner of the world. Find out what environment, social and health benefits these projects promise for the local community (beyond the profit motives) and speak with your representative and at city council meetings to let them know what you think.

, When you do well enough that you have extra time, money, or items, give back to your community by paying that good fortune forward. There are lots of great ways that you can help your community:


Volunteer. You can volunteer with local branches of organizations that mean a lot to you. Try Habitat for Humanity, which build homes for the less fortunate, or Big Brothers Big Sisters, which provides mentorship to at-risk youth.

Help the homeless. You can volunteer at a local soup kitchen or shelter to help homeless people stay safe and healthy.
Donate. You can donate your money to lots of organizations, local, national, and international. Just be sure that whoever you donate to is a good organization that uses their money well. Many charities do not and are really just a money factory for the people that run them. Try using Charity Navigator or the BBB to find out if the organization you want to help is really on the up and up.

, Blood and plasma are vital bodily fluids that are used to save the lives of thousands and thousands of people each day. There are often shortages, so it's great if you do your part and donate. If you have a rare blood type, you can literally be the difference between life and death for someone in your community.


Donating blood and plasma is especially important when there's been a major crisis. Massive numbers of injuries often result in serious blood shortages.

, Get trained in CPR and First Aid, as well as other emergency training like disaster preparedness training, so that you can help your fellow citizens when an emergency arises. If you've had this training before, it's a good idea to do it again every few years. This helps you too keep those skills fresh. It's easy to forget them when you're under pressure!

, Create the opportunity to work whenever you can. Hire and fairly pay someone to cut your lawn or paint your house. Hire a maid every few months. This contributes to the economy and gives a job to someone who is often very much in need.


Contact your local homeless shelter about finding workers there. Oftentimes, homeless people are simply regular folks who ran on hard times and the small amount of money they earn from your job can be enough to help them get back on their feet.

, It's important to take care of your body and stay as healthy as possible. When you get sick, you put others at risk and you take up valuable space in doctor's offices and hospitals that could go towards someone else. Exercise, eat right, and make sure you stay current on all your shots.


If you need help with exercise or eating healthy, wikiHow can help.
With many vaccine-preventable childhood diseases on the rise, it may be a good idea to update yours. You aren't yourself at risk, as an adult, but the unvaccinated children around you are.

, The most important thing you can do as a citizen is vote. It's easy to forget or feel disinterested and only vote during the really major elections, but it's very important to vote in every election you can. Running the country goes beyond which party is currently in power. You also need to vote for your direct representatives, who often play a much more major role in what changes happen in the country.


It's also important to vote in local elections. At the state and county level, you'll often vote on things like transportation initiatives, which can affect how people get to work, and other important laws and measures that affect your area.

, Jury duty is no fun, but it's vital to maintain a functional judicial system (at least in the US). When good people like yourself pass on jury duty, it often leaves a lot of people who do jury duty for the wrong reasons or who really won't care or and pay attention. When your number is up, take on the challenge and serve your country in your own way.

, When there are issues that matter to you, it's very important to contact your representative and tell them what you think. Even if you're too young to vote or you didn't vote for them, they still represent you and it's important for them to stay in touch with what people really believe.


If you don't know how to contact your representative or who your representative is, you can go to the official website here to find out.

, When elections do happen, extra help is often needed to make sure that everyone's vote gets counted. You can volunteer with the elections office or your preferred party and help man voting stations, count votes, and fill other support roles.

, Help others to also get civically engaged by volunteering with your preferred political party or elections office to help get people registered to vote, recruit people to gather petitions, and do other civic activities. Encourage you friends and family members to join you in these activities or go door to door with an organization to recruit strangers.

, Recycle papers and plastics according to your city's recycling system. The recycling is often collected with the garbage, but in a separate container. You can find recyclable items by looking for the recycle symbol used by your country. Generally, most items made from paper and plastic can be recycled, so long as they don't contain food and are not covered in wax.


Recycling helps cut down on waste that fills up landfills.

, Compost leftover food and organic material to help keep down waste even further. Some cities collect compost, but otherwise you'll need to compost it yourself in your back yard.


Items you can compost include leftover food, extra pieces of ingredients (like the leaves from carrots), and unbleached paper.
Compost by collecting all of these items together in a large box outside. Turn the mixture every few weeks and add soil, until the whole thing looks like a single mixture. This can often take months.
When the compost is done, it can be sold or it can be used to provide nutrients to your own yard or garden.

, If you see trash lying around don't just stare at it and walk pass it. Try to make time once a month to go around your neighborhood and pick up all of the trash that you see. Just be sure to use a grabbing stick or gardening gloves, to prevent hurting yourself on something dangerous.


You can also join city-wide groups that go around the city and pick up litter in the most affected areas. Contact your city hall to locate a group for your city.

, The soaps used for washing cars are very destructive to the environment (often contaminating your drinking water!), so start by washing your car less often and washing your car yourself. When you do wash your car, use environmentally friendly products.


At a minimum, move your car onto grass in order to wash it. This will help keep the chemicals out of your drinking water.
Try to go waterless and simply clean your car with a green window or all-purpose cleaner.

, Buy your food from local farmers and food producers as much as possible. This will minimize the environmental impact of having to transport the food a long way, it helps ensure that your food is safe and free of dangerous chemicals or pests, and it contributes to your local economy.


Food is often labeled with where it was produced. Look for products that are organic and as close to where you live as possible.

, There is likely to be a significant water crisis in our lifetime, so conserve as much clean water as you can. While our planet is covered in water, only so much of it is drinkable and we use a lot of that for unnecessary things, like watering grass and taking extra long showers.


If you want to water your lawn, use gray water (which is the water left over from preparing food or taking a shower).
Take showers that last 10 minutes or less and wash your hair only every other day.
Avoid having things like swimming pools, which take lots of water out of the system and make it undrinkable.

, Currently, many of the methods used to create energy to power our homes and devices are also very destructive to the environment. Try to use clean energy, by setting up solar panels, and conserve the energy you do use.


Turn off lights in empty rooms.
Spend less time on the computer and more time reading books.

, Skip on driving a car and instead take a bus. Not only will you help save the planet from the ravages of pollution, you'll also be helping to financially support public transit, which is vital to low-income households (who often don't own cars).

Educate others about homelessness.,
Encourage local publications to publish information about homeless shelters.,
Write letters to the editor.,
Start a blog about homelessness.,
Organize a clothing or food drive.",How to Help the Homeless2," Many people have trouble sympathizing with homeless people because of the many negative stereotypes that the homeless population is burdened with. Educating others could be as simple as correcting a friend or coworker about a homeless stereotype they express, or it could be talking with your local city or county politicians about the problems homeless people face.If you have children, start by educating them. If you volunteer for an organization that supports the homeless, ask if you can take your child along so that they can see firsthand the hardships of homelessness.

, Many people are unaware that there are homeless shelters in their communities. Contact your local newspaper, religious institution, and the editors of local civic group newsletters and ask them if they would consider running a weekly or monthly listing of local services available to the homeless. That way, more people will know about and utilize these services., Writing letters to the editor of your local paper can help promote greater awareness and understanding of homelessness in your area. You could also write to editors of national papers or publications. Share some information about the number of homeless people in your area (or country, if you’re writing to a national publication). Explain the different reasons why people become homeless. End by suggesting ways that people in your region or nation could help the homeless., Instead of (or in addition to) writing to established publications about homelessness, start a blog of your own to create awareness. Blogs are a great platform for you to share your understanding of homelessness and encourage people to help. Promote your blog via social media and encourage others to provide feedback.Incorporate video and photos on your blog as well as text.

, One of the best ways to help the homeless and create awareness about homelessness in your community is to organize a collection for food and/or clothes. Talk to local businesses, schools and colleges, and religious institutions about leaving a bin or large box in or near their foyer. Place a large sign on the bin identifying the purpose of the drive and list the items that are most needed.Advertise the food or clothing drive by putting up flyers around town and by asking your local newspaper to place a notice about the drive in upcoming editions.
Restaurants are good places to host food or clothing drive bins, since they generate a lot of foot traffic. People will remember to bring along some canned or boxed food next time they visit.
If you’re organizing the drive on behalf of or in conjunction with a particular nonprofit that supports the homeless population, ask them ahead of time what sort of foods or clothing items you should encourage people to donate. Include this information on the sign you attach to your bins or boxes.

Support day shelters.,
Support libraries.,
Oppose laws making homelessness a crime.",How to Help the Homeless3," Mental health problems can be both a cause and an effect of homelessness. One of the best ways to make a difference for homeless people is to encourage and support access to free or low-cost mental health services. Support local mental health clinics and write to politicians about their importance., Another problem that exacerbates homelessness in many cities is the lack of affordable housing. Support ballot initiatives for affordable housing and write to local housing organizations to help them understand the need. Speak out against new housing developments which are not affordable., Basic medical care is also a huge problem for homeless people. They are more prone to serious health problems but are stuck in a position where they cannot afford help. Support local free or low-cost clinics, and work on getting more free clinics in your city., Day shelters are another service which can help homeless people get back on their feet. These shelters give homeless people a safe place to stay and store their things. Day shelters are uncommon, so if your city doesn't have one, talk to your local city councilors or mayor about establishing one., Local libraries are a huge resource for homeless people. They make job searching tools, such as the internet, free and available for the homeless. They are also a source of important information, and often host programs that can help people learn the skills necessary to get a job., In many places, being homeless can get you arrested. When homeless people are arrested, it makes it even harder for them to get back on their feet. To help the homeless, vote against measures that criminalize homelessness, and against politicians that support such measures."

Give your recyclables to homeless people.,
Support economic initiatives that help the homeless.,
Direct homeless people to services that could help.,
Contact an organization that helps homeless people.,
Call emergency services.",How to Help the Homeless4," If you're in a position where you can give a homeless person a job, do it! Whether it's offering to hire and train someone in a position like a secretary or file clerk, or just letting them do odd jobs like mowing your lawn, this can really make a huge difference for a homeless person.Be sure, however, that you don't take advantage of them. Pay homeless people a reasonable and fair amount of money.

, Many homeless people rely on the small return they get on bottles and cans from recycling centers to purchase food or other necessities. If you live in an area that supports this sort of recycling program, pile all your cans and bottles in a bag. Ask local homeless individuals if they would be interested in taking your recyclables., In some areas, homeless people are paid to sell a newspaper that advocates for the homeless. In other areas, businesses might partner with nonprofits in order to employ the homeless. Support these businesses and buy the products or services offered by the homeless population., Some people may not know how to locate help and therefore never get any. If you see a homeless person, you could ask them if they need help. If they say they do, ask them if they’ve been to the local homeless shelter. If they have not and are interested in going, provide them with directions.Many homeless organizations have printable maps or resource lists that you could print and give to the homeless person in question.
Showing that you care in this way is a great way to help homeless people feel that they matter.

, If you see homeless people on the streets and don’t want to approach them yourself, call a local nonprofit that helps the homeless. They might be able to send someone out to talk to the homeless person in question and help them along the process of getting back on their feet.Be sure to relay information about the person’s exact location, their manner of dress, and their appearance.

, If you don’t feel comfortable approaching the homeless individual and cannot get through to your local nonprofit that serves the homeless population, contact emergency services. They will send an outreach team to help the person and find out more about their condition. Additionally, call emergency services if you see a homeless person who is:Having a psychotic episode
A danger to themselves or others
Intoxicated
In danger because of weather conditions

By improving your understanding of homelessness, you’ll be able to identify more ways to help the homeless and educate others about the problem. You could also watch documentary films about homelessness or attend lectures on the topic., Many people carry around certain preconceived notions about what homeless people are like and why they are homeless. For instance, some people think the homeless are only on the streets because of their own poor choices. In fact, this is often untrue. Look for stereotypes in the thinking of others, and gently correct them when you hear uninformed statements about the homeless.Continually evaluate your own ideas about homelessness and keep an open mind.

, Homeless people deserve the same level of courtesy and consideration as anyone else. Treat them with the same level of kindness that you afford your friends and coworkers., The homeless often feel invisible, which can hurt their self-confidence and general attitude. Smile at homeless people when you pass them and speak to them with kindness if you have the opportunity. Simply smiling at someone or saying hello can often make their day."

Food
School tuition and fees
Medical care
Books and toys
Clothes
Clean water
Shelter
Supporting an orphanage

, There are many different children’s charities. Some are focused towards a specific cause, such as education or healthcare. Others are for the general welfare of children. Before you donate money to a charity, research the charity to make sure that they provide the majority of their funds to their cause. Check Charity Navigator to see if they have at least a three star rating.Some reputable charities include:


UNICEFChildren in NeedSt. Jude’s Children’s Research HospitalChildren’s Miracle NetworkYouth Law CenterReach Out and Read, While you can give out of your own pocket, you might also want to encourage other people to donate as well. Advertise your charity of choice to friends and family. Encourage others to chip in so that your money can have a larger impact. You might consider publicizing your cause through:


Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram
Blogs
Video appeals
Your personal website

, One great way to raise money for children is to sell something and give the proceeds to charity. You can set up a stall in front of your house, at a school, or during a farmer's market. Advertise your sale as a charity benefit. You may find that strangers are willing to buy things just to help out a good cause. Some different types of sales include:


Yard sale
Hand-crafted goods such as bracelets or scarves
Bake sale
Lemonade stand

, Crowdfunding platforms allow you to set up a special page to raise money for a nonprofit of your choice. These webpages can attract many small donations from a large pool of people. There are many crowdfunding websites that specialize in fundraising for charities. You might consider using:

Become a mentor.,
Apply to be a court-appointed special advocate (CASA).,
Consider fostering a child.,
Start your own non-profit.",How to Help  Poor Children to Have a Better Future3," There are several organizations that help needy children connect with stable adults who can guide them through school and life. These programs offer at-risk youth a vital support system. Kids who have a mentor are more likely to graduate high school and less likely to abuse drugs or alcohol.Some mentoring programs include:


Big Brothers Big Sisters of AmericaChildren’s Aid SocietyStand Up For KidsYour local department of child services may also have a mentoring program.

, Children in foster care often do not have legal guardians who can represent them. A court-appointed special advocate is a representative who looks out for the best interests of a child in court. While they are not an attorney, they do represent foster children in court instead of a parent or legal guardian. CASAs often form personal bonds with their children, thus ensuring that they are protecting the rights and needs of the child.You can locate a CASA program near you on the CASA for Children website.You will have to undergo a thirty-hour training program before you will be assigned a case.

, If you have the space and finances to take in a child, you can foster a child. Foster care is intended to provide a temporary, stable home for a child who has been removed from their parents.The process for fostering takes months, but a dedicated foster parent can change the life of a disadvantaged child by providing support, stability, and consistency during a tumultuous time in their life.


In the US, you will have to apply to be a foster parent at your state Department of Child Services or Department of Social Services. You will have to complete training and pass both a home inspection and a background check.In the UK, you can contact your local council for more information or find a nearby fostering agency. You will have to pass a Discourse and Barring Service Check as well as a health exam. You may have to go through training.In Australia, you will have to submit both an Expression of Interest Form and an application to your state Department for Child Protection and Family Support. You will have to pass a background check and a training session.In Canada, you should check with your provincial government to determine the proper procedure for fostering. You may be asked to complete a background check, medical examination, and home interview., If you are passionate and dedicated to helping disadvantaged children, you may want to consider starting your own non-profit charity. Starting a charity requires extensive work, including special tax preparation, fundraising, resource management, and organizational structure. Before deciding if this is the right move for you, you should ask yourself:


What kinds of services might this charity provide to my local area?
Is there any other charity in my area that offers the same or similar services? If there is, you may just want to volunteer for that charity instead.
How will the charity fund itself?
Who will be needed to help run the charity? Think about other managers, fundraisers, accountants, tax lawyers, and volunteers.

Ask pro-abortion activists if they are in favor of killing already born babies and children, just because the mother considers them a burden and want to get rid of them.,
Mention that we are either persons or properties.,
Provide more facts on human development.,
Remind them that the unborn baby have feelings of his own and can respond to his environment.",How to Defend Pro Life Beliefs1," If they say no, then ask why they feel any differently for an unborn child. (If they said yes, continue to ask probing questions to see if they actually have a middle ground in which they consider killing another person to be unethical.) After all, in both cases, we have a living human being who is dependent on the mother for sustenance. If they start making an argument about how ""nobody know exactly when life begins"", or how the entity in the womb is not yet a ""person"", make your case as follows:


Ask them at what moment they consider a human life begins. At the moment when a human sperm penetrates a human ovum, a new entity called the ""Zygote"" comes into existence. The zygote is the first cell formed at conception, the earliest developmental stage of the human embryo, followed by the ""Morula"" and ""Blastocyst"" stages.The new human zygote has a genetic composition that is absolutely unique, distinct from any other human ever existed, including that of its mother (thereby refuting the claim that what is involved in abortion is merely ""a woman and her body"").Explain that earliest human embryo is biologically alive. It fulfills the four criteria needed to establish biological life: metabolism, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction.Is the embryo a human organism or human being? Remind them the scientific definition of an ""organism"": a complex structure of interdependent elements constituted to carry on the activities of life by separately-functioning but mutually dependant organs.The zygote easily meets this definition. It acts immediately and decisively to initiate a developmental program that will, barring accident, disease, or external intervention, proceed seamlessly through formation of the definitive body, birth, childhood, adolescence, maturity, and aging, ending with death. This coordinated behavior is the very hallmark of an organism.By stark contrast, a mere collection of human cells may carry on the activities of cellular life, but it will not exhibit coordinated interactions directed towards a higher level of organization.;
, Ask them if they don't consider the unborn baby to be a human being, would they consider them a mere piece of property?

, Sometimes, a quick recitations of the facts of human development will weaken the ""not yet a person"" mentality.


The cardiovascular system is the first major system to function. At about 22 days after conception, the child's heart begins to circulate his own blood, distinct from that of his mother's, and his heartbeat can be detected on ultrasound.At just six weeks, the child's eyes and eye lids, nose, mouth, and tongue have formed.
Electrical brain activity can be detected at six or seven weeks,and by the end of the eighth week, the child, now known as a ""fetus,"" has developed all organs and bodily structures.By ten weeks after conception, the child can make bodily movements.

, An unborn child may move away from the instrument that is going to end its life in an abortion. By twenty weeks of gestation, a baby will react physically to outside stimuli such as sound, light and touch.


“At 20 weeks, the fetal brain has the full complement of brain cells present in adulthood, ready and waiting to receive pain signals from the body, and their electrical activity can be recorded by standard electroencephalography (EEG).” - Dr. Paul Ranalli, neurologist, University of Toronto
An unborn baby at 20 weeks gestation “is fully capable of experiencing pain. … Without question, is a dreadfully painful experience for any infant subjected to such a surgical procedure.” - Robert J. White, M.D., PhD., professor of neurosurgery, Case Western University

",How to Contact Government Officials1,"


Contact federal officials such as your United States Senator or member of Congress if you have an opinion on a national issue, such as Social Security, Medicare or defense.
Get in touch with state and local officials for questions or problems specific to your region, or to share concerns about the local legislation. Most states have an assembly or a legislature as well as a state senate. You can also appeal directly to the governor, mayor, and city or town council.

, For example, if you are a farmer with an interest in promoting your organic farm, contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture rather than the president or your senator.

, This can be found online, by searching sites such as USA.gov and Congress.org, in your local printed directories and in government buildings such as post offices and libraries.

, Your U.S. Senator and member of Congress will have a local office as well as an office address in Washington, D.C.

,


Be sure to sign your name and include your contact information. The government official you are contacting might need to get in touch with you for more information or to offer you assistance.
Keep your letter brief, on point and professional. Rambling letters that go on for pages and pages are less likely to be taken seriously than succinct, well-written correspondence.

Explain what ""Roe v. Wade"" really meant.",How to Defend Pro Life Beliefs2," Most people do not actually know what the Supreme Court decided on January 22, 1973. They assume that the Court legalized abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy only, and that it is subject to the limits and regulations today. You will be able to change minds when you inform them that neither of these assumptions is true.


The Court ruled that abortion must be permitted for any reason a woman chooses until the child becomes viable; after viability, an abortion must still be permitted if an abortion doctor deems the abortion necessary to protect a woman's ""health,""Essentially, Roe created an absolute right to abortion under which any abortion can be justified. Cite statistics to show that only a minority of Americans agree with Roe:

61% of Americans say abortion should be illegal after the fetal heartbeat has begun,which occurs in the first month of pregnancy.
86% of Americans say abortion should be illegal after the first 6 months of pregnancy.Only 6% -17% of Americans believe abortion should be legal at any time, under all circumstances.The law clerk of Justice Blackmun, the Justice who authored the Roe v. Wade opinion, calls it ""one of the most intellectually suspect constitutional decisions of the modern era.""Even the extreme left justice Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been critical of Roe, saying that it ""ventured too far in the change it ordered and presented an incomplete justification for its action""and that the Roe decision was ""not the way courts generally work."""
"
If they argue that we ought to respect a woman's choice, point out that in many cases, abortion is far from a woman's choice.,
Explain why being pro-life is being a true feminist.",How to Defend Pro Life Beliefs3," The website www.afterabortion.com established by a woman who had five abortions provides a place for women to help each other cope with the aftermath of their abortions. The website has millions of posts, telling stories of how they were coerced into aborting their children by boyfriends, husbands, friends, and family. They describe how abortion was far from being a choice. They speak of overwhelming guilt, nightmares, excessive drinking, drug abuse, promiscuity, an inability to form or maintain relationships, difficulty bonding with later children, and other ways in which they are suffering. Ask them to visit this site and read their stories to know the real impact of abortion on women.

, Abortion advocates are threatened by the pro-life arguments of the organization Feminists for Life which says abortion is a reflection that society has failed to meet the needs of women.Pro-life feminists are destroying the old ""baby vs. woman"" dichotomy that has dominated the abortion debate for decades. Women and children are not natural enemies, of course; it was a perversion of feminism which brought about such a dichotomy in the first place.

Compare something you know for sure is a living thing to something you know is definitely not.,
Consider that everyone who ever walked the earth was able to live because their parents didn't have an abortion.,
Ask them to imagine for a minute that they are a fetus: Pretend you understand human speech and can hear your mother talking.,
If they try to argue that even if abortion was illegal, we could not prevent women from having abortions, remind them the exact same argument could be used to stop anything from becoming illegal.,
If they argue that a woman should be able to control her own body, explain that the fertilized egg is not her body, rather, it is, conceivably a separate human being.,
If they argue that abortions are mostly done for health reasons or in case of rape, remind them that only 7 percent of women report that their abortion was due to a health reason or a possible health problem with the baby, and less than half a percent report that their abortion was because they became pregnant as a result of rape, which means the vast majority, 93 percent, of abortions in America are purely elective -- done on healthy women to end the lives of healthy children.",How to Defend Pro Life Beliefs4," Take a snowball. If you roll it down a hill, it grows and develops. However, it isn't made of cells, can't reproduce, and can't respond to its environment. How about a leopard? It is made of cells, it grows and develops from a cub to an adult, it can make babies, and it responds to its environment. If they bring up a woman who is infertile, say that women as a species can reproduce, it's just that a deformity causes some women to be infertile.

, There are even some that have survived an abortion and are still living today. If you have an abortion, you may forever wonder who your baby might have grown up to be; you may have just deprived the world of a great artist, political leader, scientist, important military leader, violent criminal, etc. Everyone deserves a chance to make the world a better place.

, She wants to get an abortion. You want to say, ""Mommy, don't kill me,"" but she can't hear you. It may seem silly, but, you were a fetus a long time ago. And, whether or not you believe a fetus is a human being, you would not be here right now if your mother had an abortion. Or, maybe you would.

, To turn it around, if murder was legalized, more people would be like ""Oh then it must be okay to do it!"" Same for abortions, if it became illegal, people would think, ""It must be illegal for a reason."" Plenty of people get abortions without thinking it through thoroughly. Sadly, many just see it as a shortcut - they've never been told that it might possibly be wrong.

, After all, if it was part of her body, that would mean the mother has 2 hearts, 4 legs, 4 arms, and 2 heads for almost 9 months of her life!

Use your own reasons and arguments based on your own personal belief and experience.,
Refer to the fertilized egg as ""he"" or ""she"", not ""it."",
Where is the line?,
Continue to argue to a point, but know when to stop.,
Be respectful and professional.,
If you're talking to a woman who is asking you whether she should abort her baby, be very very comforting.",How to Defend Pro Life Beliefs5," These may be your strongest arguments. Nobody knows you better than you.

, Subtly refer to the fertilized egg as a human being, not a thing.

, When does a fertilized become ""human?"" Is it not the moment it is conceived? Does the baby suddenly snap from a funny-looking-fetus-thing to a human being at the second trimester? Show them 4D ultrasounds of babies during the allowed abortion time. It looks like, what? A baby?

, If you are unable to convince the other person, the two of you may have to simply agree to disagree.

, Don't say things such as ""I'm right and you're stupid."" You'll look immature and give a bad image for your cause. Especially if you're talking to a woman who is in the process of deciding.

, Even if you believe that it isn't her choice to make, bashing her will only make her resent you and your beliefs. But if she asks you for reasons why she shouldn't abort:


Discuss the reasons listed above.
If it's that she can't afford to care for the baby (which is usually the case), encourage her to have the baby and either put him or her up for adoption or drop him or her at a safe haven.
If it's that the baby is ill and might not make it anyway, remind her that he/she might not live if he/she is born, and will not live if aborted.
If the issue is that if she carries through with the pregnancy she has a risk of dying in the process: this is a very touchy subject and it's not so much a pro-life or pro-choice argument.

Expect the unexpected.",How to Plan a Town Hall Meeting on a Health Issue," The idea behind a planning committee is strength in numbers. There are few issues related to health care that aren’t of concern to more than one organization. You need to identify other organizations within the community concerned with your issue, convince important members of the benefits of a town hall, and recruit them onto your planning committee.For example, if your issue of concern was childhood nutrition, some community organizations concerned with that issue might be schools, pediatricians, food banks, churches, farmers, and day cares.
Self-promotion can be an extremely compelling motivator. Approach target organizations from a vantage point explaining how participating in the town hall could be of benefit to them specifically.;
, It’s much easier to get concerned about an issue that affects you directly. In order to make the subject matter of your town hall more immediate and compelling, emphasize the local impact of the issue rather than the national or global impact.For example, if your city or state has a high rate of HIV infection, or high rate of obesity, you should emphasize the problems your locality will face as a result rather than the problems that come from HIV diagnosis or obesity generally.
So you could say: “The City of Philadelphia will have to pay $3.5 billion more in healthcare costs over the next 15 years because of our high rate of obesity,” rather than “ Obesity leads to higher health care costs.”

, The objectives of your meeting will dictate the format, who you invite and how you will promote it. The term “town hall” only signifies a type of meeting where open question and answer from the public comprises the bulk of the meeting.The objectives of your meeting could be informational, advocacy for a certain position, or for giving feedback to political candidates. While political candidate and advocacy meetings probably attract the most attention, they aren’t necessarily what’s best for your issue. For example, if public opinion is against the policy objectives of your organization, an informational meeting could be a better strategy for changing opinions to suit your needs.

, The traditional format of a town hall is for a panel of three to five speakers plus a moderator to give short introductions detailing their backgrounds and positions. Then, a moderator opens up questions to the audience. While the audience may pose questions to a certain panelist, the moderator should act as a facilitator, and if they feel the program would be advanced by posing that same question to multiple panelists, they should. Other formats could include:A pure question and answer format. This can be good for a candidate’s forum.
An anonymous question format, where questions are submitted in advance, and the moderator chooses which questions to present to the panel. This format can be good for controversial subjects.

, The location of the meeting should be in a centralized, neutral, handicapped accessible location. Churches, libraries, government buildings and community centers are all good choices. Make sure it doesn’t conflict with another popular community event, and hold it at a time when many people will be able to attend—the weekend, or if during the week, in the evening.A good rule of thumb is to always pick a location that is a little too small. A crowded venue creates the impression of activity and popularity, which is always better than the alternative.
Make the event free or of nominal cost, but encourage the attendees to RSVP—a Facebook page, an email address, or a phone number to call are easy, low cost ways of doing so. Assume two-thirds of the “maybes” won’t show up.
Make sure you have an alternate meeting location just in case your scheduled venue falls through.

, The panelists are one of the most important factors contributing to a town hall’s success or failure. While it’s best to have notables on your panel, that isn’t always an option. The next best thing is to have panelists representing notable organizations and/or panelists with notable backgrounds—it gives the event more credibility.Look to elected officials, academics, church and community leaders, and treatment providers.
This is another area where a diverse planning committee can come in handy. The more far reaching the ties of the members of the planning community, the more likely you are to be able to tap a diverse and exciting panel of experts.
Don’t discount the personality factor when you’re inviting panelists. The panelists should be credible enough to get people to the town hall, but they should be exciting enough that people talk abut your town hall long after it’s over.

, Moderators are another important factor in the success of a town hall. The moderator has to have the respect of the panelists and the audience, along with the temperament to defuse tensions and pace the discussion.Think of a moderator like an MC—they should be charismatic, but not so charismatic they overshadow the panelists or dominate the discussion. Members of the media, retired judges and attorneys, and clergy can be good candidates.

, Make sure your panelists know about the format of the town hall, the other panelists, the expected turnout, and the subjects on the agenda. As long as they are willing, prepare them to speak with the media afterwards.It’s a good idea to have your panelists arrive forty-five minutes to an hour ahead of time so you can go over the format and subjects one last time.

, Certain key staff are going to necessary to ensure the meeting runs smoothly. You should have someone to talk with the media, seat the guests, and pass out materials like meeting agendas to the panelists and the guests.These are all fine jobs for volunteers.

, No matter what the size of your meeting, you’ll need some printed materials to pass out to guest, press, and the panelists. The type of meeting you’r e running will dictate the specific types of materials. For instance:If you’re running an informational meeting, it’s a good idea to print up handbills or brochures that will touch on some of the information that you’ll cover in the town hall. For example, if your issue is HIV in your community, then print out a handbill that goes over some important statistics about the impact of HIV locally.
A town hall with political candidates or officials might include information about the candidates’ or officials’ positions and parties as it relates to your health issue.

, The press is crucial to a successful town hall. Whether the town hall is focused on issue advocacy, dissemination of information, or a political forum, its notoriety will influence the success of those goals and your ability to put together town halls in the future.You’ll need to write press releases, identify the reporters that cover stories about health, community affairs, or politics, and reach out to them at regular intervals.
A press release is a simple document sent to media organizations that explains an event and why it is noteworthy. Press release are typically less than a page long.
News is about current events, so you need to make sure you stress to reporters why the town hall is an event to cover now and not later. For example—obesity is always a problem, but it only makes news when a study is released purporting to show another reason why it is bad.

, Members of your planning committee, panelists, and members of related organizations who aren’t a direct part of the town hall should all be cultivated to publicize the event.Don’t forget to utilize resources like college campuses, hospitals, and government agencies. Post flyers publicizing the event at those locations. They can be a great way to boost attendance.

, Don’t forget the extensive network of issue groups on Facebook and other social media outlets. Don’t just reach out to brick and mortar organizations with people on the payroll. Post to Facebook groups, blogs, and message boards of interested and related organizations.


Make sure your panelists and members are also promoting the event on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

, A press packet is distinguished from a press release in that it is a packet of materials given to reporters on the day of an event rather than an inducement to cover an event. It should include:The press release.
Biographies of the panelists and speakers.
Information about the subject matter, including relevant studies, statistics, and personal stories of affected individuals.

, Sometimes panelists don't show. Sometimes protesters flood the venue. A snowstorm might sweep into the area out of nowhere. As the event planner, you need to plan for these contingencies by booking alternate speakers or scheduling alternate dates.


If your town hall is swamped by protesters, a change in format might be appropriate. If the original format is open question and answer, get advance questions instead. If the protesters are outside, invite them in and change the format to advance question submissions.
Line up alternate speakers from your organization or participating organizations just in case a scheduled speaker doesn't show. If the town hall is a forum between political candidates, relentlessly emphasize it to the media--which will make them wish they had shown up.

Alert others of this marketing ploy; tobacco companies spend millions to put smoking in movies.,
Support recent local indoor smoking bans at restaurants and bars, if you are of age.,
Help smokers quit by giving them encouragement and telling them some gross fast facts they probably did not know about the health dangers of smoking.

,
Visit the schools and ask permission to post fliers on the bulletin boards to educate students of the dangers of smoking.",How to Take Action to Phase out Smoking in Society," Yes, in order for smokers to boycott, they must first quit. The tobacco companies will lose revenue if no one buys their products, thus taking away more and more of their power and advertising money. If you think ""this store already bought them"", if you buy cigarettes from them, they will run out faster and have to buy more cigarettes sooner, and you might look like an addict to them.;
, Write a petition to ban smoking in the workplace, or where food is being served, or in the parks, or wherever you feel smoking should be banned that it hasn't yet. Or for more taxes on cigarettes. Since 90% of smokers started before age 21, raising the legal age limit for purchasing cigarettes would make sure people are more mature before they can make the decision of whether to start smoking or not. Or, if your state has already made a lot of progress to stop smoking, petition to ban smoking in at least some parts on the streets and in public - completely taking away the risk of secondhand smoke, which kills 3,400 people a year from lung cancer, over 20,000 with heart disease and causes illness in many more. If smoking is banned in restaurants, for example, smokers will just sit outside on a bench, smoke, and usually litter their butts even if an ashtray is within arm's reach. Have friends or family sit outside libraries, or post offices, and have the petition signed by hundreds of people. Make sure that this put on the ballot of the next election.

, Even if they have the same amount of people as signers for a petition, protests can be more convincing.

, Create a blog, write to newspapers, talk to your local TV news stations. Dissuade others from patronizing movies that contain smoking of any kind. Send emails to each production company. Never buy movies containing smoking.

, Big Tobacco scares restaurant owners into thinking they will lose revenue if smoking is banned there, so that they are reluctant to ban it, but the tobacco industry only does it because they want their products to be able to be consumed anywhere. In fact, most profits actually go up once smoking is banned, and the place is healthier, so it would be hard to reverse the ban later. Go to the restaurant or bar, be a customer, and tell them you couldn't stand the smoke there before and wouldn't have been a customer now if smoking wasn't banned there.

,, Convince them to either not start smoking, or to quit if they already smoke. If you are really feeling brave, carry nicotine gum and hand it to every smoker you see. The vast majority of smokers want to quit, and they would be more than happy to try out nicotine gum that they got for free, what have they got to lose? Maybe hand them a few packs so they don't run out and start smoking again.

It is always good to understand the cause you represent deeply, as you may be asked about it.


Often, ribbons are worn in honor of someone you know. For instance, a relative that passed from a type of cancer.
Ribbons are also worn to demonstrate solidarity with a particular group, for instance Black Lives Matter or the LGBT community.;
, Single-color ribbons are simple enough, but ribbons with multiple colors or different designs can be more complicated. Often, a particular cause may have a specific ""official"" design, but you don't necessarily need to be bound by that.


You can customize a ribbon by writing the name of a person who is meaningful to you on the ribbon's tail, or trimming in their favorite color.
The ""Eye"" of the ribbon is also an area that people like to customize with designs or symbols.
If you want to follow a particular design exactly, you'll want to seek out the website representing the cause and find their exact specifications.

, For smaller ribbons, especially those that will be worn, you'll want to use ribbon or fabric as your material. These materials are generally soft, wearable, and tolerate stress and weather reasonably well.

, If you are making a larger ribbon to be displayed on a door or in a window, you may want to consider paper or card stock. Since the ribbon won't be worn and won't be moving much, paper and card stock are both cheaper and easier to make large ribbons out of.


Paper or card stock reasons are also easy to add additional colors to - just use a marker or paint.

, You'll need to decide how large you want your ribbon to be. Most simple awareness ribbons that people wear are 1/4"" thick.Depending on your method and material, this make take some trial and error.


When using ribbon or fabric and folding it into your shape, you'll want to cut a band between 2.5x and 3x the total length of the completed ribbon.

, You may want to make sure you cut your desired lines by using a straightedge or ruler and tracing along your cut.


Try to make sure that the angles of your cut match each other on each end of the ribbon.

, You'll need to fold your ribbon. Fold one half over the other half and leave an ""eye"" in the middle to form the classic ribbon shape. When complete it will look like a ""Figure 8"" with one end open.


You can use a tiny bit of craft glue or tape between the two halves to stick them together and preserve the shape.You can also use needle and thread, but this is more complicated and is best done by those with practice!, You can personalize your ribbon or follow more complicated designs by adding other types of fabric, tassels, sequins, and a number of other decorations.You can also use markers or paint, especially on paper and card stock ribbons.

, You'll need to decide how large you want your ribbon to be. Most simple awareness ribbons that people wear are 1/4"" thick.Usually you will want ribbons that are placed on doors or windows to be larger though. Depending on your method and material, sizing make take some trial and error.


When making a paper or card stock ribbon size it by simply tracing the ribbon shape onto your material. You will cut this out later.

, You may want to make sure you cut your desired lines by using a straightedge or ruler and tracing along your cut.


When cutting the pre-traced ribbon shape out of your material, be especially careful along edges with corners.
When complete, it should look like a ""Figure 8"" with one end open.

, You can personalize your ribbon or follow more complicated designs by adding other types of fabric, tassels, sequins, and a number of other decorations.You can also use markers or paint, especially on paper and card stock ribbons.


You can write a name on the tail of a ribbon, decorate it with a trim of a favorite color, or even add a symbol or design to the eye of the ribbon.

, Good types of pins to use include safety pins, clothespins and the pins used to for flowers and boutonnieres. Run the pin through the center of the ribbon and the item of clothing it will be attached to as you would if you were pinning a boutonniere.Be careful not to prick yourself or anyone else with the pin!

, Double sided tape is very useful for this, but you can also fold single layered tape into a loop around itself to have it serve as double sided tape.


Don't use glue to mount a pin to a non-disposable background.

, Now that you have made your ribbon you can display it with pride. Draw attention to the cause you are representing and get ready to tell everyone else about it!

Employment discrimination. This is a common form of civil rights lawsuit. Federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, disability, genetic information, sex (including pregnancy), religion, race, national origin, and color. It also prohibits harassment on the basis of these protected categories.Before filing a lawsuit, you must report the discrimination to a government agency.Housing discrimination. Federal law also prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, disability, familial status, race, color, and national origin.Police misconduct. The police violate your constitutional rights when they use more force than necessary to arrest or detain you. If so, you can bring a “section 1983” claim for the violation.Many civil rights attorneys handle these cases.;
, Even before finding a lawyer, you should begin to pull together all of the evidence you have that relates to the civil rights violation. One of the first things you can do is sit down and write out your memories of the event.Try to remember all important details, including who said what, or what actions people took. Also be honest and record what you said or did.
Date and sign your statement. This will help make the statement more authentic.

, You should also try to get the names and contact information for anyone who witnessed the discrimination.Witnesses are a key part of any lawsuit and you want to identify the witnesses as soon as possible.


If you were discriminated against in employment or housing, then write down the name of all people you were in contact with at the leasing office or the employer’s.
If you were the victim of police misconduct, then try to catch the names of the officers as well as bystanders. If you are being restrained, then have someone with you try to collect this information.

, Save any document related to your civil rights claim. These documents can include emails, letters, memos, and police reports. An attorney will want to see them when you meet for a consultation.


If you have a lot of documents, then it might be helpful to create a binder in which you can store witness statements, communications, and official reports. Organize the binder in a meaningful way and take it with you when you meet with a lawyer.

, Generally, you can bring a lawsuit in the county where the discrimination occurred or where the defendant lives or does business.It is often easier to hire an attorney who is based near the county where the incident happened, so keep this in mind as you search for a civil rights attorney.


If you were assaulted by police while visiting relatives in another state, then you will need to hire an attorney who works in that state. You cannot hire an attorney in your home state to represent you.

, You can try to get recommendations from anyone that you know. Ask people if they have ever had to file a civil rights lawsuit and whether or not they would recommend their attorney.


No matter how much you trust the person who gives you a referral, don’t automatically hire the lawyer they recommend. Different people have different communication styles and expectations from a lawyer. You still want to meet with the lawyer and judge for yourself how well you get along.

, Civil rights lawsuits often make the news. Police brutality, employment discrimination, and housing discrimination cases are often high profile and are reported on television or in the newspaper. Pay attention to the names of the lawyers interviewed. They are probably experienced civil rights attorneys who you can contact.

, Each state (and many counties) have bar associations, which are private associations of lawyers. Most of these bar associations run referral programs.By contacting the referral program, you can get the name of one or more civil rights attorneys.


To find a bar association, you can search the Internet. Type your state or county and “bar association referral.” There should be a phone number to call or an online submission form that you can fill out.

, These organizations provide free or legal services to people in financial need (often defined as those within 125% of the federal poverty level).If you choose to go with a legal aid attorney, however, be advised that you probably will have to work with whatever attorney is assigned to you. Legal aid organizations often have tight budgets and busy workloads; it is unlikely that you can pick and choose which legal aid attorney to work with.


To find a legal aid organization near you, search the Legal Services Corporation’s website at www.lsc.gov. At the homepage, click on “Find Legal Aid” and then enter your zip code. Links or contact information will be provided to legal aid organizations in your area.

, Once you have a list of civil rights lawyers, you should begin researching them. Today, most attorneys have websites. You should visit the website and look through to see how well-written and neat the website appears. A sloppy, poorly written website may indicate that the lawyer is not diligent or careful.

, Each lawyer should also list representative cases that he or she has worked on. For example, an employment discrimination attorney should tell visitors about recent employment cases. Often, the attorney will give a capsule summary of the case and tell you how much money the client won in a settlement or at trial.


If you are bringing an employment discrimination claim, then do not be impressed by how successful the attorney has done in products liability cases. That is a different area of law.
Also check to see that the attorney has handled a similar case recently. The law often changes regularly, so you want an attorney who is familiar with the current status of the law.

, Many websites now have online reviews posted about lawyers. Popular websites include Avvo, Google, Yelp, and Martindale.You can visit these websites and type in the lawyer’s name to see what former clients have had to say.


Remember a few basic caveats when reading online reviews. First, every lawyer has a disgruntled client or two.The fact that you see a negative review does not mean the person is a bad lawyer.
People may be more motivated to leave negative reviews than positive ones. Think about your own positive experiences with your dentist, doctor, or business that you frequent. How many times have you left an online review? Many people are motivated to review only when upset. So the lack of positive reviews may not be meaningful.
Instead of treating each individual review as definitive, look for common themes. If many clients mention having difficulty contacting the attorney, then the lawyer may indeed have a problem in that area.

, Each state has an attorney disciplinary board that investigates charges of misconduct. If the lawyer has been accused of violating ethics rules, then the organization investigates the charge and, if necessary, disciplines the attorney.This information is then made public.


You should find the state’s disciplinary agency by searching the Internet for “lawyer discipline” and then the state.
Once at the website, you can use a “Lawyer Search” function.Type in the attorney’s name and see if any disciplinary history has been listed. There may also be a list of disciplined attorneys available at the website for your to browse., After researching the attorneys, you should try to narrow your list down to three or four lawyers. You will want to meet for consultations with a handful of lawyers. If your list is too long, you will take too much time.


You should probably consider experience, location, and reviews as you winnow down your list. Remember that the more experience a lawyer has, the higher his or her fees typically are.
Nevertheless, don’t hesitate to reach out and contact an experienced lawyer. If the lawyer’s fees are too high, then he or she can refer you to another civil rights attorney who charges a reasonable fee.

, You should call to schedule consultations with the attorneys on your short list. Some attorneys will have secretaries or paralegals ask you questions on the phone in order to screen whether or not your case is something that the office typically handles. Ask for a consultation.


Some attorneys offer free or reduced-fee consultations.You should ask about the price before confirming your consultation. Also ask how you can pay the fee (check, credit card, cash).You should insist on meeting in person (unless that doesn’t work for you). By meeting in person, you get a better sense of how organized the lawyer is and what his or her communication style is like.

, Once you have your consultations scheduled, you should prepare by gathering any documents related to your claim.Get together police reports, hospital reports, employer letters, etc.


Be sure to take only copies to the attorney. Also be sure to take your copies with you after the consultation unless you agreed to hire the lawyer on the spot.

, Before going to the consultation, you should come up with questions that are important to you. You might not have a lot of time. Consultations generally don’t run over half an hour. However, there should be time for you to ask a few questions.


You could ask how many cases the attorney has handled that are like yours.For example, if you are bringing an excessive force claim against the police, then you would want to know how many of those cases the lawyer has handled.
Also ask if there are other ways to resolve your civil rights dispute.For example, the lawyer might think arbitration or settlement is a better route to take.
Ask how the lawyer communicates. Does he or she send regular emails? Is the lawyer available by telephone? Can you stop in and visit? It is important to understand how the lawyer communicates since communication is often a source of conflict between clients and attorneys.
Ask about the likely outcome.Here, you get to see how the attorney analyzes your case and how knowledgeable he or she is about the law.
Don’t ask questions which you can learn the answer to by looking at the lawyer’s website. For example, “Where did you go to law school?” and “What year did you graduate?” should be answered on the website.

, Give yourself plenty of time to find parking or deal with public transportation. The lawyer is probably busy and has other things scheduled around your consultation. Be sure to have the office number on your phone in case you need to call because you are running late.

, One question to be sure to ask is how the attorney bills. Civil rights attorneys can offer a variety of billing options. For example, some might offer straight hourly billing, in which you are charged an agreed amount per hour of work.


Often, civil rights attorneys will represent clients on contingency. With contingency fee agreements, the lawyer will only get paid if you win or settle your case. In those situations, the lawyer will take around a third of your settlement or jury award.As the plaintiff, you will still be responsible for court costs, such as fees associated with filing the lawsuit and with court reporters.
If you bring a section 1983 claim for police misconduct, then you can seek reasonable attorneys’ fees if you win.This means that the defendant would pay for your lawyer.

, After meeting for consultations, look over your list of attorneys and begin to strike out those you didn’t like. You should look for the following “red flags,” and avoid these attorneys accordingly:


The lawyer promised you would win.In truth, no lawyer can guarantee how your case will turn out. A lawyer can offer a professional guess, backed up with reasons. But any lawyer who promises a result should be avoided.
The attorney’s staff is rude to you. A lawyer who tolerates rude staff does not care about his clients.
The lawyer’s office is messy. This signals that the attorney is not careful. A messy office also makes it hard to keep client information confidential. If you see files stacked all over the place or papers covering the lawyer’s desk, then you might want to cross him or her off your list.

, To help yourself choose a lawyer who is right for you, ask yourself the following questions. If you say “no” to any of these questions, then you should think twice before hiring the attorney:Did you feel comfortable meeting with the lawyer?
Did the lawyer project sufficient skill and experience to handle your case?
Did you understand the lawyer’s explanation of your case?
Is the fee reasonable?

, Only you know which attorney is the right one for you. Some people might prioritize a lawyer who is a good communicator over someone with extensive experience. Trust your gut to make the right choice.


If you didn’t feel comfortable or confident with any of the lawyers you met with, then you will need to get additional referrals and schedule more consultations.

, You can call the lawyer and tell him or her that you would like to hire them. Ask what information they need from you, and tell the attorney where to send the engagement letter for you to sign. You will not have a formal attorney-client relationship until that time.

, The attorney should send you an engagement letter which spells out the terms of the representation. This letter should indicate what happens to the client file when the case ends, whether the attorney agrees to represent you on appeal, and who the attorney may assign work to.


Also read the fee agreement. This agreement may be included as part of the letter or may arrive separately. The agreement should spell out in detail how the lawyer’s fees are being calculated and when you will be billed.
If you don’t agree with something in either the engagement letter or the fee agreement, then call the lawyer and have it fixed before signing. You should only sign agreements with the lawyer when you agree with everything in the document.
You should make sure that both the fee agreement and the engagement letter are in writing. Keep a copy for your records after signing."

Identify times you've acted racist toward someone.,

Question your snap judgements.,
Start noticing racial injustice.,
Take people seriously when they call something racist.,
Keep educating yourself.",How to Tell if You Are a Racist," The belief that some races are superior while others are inferior is the foundation of racism. If you believe deep down that the race you belong to (or one you don't belong to) has qualities that make it better than other races, that is racist thinking. Be honest with yourself about what you believe.;
, Do you stereotype people based on their race? For example, it's racist to believe that all members of a certain race are untrustworthy. It's equally racist to believe that all members of a certain race are smart. Applying any one stereotype to all members of a race is racist thinking.


Many people who practice this type of racism believe that it's harmless. For example, they might think assuming a person from a certain race is smarter than average is a compliment. However, since this assumption is based on a racial stereotype, it's not a compliment: it's racist.
In worst case scenarios, judging people based on stereotypes can be extremely dangerous. For example, innocent people are frequently targeted as criminals due to the color of their skin, even when they haven't committed any crime.

, Let's say someone you've never met before is introduced to you at a work function. First impressions always come with a few snap judgments, but are yours generally racial in tone? Do you assume things about the person based on skin color? That's a racist tendency.


Racism isn't limited to judging based on skin color. If you make judgements based on someone's attire, accent, hairstyle, jewelry, or other aspects of their appearance related to their race, those judgements also fall into the racism category.The judgements you make can be positive or negative, but in either case they are racist. Whether you assume the person is funny, sexual, scary, or any other quality, it's still making a judgement based on a stereotype.

, When you hear someone else point something out as racist, are you able to understand their point? Or do you tend to think it isn't really racist? Racism is a major problem in just about every country in the world. If you never really notice it, it's not because racism isn't there; it's because you aren't clearly seeing it.For example, if you have a colleague who feels she isn't up for a promotion due to her race, and you work for a company with a history of only promoting people of a certain race to senior management, chances are, your colleague has a point.
Racism can be difficult to spot, especially when you're new to its nuances. But when someone dismisses concerns about racism out of hand without trying to understand the concerns, usually means the person has racist tendencies.

, In a perfect world, all races would have equal opportunities and enjoy equal wealth, but that is certainly not the case. Instead, certain races have historically taken more for themselves and left others with less. When you don't acknowledge racial injustice, you help perpetuate racism by ignoring the problem.


For example, if you believe that all races have equal access to education, and that races underrepresented in universities just aren't trying hard enough to succeed, take a deeper look at the root of the problem. The reason certain people are able to afford college and graduate with a degree is often because they have historically had more privilege than others.

, Do you treat all people the same way, or does something about your demeanor change when you're talking to a person of a different race? If you stiffen up or treat people of different races unkindly, that's racist.


Notice whether you feel less comfortable talking with people of other races.
See if you easily make friends with people of different races. If everyone you hang out with tends to be the same race, that might be a sign of a problem., Maybe you're nice to people's faces, but do you speak kindly about them behind their backs? If you feel comfortable using slurs or perpetuating stereotypes when you're among people of your own race, even if you'd never do it in front of the person you're talking about, it's still racist.


And in fact, even if you do these things in front of the person you're talking about, and the person says their fine with it, that's not OK. Maybe the person really doesn't care, but you're still demonstrating racist behavior.

, This goes back to determining whether you treat people of different races differently or if you practice the same behavior with everyone. If you decide not to hire someone, not to be someone's partner, not to smile at someone, and so on based on the person's race, that's racist behavior.Another classic example is crossing the street when you see someone of a different race approaching you.
Even if your reaction is to crack extra jokes or act more outgoing than usual, if you're doing it because you assume something about the person based on race, you're treating that person differently.

, If you're new to understanding the nuances of racism you might not even realize that you've said or done something racist, even around people you consider friends. Remember that any time you make a judgement about someone's abilities, preferences or any other qualities based on stereotypes about their race, that's racist thinking. Saying these judgements out loud has the potential to be very hurtful to someone and perpetuate stereotypes that hurt everyone. Here are some types of comments and questions to avoid:


Making race-based assumptions about a person's food preferences, music preferences, or any other preferencesAsking someone questions about their race, as though they're a spokesperson for everyone else
Asking someone for advice on how to date a member of their race
Asking uninvited questions about a person's race or where a person came from
Making any type of comment or gesture that could make the person feel different or put on the spot because of their race (touching someone's hair, etc.)

, Once you know what to look for, you'll be overwhelmed by the racial stereotypes pushed by people you know, the news, politicians, movies, books, and everywhere else you look. Racial stereotypes are embedded in our culture, and bringing them to light is one way you can change your views and help stop racism.If you're new to understanding racist stereotypes, a good way to educate yourself is to watch old movies. Take a look at classic westerns, for example. What racist stereotypes are perpetuated by the roles played by white people versus Native Americans? Stereotypes today aren't always as blatant, but they're certainly there.

, If you realize you've just made a judgement about someone based on race, take a moment to understand what just happened. Make a conscious effort to see past the stereotypes you've internalized to the real person standing before you.


No one's personality, history, desires, or potential is limited to the stereotypes you know about that person's race. Don't let racism taint the way you think about a person.

, Once you're aware it exists, you'll see it all around you: at school, at work, in your neighborhood, and in the way institutions are run. For example, if you go to a private school and 90 percent of those who attend are white, question why more people of color don't attend school there. What inequalities have led to this issue at your school?


Or think about those elected to serve in your local government. Is each race in your area well represented? What factors might lead to members of a certain race having a lower chance of getting elected?

, Maybe it is racism, maybe it isn't, but don't make a habit of dismissing people when they feel they've been a victim of racism, or when they point out something they believe is racist. Examine the situation and do what you can to help. Even if you can't see how something is racist right away, give the person the benefit of the doubt., Learning how to banish racism from your life is a work in progress. Everyone in our society has learned the stereotypes about race, both their own and others. Racism isn't going to just vanish, but by pointing out injustice when we see it instead of turning our heads, we can do our part to put a stop to it."

A mother bears lot of pain, disturbance in health, and changes in her body.,
Recognize that your mother endured around nine months of carrying you because of her love for you.,
Honor your mother's wishes.",How to Respect Women and Their Rights as a Muslim2," She helps take care of her baby and fulfills her responsibilities—being a good wife, mother, and daughter-in-law. She has spent many years raising you and teaching you, caring for the household, providing for the family, or both.


The Quran emphasizes the great struggles the mother goes through for her child, to highlight the need for one to reciprocate their parents sacrifice for them: ""And We have enjoined on man to his parents: in travail upon travail did his mother bear him and his weaning was over two years. Be thankful to Me and to your parents, unto Me is the final destination.""

, A mother has to go through the problems of pregnancy and severe pains of delivery. The father doesn't suffer from any of these difficulties, that is why the Prophet (peace be upon him) has given more rights to the mother than anybody else. According to narration;


""And We have enjoined upon man, to his parents, good treatment. His mother carried him with hardship and gave birth to him with hardship, and his gestation and weaning period is thirty months until, when he reaches maturity and reaches forty years, he says, ""My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to work righteousness of which You will approve and make righteous for me my offspring. Indeed, I have repented to You, and indeed, I am of the Muslims.""
""Do good to and serve your mother, then your mother, then your mother, then your father, then the near relatives and then those who come after them.""

, If she asks for help washing dishes or cleaning the house, go help her. Offer to run errands, watch your siblings, and take care of other chores. This will give her more time to rest and focus on her biggest responsibilities

If she chooses to stay at home, recognize that she puts a lot of effort into keeping the household running smoothly. If she works, then she is delivering money to the table.

, Her opinion matters. She will not disobey you if the two of you can figure out a decision that makes both of you happy.

, Don’t pressure her to do things she is hesitant about or not ready for. Set aside time to talk with her about what she is and isn't willing to do, and don't try to negotiate if she says she is not comfortable with something.

, Feminists are gathering in bigger numbers on the internet, where it is (usually) safer and they can find others who aren't afraid to speak up. Websites such as Tumblr, Everyday Feminism, Jezebel, and others often host feminist discussions.


Be careful of trolls and harassers. Feminism has a significant backlash (notably the MRAs), and prominent feminists may be targeted. Get a strong support system and call the police if threats are made against you or you feel unsafe.
Internet feminist culture has had issues of ableism, bullying, and antisemitism. Be aware of these issues and don't be afraid to call someone out if they are doing something problematic.

, The feminist community, like all communities, has its unique vocabulary and norms. While it would be impractical to list all words right here, here are a few examples:Patriarchy—a society in which men are given more power than women, masculinity is seen superior to femininity, and rigid gender roles are enforced (to the detriment of everyone).

Rape Culture—a culture in which rape is normalized or dismissed.

Nice Guy (TM)—a man who acts nice in the hopes that a woman will reward him with sex, and may respond with anger or violence if she does not. Distinct from ordinary nice guys.

Cisgender—a person who is not transgender; their gender identity matches their biological sex.

, Feminism is about helping all women (and all people), which includes women of color, LGBTQIA women, disabled women, large women, poor women, and women who belong to religious minorities. As you research, make sure to listen to the voices of women who lack privilege in areas besides gender.


Men and nonbinary people may write articles about other axes of oppression. Don't feel like you need to limit yourself to only female writers!

, Feminists are constantly challenging and critiquing ideas. In order to move past prejudice, one must be willing to put aside one's ego and not take criticism personally.


Everyone does problematic things sometimes. Listen when you are called out, understand why that particular action was wrong, apologize, and work to do better next time. If you can do this, then you're doing great.
Don't beat yourself up over past mistakes. Learn from them, and move on. You did the best you could do at the time.

, Feminism is not a club of bra-burning, hairy, masculine lesbians with short hair.Feminism encompasses all sorts of women—from feminine homemakers to business executives to disabled writers to charming lesbians.


Some feminists are fat, hairy, short-haired, masculine, and gay. According to feminism, these women are okay too.There is no wrong way to be a woman.
Feminists did publicly throw bras into trash bins during the Second Wave, but bra-burning is a myth., Feminism is not limited to white, middle-class and upper-class working women. Homemakers, sanitation workers, minimum-wage factory workers, secretaries, daycare workers, unemployed women, et cetera are all welcome in feminism. Feminism advocates respect of women of all walks of life, because women should be able to choose whatever path suits them and their priorities best.

, In fact, feminists have called for support for male rape victims,the breaking down of rigid gender roles that hurt men, an end to infant male/AMAB circumcision,and intersectional rights (race, disability, size, LGBTQIA status) that all affect men.


Feminism does not seek to do to men what patriarchy has done to women.
The only men who will be hurt by feminism are the men whose livelihoods depended on the oppression of women. If you're an ordinary good man, you'll have some learning to do, but you'll be fine.

, Feminism holds that all women deserve equal rights, not just the ""correct"" type of women. It is not about women distancing themselves from femininity to seem superior as individuals. In feminist belief systems, femininity and feminized things (e.g. feminized jobs) should not be seen as lesser.


The phrase ""I'm not like other girls"" is a key example of what feminism is not, because it implies that ""other girls"" are inferior and less worthy of respect.
Women should be able to like pink, manicures, pop music, etc. if they choose. There is nothing inherently inferior about this.
Calling other women ""sl*ts"" and ""b**ches"" is not feminism. Insulting women who are less intelligent or less educated is not feminism. Throwing mentally ill women, fat women, lesbians, etc. under the bus is not feminism.

, It has different sects that hold different beliefs. (Even within sects, different feminists have different opinions.) Here are a few of the sects that are often mentioned:



White Feminism—a sect that focuses on white women, ignoring or even speaking over women of color. (Not all white women who are feminists are White Feminists.)

Sex Work Inclusive Feminism—a group that believes people who voluntarily perform sex acts for money should be respected and kept safe, and that sex work should be decriminalized. (They do not support sex trafficking, which is done against the victims' will.)

Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminism—a sect that believes transgender women are men who intend to invade women's safe spaces (among other things).Its adherents are often called TERFs.

Sex Positive/Sex Critical—feminists who believe that female sexuality should be de-stigmatized and celebrated, versus those who voice concerns over male/female power dynamics in relationships.

, Studies have shown that feminists actually feel less hostile towards men than non-feminist women do.Plenty of feminists are married to men, and/or could name several men they care about in their lives.


Feminist values such as consent also apply to men.
Some feminists believe that men can be feminists, while others are concerned that male feminists will try to take over the movement.Some men prefer to identify as ""feminist allies"" to be clear that they're only here to help.
Men have male privilege.Having privilege is not equal to being evil.
You may run across misandry jokes. These are humor attempts, in which feminists satirically say the same horrible things about men that society says about women.Satire means that they do not actually hold these beliefs.No reasonable person actually wants to ""kill all men.""""Not all men"" is an obvious statement.When feminists say ""I hate when men do ______,"" their intent is to spark discussion, and make men think about whether they do that thing. The men who do it can rethink their actions and do better, and the men who don't do it can nod intelligently and keep moving.

, Feminists seek to dismantle all systems of oppression—not just patriarchy like their name suggests, but also systematic racism, heterosexism, ableism, and more. It covers issues from rape culture to income inequality. In the eyes of a feminist, every human has human dignity, and deserves the same freedoms and opportunities in life.


""Girl power"" ignores the idea that women can do bad things too.
Equality to men is an impractical idea—which men should women be equal to? White heterosexual men? Black autistic men? Fat transgender men? Not all men are equally privileged.

, It supports everyone from the rape victim to the woman whose bottom is pinched by a coworker, from the teenage wife to the gamer who is frustrated at seeing characters of her gender seen like objects. The existence of larger problems does not invalidate the smaller problems.

, They should not need to dress a certain way, lose a certain amount of pounds, hide signs of their religion or disability, or straighten their hair in order to be treated with basic respect.


Basic respect means (among other things) freedom to walk around without stares of disgust or rude remarks, human rights such as effective healthcare, equal opportunity, and not fearing for their safety or lives because of their gender/race/gender identity/etc.

, Feminists believe that no one's bodily autonomy should be violated. This is very clear in their stance on sex and sexual assault, but also in a number of things in everyday life. In feminism, consent has no exceptions.


Most feminists are pro-choicebecause a fetus is using a pregnant person's body (causing things like vomiting and serious financial expense), and it thus it should be removed if the pregnant person no longer consents to its use of their body.Feminists usually oppose the draftand routine infant circumcision,because men did not consent to the draft, nor can infants consent to an unnecessary operation., Feminists believe that women's bodies are about more than sex and beauty. They dislike the treatment of women as sexy objects in advertising, movies, video games, and other areas. They are critical of the beauty industry that tells women that they need to meet a nearly impossible standard in order to feel happy and desirable.


Some feminists rebel against toxic beauty culture by deliberately choosing not to follow it (e.g. not shaving, wearing little or no makeup, accepting body fat). Others prefer to dress up according to beauty norms. Neither preference makes a woman a bad feminist.
Some women protest the idea that the female body (especially cis women's breasts) is inherently sexual. They believe that women should be able to breastfeed in public without people ascribing sexual meaning to it, and go topless in the heat like men can.

, It encompasses more than sexism—it also addresses issues of race, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, income, size, religion, and more. This is because feminism is for all women, not just the straight white able-bodied etc. women. The need for feminism will disappear when all forms of oppression no longer exist.

Fight hard for intersectional issues.,
Work for an end to sexism and the embrace of diversity.",How to Support Men As a Feminist1," Both men and women have been forced to be ways because of gender, rather than allowing men to show emotion or women be assertive. Speak up against the idea that masculinity is superior to femininity, and that a man who does feminine things is somehow inferior. Speak up if you see boys or men being treated badly for liking ""girly"" things such as sewing, fashion, literature, ""chick flicks"", TV shows aimed at women, ""women's"" clothes, or the color pink.If you see a man doing traditionally feminine things, smile and treat him exactly the same as you would if he were a man doing masculine things or a woman doing feminine things.
Pay special attention to how gay men are often stereotyped as ""effeminate"". Gay people are just as diverse as straight people (this also includes bisexual people, asexual people, and the vast range of people and ways to be.);
, Men face a world in which they are told to ""man up"", ""boys don't cry"", and show little emotion--unless maybe it is anger. Society considers expressing emotion to be feminine,and men who cry or show weakness may be ridiculed.This is bad for their health.Take a man seriously if he cries or expresses feelings. Listen to him and treat his emotional expression like it is as natural as if it were done by a woman.

, Men can be wonderful fathers, uncles, grandfathers, babysitters, teachers, and nannies. A man caring for children should be regarded just as natural as a woman caring for children.Respect stay-at-home dads, or dads who put their family or their wife's career before their own. Treat them like their decisions are completely normal and respectable.
Support men in their household activities. Challenge the notion that certain hobbies or activities should be done only by women or only by men. Whether a man is cooking, cleaning, gardening, or sewing, avoid the assumption that this is out of the gender norm.
Fight the idea that women (and only women) have an innate maternal instinct. Some women are good with children, some are not, some men are good with children, and some aren't. Both maternal love and paternal love are natural and valuable.
A fathers does not ""babysit"" his children, he fathers them. Stop using the term ""sitter"" for fathers. It suggests that a father is the lesser caretaker. It is both dismissive of fathers and suggests that only women can raise children.

, Antifeminists and rape culture often act like men cannot control their urges, and it's natural for them to have sex drives or anger surges so strong that they hurt others. This is a toxic and harmful message for boys and men. Pose the idea that men are 100% capable of self-control, and that they know very well what is right and wrong.Hold rapists (male or otherwise) accountable, and never blame the victim.
Advocate for comprehensive sexual education including how to determine if you have consent,stay safe, manage power dynamics in relationships, handle sexual frustration, and recognize the signs of a dangerous relationship.
Fight the idea that men have uncontrollable sex drives.

, Abuse and assault are terrible tragedies,and it's important that emotional support support and health care are available to victims.Work for a world in which all victims are taken seriously, and male victims are not derided as weaklings, inferior men, or ""gays"" (which raises additional issues of homophobia).


If someone says they have been raped, believe them. Between only 2-8% of rape allegations are false,and many victims stay quiet because they fear they will not be taken seriously.Challenge people who laugh at the idea of rape, state that men can not be victims,or make fun of male abuse victims.
Work for the availability of rape crisis centers, counseling, and other resources. Male, female, and non-binary victims all deserve support.

, Consent is one of the key values of feminism,and infants cannot consent to a medically unnecessary, permanent procedure.Keep in mind that not all children who are circumcised are boys. Intersex babies and transgender babies with XY chromosomes are also circumcised.
Feminists are somewhat split on circumcision, as there are concerns that banning it outright would cause people to do it underground, which would put the babies' health at risk.

, Forced conscription of men into the army goes against the value of consent—men should only fight in wars if they choose to do so. If a draft is ever used in your country, speak up against it. 


Feminists have historically argued against the draft., Men are more likely to successfully commit suicide,and may be discouraged from seeking help because they view it as a sign of weakness. Work on reducing the stigma of mental illness, and support people with disorders from depression to schizophrenia.

, Advocate to let boys and men be free of pressures to appear more masculine or aggressive.Masculinity should be a choice, not a restriction.


As a parent, be conscious of how you treat your children. Parents (even parents who think they are treating their children equally) tend to be harsher on boys.Give your sons the same compassion, patience, and affection that you give to your daughters. Treat a crying boy the same way you'd treat a crying girl.

, You aren't here only for the white, cishet, non-disabled, thin, etc. men—you're working to help all men. Spend time on intersectional issues such as racism, classism, LGBT+ rights, and more. There are many ways to support men that aren't focused only on gender; getting involved in these social issues supports men facing these other hurdles, as well. Here are some examples:


Fighting the frequent execution of men of color and disabled men by American police
Working to help transgender men be viewed as fully male, and to lower the high mortality rates due to murder and suicide
Campaigning for the rights of disabled people (including men)
Working against homophobia, biphobia, acephobia, and other discrimination against LGBT+ people (including men).

, Sexism hurts everyone, and to support men as a group and as individuals, it's important to fight gender-based stereotypes, expectations, and discrimination. Giving equal rights to everyone makes the world a better place for everyone, including men.


Without compulsory masculinity, men could do whatever they wanted regardless of the gender binary.
If men and women earned the same amount of money, then men wouldn't usually need to pay alimony in divorce, nor would the custom of men paying for dates have much use.
If women had less barriers at school and work, they could be more productive and innovative, improving the economy overall.

Define racism.,
Familiarize yourself with types of racism.,
Bring awareness to these racist comments.,
Address biases within yourself.,
Try to step into the shoes of those you speak about.,
Consider the mental and physical impact of racism.,
Apologize.",How to Stop Using Racist Comments1," Before you can make any positive changes and move away from any potentially racist behaviors, it is best to correctly identify what racism is. Racism is the belief that another race of people is inferior to your own. Racism occurs both on an individual and societal level.


For example, one person may have preconceived beliefs and notions that persons from a different race are flawed. Or, society’s messages may convey that people from a particular race are inferior to another.
Racism is a systemic issue and not just the issue of a few people.;
, Racism is not just about the inaccurate beliefs and derogatory statements of a particular race of people. There are in fact several different types of racism that you may want to learn about.



Benevolent Racism. Identifying members of a race as sympathetic but incompetent.

Cultural Racism. The belief that the culture of a race is flawed.

Hostile Racism. The belief that a particular race is inferior to your own.

Institutional Racism. This works on a macro-level, where our social institutions, (government agencies, courts, or other large systems), perpetuate a system of inequality based on race (I.e., goods and services are disproportionate and often suppressed for minority groups).

Colorblind Racism. The belief that racism does not matter, and that racism no longer exists.

Genetic Determinism. The belief that a particular race is biologically inferior to another.

Internalized Racism. When someone’s internal dialogue becomes racist. For instance, someone may consciously internalize negative attitudes, beliefs, biases, or stereotype members of a race or ethnic group.

, Awareness is always the very first step in any process of change. You need to know when and how you make these comments in order to stop. Pay attention to your interactions with others and any thoughts you have regarding those who are different.


Try to understand the circumstances that lead to your racist comments and any thoughts or feelings you have when you make them. Keep a log in a journal or your phone’s note-taking app.

, Now you need to delve deeper and get some insight into why you make these comments. Sometimes, people repurpose racist jokes that they have heard from elder members of their community, not knowing how they sting. Or, you might make a remark with the intention of winning favor with a certain group of people.Analyze the racist comments you make. Try to find the “why” behind these remarks.

, In order to effectively end hate speech, you need to keep perspective. It can be easy to type out a nasty comment online or express it within the comfort of your home because you don’t witness the ramifications.


The truth is your racist comments negatively impact those they are directed at. Your words may reinforce negative stereotypes and even make people perceive you poorly.Spend some time stepping into the shoes of the person or group you criticize. How would you feel if those same words were directed at you?

, Those who are subject to racism are at a greater risk of developing physical and/or mental health problems.


For example, when institutional racism is applied, it inhibits one’s access to quality and effective medical and mental health care. This in turn leads to unaddressed medical and mental health issues.
On an individual level, a victim of racist comments and actions is at higher risk of developing depression, anxiety, and stress. When someone is in a prolonged state of these three mental health conditions, it increases their risk of other illnesses such as, colds, seasonal illnesses, heart disease, and cancer.
Additionally, chronic exposure to racism and chronic stress lead to poor health choices (tobacco, alcohol, drugs).

, You must make amends for ugly remarks you make about others. This helps you take ownership for inappropriate comments and shows others that you feel remorse. If you make an in-person comment, apologize immediately. If you cannot rectify your words in the heat of the moment, do so as soon as you can.Say something like “I realize how insensitive my words were. I apologize and I hope you will allow me to make amends.”
Or, you might send an email or letter at a later date. Say something along the lines of “I spoke harshly about you last week. I apologize. My relationship with you is important to me. What can I do to make this better?”

Remember not to derail conversations about women's issues.,
Watch your sources.,
Be patient with those who are genuinely ignorant.,
Take extra care of yourself.,
Listen to criticism.,
Work with men you trust.",How to Support Men As a Feminist2," Men's issues are important. Women's issues are also important, and it is not okay to try to turn the conversation away to your favorite topics.Honor the original topic of discussion, and if you want to talk about men's issues, feel free to start your own conversation or join one that was already about men's issues.


Avoid useless interjections such as ""Not all men _____!""Recognize the difference between ""Men can also get raped!"" and ""Men can get raped.""
Only interject if clearly false things are being said or implied. For example it would be okay to remind people ""Penises are not exclusively male genitalia, and clitorises are not exclusively female. Please don't erase transgender people.""

, Some groups that address feminism or masculinity can be manipulative, untruthful, or aggressive, including a portion of Men's Rights Activists.Despite their names sounding like they aim to support men, some of these groups spend their time fighting feminism and women in general.Be careful about the company you keep and the sources you cite.You're reading this topic because you're looking to support men as a feminist. Given this stance, ask yourself: Do these men work alongside feminists, or against them?

, Some men are well-meaning but don't truly understand the need for feminism. They may do problematic things, ask annoying questions, and miss the point of your answers. They are learning. Do your best to remember how you were when you first learned about feminism, and cut them some slack as they catch up.


Take a break if you need to. You are not personally responsible for their education. If you feel frustrated or exhausted, stop.
Practice the phrases ""Why don't you look that up on the internet?"" ""I'm not in the mood to talk right now,"" and ""I need some quiet time now.""

, All people do problematic things sometimes, and since men don't always recognize or care about their male privilege, they may do it more often. Some people you deal with may be frustrating, rude, or downright threatening. Look after your mental health and spend time doing things you find relaxing.


You do not have to convince everyone that feminism or men's issues matter. You are not obligated to keep talking to a person who upsets you.Consider calling the police if you get death or rape threats. You deserve to feel safe.

, Feminists get called out for doing problematic things—it happens. Listen closely, research independently as needed, and apologize if you hurt anyone. The mistake is less important than what you learn from it.

, Talk to your feminist ally friend, your politically aware brother, or your sweet and respectful boyfriend. Ask them how rigid gender roles hurt them and their friends. Gather information and get feedback, so you can work well side by side.

Ask others for accountability.,
Work together to educate yourself about other groups.,
Connect with people from other groups.,
Speak up against the racist comments of others.",How to Stop Using Racist Comments2," If you have trouble overcoming biases about people from different groups or backgrounds, reach out to others for help. Ask a friend, colleague, or mentor to help you work through your beliefs so that you can stop making racist comments.You might say, “Henry, I admire how open and accepting you are. I really need some work in this area. Can you help me?”

, Biases are often ingrained and learned at an early age. These stereotypes and prejudices can be unlearned by consciously being aware of them and educating yourself. Work with your accountability partner to learn more about the groups you are biased against.Educate yourself by reading books, watching movies, and gaining exposure to different sub-groups and cultures.

, One of the best ways to overcome racist viewpoints is to make friends from different racial groups. This way you can challenge those ingrained prejudices and biases in real life. Meeting people from different backgrounds helps you maintain perspective and expand your worldview.When you make friends, share some of your previous biases and ask them to educate you.

, You can help yourself and others change their attitudes about different racial groups by speaking out. Even when you stop making these comments yourself, you are also charged with correcting others who make them. When you hear a friend or relative make a racially-charged comment, don’t laugh or ignore the remark. Pull them aside and ask questions. Something like “What did you mean by that?” or “How would you feel if someone said that about you?” is enough to spark a conversation about the issue.

Review your comments before your press “enter.” Cleaning up your jokes and remarks in-person doesn’t give you the freedom to run amok with racist comments online.,
Stay off of racist forums and websites.,
Keep your comments to yourself, if you can’t improve the message.",How to Stop Using Racist Comments3," To truly overcome your prejudices, you need to watch what you say with your mouth or your fingertips.


Carefully read aloud any comments you make on blogs, forums, or on social media. Ask yourself whether this comment could hurt someone else. If so, edit your words to remove any biases.
If you see others perpetrating racism online, report their behavior to the site administrator., Some sites involve racism as a part of their culture or philosophy. If you notice a repeating pattern of biased or prejudiced news or information on a website, stop visiting it. The less exposure you have to hateful, hurtful language the less likely you are to develop these beliefs and use similar language in your own life., If, for some reason, you can’t seem to modify your language online or in-person, maybe it’s best if you keep quiet. Racist remarks—even when shared with innocent intentions—fuel racism and discrimination. Until you work on changing your beliefs and educating yourself about other groups, keep your opinions to yourself."

Donate to Planned Parenthood.,
Start a fundraising campaign.,
Purchase some Planned Parenthood gear.",How to Support Planned Parenthood1," Giving money to Planned Parenthood is an excellent way to offer your support. Even if you can only donate a small amount, you can make a difference.You can make a one-time donation or a recurring monthly donation to Planned Parenthood.
You may have to sacrifice something to free up enough money to donate to Planned Parenthood. For example, if you usually spend $3 on coffee every day, then try making your own coffee at home most days and donate the money you save to Planned Parenthood.
Or, if you subscribe to more than one streaming service, then you might cancel one of them and donate the money you save to Planned Parenthood.;
, If you can’t donate, then you can also try to solicit donations for Planned Parenthood with a fundraising campaign. You can set your own goal and use your social media outlets to promote your fundraising campaign. Planned Parenthood even offers tools to help you with your campaign.


Try starting a campaign about a month before your birthday and ask friends and family members to donate to Planned Parenthood instead of giving you gifts.
If you are in college, then you might talk about starting a Planned Parenthood fundraiser with your campus’s reproductive rights group.

, Purchasing and sporting Planned Parenthood gear is another great way to help. By purchasing and wearing Planned Parenthood gear, you will be providing them with some monetary support and also showing the world that you support this organization.Try sporting a pink shirt that sports the hashtag #StandwithPP to spread the word about supporting Planned Parenthood.

Self-assess.,
Research the topic.,
Stop using racial slurs.,
Avoid cultural appropriation.,
Be vigilant about systemic and invisible racism.,
Engage in mental exercises.,
Talk about race.,
Seek out culturally diverse experiences.,
Attend a conference or join an anti-racism group.,
Challenge racism in the world.",How to Stop Being Racist," An important first step in your personal journey to overcome racial prejudice is to take stock of yourself. Which groups of people might you be prejudiced against? What are your thoughts about these groups? Where do your negative feelings arise from?


Many people have prejudices that they aren't even conscious of, but can be detected using a psychological test called an Implicit Association Test (IAT). You can take the IAT yourself online.People are frequently shocked by the results of their IAT, because they assume they are free of racism. Taking this test is a good way to examine your own prejudice, and getting unpleasant results is, for many people, a motivation to work on changing their attitudes.
Think about the source of your racism. The cause of racism can be anything, but it's usually growing up in a racist environment, surrounding ourselves with peers who have racist attitudes, or looking for someone else to blame for our problems.Some also point to messages we get through the media or culture more broadly.Understanding where your own racist tendencies may have come from is an important step in unlearning them.
Monitor your thinking and practice empathy. Be aware of your thoughts when confronted with situations that trigger your prejudice, and try to put yourself in the other person's position. In other words, try to be mindful of how people different from yourself might feel in a given situation, and how your actions might be affecting them.;
, Start informing yourself about the scientific realities of race, the minority experience in your nation, and the struggles confronted by people who are victims of prejudice. Often, an understanding of these issues helps bring about greater sympathy for minority groups.


A good place to start is by learning what race really is. Primarily, racial differences are socially constructed: that is, they are the product of society. Science tells us there is very little genetic difference between people of different races, and that racial categories aren't actually biologically distinct from one another.There are many books, both fiction and non-fiction, which can help you through the next step: starting to understand the difficulties confronted by minority or disenfranchised groups. Novels like Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man can be an enjoyable place to begin.Many anti-racism organizations provide lists of recommended reading (primarily non-fiction) on their websites. Anti-racist educator Tim Wise, for example, has an extensive reading list available on his website., If been using them for a long time, it may be hard to break the habit, but try to stop using racial slurs as soon as possible. This may sound obvious, but racial slurs and stereotypes are hurtful to people,even if they are not meant to be serious.Sometimes you may not even be aware that your language has a racial meaning. Terms like ""Chinese auction,"" ""Indian giver"" or calling a bad deal a ""gyp,"" a term derived from ""gypsy"", which is in itself a racial slur against Romani people, are considered offensive by many people.Racist jokes aren't funny. The fact that you don't mean it, or that you are only intending to be humorous, doesn't make it acceptable to use racist language or to stereotype others., In other words, don't treat other people's ethnic identities as costumes or fashion accessories.


Many consider it racist, for example, to dress up like a Native American for Halloween, or to wear feathered head dresses just for fun.Think about whether your fashion statement might be devaluing something that is valuable to another culture by treating it as just an amusing trend.

, Often times, racist behavior isn't about saying something nasty to another person, it's about less obvious behavior like not interviewing someone for a job because their name sounds foreign, or not sitting by someone on the bus because of their skin color.As you go through your day, think carefully about your own behaviors to make sure you aren't engaging in these subtler forms of racism.

, Studies have shown that our attitudes about people different from ourselves can be positively impacted through practicing mental exercises. This includes even the subtle and difficult to detect prejudices that are measured by the IAT.For example, if there's a race of people who you consider to be more dangerous than others, practicing saying the word ""safe"" in your head every time you see someone of that race.Over time, this can begin to change your attitude!

, Many people are afraid to talk about race and confront the difficult issues it may present. Research shows, however, that talking about these issues increases racial tolerance, especially among children.After you've done some research, it's a good idea to talk to people of races other than your own about their experiences. Listen and ask questions before sharing your views. The idea is to learn, not to teach.Remember that when people who have suffered from the effects of racism are sharing their experiences, you should not make the conversation about yourself or your guilt. Remember too that their experiences are not wrong just because they don't comport with your own.Remember to treat people of other races as individuals and avoid treating them as representatives of their race.Also remember that people of other races are not teachers of race relations and that they are not obligated to talk to you about racism.
If you have the opportunity, work on performing some task with people you are prejudiced against. Completing a task at work or school that requires working together toward a common goal can help bridge divides between people., A great way to start appreciating people different from yourself is to respectfully seek out experiences connected with their culture.


Having experiences with a variety of people, cultures, and environments makes them easier to understand and appreciate.Take time to observe (and hopefully appreciate) not only the differences, but also the similarities, between your culture and the the one you are experiencing. This has been shown in psychological experiments to decrease prejudice., These venues are a great place to work with others to improve not only your own racial attitudes, but also society at large.


Two of the larger organizations that work on these issues are the White Privilege Conference and the Anti-Racist Alliance.Check to see if there is an anti-racism group where you live. Getting actively involved in the struggle against racism will only increase your resolve to eliminate it within yourself.

, Changing your own attitude is important, but if you truly wish not contribute racial inequality, many believe you have a responsibility to actively challenge the racism of others.


For example, talk to others about their own racist attitudes. If you encounter people who have prejudiced views but are open to change, point them toward the same types of minority perspectives that you sought out in your own research on the issue.Challenge racist behavior when you see it. If someone you know uses a racial slur, tell them it is racist, and explain why it is a problem."

Understand sexism (and the different forms it takes).,
Listen!,
Create feminist spaces.,
Volunteer, if you are able.,
Support and mentor the women around you.",How to Help Women Facing Sexism1," Different kinds of women experience sexism in different ways. The problems Black women face are different from the problems Asian women face. Luckily, plenty of different women have written about the different problems in their communities! You can look it all up.;
, When a woman is telling you about her experiences with sexism, it is important to listen to her. Do not try to empathize - if you are not a woman, you cannot understand what sexism feels like. Instead, try to sympathize! Accept and validate her feelings, and ask her what people can do to prevent that situation from happening.

, This is not as formal or difficult as it sounds. This simply means confronting sexism when you see it - among your friends, your family, at your workplace. If you are a boss, you need to make sure the women you work with have their work recognized and, most importantly, feel safe and comfortable at work. If you are hosting a party or planning a convention, you need to make sure that the women at your even feel safe and comfortable. If you make art, you can incorporate feminist messages into it.

, Look for projects that address social ills or inequalities, especially ones that focus on women. Consider groups such as...


Women's shelters
Political action groups
Resources for rape/abuse survivors
Reproductive rights groups
Other causes you believe in

, Women face additional barriers due to sexism, so one way to help is to give them extra support. Be there for the women around you, and be kind and supportive. Help them when they're struggling, and cheer them on in their triumphs.

Volunteer to be an escort.,
Attend Planned Parenthood events.,
Apply to work for Planned Parenthood.",How to Support Planned Parenthood3," Pro-life protesters often camp outside of Planned Parenthood clinics, which makes it difficult and intimidating for people to find their way into the building and access the care they need. You can help these people access the healthcare professionals in the Planned Parenthood building by volunteering to be an escort. Escorts usually meet the patients at an arranged time and place and lead them into the building.If becoming an escort interests you, then call your local Planned Parenthood branch and ask how you can become an escort.
Keep in mind that as an escort, you may become the target of pro-life protesters, so you must be willing to endure some shouting and harassment. If this does not sound like something you can handle, then this might not be the best way for you to get involved.

, Your local chapter of Planned Parenthood might host events that you can get involved in. Try to stay abreast of what they have planned and attend them to show your support. You might also offer to help out with the event if they are looking for volunteers.


Check your local Planned Parenthood’s website for information about any upcoming events.
For example, if your local Planned Parenthood is putting on a talk by a guest speaker, then you might offer to set up chairs before the event.

, If you want to get involved in an even bigger way, then you might consider working for Planned Parenthood.Local Planned Parenthood chapters hire doctors and nurses to work in their clinics, along with support staff to work at the front desk. Or, you might consider working for Planned Parenthood as an accountant, call center representative, or grassroots organizer.

Put yourself in an exercising frame of mind.,
Decide whether you want to vary your exercise once you've reached your 10,000-step goal.,
Exercise in small increments.,
Make a commitment.,
Ignore exercise myths.,
Prepare before you exercise.",How to Exercise on the Volumetrics Diet2,"


Visualize yourself exercising or think about how good you will feel after a workout is complete.
Focus on increasing your daily steps rather than focusing on the intensity of the workout. For example, increase your daily steps by 150 per day so that you can add 1,000 new steps each week. This will help you to reach your Volumetrics goal of 10,000 steps per day.

, Evaluate whether you like to work out alone or with others, inside or outside, and in a relaxed way or in an intense way. Dr. Rolls recommends these activities, depending on your exercise personality:


Alone: Home exercise machine, walking, exercise DVD, pool walking
With others: Exercise class, Zumba, water aerobics, mall walking, play with kids or grandkids
Inside: Mall walking, gym workout, treadmill/elliptical or spinning
Outside: Nature walks, gardening, bicycling
Relaxed: Weeding, cleaning, strolling the neighborhood
Intense: Jogging, boot camp, singles tennis

, Everything you do counts, so if you, like many people, find it challenging to face longer workouts, then Dr. Rolls recommends splitting your activities up into more manageable chunks. Instead of setting aside 30 minutes for a walk, take 3 10-minute activity breaks each day.

, Writing down your activities is a major part of the Volumetrics philosophy.


Write your exercise time down on your calendar or on your to-do list. Make exercise as much a commitment as your other appointments.
Record your daily activity. Keeping a journal of your exercise, just as you are keeping a journal of your Volumetrics food intake, will help you to see how you have progressed over time. A journal will also keep you honest about how much exercise you are actually getting.

, As Dr. Rolls points out, many people think that exercise makes you tired or that losing weight requires a significant amount of exercise. In truth, even moderate exercise will energize you as well as help you to manage your appetite.

,


Buy yourself some comfortable exercise clothing and some new sneakers.
Download some new music to make the session more enjoyable.
Make a Volumetrics-friendly post-exercise snack before you start. For example, prepare a parfait of berries and Greek yogurt. Place the parfait in the refrigerator and then enjoy it when you finish your exercise routine.

Listen closely to women's experiences.,
Speak up when other men say sexist things.,
Amplify women's voices.",How to Help Women Facing Sexism2," When a woman talks about sexism, take her seriously and think carefully about she says. Ask questions if you're confused. Validate her feelings and show that you care what she has to say, even if you've never experienced what she is talking about.


Never tell her that her experiences didn't happen, or aren't true. This is gaslighting. Remember, just because you don't notice a thing doesn't mean that women don't, or that it never happens behind your back.

, It's tempting to just stay quiet and ignore it if guys are commenting on a coworker's figure or sharing a sexist joke. However, your silence sends the message that you're okay with this. Even a pointed frown will send the message that casual sexism isn't cool.


You can say ""That's not funny, it's rude,"" ""Knock it off, guys,"" or ""That's messed up.""
Remember, other guys probably think it's wrong too; they just aren't brave enough to say anything. You aren't the only one who's bothered.
Don't wait for a woman to speak up. Women might be hesitant to point out sexism because guys might get aggressive, or ignore her. Guys are more likely to be listened to, so use this power for good.

, Women often get talked over, so you can help by encouraging others to listen. Hand over the microphone, share insightful articles by women, and encourage people to listen to a woman when she is trying to speak.


Don't let people interrupt her or take credit for her ideas. Steer the conversation back to her, so that she can finish what she was saying. Say ""Yes, that's what Sharon was saying,"" ""Keisha  was telling us about _____,"" or ""I'd like to hear the rest of Gloria's thoughts.""

Be respectful to women of all types.,
Stand up against bullying and abuse.,
Stay informed about the news.,
Listen to people who disagree with you.,
Support women harmed by sexism.,
Step out of your comfort zone.,
Be gracious if you mess up.,
Stay humble.",How to Help Women Facing Sexism3," Avoid judging people based on their job (or lack thereof), clothing style, femininity, and other traits. Recognize that there are many different ways to be a woman, and one way isn't necessarily less valid than any other.


Harbor a ""live and let live"" attitude: your lifestyle is what works best for you, and their lifestyle is what's best for them.
Don't criticize people for being different from you. Erase words like ""slut,"" ""bossy,"" ""prude,"" ""welfare queen,"" ""special snowflake,"" et cetera, from your vocabulary.

, Being a feminist means supporting the equal dignity of all people, and protecting people from unfair treatment and harm.


Many of these instances occur along gendered, radicalized , and other oppressive lines.

, Know what's going on in your local area and your country. Education is critical for political participation, so take the time to read up on what's happening. Read from both left-leaning and right-leaning sources, so you can understand the different perspectives.


Read the facts and the opinions. Do you agree with the opinions? Why or why not? Why do you think people feel the way they do?
Share important news using social media or in person. Help other people stay informed.
If the news is harmful to your mental health, you don't have to make yourself read it. There are plenty of other ways you can stay engaged.

, Why do they think the way they do? What can you learn from them? Could they be right? If they're wrong, why? Listen closely, and take the opportunity to deepen your understanding of various issues.


Obviously, not all disagreements are valid. You don't have to listen to people who disagree with human rights or human dignity, such as people who believe ""Muslims are inherently evil"" or ""disabled people are a waste of space."" This is cruel and you don't have to listen to it.

, Sexism may impact a woman's opportunities, self-esteem, environment, et cetera. If a woman you know is having a hard time, support her. Remind her that she's awesome and that any sexism she faces in unfair and undeserved. Support from others can go a long way to helping her feel better.

, Listen to people whose perspectives and backgrounds are very different from yours. What do they say? Why do they think differently from you? What can you learn from them?

, Making mistakes is normal, and it's possible that you'll accidentally say or do something that hurts someone. (Just like how you might accidentally knock over someone's books.) Acknowledge your mistake, apologize, and move on.


Say something like ""I'm sorry. I messed up, and said something I didn't mean. I apologize.""
Don't beat yourself up. Your mistake is less important than how you responded to it. These things happen, and you're not a bad person.

, You don't know everything, and can't fix everything. Remember that many other people have different perspectives, and it's important to listen to them. Keep evaluating and re-evaluating your beliefs based on new information. Don't be afraid to say that you were wrong.

Look for stereotyping.Stereotyping is assigning certain qualities to people based solely on their race.,
Beware of hostility.Racism often manifests in the workplace as a hostile tone, behavior, or attitude toward workers of a certain race.,
Keep an eye out for unfair criticism.If a racial minority in the workplace is told consistently that their work is never good enough, it might be because of their race.,
Look for biased hiring practices.If you notice that there are few racial minorities employed in your workplace, the company might have racist hiring practices or management.",How to Recognize Racism1," Believing that all Asians are really good at math, for instance, is a stereotype. It makes no difference whether the stereotype assigns positive or negative qualities to a person — either way, it’s still a sign of racism.


People who stereotype others often make blanket statements using an “us” and “them” structure. For instance, you might hear a coworker or manager say, “They are all too lazy to work here.”;
, Either a manager or a coworker might perpetrate hostility against you because of your race. Racial hostility could take many forms, including:


Physical intimidation or abuse
Assigning workloads that are unequal to those of one’s peers (either more or less work)
Mocking an accent or way of speaking

, Racists might overreact to situations that are not a big deal, or react less critically to the same situation when someone of their race does the same thing.


Unfair criticism might result in harsh employee reviews and a failure to be promoted. Racial minorities in a workplace might not get a raise or be paid the same amount, even when their peers of a different race are moving up the ladder. Look for patterns in which individuals are not promoted.

, This is hard to notice unless you’re inside a company and privy to the hiring and interview practices of the company. Look out for people who, for instance, discard applications with “unusual” or ethnic names before even interviewing the individuals. This is a good indicator of racism.

Donate food items.,
Support organizations that distribute food.,
Take food directly to those in need.,
Get your employer involved.,
Fight stereotypes.",How to Take Action to End World Hunger1," There are lots of local organizations that will take food donations. They will then distribute those food items as needed. This is safest and easiest for you and these organizations will know the best ways to get the food to those most in need. There are lots of foods that are good to donate but canned food and a smaller portion of healthy, fresh food is best. Ask your local organization for what they need most.


If you have a membership to a bulk foods store like Costco, this is a great place to pick up food for donating. You’ll get more food for your money and it tends to be the kind of easy to store items that work well for distributing to the needy.
Local churches, soup kitchens, shelters, and even government organizations will take donations of food to redistribute to the needy. Find one that matches up with who you’re looking to help.;
, You can help those churches and shelters by doing more than just donating food too. They also need money to stay open and pay the people that work there. They often also need volunteers to help distribute the food. Ask them when you donate your food items about other ways that you can help.


For example, call your city and find out if you can help the local Meals On Wheels program deliver food.

, You don’t need to wait for a food shelter in order to distribute food items to people that you know are in need. Buy healthy food that doesn’t require anything to be prepared and take it to homeless people that you see in your daily activities. For example, buy a bunch of bananas and hand them out to the homeless people downtown.


Another common demographic of people that go hungry are the elderly. Older people living on their own often have limited money and may not be capable of cooking very much for themselves any more. If you know someone who’s very old and might struggle making themselves a good dinner, offer to bring and have dinner with them every now and again.
Good examples of foods to take include: sliced soft apples (like Gala), whole bananas, a portion of a loaf of whole grain bread, pop-open containers of tuna, soy nuts (bought in bulk, these a quite cheap and they contain a massive amount of nutrients in a very small serving), and pre-cut carrots (cut as thinly as possible).

, Many businesses will do donation matching. Talk to your boss about getting your business involved if they aren’t already. This will mean that any money or goods you do donate will be matched by your employer, effectively doubling the amount of good that you do.

, In more and more cities, you’re seeing laws put in place that actually ban feeding the homeless. The idea is that if they’re hungry, they’ll be more willing to work hard to get a job, stop taking drugs, and get back on their own two feet. However, the stereotype that homeless people are lazy people who just want to have fun and abuse every substance they can get their hands on is just that: a stereotype. People who are homeless may have many reasons for being so, most of those reasons being very complex and requiring more than just motivation to overcome. Starving these people will not help and you need to make sure people in your community understand that. Do your best to educate people and prevent this from happening.

Start small.,
Volunteer at a local shelter.,
Bring the humanitarian mindset to work with you.,
Spread the message on social media.,
Be consistent.",How to Be a Humanitarian1," You don’t have to travel to the other side of the globe to be a humanitarian. You can start by affecting change in your own neighborhood. Look at the community around you and try to identify humanitarian issues that you can help address. It could be helping the homeless or the hungry, volunteering at an after school program, or picking up litter.Look for things that you feel like you could help to improve.
If there is a lower income community in your area, think about what types of things you could do that could improve their standard of living.;
, There are homeless shelters and food banks in many larger communities that are always looking for volunteer help. Shelters for victims of abuse are also fairly common and need help organizing and executing fundraising and day to day operations. You can offer your time to these organizations as a way to pursue local humanitarian work.Look for a cause that you feel strongly about and volunteer your time at a local organization to help.
Humanitarian work can be done anywhere in the world, including your own neighborhood.
Try using websites like http://www.idealist.com to find local organizations that need volunteers.

, You can help humanitarian causes by getting the company that you work for involved. Organize a can drive at work, or start a collection of clothing to help the area’s under privileged. Many companies will not only authorize you to pursue humanitarian efforts at work, they may even encourage it because it improves perception of the organization in the community.Make sure to speak to your manager for permission before starting a program at work.
Reach out to local shelters and humanitarian organizations to see what is in high demand that you can attempt to help with.

, One of the biggest challenges facing humanitarian organizations all over the world is funding. You can help by engaging your friends and family on social media and encouraging them to donate to humanitarian causes. This is one aspect of humanitarian work you can do from home that can have a global reach.You can share content posted by your favorite humanitarian organizations.
Posting your own message about important causes with links to donate may help your message to reach people.

, Volunteering your time, skills, or resources here and there can be extremely rewarding, but consistency can help your efforts to compound. Instead of volunteering at a single event, or helping to raise funds one time, volunteer with consistency for local organizations that need your help. In order to be truly effective, humanitarian efforts must include both short terms and long term plans.Consistent humanitarian work can help you to develop a relationship with the people in your community that you are helping, which can be more rewarding for you both.
Every bit of your work counts. Over time, a few hours out of your Sunday afternoons can compound into a significant change for the people in your area.

Look for people who advocate segregation.Non-racists believe that all people, regardless of their skin color, are equal, and they have no problem living in a multicultural community.,
Be wary of fanatic nationalism or patriotism.,
Look for people who claim to be “color-blind.”The “color-blind” ideology is one that argues that because our schools and jobs are available for people of any race and gender, and because our laws apply to everyone equally, there is no need to acknowledge differences between races.",How to Recognize Racism2," Racists, on the other hand, believe that races should live separately and not mix with one another. This belief is based only on racism, not on fact.


Racists might try moving to or starting communities where there are few or no racial minorities.Racists might also discourage or disapprove of interracial relationships or marriages.

, Fanatic patriotism and nationalism may go hand-in-hand with the belief that only certain races can truly feel patriotic or be loyal to a Western nation. These individuals believe that for a country to be united, the citizens must share a racial background.Nazi Germany is a good example of a right-wing nationalist state that had extremely racist policies.
However, don't assume that because a person is patriotic they are also racist.

, The problem with this point of view is that laws are applied differently depending on the person's race.


The counter-protest movement “All Lives Matter,” for instance, is an example of racist color-blind ideology. It is opposed to the “Black Lives Matter” movement that seeks to address the disparities of opportunity for people of color in the United States.
Color-blind ideology serves to make the struggles of racial minorities invisible by pretending racial discrimination is a thing of the past.

"
"
Pay attention to the response during high-profile racial incidents.After a racially-related incident, many will try to justify the situation in order to make the racial minority look like the villain.,
Stay attentive to structural racism.It is easy to detect racism when examining the social structures of society.,
Look for double standards.If a racist sees someone of their own race do or say something harmless, but worthy of criticism, they might pay it no mind; however, if someone of another race does the same thing, the racist person might be extremely angry and critical.",How to Recognize Racism3," For instance, after Michael Brown, a black man, was killed by white police, media and (more frequently) internet commentators claimed that the violence against Brown was justified.


Many people use such opportunities to go beyond simply justifying situations that have racial overtones to claiming that every member of a certain race ought to meet a similar fate. These racist statements are an easy way to recognize racism.
The same people who are unsympathetic to violence or injustice against minorities are often quick to draw attention to violence or perceived injustices against people of their own race.

, Take a step back when thinking about the accessibility and equality of social institutions. You will quickly recognize racism at their very core.


In economics, for instance, you might notice that the average household income for black Americans is close to half ($35,400 annually) what it is for whites ($60,250). The average median household income for Hispanics, similarly, is well below that of whites, at $42,500 per year.The educational system, likewise, is steeply stacked against certain racial minorities. Far fewer blacks than whites attend college, and blacks drop out of high school at higher rates than their white peers.Think about arrest rates or how often people are stopped by police. Racial minorities are consistently stopped more than whites, even though they make up a smaller percentage of the population.

, Racism is behind this double standard.


For instance, if a black politician says, “We don’t need to spend any more education,” he or she might be criticized by white media and citizens; however, if a white politician says the same thing, there might be less outrage simply because they are white.

"
"
Question frequent references to race.You can recognize racism in everyday speech when someone often notes another person’s race when talking about them.,
Listen for racist jokes.Racism is often packaged in the form of rude, racist jokes.,
Look for denial.Denying that a racial minority can achieve certain things is a hallmark of racism.,
Pay attention to racist comments.Racist comments often take the form of, “I’m not a racist, but .,
Examine privilege and intersectionality.",How to Recognize Racism4," For instance, you might hear a comment like, “That black fellow, James, was walking around.” Framing the conversation with references like this serves to indicate that (in the opinion of the speaker) there is something odd or strange about the person just because their race is different. This is a racist way of speaking and thinking.


This might also take the form of an implied or explicit surprise that racial minorities have achieved something. A backhanded compliment like, “You’re well-read for a Hispanic,” is, at the very least, a sign of ignorance, and probably a sign of racism.

, Some racists assume that others of their race will share their racist views, and tell jokes that mock, stereotype, or criticize people of a different race.


Typically, when someone expresses disgust or outrage at racial jokes, the offending party will often insist that the person who does not find the jokes funny needs to “relax” or should “learn to take a joke.”, There are many examples of this. For instance, many believe that President Obama only got into Harvard because of affirmative action policies, rather than because of his innate intelligence and ability. This perspective is — intentionally or unintentionally — based in racism.

, . .” followed by a blatantly racist comment. People who make these comments are aware that they sound racist because they are racist. Recognize qualifying statements and racist rhetoric for what they are: ignorant racism.

, When presented with the idea that a white person has certain advantages over others based solely on their race (such as the assumption that any failings or flaws will not be attributed to your race), a racist person may fail to take responsibility or acknowledge those benefits. The person may feel threatened and become defensive, insisting they do not benefit from racism.Being privileged by your race does not mean you haven't experienced discrimination in other ways. Intersectionality acknowledges that a person may enjoy some privileges based on being white and that they can also experience discrimination based on their gender, class, sexual orientation, disabilities, etc.
Acknowledging white privilege doesn't mean a person hasn't suffered hardships or worked hard for what they have accomplished.
Denying the existence of white privilege or that white people are given certain advantages limits progress and cooperation when trying to eradicate racism.If the suggestion of white privilege causes someone to become angry and talk about all the ways they have struggled, this is a subtle form of racism.

Educate yourself and stay informed.,
Keep an open mind.,
Find your voice.,
Create dialogue.",How to Overcome Racism1," Consider that racist stereotypes are largely rooted in ignorance. Confront ignorance with truth. Try to keep an open mind and step outside of your shell. Learn as much as you can about other races, languages, and cultures. Knowledge is power.


Read the news, and not just from a single source. Absorb as many perspectives as possible. Carefully consider the bias behind each source.
Don't hold it in. Share what you learn with your friends, family, and larger community. Learn to teach and teach to learn.;
, Accept others, even if they don't accept you. You do not need to become ""colorblind"" – you can appreciate other races and cultures for the things that make them unique. Embrace uniqueness wherever you encounter it.

, The ubiquity of the Internet makes it easier than ever to reach, teach, and influence people beyond your normal sphere of interaction. Share articles, videos, and stories on social media; find a platform to blog or otherwise broadcast your perspective; and generally consider how your online presence feeds or fights the dialogue of racial imbalance. Look for ways to speak out in your school, neighborhood, or workplace. Encourage your family, friends, and broader community to respect and accept individuals from different backgrounds.


Be careful about what and how you post on the Internet. Your social media presence may be much more public than you realize. Consider the dangers of provoking the ire of anonymous strangers.

, Listen to people from all races and cultures. Find the things that you have in common, and seek to understand what divides you. Strive to curate a peaceful and respectful conversation about racism – a conversation that includes and empowers everyone.Understand that we must work in collaboration to create a safe and inclusive society.

, You might be able to donate using a charitable or other trust to give to the NILC. A charitable trust is “irrevocable,” meaning that once you make the gift you cannot change your mind.You should talk about these options with your estate attorney as well as with the staff at the NILC. For example, consider the following:


Charitable remainder trust. You can transfer assets to a trust and the trust pays you income, usually for life. At your death, the assets will pass to NILC.Charitable lead trust. You transfer assets to the trust, and the trust pays income to the charity. At the end of a specified period of time, the assets transfer back to you or your beneficiaries.

Do some research to better understand where and what help is needed.,
Be careful what food products you buy.,
Donate to the right charities.,
Buy Fair Trade.,
Support immigration reform.,
Use your skills to volunteer.",How to Take Action to End World Hunger2," As with most things, if you go into a situation with only your assumptions or outright bad information, you're likely to cause harm or at least not do any good. This applies to methods for solving hunger too. Certain types of donations in some regions are fuel for conflict with warlords. While you might want to help people in one country, you might actually be able to help three or four times as many people by helping in another country. World hunger is not a simple problem and the solution isn't just as simple as sending cans to Africa: just as with most complex problems, you'll need information if you want to leave a real impact.


Check out sites like the United Nations World Food Programme to learn more about the hunger situation in the world.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also do good work on educating about world hunger. See their site for more information.

, When some products are bought in large amounts, it can actually harm the areas where those foods are grown.There are many reasons for this. Sometimes growing too much of the same thing is bad for the soil but farmers do it anyway because it's the only way to survive. Other times, it can deplete the amount of food available for the people in that region, if the crop had previously been used for locals. Either way, your best bet is to buy mainly local food and supplement your diet with these popular superfoods.

, There are more than a few ""charities"" out there that say they help solve world hunger but actually spend most of the money you give them on CEO paychecks. You also want your money to go towards long-term solutions, rather than just a band aid. This is why it's important to give to charities which are reliable and use the money in a way that helps communities long term. Teach a man to fish and all that.


One great charity that you can donate to is Heifer International. This allows you to donate farm animals to people in need, allowing them to start producing their own food so that they are not reliant on continued donations.
Another good option is Charity: Water. This charity provides clean water to communities, meaning that not only can they drink safely, but that all of their food can be made more safely.
Kivais a microfinance organization through which you can make loans to entrepreneurs in the developing world, so they can grow their businesses. You can donate very small amounts, and when you are repaid you can lend the same money out to someone different. These businesses often revolve around providing food for families and communities, so this is another effective charity.

, Items marked Fair Trade with the international Fair Trade symbol are a great way for you to help feed other people while you eat. How? Fair trade items are bought from producers, like Guatemalan farmers, at a price that is fair for that region. It means that the company buying the goods also invests money in those communities to improve their lives, education, and access to supplies. This means that these people will have more money with which to buy things like food for their families.


Buying a lot of items like this also sends a message to companies. As consumers, we can use our money as our voice. If enough people are buying these kinds of products, then more of them will be offered.

, You don't have to support letting everyone who calls at the border into the country but supporting some laws which change how immigration works can significantly improve the lot of people who live outside your country as well. Immigration reform, which regulates the work that non-citizens can do and how much money they can make, helps ensure that they get enough money to feed themselves and their family. The reasons why immigration effects hunger are two-fold:


People from poorer countries used to frequently provide labor in wealthier countries before returning to their own. Now, with heavily guarded borders and stricter immigration laws, fewer people that get into a country can get back out.This means that they have less opportunity to bring the money they earn to their families.
The other problem is that strict immigration laws create a situation in which unscrupulous employers can pay illegals next to nothing and under the table, meaning that those people go hungry even though they work hard.

, If you have valuable skills, like knowledge of farm equipment, horticulture, construction, project management, or fundraising: donate your time. Organizations often want to do good work but lack the people with the necessary skills to help the communities they travel to. If you know how to do anything like this, taking a month to travel to a remote location and help set up a farm can be a huge help.


Even if you don't have these skills, you can help with your money. Throw a fundraiser and donate that money to some of the charities that we've mentioned. What you don't want to do is travel overseas to do volunteer work that you have no experience with. This can often weigh a project down.

Do away with selfishness.,
Value human welfare.,
Free yourself from any prejudices.,
Maintain a professional demeanor.,
Seek and embrace new experiences and challenges.",How to Be a Humanitarian2," Being a humanitarian is about action, but your intentions matter too. Pursuing work that helps others with the intent of gaining something like recognition or influence isn’t the purpose of being a humanitarian. Instead, look for ways to benefit others without placing an emphasis on what you may get in return. In order to be a capable humanitarian, you need to demonstrate tolerance, cultural understanding and altruism.

Approach humanitarian work with a mindset of giving, helping, and hope to improve the world around you.
Don’t focus on what you can gain from your effort, focus on what your community can gain.

, The nature of humanitarian work is to pursue ways to end human suffering in all forms. In order to do so, you must learn to appreciate the value in saving lives, relieving suffering, and helping to maintain human dignity. Try to imagine yourself in the difficult positions of the people you seek to help to better empathize with their situations.It’s important that you learn to show empathy for all people.
Valuing human welfare can help you to overcome the discomfort of helping people in difficult situations and environments.

, A humanitarian must value human life in all forms. That means letting go of any prejudices or generalizations you may find yourself making about groups of people. All people, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, religion or race deserve to live a life that is free from suffering, and it’s the humanitarian’s job to help make that happen.It is not uncommon for people to grow up with misconceptions about groups of people they have never met, but you must actively engage and overcome these ideas.
A humanitarian values all human life equally and works to alleviate suffering equally worldwide.

, Humanitarians need to carry themselves in a professional manner in the field as well as the office. Each organization has its own set of guidelines to aid in your understanding of professional behavior, but it is all based in the concept that all humanitarian workers should adhere to common standards in order to maximize their effectiveness in a crisis.Carrying yourself in a professional manner means maintaining an ethical standard and demonstrating respect for all you encounter.
Being professional also means following the local laws and regulations as well as those enforced by your organization.

, Humanitarian work can lead you all over the globe and take you on exciting adventures, but it can also present some extremely difficult challenges. In order to be an effective humanitarian, you must seek new ways to solve problems and overcome obstacle and find the value in creating relationships with new people.Meeting new people and facing new issues can be a way of life for humanitarians.
Embracing the experiences that are inherent to these challenges can help you to overcome them.

Determine what skills you can offer.,
Choose a cause to support.,
Look for an organization that supports your cause of choice.,
Contact the organization of your choice.,
Raise money for your trip.,
Plan your trip thoroughly and take the necessary precautions.,
Share what you have learned.",How to Be a Humanitarian3," Humanitarian efforts need all kinds of skill sets, all over the planet. You may already possess a skill or trade that could be extremely helpful to the right cause. Take an inventory of your qualifications and use that to inform your search for a volunteer opportunity. Volunteering to share your expertise can help you make the biggest impact possible with your time and effort.You may want to consider volunteering in the same field you work in. Whether you work on a construction site or in a cubicle, there’s likely an organization in need of your skill set.
Consider what other skills you possess that may be helpful. Skills like leadership, problem solving, or any technical skill are always in high demand.

, There are many different organizations and causes you can choose to volunteer for, so it’s important to find one that you’re passionate about. Volunteering overseas is a significant commitment, so finding a cause that matters to you can help alleviate the stress of leaving your home behind for a short time. Here are some common areas people volunteer their efforts for:Marine Conservation
Wildlife Conservation
Teaching and Education
Community Development
Healthcare
Environmental Conservation

, Once you have identified a cause you’d like to work for, start looking for organizations that support that cause. Many organizations have volunteer programs to help get you placed in an area you can help. Make sure to research the organization you choose to volunteer for extensively, as your safety should be a top priority.Find volunteer opportunities online in databases like the one found here: http://www.workingabroad.com/database

Once you find an organization you like, look for news stories about it online. It can help you to better understand the organization and shed light on any issues the organization has had recently.

, Many organizations have outreach professionals whose job it is to help you plan your volunteer experience. Because each organization has different procedures, these people can walk you through the steps necessary to get on your way to providing aid in a part of the world that needs your help. You can also contact third party organizations like Working Abroad who can help get you started on the right track.Look for contact information on the webpage of the organization you choose.
Ask questions to make sure you have all of your important concerns addressed like how you will travel there, where you will stay and what expenses are involved.

, There are a number of expenses involved in volunteering to work for overseas humanitarian causes. You will likely be responsible for the costs of your transportation to and from the region of the world you volunteer in. Many organizations also charge a program fee to offset the cost of providing you with housing and food during your time abroad. These costs can vary dramatically depending on the organization you volunteer for and the distance you need to travel. You can get a good sense of how much you will need to raise by speaking to a volunteer coordinator within the organization you will be working with.Try using a fundraising website like GoFundMe.com or Classy.org to raise money for your trip.
Ask friends, family and coworkers to help support your cause by donating toward the cost of your trip.
Write letters to business owners or individuals in your community that you think may be willing to help.

, Before leaving for a humanitarian aid trip, it’s important the you plan things thoroughly. Start by making an appointment with your doctor or a travel medicine specialist to receive any immunizations that may be necessary for the region you’re traveling to. Make sure to speak to your volunteer coordinator about what to expect so you can pack the necessary equipment and let your family know your plans.Make sure your coordinator tells you what kind of traveling you can expect to do and in what regions of the world so you can appropriately prepare for the trip.
You may want to have a dental checkup before you leave as well, to ensure your trip is not hindered by an unexpected dental emergency.

, Your humanitarian trip will likely change the way you view the world around you, and it’s important that you share that message with others upon your return. Studies have shown that humanitarian trips can increase reflexive learning about external factors effecting the world as well as internal factors that affect our perception. By sharing your experiences, you can encourage others to take similar trips, thus expanding their perspectives as well.Sharing your experiences can help encourage others to volunteer their time and skills as well.
The experience you gain as a volunteer can also help lead to a career in humanitarian service.

Put together a good résumé.,
Search for positions you’re qualified for on job board websites.,
Ace the interview.,
Embrace working in the home office.",How to Be a Humanitarian4," If you don’t have extensive volunteer work to pull from, you will likely need a master’s degree from an accredited institution in order to find a career in humanitarian work. It can be an extremely competitive field to find work, so having an advanced degree in a field that is of particular benefit to the organization you want to work for can help.Advanced degrees in engineering, accounting, or other in demand fields are always sought after.
A master’s degree or higher in humanitarian related fields such as food security is a great way to get in the door.

, You will need to apply to a position within a humanitarian organization just like any other job, so the first step should be to make sure you have an updated and well put together résumé. Make sure to highlight your skills and experiences that make you a valuable addition to a non-government organization’s team.

Create a cover letter that speaks to your passion about the organization you apply to, as well as the cause they support.

, You can find careers in the humanitarian industry on most traditional job boards like Indeed.com or Monster.com, but there are also specialized job boards you can visit that allow people to post only positions in non-government, humanitarian organizations. You may also want to create a LinkedIn account to help you look for positions.Try visiting Reliefweb.int, Trust.org or DevNetJobs.org for international humanitarian job postings.
If there is a particular organization you have in mind, look on their website for open positions.

, Once you are able to get an interview to work for the humanitarian organization of your choice, make sure to prepare beforehand.

Intervene.,
Document injustice.,
Keep a level head.",How to Overcome Racism2," Do not take racism lying down. Act on your beliefs when you come across injustice, prejudice, and discriminatory words. Call out racism when you see it. Don't be afraid to stand up for someone who is being mistreated!


Use your words, your actions, and your influence. Be bold, but be smart. Think about how you can intervene most effectively.

, Keep a cell phone camera handy, and take video footage of any oppressive acts that you encounter. Do not be afraid to videotape law enforcement officers if you feel that they are physically or verbally oppressing a civilian. Broadcast the truth. Show your friends, tell your story, and post your footage to social media.


If you can't take video, take photos or record audio. At the very least, pay close attention. A solid eyewitness account is better than nothing.

, React with intention, and advocate nonviolently. Try to hold your cool and maintain perspective in the face of deep injustice. Do not submit, but be careful about acting with anger. Sometimes, it's best to slow down and consider the wisest way to react. Find your center and work from there.Take your cues from nonviolent activists like Rosa Parks, Nelson Mandela, Harriet Tubman, and Martin Luther King, Jr.: men and women who used their frustration to help people rather than hurt people. Each day, be the change that you wish to see in the world.
Consider that anger often arises in response to anger. Ask yourself whether, by reacting angrily, you will actually solve the problem – or only feed the cycle of anger.

Understand why people look different.,
Consider the evolutionary root of racism.,
Read about the modern history of institutional racism.",How to Overcome Racism3," The history of humanity is the story of people that, over tens of thousands of years, migrated from the jungles and savannas of Africa into Europe and the vast sweep of Asia; navigated ships through the islands of Polynesia using the currents and the stars; followed the hunt from Siberia, across the frozen-over Bering Strait, into the wild heart of North America; and spread, by roughly 10,000 years ago, across the whole grand span of the Americas – to the tip of Tierra del Fuego. Everywhere that our ancestors went, some people stayed and some people eventually moved on. The people that stayed adapted to their environment in various ways: people in cold northern climes, with less sunlight, developed lighter hair and skin, while people living nearer the equator tended to produce more melanin to protect their skin from the heat.


Look past these superficial differences at the underlying DNA. From South Africa to Siberia, Bangladesh to Brazil, Canada to Kazakhstan: we are all genetically homo sapiens. We are all human., Some say that there was once a tribal function to discrimination. When groups of ancestral, pre-modern humans were competing for resources and territory, there may have been real danger in the inability to distinguish between someone from your ""own"" group and someone from another, potentially hostile group. Studies of our ape cousins have shown a similar distrust for individuals from a rival group. Consider the thought, however, that while this tendency may have come about for a reason, it is not necessarily something that still serves our species., Understand that laws and individuals have been discriminating against non-white human beings for hundreds of years in the United States alone. Learn about the abolition of slavery, the Jim Crow years, the Civil Rights Movement, and the ways that racism has persisted through it all. Read the news and stay up date about the events that people are talking about. Learn to connect the dots of systemic injustice from the past to the present."

Research human rights causes.,
Visit Amnesty International’s website.,
Make a list.,
Decide on a cause.",How to Be a Human Rights Activist1," Learn which causes are important to you by conducting research online or talking to family or friends you know who volunteer or care about human rights issues. By researching and learning about various areas of human rights activism, you may find a cause that you are passionate about that you did not previously know about.


Use the internet to conduct an online search of human rights activism. You can use a search engine to search for “human rights activism,” “human rights issues,” or “human rights volunteering.” The results that come up should give you an idea of what human rights causes, groups, and issues are out there.
You can use an online search engine to search for famous human rights activists to become inspired by the work of other great activists, such as Martin Luther King Jr. or Nelson Mandela.
Talk to family or friends who are human rights activists and ask them how they volunteer and what areas they focus on and why. You can learn a lot by listening to others speak about issues that are very meaningful to them.;
, Amnesty International is the world’s largest organization for human rights. Their website contains plenty of information about human rights issues. By visiting their website, you can learn about the violations of human rights in the United States and around the world.Go to www.amnestyusa.org.
Click on “Get Involved” in the top menu.
Click on “Issues” in the menu on the left side of the page.

Click on one of the issues to learn more about it. Reading about the different areas of human rights will give you a better understanding of what you would like to focus on.

, Using a sheet of paper and a pen or pencil or using a Microsoft Word document, write down or type the causes that mean a lot to you. There may be several causes or there may be just a few.


Narrow the list of causes to one or two that mean the most to you. By narrowing your focus, you will be able to fully lend yourself to a cause, which will be the most beneficial to you and the people you would like to help.
For example, if you care about LGBT rights, censorship, refugee and migrant rights, women’s rights, and the death penalty, you might choose one or two that are the most directly relevant to you, such as censorship and women’s rights. You can also narrow this down by picking the one that you feel the most passionate about.

, By choosing a cause to dedicate yourself to, you will be more likely to make a difference in your chosen area. This is because you will have more time and resources to dedicate to this particular cause, rather than spreading your time and resources too thin by being involved in several causes.

Make the message age-appropriate.",How to Talk About Race," One of the most important parts of discussing race includes taking an open approach to understanding race, especially from a different viewpoint than your own. Be willing to hear from someone who has different experiences, religious views, economic means, and family lives than your own. Listen with curiosity and be willing to accept what they say about their own struggles or privileges.Don't shy away when race comes up in conversation, especially people who are a different race from you.If you are not used to talking about race, you might be startled when it comes up. It's perfectly okay to express this. You might say, ""I want to have this conversation with you! Forgive me if I'm a little slow in my responses, my family never talked about race or racism.""
Be objective and open to learning about another culture, race, and ethnicity that is completely different than your own. These conversations should not be about ‘winning a debate’ or trying to persuade or convince them into understanding your point of view. It should be about learning and understanding.;
, Be mindful of your own personal internalized assumptions, thoughts, and emotions. Do not assume that others who you perceive to be within your own racial group will have the same opinions, beliefs, values, or perspectives and experiences as you do.

If you are speaking to a racial group that is different from your own, don’t assume that this racial group is unable to relate to your experiences and perceptions.
Eliminating assumptions and becoming more mindful of your internalized thoughts can help you to avoid any misunderstandings and prevent any hurt feelings during a conversation.

, If someone is sharing their experience with you, validate them and how they feel. For example, if someone went to a restaurant and was treated disrespectfully, listen to them talk about it. When you validate someone’s experience, it helps them feel like they are accepted, which is especially important after feeling mistreated.Don’t offer answers, make excuses for how they were treated, minimize their experience, or judge them. Just listen and say, “I’m sorry you had to go through that.”
Practice active listening, especially when a difficult or an emotionally charged issue arises. Focus on the person speaking and do your best to fully understand their personal viewpoint, rather than planning your next response to their statement.
When they have finished speaking their concern, paraphrase what you felt you understood from their concerns. Examples include: “If I understood you correctly, you feel….”, “I may have misunderstood, but from what I am hearing you stated that….”, “What I heard you say was….Is this what you meant?”

, Racial experiences are often very personal and sensitive, so don’t be surprised if there are misunderstandings or disagreements. The important thing is to remain calm and not escalate the situation. Take some deep breaths before moving forward, or take a few moments to collect your thoughts.If things get heated, excuse yourself and take a few moments to settle before returning to the conversation. This will help you control your impulses and avoid saying something that could hurt.
If you start to get upset, see if there is anything you can clarify what you’re saying or understand the other person better.

, Whether you’re defending yourself or someone else, learn to be sensitive to racist remarks and find ways to respond. Stand up for yourself or for someone who experiences a racial slur or other demeaning experience. Say, “That’s not okay to say” or “Please don’t speak like that.”


Find ways to get involved in big and small changes in your school, workplace, community, or government.

, Everyone struggles with being sensitive to other people. If someone accuses you of saying something racist, listen to them and apologize if you offended them. If you’re unclear about what you said that was wrong, ask them. If they seem upset about what you said, apologize and be more sensitive in their presence.


If you say insensitive things that people react negatively to, ask yourself if you think or say racist things, even if you don’t mean to be offensive.
If you know someone who calls people out about racist remarks, start a conversation with them and learn from them.

, Before diving into a discussion about race, ethnicity, or the diversity between cultures, it is important to understand your purpose for the conversation. Be clear with yourself and others about what you are trying to accomplish, as this will help you set the tone and guide the conversation accordingly. For instance:

Are you attempting to learn for yourself or teach others about a particular race, culture, or ethnicity?
Are you trying to convince others about your knowledge and perspective?
Do you have concerns with a particular race, ethnicity or culture, and are desiring to unload some of your pent up emotions with others?

, Especially if you’re talking with a group of people, set some rules so that everyone will respect one another. Create rules as a group. For example, suggest that participants not interrupt and let one person speak at a time. If things get heated, you take some time to process emotions before moving on.Everyone should know what behavior is acceptable and unacceptable when talking about race. Because talking about race can be very personal, it’s important that everyone respects one another and that the discussion does not get out of hand.

, Have a quick discussion about what it means to be respectful and treat others with respect. Discussions about race can polarize quickly, so make sure everyone involved knows to be respectful of one another. Make some examples of how to disagree respectfully with someone., A moderator can be helpful when talking about race in groups, such as in a classroom or office. Choose someone who is knowledgeable about issues regarding race. This person will shut down any comments that are hurtful or derogatory and move the conversation along if it goes off topic.A moderator can let people know when comments are disrespectful or need to be phrased differently.
The moderator may have specific questions to ask or choose activities for people to do.

, Let everyone know that they have a voice and are free to express their thoughts and opinions about race. Discussions about race aren’t just for people who feel in the margins, they are for everybody. Getting everyone involved means that different perspectives can be shared.Even if people don’t verbally contribute, consider asking participants to journal their thoughts or feelings before and after the discussion.
Encouraging everyone to contribute helps people realize that they are not alone in their experiences and that they might have beliefs or biases they didn’t realize they held.

, When talking to someone or a group about race, affirm their values. For example, state that the people present work hard to contribute to their families and country and strive to improve themselves and their community. Try to connect emotionally with the people present and recognize things that are important to them.Affirm “shared fate,” meaning that anyone suffers when they lose their job, raise children on their own, or get sent to prison, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or religion.

, Define some words before or during the discussion. Some words to be sure everyone understands can include, “stigma,” “stereotype,” “bias,” or “mass incarceration.” Depending on your discussion, you can bring up specific events or words which you might define, such as “caste” or “Jim Crow.”Don’t assume people understand everything you say. Define any terms you think people might not know. For example, say, “Jim Crow refers to repressive laws and segregation in the southern USA.”

, Be sure to be aware and acknowledge whatever fears or concerns you or others may have up front with discussing race. If you take the time to be aware, acknowledge, and become mindful of each other’s fears through discussion, you can agree ahead of time on various ways to help lessen them.

Agree to avoid calling another person racist or ignorant, or agree to validate other’s feelings and experiences.
For instance, if you are speaking to others who are predominantly ‘white’, some of them may fear that they would unintentionally say something offensive about another race (such as Native American or African American).
Another example could be that the non-dominant racial group may fear that if they DID speak up, their viewpoints would not be valued by the others.

, Talk about racial problems directly. If they directly impact members of the group, say how they do. For example, in a university setting, you can say, “Minorities tend to be underrepresented in high education.” Talk about specific problems and how they relate to a historical context.Allow people to share their own views on how issues of race impact them and the community at large.

, Some people subscribe to stereotypes without being aware of their beliefs. Yet, even “positive stereotypes” (like Asians are good at math) can be hurtful. Talk about pervasive stereotypes and subtle stereotypes, discussing how they impact individuals and groups as a whole.Talk about how stereotypes are perpetuated by news, movies, and music.

, A person’s race and class impact personal experiences. It is important for any conversation that involves discussion about race to also take into consideration the person’s socio-economic background as well as their personal experiences and perspectives.

For instance, a person who is of a minority race, and who comes from an advantaged family may not have experienced economic disparities and hardships. However, they could still share the same experiences, such as targeting, discrimination, and microaggressive behaviors that others in their racial group may have experienced.
Another example would be that white people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have experienced oppression and discrimination based on their socioeconomic status, yet they would not have the same experience with race-based discrimination as someone who is of color.

, Privilege refers to any an unmerited or unearned advantage over other people. Being born with privilege doesn’t make a person ‘good’ or ‘bad’ or more or less worthy as humans. However, it’s important to acknowledge privilege when discussing race. Talk about how privilege affects people of different races. Ask people what privileges exist, and which ones they have or wish they had.For example, talk about how having an ‘ethnic sounding’ name affects job opportunities, or how some people tend to be more suspicious or trusting of people depending on their race.

, Your own experiences with race growing up likely impact the way you experience race and racism now. Many families don’t talk about race or are uncomfortable discussing issues. Perhaps you were raised in a biracial family, so issues may have been more readily discussed. Think about how your attitudes growing up affect how you approach race now.


Think about the people who influenced your attitudes about race, and whether they were positive or negative experiences.

, While process-oriented approaches can help people understand their values and experiences, they don’t provide any solutions. Solutions can be practical and also feel accessible to people. People can think of large, systemic solutions ways to subtly respond to racism in their communities. Brainstorm ways that people can contribute to finding solutions and responding to negative experiences.Letting people create solutions helps them feel involved and invested in making changes.

, If you are trying to solve problems (on a small or large scale), find some solutions and commit to seeing them through. For example, if you’re a school organization and want more diversity in your group, commit to expanding your parameters and meeting more people who are interested in the group who come from racially diverse backgrounds.Brainstorm ways to contribute to change and make direct efforts to complete the changes.

, A child might say something horrifically racist, but don’t shame them. Instead, create a dialogue and let them know what was upsetting about what they said. Being observant, thinking about, and talking about race should be okay and safe. If your child comes to you with a question or comment about race, invite them to talk about it further. This can help your child feel comfortable in their own skin and help them accept others.Additionally, teach your child to avoid guilt and blame. We are all born and socialized into a society that we did not create. Thus, it serves no purpose to feel guilty or blame ourselves or others. Teach your child instead to work toward making things better for everyone. This allows your children and yourself to focus your energy in a more productive and positive direction.
If your child says something offensive, set them straight. For example, say, “Your friend looks like she does because one of her parents is Black and the other is Asian. She’s mixed-race. If you tell her you think she doesn't look like her mom, you might make her feel bad, even though there's nothing bad about it.”

, When discussing race with children, look for teachable moments to bring up race and treating people fairly. Your child might notice or say something about a child who looks different or acts different at school or on the playground.When talking to your child, ask them to notice not only the differences but also the similarities. For example, say, “How are they different from you? What about the ways they are the same?”
If you want to discuss race further with your child, read books that discuss race. Find books that discuss mixed-race families, being adopted into a family that’s a different race, and feeling different at school around race.

, Kids may not be ready to talk about systemic problems that lead to different economic advantages. However, you can discuss issues like slavery with a young child. For a preschool or young school child, try talking about fairness, as this is often a big theme in children’s lives.For example, you can say, “Some people think others are somehow less important due to the color of their skin. That doesn’t sound very fair, does it?”
If your child comes to you with a difficult question, don’t hesitate to say, “Let me think about that and we can talk about it later.” Do some research or gather your thoughts so that you can answer their question truthfully and thoughtfully in a way they can understand.

Going without food
Giving up technology (TV, radio, computer or other IT device, MP3 player, even lights and electrical appliances)
Not using furniture (chairs, beds, etc.)
Giving up free time or play time by doing chores around the house without pay
Some participants have even gone without sleep for 40 hours, but this is not recommended.
This is just a list of suggestions. You can invent your own challenge. Just be smart about it. Don't do anything dangerous. The point is not to be daring; it's to raise money and awareness for the underprivileged.
If you are a minor and choose to go without food, make sure your parents are well aware of this fact and approve of your choice.

If you'd rather just play and donate anonymously, that's fine too.

, Assuming you've chosen the vocabulary quiz, it's as simple as clicking on the choice of word that you think is right:

Look for the English vocabulary quiz.






Start clicking on what you think the answer is. You'll either be correct or not. If correct, the bowl of rice gains 10 grains for each correct answer.






If not correct, the bowl doesn't gain any grains but don't worry––the question will return for you to get it right this time. Indeed, your desire to add grains of rice to the bowl should help you to remember the meaning of the word from this point forth!







, The grains of rice you've added will be evident from your total under the rice bowl. To keep a check on your overall total over all the days you've played, click on the tab ""My Account"" and the drop down tab ""View Profile"". This will show your profile page, which also includes the total of grains you've earned.


Don't worry too much about the levels to begin with. The site automatically adjusts the levels as you go. A correct question increases your level, a wrong question takes you back to an easier level. You can also manually manipulate the level using the button ""Change level"" at the base of the quiz.







, It doesn't have to be spelling or vocabulary. The site has expanded considerably since it began in 2007 to include other fields of knowledge and includes languages beyond English, geography questions (flags of the world, identifying countries on the map and world capitals), math, humanities and chemistry. The categories can be found here: http://freerice.com/category.

Simply click on the ""Subjects"" tab in the bar at the top of the page and select the quizzes that interest you most. This can be a good way to sustain interest in a single visit, as your attention tends to flag after a while of choosing the vocabulary answers.






As with the vocabulary quiz, each correct answer will earn you 10 grains of rice in the bowl.







, Visit http://freerice.com/about or http://freerice.com/group/rankings/players to find out who is donating the most rice at any current time. This is a great incentive to catch up!


You'll also notice that it's possible to join groups who are donating through this way too––see http://freerice.com/groups for a list of groups. If a group interests you, simply click on it. You'll be taken to the group page and you can click ""join"" after you've learned some more about the group.






At the base of a group page, you'll be able to see the statistics for how many grains of rice have been given in any particular year. If you've participated in that count, feel proud about your meaningful contribution!






You can also make your own group if you'd like. Simply click on ""Groups"" in the bar at the top of the page and then ""Create Group"" in the drop down menu. Naturally, you need to join as an individual first.







, Try to remember to return every day that you're on the computer. Even just 10 grains is better than none and it all soon adds up.

, Encourage family members to join. This site is great for children who are learning spelling, vocabulary, math and more and it's equally good for people of all ages who could do with improving these aspects of their knowledge. Indeed, the site prides itself on having knowledge testing suited to beginners through to ""levels that will challenge the most scholarly professors. In between are levels suitable for students of all ages, business people, homemakers, doctors, truck drivers, retired people.""

Choose a campaign or a focus for your Monday health changes.,
Understand the beauty of choosing Monday.,
Limit your saturated fat intake by going meatless once a week.,
Start exercising.,
Quit smoking.,
Begin the week determined to reduce stress in your life.,
Keep updated about Healthy Monday initiatives in general.",How to Participate in the Healthy Monday Campaign," The Healthy Monday campaigns cover a wide range of ""wellness initiatives"". The idea is for people to join and start the week off in a healthy way by choosing a particular campaign that you are committed to. Alternatively, you could combine several campaigns or even make your own. The campaigns you could choose from include:Nutrition: Meatless Monday
Exercise: Move It Monday!
Stress reduction: Mindful Monday
Preventative Screenings: Man-Up Monday
Smoke Cessation: Quit & Stay Quit Monday
Your own choice or a combination of these choices.;
, Research performed by The Monday Campaigns movement shows that we already treat Monday like a fresh start day, a day dedicated to health and a day most favored for getting your act together. This happens to be a phenomenon cutting across cultures. It is also a day with negative connotations if you are not enjoying the way you are living your life, so this makes it another good reason to overcome the reasons for the negativity. Dedicating a specific day to health provides both a call to action and a way for people to increase compliance and impact.


We organize our lives around the week, starting with Monday. Monday is the day to set goals, refocus, and recommit and it is the day to trigger and sustain healthy behavior.

, Meatless Monday at http://www.meatlessmonday.com is a project associated with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. This project is about encouraging you to give up meat one day a week and to cut your intake of saturated fat by 15 percent. Doing this can reduce your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and certain types of cancer. That is a great promise for a new habit this Monday! Here is how to get involved:


Visit http://www.meatlessmonday.com and http://www.mondaycampaigns.org/meatless-monday/; also check out MyPlate at http://www.choosemyplate.gov/ for nutrition recommendations.
Follow Meatless Monday on Facebook and Twitter.
Pin up Meatless Monday posters at your school or workplace; start a campaign.
Collect pledges from others in your school or workplace to join in Meatless Monday (a pledge sheet can be downloaded from the Meatless Monday site).
Try a new meatless recipe (or recipes) every Monday.
Spend some time reading nutritional guidelines suited to your age and gender; learn about the nutritional needs of your household or family and share the information with everyone
Add Meatless Monday recipes to your website with the Meatless Monday recipe widget.

, The CDC recommends doing 2 1/2 hours of exercise minimum each week.The benefits of exercise include improved health, longer life and a boost for your brain power. Use Monday as the day to commit to an exercise routine. Start walking, join a gym, enroll in a fitness class, or plan physical activities for the week and stick to them! Things you can do participate:


Decide which activity you'll start doing regularlyCreate Monday Mile Maps and markers to help others know how far they're exercising; place these on tracks, paths and other exercise areas designated for Move-It MondaysEncourage others to join in by starting a walking group or fitness class at your workplace or school
As a family, get out and exercise together by taking walks or hikes, cycling together, doing indoor sports activities or joining a sports club together; help enthuse one another to be active regularly.

, Not smoking is one of the healthiest things you can do for yourself. As soon as you stop smoking, you will start seeing and feeling the effects. However, it can be hard to get started and commit. That is why the Healthy Monday Campaign recommends that you try to quit on Monday. Instead of waiting until New Year's Eve, your birthday or anniversary, having a weekly opportunity to recommit to your goal is more likely to succeed. Some things to do include:


Read the American Cancer Society's Quit GuideCall 1800-Quit-NowRe-introduce yourself to people you know as a non-smoker - the new and healthier you
Encourage others to quit smoking; add banners to your website, for example.

, Focus on having a Mindful Monday and bring more relaxation into your life:



Meditate - meditation can clear out the negative thoughts and worrying clutter in your mind, allowing you to focus clearly on what you want in life

Stay calm – when everyone else is panicking, a calm head will win the day
Learn how to self soothe – getting upset may be a habit but it's a bad one that prevents you from remaining calm and focused; learning to self soothe can help you to overcome panic, anxiety and negative thought processes
Familiarize yourself with assertive approaches to dealing with conflict and ""difficult"" people – this will ensure that you can stand up for yourself and not feel victimized
Practice deep breathing techniques – this helps with calming, soothing and focusing yourself

Visualize a stronger and more fulfilled future for yourself.

, There are a few ways you can stay updated about the campaigns, such as signing up for Eater’s Digest, a free weekly online newsletter that delivers meatless recipes, health and nutrition news, and a health tip on Mondays. You can also just sign up for Healthy Monday tips.Put Healthy Monday tips on your website to help others learn about this initiativeFollow Healthy Monday on Facebook and Twitter

, This could be your boss, a family member, your significant other, or a friend. You should tell her why she is important and all the things she does well. For instance, if it's your boss, tell her why she's a great boss and how much you've enjoyed working for her.


You can use social media to do this. Share a post celebrating the women in your life.

, Don't just tell them why they are important. Thank them for being there for you and for doing what they do. This could be as simple as thanking your mother for helping to raise you or thanking a female friend for helping out during tough times in your life.


You can also thank women you do not know. Post something thanking a famous woman for making strides for equality, for example.

Make it clear that you aren't arguing that abortion is a wonderful procedure full of sunshine and rainbows.,
Mention the United Nations (UN)'s position on pregnancy and torture.,
Point out double standards regarding bodily autonomy in government.,
Discuss cases in which abortion could protect the pregnant person from severe harm or even death.,
Mention the pregnant person's future.,
Examine whether they have a middle ground.",How to Defend Pro Choice Beliefs1," Being pro choice does not necessarily mean hating babies or coercing people into terminating a pregnancy. It is about allowing people to evaluate their own situations, think hard, and then choose what is best in their unique circumstances.


Mention how abortion centers will interview the patient to ensure that they are not being pushed or manipulated into the abortion.One Planned Parenthood ex-volunteer describes being trained on how to give resources (e.g. rehab brochures, information on subsidized childcare) to someone who said that they wanted to keep their pregnancy but didn't think they could.""Choice"" includes choosing to keep and love a fetus.;
, Pregnancy involves around nine months of difficult or debilitating symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, cravings, exhaustion, and more. The UN has classified forcing a pregnant person to continue a pregnancy against their will as torture., For example, in most countries, vital organs cannot be harvested from a corpse without the dead person's prior consent. If corpses are allowed to control organs that could save lives, while pregnant people cannot control their uteruses, then a pregnant person has less bodily rights than a corpse., Some pregnancies, such as tubal pregnancies, are ticking time bombs—the fetus faces certain death and the pregnant person could be harmed too. These people should have the right to safety.


Aborting a fetus before it naturally miscarries, and being kind about it, can save the pregnant person a lot of pain and danger to health (especially if the dying fetus was wanted and loved).Ask if causing both pregnant person and fetus to die is pro life.

, Ask if they believe the birth of an unwanted child to a young, promising person would hinder their life. Of course it will: it'll cause financial expense, increased stress, enormous medical bills (if they lack adequate insurance), and other hardships. Ask: Is it ethical to force this upon someone who never asked for it?


Not all pregnant people consented to sex—rape victims didn't, and some pregnant people were too young to consent to sex (e.g. 13-year-old girls).
Even if the sex that led to pregnancy was consensual, consent to one thing does not automatically translate to equal consent to another. Many people may not fully comprehend the implications of their actions. Thus, why would consent to sex be viewed as consent to pregnancy and childbirth?
Around 3/4 of people who get abortions say they could not afford a(nother) child.Is the pro-life person supporting programs that would help low-income families?

, They may argue exceptions of rape, incest, pregnant children/teens, dead or dying fetuses, et cetera. Ask what makes these cases so different. Continue examining different cases, and they'll begin to realize that abortion is far more than black and white.


For rape/incest exceptions, point out that this isn't about a ""right to life"" at all then, because a fetus created from rape is no less alive than a fetus created from consensual sex. It is about punishing the pregnant person (often a woman) for consenting to sex.For ""pro need"" type beliefs, point out that this is the foundation of the pro choice movement: that if the pregnant person feels their individual case is serious, then they should be able to abort. Shake their hand and say you wholeheartedly agree.

Ask them why they aren't a feminist.,
Clear up their misconceptions.,
Notice how open they are to new ideas.,
Be prepared for bigotry.,
Offer to share some articles or books.,
Remember that learning takes a long time.,
Remember that they are different from you.,
Focus on other things too.",How to Convince Somebody to Be a Feminist," Listen closely to their viewpoint. Many non-feminists harbor misconceptions about feminism. They may believe that...


Sexism is not a serious problem
Feminists want women to be superior to men; they want to do to men what patriarchy has done to women
Feminists hate men
Feminists are ugly lesbians with short hair who never shave (Some are, some aren't. Feminism welcomes people from all walks of life.)
Feminism is only about white, middle-class, cishet, conventionally attractive, thin, non-disabled women;
, This can require quite a bit of education and preparation, which makes it a daunting task. Take deep breaths, collect your thoughts, and speak calmly and logically.


Explain that feminism is the belief that all people have equal human dignity, and deserve equal respect and opportunities (or something to that effect).
Point out any good articles that you know.
Address any individual misconceptions with facts or basic logic. (""No, feminists value consent, so we do not believe in forcibly castrating cis men."")

Acknowledge any pain. The feminist movement is not perfect, and there are legitimate areas of concern:toxic callout culture, lack of intersectionality in certain communities (e.g. ableism, exclusion of trans people), and more. Help them find a welcoming feminist space, or let them do their own work separate from feminism.

, A person who would make a good feminist is someone who listens and learns, asking questions and speaking up if something doesn't match their personal values system. They are interested, and they don't view it as a personal attack. If a person seems bored or even takes it personally, then drop the subject. You aren't going to get anywhere.


A friendly but less interested person may identify as a feminist ally—they agree that inequality is bad, but aren't interested in learning the technicalities. They'll give a thumbs up as you fight rape culture or promote LGBT rights but won't initiate anything. If so, that's okay—they support you, and you did well.
Some people may want more information before diving in. This means that they are critical thinkers, and could become great feminists. However, if they are ridiculously skeptical or patronizing, then they probably are trying to make a fool out of you.

, Some people will get defensive when their ideas are challenged, will insist that they know best (even if they haven't read a thing about feminism), or will act like they are being attacked. End the conversation and walk away. These people are not willing to understand, and they are not the type of people you'd want in the feminist movement, anyway.


They may be more open to it when they are older and less likely to take everything personally.
Remember, an open woman-hater can be easier to ignore than a woman-hater who is convinced that he is a feminist.

, If someone is interested in feminism, they may want to hear recommendations from you. Or they may want to do their own research. Offer resources, but don't push. Each person learns in their own way, at their own pace.


If you are in college, you might take a gender studies course together.
Warn them away from any misleading resources.

, It'll be a while before (if ever) they're up to speed on things—so be careful about overwhelming them with terms like cisnormative, rape culture, and gender performativity. It takes a while to unlearn and relearn things from a more critical perspective. They will do problematic things, they will voice annoyingly common misconceptions, and they will be confused. Use patience, and try referring them to other sources to prevent exhaustion.

, Maybe you focus on rape culture and transgender rights, whereas they're interested in ableism and racism. They will develop viewpoints different from your own and will care most passionately about ideas that may be different from your own. This is okay—feminists are not mindless clones of your viewpoint, but critical individuals with their own perspectives.


If their perspective is actively harmful (e.g. they are being transmisogynistic), then it's absolutely okay to call them out.
Debate them if they are open to it, but don't try to force your viewpoint onto them. Remember to respect their opinions and autonomy.

, It's great to have feminist friends and family members whom you can discuss issues with—but feminism is not the entirety of your relationship. Remember to enjoy other aspects of your relationship as well, and to have fun together.

Practice an abundance mentality.,
Broaden your idea of the word ""free"".,
Look for ways to benefit and stay free.,
Use an open license on any work you create (blog posts, photographs, illustrations, music).,
Exercise the freedom to share.,
Donate to free culture organizations.",How to Support the Free Culture Movement," At the core of the free culture movement is the belief that overly restrictive copyright laws hinder creativity by deterring the free exchange of ideas.In contrast, there is the argument that open licensing will hurt the creative work in some way and limit its value. However, this presumption may prove inaccurate when put to the test. For example, consider the experience of Zen Habits blogger Leo Babauta. His has removed the copyright from his online work and as a result his work has been spread far and wide, built upon and improved, in ways more diverse than he ever could have done alone. It is a result that he finds flattering and he says: If can take my favorite posts and make something funny or inspiring or thought-provoking or even sad... I say more power to them. The creative community only benefits from derivations and inspirations. This isn’t a new concept, of course, and I’m freely ripping ideas off here. Which is kinda the point. As for Leo? His blog is one of the top 25 blogs and top 50 websites in the world.The opposite of an abundance mentality is a scarcity mentality, in which a person or corporation tries to hoard information out of fear of loss or lack of trust in others. This tends to be about controlling information rather than setting it free for all to benefit from. While it is appropriate that the creator of a work benefits from his or her creation initially, locking up the work well beyond its time of creation is akin to hoarding. For example, originally the US gave a 14 year period for copyright; do you think it is appropriate that the time of this control has since continued to increase, such as 70 years after death for individuals or 95 years for corporations? Who do you think is really benefiting from such extensive control over creative work?
Reflect on what concerns you might have about other people sharing what you create. You may not even have any but if you do, what is the basis of them? This is a useful exercise to get to the nub of your concerns––some may be valid, while others might not be based in fact.
Watch the film RiP: A remix manifesto at http://ripremix.com/. You'll learn a lot how about how information has been stealthily controlled over the past century, along with some interesting information on the perils of remixing and the fact that much of Walt Disney's work was built on other people's. And if you like remixing, the filmmaker Brett Gaylor even encourages you to remix this film!;
, When many people hear the word ""free"", they think about getting something without paying for it. But in ""free culture"", the word ""free"" refers to the freedom to distribute and build upon creative works without having to ask for permission first. It is absolutely compatible for you to get credit and make money from your works, if you so desire, while still supporting free culture. Consider the band Radiohead, who released their album In Rainbows direct online and asked listeners to make up their own minds about payment. This gesture increased awareness of and support for their work. Within weeks, remixes of their album were popular and yet, everyone still knew and respected the source as Radiohead. In other words, the openness and trust of the originator encourages others to emulate the work while still honoring the source and getting payment.

, How can you benefit from your creative works without restricting its distribution? There is the argument that with copyrighted works being shared illegally on the Internet anyway, creators of any kind are better off finding new ways to benefit from their work that do not depend on restrictions that are almost impossible to enforce. There are a number of ways get your creative work out there while still benefiting:


The viral aspect: If you use a share-alike license through which someone can distribute or build upon your work only if they share it under the same copyleft license, there's more potential for your work to make continuing contributions to free culture.If you use a license that requires attribution (which most do), that's an opportunity for your name, brand, or website to ""tag along"" with something that people are sharing freely with their friends. This can generate significant website traffic and other kinds of leads.
Sell services associated with your creative works. If you put something out that people find valuable, you can strive to establish your reputation as an expert so that you can make money from speaking engagements, seminars, teleconferences, or as a consultant. If you're a performer, you can generate income from live performances. You could even get a job offer from someone who's enjoyed your work. By way of example, animal welfare advocate Temple Grandin published her designs in the public domain in order to kill the patents––she reasoned that she wanted them used, not tied up in patent disputes.Yet, she is still needed personally to oversee the implementation and ongoing workings of the designs once built––her expertise is valued in the actual doing.
Charge for your creative product. If you're sharing something freely, that means people don't have to ask you (or pay you) before using or redistributing it. But, that doesn't mean you can't simply ask them to pay for it, whether before or after they use your work. For example, if you have an eBook under a copyleft license, you can sell it on your site. People who've already bought it can legally share it with their friends, but you can put a note in the book asking that if they enjoyed the eBook, they can pay for it on your site. If it's a helpful product, there will always be some people who will voluntarily pay for it, just to say thanks and also to encourage you to keep creating more.
Sell the work in alternative formats. You can use a free license on digital versions of any work, and sell non-digital (for example, print) versions. Or think really laterally and use non-digital variations such as t-shirts, mugs, bags, etc. If you have particular portions of your work that really grab people, such as a quote or an iconic photo, that may be sufficient on its own to create a product range that leads back to your work.
Share ideas more persuasively by freely sharing the materials in which you explain the ideas. You'll show you're not just saying something provocative to make money, and show that you're correct––or on the way to being correct––by holding your ideas up to the scrutiny of your opponents as well as your supporters.

, There are many licenses you can choose from, such as the GNU General Public License and a variety of Creative Commons licenses, or you can even release your work into the public domain. You'll find out how to use Creative Commons licenses more clearly by reading How to choose a Creative Commons license and How to apply the Creative Commons license to Flickr photographs.

, In addition to sharing your own works, read and browse works that are freely licensed by others. Use them, build upon them, republish them, and attribute them appropriately. No need to worry about expense or supporting something you might disagree with, like gratuitous violence in entertainment; you can enjoy a particular work, and then consider whether and how you might support the maker or genre. By enjoying and circulating creative free works, you're helping the free culture movement to flourish and making it more enjoyable as a ""shared"" experience.You're contributing to the viral nature of freely licensed works (which, as discussed above, can have many benefits for the creator, and for the world) and you're part of reassuring everyone that sharing makes good sense.


Contribute knowledge and images to any website that uses free licensing by default, such as wikiHow and Wikipedia. You can also post wikiHow articles on your blog or website.
Instead of using copyrighted or stock images (in blog posts or brochures, for example) get Creative Commons images from Flickr, look for images at Wikimedia Commons (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Pictures_and_images) or look for freely licensed images on Google.

, It takes time and money to develop the licenses that define the spectrum of possibilities between full copyright and the public domain, and that work globally alongside existing copyright laws. Free culture based organizations also undertake efforts to educate the public about flexible licensing alternatives. And if you can't donate money, you may be able to donate your time and skills to the movement.

Try paying more for conditioner and less for shampoo.",How to Beat the Pink Tax," Before making a purchase, scrutinize the label. This can help you identify the pink tax. You may think certain products are marked up fairly, because they contain different ingredients or come in greater amounts. However, you may find many women's products are similar to men's products but needlessly marked up.Bring your smart phone or a calculator when you shop. Calculate the cost per unit for items like shampoos and lotions. You can do this by dividing the cost of a product versus the number of units.
For example, a brand of women's shaving cream is $4.50 for a 14 ounce bottle. The cost per unit is about 32 cents. For a bottle of men's shaving cream, it's $4 for a 16 ounce bottle, making the cost per unit 25 cents. The men's shaving cream is cheaper in terms of both total cost and cost per unit.
Consult the label again. Sometimes, a brand of shaving cream may have special ingredients for a specific skin type (i.e., sensitive skin, dry skin, etc.) which may explain the higher cost. In this case, it may be worth the extra price. However, if the products in question are more or less the same, opt for the men's shaving cream instead to avoid the pink tax.;
, Brand name products are more likely to be marked up unnecessarily, and you may find the pink tax is particularly high for things like name brand shampoos. Compare the labels of name brand shampoos with cheaper, generic brands. When possible, opt for the generic brand of shampoo over the cheaper variety., The pink tax does not just apply to items you buy in the store. Services for women are often inexplicably more expensive. Appointments to hair salons are generally higher priced than appointments to barbershops, even if you're just getting a trim.If you have short hair, you can usually get it cut at a barbershop. Some barbershops also do long hair, however, so check with the shop.
For things like coloring and styling, you may still need a salon. However, you should be able to get a basic trim at a barbershop.

, The best way to identify and avoid pink taxes is to shop around. Each time you are in a store, look at the pricing of multiple products. Try to determine which products give you what you need for a reasonable price.Look at multiple items in the same store to see which brands mark up women's products. Strive to buy brands that charge similar prices for men's versus women's products.
You can also go from store to store and compare prices. You may find prices slightly lower in one store versus another for basic product you use each day. While it may seem silly to go from one store to another for only a 50 cent different, think about all the money you'll save throughout the year for items you must replace multiple times a month, like facial cream, conditioners, and body washes.

, Women's clothing generally require less fabric than men's clothing. However, it's often priced up anyway. If you're handy with sewing, you can buy products like men's jeans and tailor them to your body type. You can also ask a friend to take in a dress if you know someone handy at sewing.Professional tailoring is unlikely to save you much money, however. If you don't know how to sew, and do not know someone who does, it may be more cost effective to simply pay slightly more for clothes.

, Besides a certain fragrance, there is little difference between men's deodorant and women's deodorant. Yet, men's deodorant is generally around 20 cents cheaper per ounce. To avoid the pink tax, go for men's deodorant when possible. This will save you money over time.If you dislike the scent of men's deodorant, go for unscented varieties.

, There is very little difference between men's razors and women's razors other than the color. A razor targeted at men will work the same as a women's razor, and it comes at a much lower price. When buying razors, always opt for men's razors., Oftentimes, the only difference with toiletries (i.e., face creams, soaps, lotions, adult diapers, etc.) is something small, like the fragrance or the color of the bottle. If you're going to be washing out these products anyway, do you really need to pay extra for a smell? Does the color of the bottle really make a difference? When there does not seem to be a big difference between the products, opt for men's products., Many toy stores sell girl toys for more because of the color or design. In most toy stores or department stores, you can easily spot the girl's aisle because it's decorated in shades like pink and purple. To save money, avoid this aisle and get boy's toys of the same variety.For example, Legos and Duplos made in shades of pink and purple instead of the standard primary colors and marketed for ""girls"" are often sold at higher prices per unit than the standard toy, but they function the same way.
Instead of paying extra for a pink or purple scooter, just pay for a boy's scooter in a different color.

, Some items are marketed towards women and marked up because of superficial differences. Women's pens, for example, are often marked up simply because they are pink. Be wary of products like this. If a product, like a phone or a pen, is marked up because it's a women's product, chances are the only different is something superficial like the color., Healthcare products are often priced differently depending on gender. While it may be frustrating that certain women's products are priced more, it may sometimes be worth it to pay the extra cost. Dosages and ingredients are often based on physical differences between men and women. Something like diet supplements, for example, may have a different formula for men and women., Women's clothing is often more expensive, but may be made from different fabrics and cut differently. Some women's clothing requires less fabric, but certain items may be cut in a way that requires more fabric. If you truly like the cut of a particular clothing item, like a t-shirt, you may be better off opting to pay a bit more instead of buying men's products.You can save by buying clothing you don't really wear or show off, like socks and pajamas, in male styles. This can save you some money, allowing you to spend a little extra on a t-shirt or pair of jeans with a flattering cut.

, Many times, women's shampoos cost extra due to the scent. If you love the smell of your shampoo, keep in mind you wash it out. The smell of the conditioner is really what stays in. Consider buying the conditioner for the extra cost to get the scent you love, but buying men's shampoo to save some money."

Ask them to consider the following question: if we cannot decide at what point life actually begins, can we decide at what point life ends?,
If they insist that life begins at fertilization, point out identical twins.,
If they insist that life begins at fertilization, ask what they think about cloning.,
Point out that people are willing to kill similarly-sized organisms without calling it a sin.,
Remember that the precise beginning of life is not the point—bodily autonomy is.Is it okay to force someone's body to host a fetus against their will?",How to Defend Pro Choice Beliefs2," If they don't know, explain the concept of brain death, and how doctors pronounce a patient dead when the brain stops sending pulse signals to the body. A fetus' brain begins sending signals eight weeks into pregnancy. Use this argument to show that since life ends when the brain stops, shouldn't life begin when the brain starts?

, Up to two weeks after fertilization, that clump of cells could split up into identical twins. Where did the second life come from?

, Assuming that human cloning takes place - probably a matter of time - no fertilization takes place at all, the new person has the exact same genetic information as the ""donor"", yet they are clearly distinct individuals.


Animals, such as Dolly the sheep, have been successfully cloned and were very much alive., Mosquitoes, spiders, cockroaches, mice, and rats might cause annoyance at best and illness at worse. Many people kill them or call exterminators without second thought. An unwanted fetus can cause almost nine months of suffering in an unwilling pregnant person, far worse than any other pest, so why is this life sacred?


Remind them that there is a difference between a wanted and an unwanted fetus. A happy parent-to-be is willing to suffer because they love the fetus and look forward to having a baby. This is great! But a person who doesn't benefit from the pregnancy is only suffering.

, Can someone's body be used as an incubator?


If they believe that life begins at fertilization and must be protected at all costs, then what about the zygotes that are naturally rejected by the uterus? Are they doing anything about those? Statistically speaking, someone on birth control is less likely to have a fertilized egg, and thus is less likely to have a zygote die. Yet the pro life movement does nothing about this."

Mention that anti-abortion laws don't significantly change abortion rates.,
Explain how legalizing abortion can save lives.,
Explain how difficult it would be to enforce anti-abortion laws.,
Explain that abortion laws, such as the one mentioned in Roe vs. Wade, were not about the moral implications of abortion.",How to Defend Pro Choice Beliefs3," Global studies suggest that abortion rates are not really affected by whether abortion is legal.Thus, banning abortion would not reduce abortions, but force people to use underground methods, which can be much more risky.


Free contraception and comprehensive sex education can lower abortion rates.One estimate suggested that free contraception could cut the abortion rate by as much as 75%.If they really are concerned about life, instead of being anti-sex, then they should be campaigning for these things.

, For example, the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act significantly reduced abortion-related deaths. When abortion is legal, it becomes safer, saving lives of people who seek it.If anyone believes that abortion seekers deserve to die, point out that it isn't very pro-life to want pregnant person and fetus dead.

, The procedure used in performing abortions is identical to the procedure used to investigate bad pap smears. This is how abortions were covered up in the past.

, They were about safety and the right to privacy.

Shrug off speculation of ""How would you feel if your mom aborted you?"",
Remind them that being pro-choice is not anti-family.,
Point out inherent flaws in disaster comparisons.,
Dismiss speculations about what the fetus could have been.,
Point out the hypocrisy (and bad manners) of showing graphic abortion pictures.",How to Defend Pro Choice Beliefs4," Explain that you wouldn't have feelings because you wouldn't exist, and that people can give birth while supporting others' right not to. You may wish to add that you love your mother and wouldn't want her to endure 9 months of a forced pregnancy.

, No one is disputing that a wanted, loved pregnancy is a beautiful thing.Pro-choice people support a person's ability to choose what happens inside their body. (This is why the position is called pro-choice and not pro-rampant-abortion.)

, The death of an unwanted fetus is not the same as genocide, slavery, or the murder of an autonomous person. (A fetus or embryo, unlike a human being, is using another person's body in order to exist.)


If they point out that murdering disabled people and children is wrong, and disabled/young people may not be autonomous, the key is that any caregivers consent to caring for that person. (For example, an autistic person's caregiver chose that job and can quit at any time.)

, The fetus could have cured cancer, yes... or it could have been a serial killer (which is statistically more likely). One could imagine all sorts of things, but none of it is relevant to the point of human rights.

, Heart surgery and the removal of tumors are also graphic procedures, yet those aren't automatically evil. Furthermore, gore can trigger phobias, PTSD, and other awful reactions, so it's not exactly a kind thing to shove in strangers' faces.

"
"
Be polite and courteous when defending your beliefs.,
Never insult someone else's religion.,
Don't manipulate rhetoric.,
Remember that not all pregnant people are women.,
Take a break if you need to.",How to Defend Pro Choice Beliefs5," Never interrupt, shout over, or insult another person (even if you feel that they really, really deserve it).

, Religion and government are separate, and religion and abortion rights are separate. Condemning someone's entire religion is cruel and divisive.


Not all religious people are anti-choice; for example, it is possible for some self identified Christians to be pro-choice. Even if the person in front of you is a flaming bigot, think of the nice religious people, and don't insult their religion.

, Pro-choice people have long pointed out how ""baby"" and ""unborn child"" are manipulative ways to refer to an unwanted fetus. But calling all fetuses ""clumps of cells"" is also an insensitive use of rhetoric, because there are some fetuses that are truly loved and wanted, and to those parents the fetus is far more special. Stick with the factual term fetus.


Dismissing fetuses as mere ""clumps of cells"" can be deeply upsetting to people who miscarried a loved, wanted fetus.Don't accidentally minimize the hardship of losing a beloved fetus.

, Transgender men, nonbinary people, and some intersex people of any gender can also get pregnant. Be sure not to step on the toes of transgender people as you fight for the rights of everyone with a uterus.

, You are not obligated to change anyone's mind, nor do you have to keep talking to someone who says very rude or upsetting things. This may be personally upsetting to you. Say ""I don't want to talk about this anymore,"" ""I need a break,"" or ""I need to get some air"" if you can't keep calm. Any decent person will respect your wishes.


If the person makes you feel unsafe, leave right away. Call police if you are being threatened or stalked.

Understand the Black Market.,
Understand that prohibiting drugs makes them FAR MORE DANGEROUS.,
Understand the propaganda with which the drug war fights.,
Understand that the scheduling system of drugs can be seriously flawed.,
Understand that, even with the above, legal alcohol is better than the first Prohibition.,
Understand that drugs SHOULD be regulated.,
Understand that the War on Drugs severely handicaps scientific research.,
DO YOUR RESEARCH.",How to Dispute the War on Drugs," The most harmful element of the War is that it forces substances out of the normal economy. This raises the prices of illicit goods due to lack of availability, making them both very profitable and draining on the salaries of addicts. This profitability SUPPORTS the drug trade, and is responsible for reports of muggings for drug money: if the drugs were cheaper, addicts could afford them instead of committing MORE CRIMES.;
, As an example, heroin is lethal on its own, but since it cannot be supervised by medical professionals, it also has helped to spread the AIDS epidemic due to dirty needles. In countries such as Amsterdam, where heroin is available, these needles are regulated in such a way that they are far safer to use, and the percentage of overdose occurring is far smaller. Users who buy drugs off the black market CANNOT LEGALLY KNOW THE QUALITY OR DOSAGE THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING.

, Many violent incidents related to marijuana and displayed on television were actually incidents coupled with alcohol. Lung damage associated with marijuana assumes that the user smokes it instead of, say, baking it into cookies. DMT is deemed dangerous because of its reality distortions when in reality a DMT user is not mobile during the experience, and thus unable to cause physical distress to others and their property. (And so much more. See last step)

, For instance, DMT is a schedule I drug (along with heroin and other extremely dangerous substances.) This scheduling implies that it has no medical purpose, is highly addictive, very abusive, and, furthermore, dangerous. The truth is that DMT has not been shown to be addictive, has a ""trip"" which only lasts up to an hour on a reasonable dose, and has caused no documented death. Compare this to alcohol, which no sane doctor would prescribe as medicine, can cause physiological addiction which can kill, is abused by 10% of its users, and is present in far more deaths than any other illegal drug.

, While liver problems and alcohol consumption dropped during the prohibition, murder rates SKYROCKETED. It was the birth of the gangster culture. As soon as the prohibition ended, murder rates fell, and the health problems from improperly created alcohol (such as blindness and death from bathtub gin) were all but eliminated.

, Even though they should not be prohibited, drugs still do pose a risk to citizen's safety. The idea of regulation (which is impossible under prohibition) is to make laws regarding the age group that can safely use substances, and where they can be used without affecting others, while ensuring that the dosage of substances is not more harmful than necessary and that the substance is not laced or contaminated with something fatal.

, Many modern medicines are derived from substances thought originally to be purely harmful. Even today, various venoms are being tested for use in a cure for cancer. The regulations placed upon drugs stunt research into unique substances (what else is like LSD?) which may provide vast insights to medicine and the function of the human body (both cannabinoids and DMT are secreted naturally in humans).

, This guide cannot possibly explain to you the intricacies of black market economics and human tendency to abuse drugs which are unregulated, nor can it provide you with your own voice in the war against the Prohibition. To make a difference, you must KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

Explore common misconceptions about feminism.,
Study the history of the feminist movement.",How to Be a Feminist," It may sound cheesy, but if you are a woman, loving yourself and practicing self-care empowers you. When you love yourself, you are essentially saying “my humanity matters.”


With this is loving your body, even (especially!) if it does not fit the media’s stereotype of perfection. Feminists often fight the misconception that an attractive female has one particular set of traits.
This does not mean that you can’t spend time making yourself look pretty. You can wear makeup or high heels and be a feminist, but you don’t have to!;
, It can be common for members of heterosexual relationships and marriages to slip into traditional gender roles.If you want to stay home with your children while your husband works, that’s fine! You can still be a feminist! However, you and your partner should make mindful decisions about household responsibilities.


If you do most of the cooking, perhaps your partner should clean up the kitchen after dinner. If your partner does laundry on the weekends, you can contribute in other ways, like by vacuuming. As long as you’re making decisions about responsibilities based on choice and personal preference, and not on gender stereotypes, you’ll be incorporating feminism into your lifestyle.

, There are many ways to raise children to be feminists. A good start is encouraging them to embrace their individual interests and passions, regardless of their gender. You can also teach them to question gender assumptions (such as why girls’ items are invariably pink and purple, but boys’ items are never pink). Help them make life goals that do not hinge upon their genders.It is also important to emphasize both the mother’s and the father’s role as a parent. This will minimize the assumption that mothers parent while fathers work.

, In an ideal work, workplaces would all be blind to gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and other life choices. In reality, this is not always the case. Maintain professionalism in the work place and always perform your best; if you feel that you are being discriminated against, (ie: paid less for similar work or passed over for a promotion) due to your gender. Do not be afraid to speak out about the inequity.If you have a managerial position, ensure fairness and equity in hiring, pay, and promotion policies.

, There is an unfortunate modern tendency for women to judge and belittle the choices of other women, (particularly on social media). To be a feminist, support and empower other women instead of judging them. Realize that women who make decisions that differ from your own have likely put as much thought into those decisions as you have., An important part of being an informed feminist is cultivating an awareness of systemic prejudices against women around the world. You cannot stop every individual from having a particular opinion about women, but you can expose systemic inequalities.You can support organizations that provide suppressed women in other cultures education and opportunities.
You can notice trends such as the discrepancy between the percentage of politicians or world leaders who are female, versus the female population of the world.
Realize that in systems that discriminate against women in the areas of education or employment, women’s economic lives become dependent on others in power, which takes power from them., Go to rallies that promote women’s equality. Join organizations that fight for the equality of women in your area as well as other countries. Speaking out about inequality is an important step towards achieving equality. You can find resources for feminist activism http://feminist.com/activism/ here.

, One way that you can be a feminist and support feminist causes is to vote with women’s rights in mind.Voting for politicians who advocate for women in the workplace and women’s healthcare rights can put your feminist beliefs into action.


Additionally, you may want to find out if a candidate (male or female) has women working on his or her campaign staff. Advocating for women’s employment rights is less meaningful if a candidate doesn’t actually employ women.

, Part of being a feminist is supporting the rights of everyone to do what they want in their lives and careers, even if it means breaking traditional gender stereotypes.That means believing that a mom or a dad can choose to stay at home to raise young children. It means believing that a man or a woman can become a CEO of a company or a politician or president.

, A feminist believes that men and women should have equal opportunities and may spend time sharing and cultivating those beliefs. Feminism is not about rejecting female sexuality or upholding women as superior to men; it’s about challenging preconceptions about gender roles.It’s about making observations and asking questions like, “why are pilots usually male, while flight attendants are usually female?”

, There are many misconceptions about feminism.Some people hear the word “feminist” and imagine a woman who wears her hair short, hates men, and acts aggressively all the time.However, a feminist can also be a stay-at-home-mom raising 4 kids and spending her days cooking and cleaning. A feminist can also be a man.


Feminists do not have to remain unmarried, hate men, or be lesbians.Feminists do not have to dress or act a certain way., To really understand feminism, you may want to brush up on the different waves of the feminist movement.Learn about the most influential women leaders of women’s the suffrage movement. Learn about women’s equality issues such as equal pay for equal work,tax benefits for childcare,and maternity leave policies."

Display passion and engagement in women’s rights.",How to Be a Feminist As a Man," Feminism has several possible definitions, depending on which school of thought you reference. However, the two main definitions of feminism are:Feminism is a movement by women for women. This means that feminists are women who are working to better the lives of other women. There can be different types of feminism that represent different female groups in society, from African American women to trans women, but the basis of the movement is for and by women. Men can act as allies to women and work with women to demonstrate their support of the movement but they are not a dominant force in the movement.
Feminism is a movement about gender justice. This means that feminism works against the system of oppression we live in, which affects women as well as other non-binary individuals (or individuals who are not straight men). In this approach to feminism, people of all genders can be feminists as long as they are willing to work to dismantle the system of oppression that we currently live in.;
, A big part of being a feminist is understanding that as individuals we live in a patriarchal society. This means that society is based on a system of customs and rules that are created by heterosexual men for heterosexual men. As a result of the patriarchal system, individuals who are not heterosexual men (including women) are discriminated against or are not given fair treatment.Recognizing that we exist in a patriarchal society will allow you to better understand the need for feminism and for movements to work against the existing patriarchy. Just because feminism works against the effects of patriarchy does not mean feminists hate all men. Instead, men can be seen as allies to women in the fight against patriarchy. The support of men in the feminist movement will ultimately benefit people of all genders.

, Educate yourself on a daily basis by integrating feminist blogs and websites into your internet reading routine. Rather than click on the standard news and opinion sites, seek out websites and blogs that address current news and issues from a feminist perspective. This will allow you to access the perspective of feminists and support them by reading what they have to say.There are several well known feminist blogs and websites online that are updated regularly. Many of these blogs are written by women for women, but are of course, accessible for men, too., You can also throw financial support behind feminist issues by subscribing to feminist publications. Many of these publications have low subscription fees and appeal to a wide readership, with articles on pop culture and political issues from a feminist perspective.


Look for feminist magazines, such as Bitch Magazine or BUST Magazine, at your local bookstore, magazine stand, or at your local library. You can also subscribe to these magazines online., Male privilege is the result of the patriarchal system we live in, where men are given more power and privilege than women.This means that as a man, you are entitled to higher wages than women, have a lower risk of sexual assault and sexual violence, and have access to financial and social support that is not extended to women. Because you benefit from male privilege as a man, it is important that you acknowledge this privilege in your discussions with feminists.This concept is also known as “checking your privilege”, where you recognize and acknowledge your male privilege before you respond to a woman who is speaking to you or to women that are in a shared space with you. This will allow you to keep in mind where you are coming from in relation to feminism and to be a positive ally to women.

, As a male feminist, it is important that you focus on active listening to women when they speak. This will show you are aware that women are the leaders in the feminist movement and that you are a supporting player in the movement. Though you may be used to asserting yourself in discussions with others, it is essential that you actively listen to women in discussions on feminism.For example, perhaps you are in a conversation with a woman who identifies as a feminist. She may make a comment about the need for safe spaces for women to meet, talk, and hang out without heterosexual men around. You may feel that segregated spaces for women will feel exclusive to others. Rather than attack her point of view, ask her thoughtful questions about her comment and demonstrate you are actively listening to her.
This means making eye contact with her, nodding your head as she speaks, and responding in an active way. For example, you may say, “What I am hearing you say is that safe spaces for women are important in our patriarchal society.” If she responds yes to your response, you can then present your argument. However, always check your privilege and acknowledge that you are viewing the situation from a male perspective. This will keep the discussion proactive and honest.
It is also important in these discussions to recognize that you do not need to be right or win the argument against a female feminist. Instead, the idea is to foster discussion and communication between men and women in a safe, open way. Your male privilege does not mean you are automatically correct or have the right idea, and it is important that you recognize this during your discussions with women.

, “Mansplaining” is when a man explains a topic, such feminism, to a woman when she likely already knows and understands the topic. Mansplaining is often done by male politicians when they discuss women’s reproductive rights. But it can also occur in common conversation, where a male speaker “mansplains” a feminist concept to a woman or to a group of women in the room. Avoid doing this, as it indicates you are not supporting the feminist movement and are instead trying to assert your male privilege in front of women.You can avoid “mansplaining” by focusing on active listening to other women. Ask, “What do you think of this topic?” or state, “As a man, I am not qualified to talk about this but I look forward to hearing what you have to say.”

, Though sexist jokes or references may seem harmless to you, to women, sexist jokes only reinforce the gap between male privilege and women’s rights. Commenting on a woman’s physical appearance, such as calling a woman “hot” or sexualizing a woman, is offensive and disrespectful to women.Avoid making sexist jokes around your other guy friends, as this also indicates that it is okay to sexualize women and see them as sexual objects. Doing this works against feminism and the equality of the sexes.

, Being a feminist as a man is not like gaining entry into an exclusive club. Instead, it requires constant work and acknowledgment of your male privilege. Focus on educating yourself by talking to women who identify as feminists and to other men who are trying to support women as allies., If you are sexually active with your female partner, you may have discussions around birth control and preventing pregnancy. Avoid making decisions for your partner about how she can manage her reproductive system. Support her if she decides to go on birth control or another birth control method.This also extends to abortions and terminating a pregnancy. If you and your partner have an unplanned pregnancy, you can have a discussion with her about the options. But if she decides to have an abortion, as a feminist, it is important that you support her decision. Ultimately, it is her body and she has the right to decide how her body is used.

, It can be easy to fall into gender stereotypes, especially in heterosexual relationships. But the gendered notion of women in the kitchen, cooking and cleaning, and men in the workplace, bringing home the bacon, are outdated and based on gender bias. As the man in the relationship, be willing to do 50% of the housework, whether this is cleaning, cooking, or gardening. Try to split the housework between the two of you so there is not an imbalance in your relationship.If you and your partner both work, support your partner when she pursues a big account or client at work. Encourage her to take on a leadership role in her job and in other areas of her life. This shows that you are not threatened by her ambition and determination, and that you do not buy into the stereotypical notion that only men can be leaders and achieve professional success.
You should also take responsibility for roles in your relationship that may not be typically perceived as “male”. This could be doing 50% of the emotional work in the relationship, such as talking about your feelings, your thoughts, and your needs. This could also be actively listening to your partner and responding to her needs.

, Sex is another area where stereotypical gender roles can come into effect, leading to an imbalance in your sexual relationship with your partner. Talk to your female sexual partner about what she enjoys in bed and how you can please her. Respond to her needs in the same ways she responds to yours. Avoid being the dominate one or the aggressor in the relationship. Instead, focus on maintaining a balance between you and your partner. This will create a sexual relationship that is based on mutual respect and mutual enjoyment., If you are close to your female siblings or have a daughter or a young niece, teach them about the value of feminism. This could mean talking about feminist ideas with them on a regular basis or passing along feminist reading material. Rather than “mansplain” feminism to your female peers, focus on discussing the importance of feminism with them and reinforcing the need for feminism in our society., Put your feminism into action by marching in solidarity with women’s right on International Women’s Day, or by taking part in rallies for missing and murdered women in your city or area. You can also passionately engage in feminist issues online by joining forums and feminist groups.Once you join women’s rights groups, it is important that you participate in the conversation using active listening and take a supporting role. Check your privilege and get involved in an open and engaged way.

Live your life, not anybody else's.,
Read books and magazines.,
Listen to the music.,
Go to concerts.,
Play an instrument.,
Don't dress for boys.,
Go live it!",How to Be a Riot Grrrl (or Boi)," It isn't a fashion statement. You can't wear it for a few days. It isn't a music genre you can merely dabble in. You must devote your life to Riot Grrrl and live it. Sure, you are allowed to have other interests, but you can't ""act"" Riot Grrrl. It must be who you are.;
, How do you expect to be a Riot Grrrl (or Boi) if you aren't one? Stop worrying about what you look like. If you don't want to wear makeup, shave, wear dresses or heels, you don't have to. Doing these things though doesn't make you weak; fight against the media portrayal of feminine weakness by being who you are and who you want to be. Fight against rape, violence, and inequality. Attend a . Don't let anyone walk on top of you or tell you that you aren't as good because you are a girl. Refuse to lay down.

, So you're a feminist which means you support equality, but you aren't sure if you can embrace gays, lesbians, transgenders, pansexuals, bisexuals, or any of the like. Everyone has the right to live their life how they want and you must respect everyone. Stand up for your beliefs.

, Find a cause you support (whether it be women's rights or child labor in India) and go reveal it to the masses. You'll never get anywhere sitting on your computer all day reading about what others are doing. Get out there! You might just be on the forefront of cultural/political/social change. Anything is fair game, just go do something about it.

, The world around us is full of images that tell us who we should be and what we should do. Ignore it. You'll encounter lots of people who will try to make you be someone, but you can't be anyone but yourself. Embrace what you have and do what you want. You are perfectly good as you are and you shouldn't change that to suit anyone else.

, Books provide you with all sorts of information, as can newspapers. Keep up to date on the world around you. If you can find magazines, please read them. A lot of them will be garbage, but the good ones are invaluable. You'll get to read the work of your fellow Riot Grrrls and punks alike.

, Some good bands to start with are Hole, Babes in Toyland, Bratmobile, Bikini Kill, 7 Year Bitch, Heaven to betsy ,and the L7. Through these you can find others and at least some of them will be to your liking. After you've gotten into these acts, try to explore some of the lesser known bands. As much as we hate it, Tumblr can be a great source for underground bands. Every city has some kind of scene and, with a little research (either through the internet or asking around) you can find some underground concerts. Check your local music store or coffee shop for flyers.

, Recorded music isn't sterile by any means, but live music is definitely something to roll around in. Pay for your entrance and support your local acts. Even if you don't think they're all that good, you can feel great knowing that you supported real people and not corporate zombies who forgot the real scene years ago. Talk to the band members and encourage others to listen to them. They'll appreciate it. Keep in mind that, if you do some moshing, it is a good way to get yourself felt up and groped. Make sure you know how to do it properly and bring someone larger than you to keep you out of trouble.

, This isn't necessary, but why wouldn't you pick up something, whether it be guitar, bass, or drums, and get your own music out there? If you find that you have no talent or interest in an instrument, be the vocalist. Even if you can't sing like an angel, Riot Grrrl isn't all about talent. It's about the message and the energy. Grab some fellow Riot Grrrls and Boys and put together a band.

, If you want to put on makeup, go for it! If not, that's fine too. Do whatever makes you happy. All women should be treated equally, no matter what they look like.

, Embrace your new lifestyle and go forth to the world. Protest, rock out, and be yourself. You are beautiful and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!

Speak up if you see racism in action.,
Support and attend events that celebrate different cultures.,
Organize a vigil or protest.,
Lobby and fight for nondiscriminatory laws.,
Get involved with a local, national, or international organizations.,
Learn about your community.",How to Help Reduce Racism1," If you hear someone use racial slurs, make a racial joke, or mistreat people because of their race, step in say something.You might be afraid of someone who is openly hostile, but think about how the other person feels. If you are afraid for your or the other person's safety, feel free to get an authority figure, such as the police, or an adult if you are a child or teenager.


If the person sees nothing wrong with what was said, ask the person not to say racist or bigoted remarks around you anymore. Tell the person that you will no longer hang around them if they continue to act this way.
For example, if someone says ""All _____ are criminals,"" ask the person, ""Why do you say that?"" or ""Where do those beliefs come from?""Try saying, ""That was an inappropriate thing to say."" or ""How would you feel if someone said something like that about you?""
If you miss the opportunity to say something or chicken out, do not beat yourself up about it. Promise yourself that you will speak up the next chance you get.
Address the behavior or the comment instead of the person. Do not resort to name calling or tell someone, ""You're a racist."" This will only offend them and make them angry.;
, Most cities have cultural festivals and events. These events are a great place to learn about different cultures and interact with people from that culture.Invite your friends and family to go with you as well. Educating yourself and others is a way to have a more positive attitude towards people from different backgrounds.Events are often held in accordance with larger celebrations such as Black History Month, Asian-Pacific Heritage American Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, etc.

, Protests and demonstrations are powerful ways to combat racism in your community. These can be coordinated in response to events that happen around you. For example, if someone puts racial graffiti on a building, you could get together with some people to paint over the graffiti. If a hate group such as the Ku Klux Klan is coming to town, create a petition to stop them from coming.Even if you are not able to organize something yourself, just the act of speaking up and introducing the idea is helpful.
Always start by contacting your friends, family, classmates, neighbors, etc. You can also contact local law enforcement about your concerns or about what you are interested in doing.

, Racism happens at both the individual level and at the institutional level. Local and federal legislation can promote racism. Educating others and reforming yourself is more important, but the government does make a difference. Look for laws that promote equal salaries, equal opportunity, and punishment for people who discriminate in housing or employment.Write your elected officials, newspapers, or contact community organizers about the policies.

, Many organizations are dedicated to working towards these issues. Joining or supporting one of these organizations is another method you can use. You may meet like-minded people or get useful updates. You can volunteer at the organization or donate your time and/or money to their cause.


America Healing maintains a list of organizations that work on racial equity issues., Having a good understanding of your community will help you identify the best approaches for reducing racism. Read through your local newspaper, magazine, or websites to get some background information. What groups of people live in your community? Do these groups live and work together? Are neighborhoods segregated? Have there been any incidents of racism between different groups?"

Educate yourself.",How to Fight Racism in Your School," Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself (or a friend or even a stranger) when you encounter bullying around racism. Bullying related to racism often continues because bullies see that the person won’t defend his- or herself or speak out.Stop the cycle and say something!


You don’t have to be mean, just show that you won’t let these comments go on. You can say, “Why would you say something like that?” or “That’s a really mean thing to say.”
If someone being bullied sees you stand up for yourself, you may inspire him or her to stand up as well.;
, When someone says something racist to you, get the last word and make it count. Responding in knowledge can feel empowering as well as arm you with information as power.If someone says something racist, respond with events, facts, or statistics that help you educate people that may be less aware of how these comments affect people.


Some comments are made from a place of ignorance, but words can hurt. You can comment, “When you put indigenous people down, it perpetuates a mentality of them being less than you.”
You can also respond, ""When you say that Asians are better at math, you're stereotyping a whole group of people, which isn't fair to them.""

, Humor is an excellent way to communicate something in a more casual way, yet still make a point that those comments are not ok.


If someone makes fun of an immigrant’s accent, say, “Hey, how’s your second or third language coming along?”

, Microaggressions are small but significant acts of separation that can deeply affect how people feel.While these acts are not as blatant as a jab shouted from across the hall, they can be equally painful. Notice when you or your friends engage in any race-related microaggressions, and make sure to speak up. Often microaggressions aren’t purposefully hurtful, but have a negative effect.


A microaggression can be as simple as not wanting to touch someone from a different race.
If you see someone make a face at someone from a different race, say, “What was that about? Just because that person is a different race doesn’t make him any different as a person.”
If you ask someone where she is “really” from, this is a form of microaggressions. If you’re curious about someone’s family lineage, say, “I’m interested to hear if you’re connected to cultural customs and what your ancestry is.”

, If you’ve experienced prejudice, racism, or discrimination, document it and bring it up to an authority (like a teacher, school dean or principal, or police officer).This is an important way to make sure these actions don’t happen in secret but that people are aware and taking action. It’s important to show others that this kind of behavior is not okay and will not be tolerated.

, It’s unlikely you’re the only person in your school who feels on the sidelines because of your race. You may be the only Korean at school, but there are probably other people that aren’t in the majority as Laotian, Croatian, or Ecuadorian. Start a club or group for people that are diverse in your school. Unite people who feel different (and those who actively want to support inclusion and diversity) by joining with people that may have similar experiences in similar contexts, and you can begin to create an in-group identity.You can talk about how other people’s misunderstanding affects your life, how you’ve all experienced racism, and how you’ve responded to it.

, Teaching about racism in school is important so that all students can learn about what racism is, how it hurts, and how to not tolerate it. Ask your teachers and even your principal to include units on racism built in to the curriculum; there are lots of books and lesson plans that address racism.You can also ask your teachers to include books with diverse themes.

, Ask your school to celebrate the history of other cultures at school. Many people have heard of Dia de los Muertos, but few have heard about Quyllur R'iti , a festival celebrated high in the Andes mountains in Peru, the Aboakyir Festival in Ghana, which celebrates the migration from West Sudan, or Qingming Festival, which is celebrated in China in reverence to one’s ancestors. It can be fun to celebrate other countries’ holidays while learning history, customs, and culture.


It’s also important to know devastating events in order to be informed and to not make the same historical mistakes such as Armenian Genocide and Tiananmen Square. It’s important not to forget these events and the people that lived and died in them.

, If your school doesn’t have these in their code of conduct or policies, strongly encourage the teachers and administration to adopt these policies at school. It’s important for schools to create clear guidelines in regard to race and treatment of people on the school campus.


Inclusion can mean that all students have access to education and receive support and that all school members feel safe from marginalization and harassment.Zero-tolerance policies often include banning weapons and drugs, but can also include behaviors that include racist remarks and hate crimes based on race. Schools can more effectively implement zero-tolerance policies by creating higher stakes, such as pairing with juvenile justice or juvenile detention centers., Somehow, racism doesn’t just go away by avoiding discussions about it. Yes, it may feel uncomfortable, but get some friends and classmates together and have an honest discussion about racism, what it looks and feels like, and how it affects your school. When you talk about racism, it actually helps with more understanding and more tolerance.Put some signs around your school and advertise a group discussion one afternoon after school. Encourage people to talk about their experiences, their fears, their biases or stereotypes. Allow the space to be safe and caring, where no questions are too silly to ask.

, Maybe you have a friend that’s from a different country and hate seeing her treated unfairly. “But I’m from the majority group, what can I do?!” You can be an ally. Use your position as someone in the majority to reach out to people that may not know better or that choose to make hurtful comments. Being an ally means you use your position to help others.If someone says something to your friend, stand up for your friend in that moment and say, “It’s not okay to say things like that; that’s racist.”

, More and more schools participate in programs like this. Ask your teachers and school leadership to help you connect with students in other countries.


It can be exciting to learn from other students your age about their way of life, what they eat, what they do for fun, and where they live. While some things may be really different, lots of things are likely similar.

, Immerse yourself in all things that celebrate cultural diversity. Often racism is rooted in misunderstanding or not bothering to take the time to learn. So, read books about Kwanzaa, Ramadan, and Chinese New Year. Read books and watch movies about kids living in other countries. Is there a new kid at school from Peru? Go up to her and talk to her. Ask her questions about her own culture and how it’s different. Meet as many people from as many places as you can.


Even when traditions are different from your own, be respectful. If someone is telling you about a custom, refrain from saying, “Ewww!” or “That’s weird.” Remind yourself that it’s different, and that’s okay.

Take care of yourself.",How to Deal With Racism1," Like harassment, brief and often unintentional acts of racial discrimination (known as ""microaggressions"") might seem like no big deal to other people, but if it bothers you, it has to stop.Studies show that people of color experience racial microaggressions every day, but perpetrators almost always deny that they've done anything wrong or that their actions were racially-motivated.This can leave people of color feeling like they're imagining things, or worried that if they say something that their experiences will be invalidated by denial.;
, If you experience a microaggression or a more blatant form of racial hostility, put your own needs first; you can choose to walk away. You are not under any obligation to engage with a person like that.


It is never your job as a victim of racism to ""fix"" the perpetrator. Engaging in conversations about racism are exhausting, emotionally upsetting, and just plain hard work, and you can just walk away. But, if you want to engage with the person who is at fault, you can choose to do that, too., Instead of accusing a person of being racist, which risks raising defensiveness, point out exactly why the behavior or words are problematic.For example, instead of saying, ""You are offensive,"" say, ""That phrase is pretty offensive to Native Americans."" By using ""that phrase"" instead of ""you,"" you take the focus off of the perpetrator and on the words themselves.

, You are never obligated to accept or deal with racism just to avoid causing friction among your peers. Racism is always wrong and you have every right to say something about it.


If someone is behaving in a way that seems racist to you, point out why it is a problem. You can choose your approach; recognize that people tend to become defensive when they are called out, so the more tact you use, the more likely they are to be receptive to your comments.

, When someone in a group does or says something offensive, your approach to dealing with it might be more or less effective depending on several factors. Decide what your goals are when you call out racist behavior in a group: do you want to let everyone present know you won't listen to that kind of thing, or do you want to preserve a relationship with someone who may have done something inadvertently offensive?


Calling out racist behavior in front of other people, rather than addressing it in private, lets the whole group know you won't stand for behavior like that directed at you. But it also tends to put people on the defensive when they are called out in front of their friends.
If you feel the behavior was unintentional and you are concerned about preserving the feelings of the perpetrator or maintaining a relationship with that person, you can let it slide temporarily, and later ask if you can talk to them about it in private. There are a lot of drawbacks to waiting to talk about it; one might be that the person will forget what they said or the context, and another is that it sends a message to the group that you are not going to challenge behavior like that.

, There are many ways to respond if something is offensive, and you have to choose what is true to your personality and the relationship you have with the perpetrator.


One approach is to say, ""You know, it hurts me when people say or do that, because…"" Making it about how you feel can help people be less defensive than if you make it directly about what they do,but it also takes some of the responsibility off of their shoulders, which may not be a good tactic in the long run.
Another, more direct approach is to say, ""You should not say or do that. It is offensive to people of a certain race because…"" This approach lets people know that their behavior is hurtful and that they should stop.

, If your teacher or boss is treating you differently because of your race, or making comments that are disparaging or embarrassing, it can be hard to know how to react since they are in a position of power over you and can affect your grades or income.


If you think the racism is unintentional or the result of carelessness and if you otherwise have a good working relationship with this person, consider talking to the teacher or boss. It's possible that this person is unaware that their behavior is offensive. For example, a teacher who calls on you in class to give the ""black point of view"" may not realize that doing so is offensive, since black people are not monolithic.
If you do talk to your teacher or boss, be sure to approach them when they are not busy and ask to speak in private. Let them know about your concerns in clear, direct, and unemotional terms: ""Sometimes I feel that you unintentionally single me out because of my race. I was hoping we could talk about that so that it doesn't happen again.""If you feel that the racism is intentional, malicious, or if you think that discussing it directly with your teacher or boss will result in negative consequences for you or impair your working relationship, you need to talk to the next level of authority. At school, this could be your school counselor or your principal. At work, this could be your human resources office or your boss's manager. First, be sure you have documented each instance of racism or microaggression.Schedule a private meeting in which you lay out what has happened (including frequency and direct quotes or descriptions of actions from each instance if possible) and why this is unacceptable.

, If you are experiencing racism at work or in a place of public accommodation, you may have legal rights. Many state and federal laws protect against racial discrimination, most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964.You should contact a lawyer specializing in civil rights or workplace rights if you are experiencing racism that is depriving you of housing, work, safety, or other freedoms. Most states have strict timetables for reporting incidents of discrimination, so be sure to get in touch with a lawyer right away.If you need to file a lawsuit and cannot afford an attorney, there are many organizations that fight for human rights that might be able to help you. In the United States, consider contacting the Southern Poverty Law Center or the Anti-Defamation League.

, Racist people are fueled by bigotry and prejudice and are unlikely to change even if you confront them. Racist actions, however, are often mistakes or the result of growing up in a culture where racism is the norm.


If someone is a racist, confronting them or trying to spend a lot of time educating them about racism and why it bothers you might be a wasted effort. Often they will just claim you are ""playing the race card"" if you are offended by something they say or do. Very rarely will a real racist person listen to you or change their behavior because it bothers you. In some cases, it could be dangerous to your personal safety to try to confront them.
However, if someone is generally a good person but sometimes makes racist comments or assumptions, you might be able to influence them to stop by teaching them why it is offensive. These people are often completely unaware of the real effects of racism in the world.
It is your decision whether to spend your time trying to deal with racist people, racist behavior, or racist policies. It is not your job to educate people just because you happen to be a minority., Enduring racism is taxing and can be emotionally traumatizing. Be sure to surround yourself with a support system of trusted individuals and take time for yourself to build your emotional and psychological strength.


Stress from coping with racism can affect every area of your life, including your mental wellbeing,performance in school, and even risk factors for major diseases.Join student associations for students of color, political organizations, or other affinity groups to meet and network with other people experiencing similar things. Talk to your family members about stressful events and how to cope.Studies show that having people with whom you can discuss shared negative experiences is an important factor in coping with related stress.

For example, in California, you can get individual assistance that will guide you through the process. After answering some questions, you will be referred to a qualified attorney in your area.Before you hire an attorney, conduct initial consultations with your top choices. Ask them about their experience, your potential case, and fee arrangements.;
, Race is not defined under Title VII. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides five racial categories, which include American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, African American or Black, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and White. Furthermore, Title VII generally encompasses:


Ancestry;
Physical characteristics (e.g., skin color, hair, facial features, height, and weight);
Race-linked illnesses (e.g., sickle cell anemia);
Culture (e.g., name, dress, grooming practices, accent, and manner of speech);
Perception; and
Association (e.g., a white person being discriminated against because they are married to an African American)., Race cases generally fall within a category called ""disparate treatment discrimination,"" which occurs when race is a motivating factor in how you are treated. If race was all or part of the employer's motivation for their decision, they are violating Title VII. In addition, the employer can not make a racially motivated decision based on business concerns (e.g., concerns about employee relations, or a perceived negative customer reaction).


The statute covers both conscious and unconscious motivations (e.g., stereotypes you might not know you hold). The discrimination against you does not have to be overt, or even known to the employer, in order to be actionable.
An example of this type of case may involve a white employer not hiring a black applicant because of the color of their skin., Less common race cases take the form of ""disparate impact discrimination,"" which occurs when a neutral policy or practice has a negative impact on certain racial groups. In addition, you must be able to show that the policy or practice is not job-related or that there is a less discriminatory alternative that the employer has refused to adopt.


An example of this type of case may involve an employer with a strict no beard policy. Assume that employer fires an African American driver for having a beard. However, the African American driver suffers from pseudofolliculitis barbae, which is a skin condition that occurs primarily in African American men. As a result of the condition, the driver cannot shave at all. If the driver challenges the policy, the employer would have to prove the policy is job-related and a business necessity., Evidence in race discrimination cases can be hard to come by. A lot of times you will not know why an employer made the decision they did. However, you should generally look for the following:


Race-related statements made by the employer. These statements may be overt racial slurs or may be hidden code words.
Comparative treatment evidence. This is any evidence that helps you show that you were treated differently than similarly situated people of a different race.
Relevant background facts. Racial discrimination does not occur in a vacuum. Look for evidence of how the employer has treated other employees. You might find a pattern of race-related attitudes or a poor work environment. An example of this may include evidence that the employer allows their employees to make racial jokes without repercussions.
Relevant personnel policies. If the employer follows a relevant personnel policy, it may be evidence that there was no racial motive. However, if that employer did not follow an applicable policy, it may be evidence there was a racial motive.
The decision maker's race.
Statistical evidence., To find the evidence you are looking for, start by contacting potential witnesses. These people could be current employees, friends of the employer, or the employer herself. When you talk with witnesses, especially the employer, you and your attorney need to gauge their credibility. If the employer's explanation does not seem believable, the evidence of racial discrimination is much stronger than if the employer is believable. Credibility can be undermined if an explanation does not match the facts or if it is vague., Request documents or get access to documents that you think will help your case. You should, at the very least, obtain the following:


Your personnel file. These documents will include your application and any notes the interviewer took; any internal documents discussing your application; your employment contract; your job description; performance reviews; award; and letters of reference.
Documents relating to damages. Get your salary information, including fringe benefits, so you can calculate the amount of damages you should be awarded. Try to find W-2s, 1099s, 401(k) plans, and health insurance information.
Party statements. These documents may take the form of emails, internal memoranda, notices of termination, meeting notes, and exit interview notes.
Rules, policies, procedures, handbooks, and manuals. You will use these documents when the employer tries to justify their actions. For example, if an employer justifies their actions saying your performance reviews were sub-par, you will want to know what procedure they have in place for performance reviews, and whether those procedures were followed.
Other charges and suits. You may be able to find evidence of past lawsuits against the employer you are investigating. If there are cases out there, you may be able to get information from those cases. One great example would be copies of depositions., Statistical evidence can help you prove an employer's pattern or practice of racial discrimination (i.e., racial discrimination is standard operating procedure).Statistical data can be hard to come by unless the employer is required to file EEO-1 Reports. These reports must be filed if the private employer has 100 or more employers. A number of federal employers are required to fill out these reports as well.


EEO-1 Reports require employers to divulge racial information about their employees. It includes different job categories and how many individuals from different races fulfill those roles. The employer will then compare the current year's information to information from past years., If you think you have enough evidence to substantiate a claim of racial discrimination, you will need to file a charge with the EEOC. If you are filing a charge against a private employer, you need to file a charge within 180 days from the day the discrimination takes place.


This time-frame may be extended to 300 days if a state agency enforces a similar race discrimination law.
These time limits will generally not be extended., While the EEOC does not accept charges online, they do have an online assessment system that will help you determine if filing a charge is right for you. Once you complete the assessment questionnaire, you can print out the results and use it to begin the filing process., EEOC charges must be filed in person or through the mail. The best way to proceed is by visiting a local EEOC field office near you. Bring any information you think will help the EEOC understand your case. If you are filing through the mail, send the following information to your local EEOC office:


Your name, address, and telephone number;
The name, address, and telephone number of the employer you are filing a charge against;
The number of employees employed there;
A short description of what you think constituted racial discrimination;
When the events took place;
Why you believe you were discriminated against; and
Your signature., If both you and the employer agree to mediation, you can try and resolve the issue before an investigation occurs. If mediation works, you may be able to resolve the case without having to go any further., The EEOC will investigate your charge in various ways depending on the facts of your case. They may visit your employer, talk with you and other interested parties, and they may review documents. The investigation process can take six months or longer.


If an employer will not cooperate with the investigation, the EEOC may issue administrative subpoenas in order to force the employer to cooperate., If the EEOC does not find a violation of the law, they will issue you a Notice-of-Right-to-Sue. This notice gives you the ability to sue in a federal court. If a violation is found, the EEOC will attempt to settle with the employer. If no settlement is reached, your case will be referred to the EEOC's legal staff. They will decide whether to file a lawsuit on your behalf. If they do not file a lawsuit, you will be given a Notice-of-Right-to-Sue., If you want to file a charge against a federal employer, you need to contact an EEO counselor at the agency you applied with or worked for. You must contact the EEO counselor within 45 days from the day the discrimination occurred. The EEO counselor will offer alternative dispute resolution programs, but if you cannot settle the dispute, you will need to file a formal complaint., You will file a formal complaint with the help of your EEO counselor. Once you do, the agency will decide whether to investigate the claim or dismiss it. If the agency investigates the claim, they have 180 days to do so.


When the investigation is completed, the agency will issue a notice allowing you to request a hearing in front of the EEOC or ask the agency to issue a decision concluding whether discrimination occurred., If you ask the agency to issue a decision and they find that no discrimination took place, or if you disagree with a part of the decision, you can appeal to the EEOC or to federal court., If you want a hearing, you must request one within 30 days of receiving the investigation findings. At the hearing, you will plead your case in front of an administrative law judge. The judge will make a finding and order relief if discrimination is found. The judge's findings and order will then be sent to the agency and they will decide whether to uphold the decision or not.


The agency will have 40 days to make their final decision., If the agency declines to follow the administrative law judge's decision, you will be able to appeal to the EEOC. You must do this within 30 days of receiving the agency's decision. The EEOC will review all the materials and make a determination., If you do not agree with the EEOC's determination, you can ask for a reconsideration. Your request will only be accepted if you can show there was a mistake of fact or law. This request must happen within 30 days of receiving the appeal decision.


If a reconsideration is granted, the decision that comes out of it is considered the final agency action., If you have exhausted all administrative remedies and you are still not satisfied, you may be able to file a lawsuit in federal court. In most cases, to file a federal lawsuit, you must have received a Notice-of-Right-to-Sue. You must file your lawsuit within 90 days of receiving this notice.During the administrative process, you may be able to file a lawsuit if:


180 days have passed since you filed your complaint and the agency has not filed a decision and no appeal has been filed; or
180 days have passed since you filed your appeal with the EEOC and they have not issued a decision., Direct evidence is extremely rare in racial discrimination cases. However, if you have it, offer it in court. Direct evidence is an action or statement that directly reflects a discriminatory attitude. If you have direct evidence, there is an automatic finding of discrimination against the employer.An example of direct evidence would be a recording of the employer saying you are being fired because of your skin color.

, If you do not have direct evidence, you will need to offer circumstantial evidence in court. To make a circumstantial case in court, you will need to first make a prima facie case of racial discrimination.If you are suing under a theory of disparate treatment, you will need to show: (1) that you are a member of a protected racial class; (2) that you applied and were qualified for the job; (3) you were rejected; and (4) the employer continued to solicit applications with qualifications equal to yours.
If you are suing under a theory of disparate impact, you will need to show: (1) the existence of a disparity; (2) the disparity was caused by a specific policy or practice; (3) that the challenged policy was not justified; and (4) that less discriminatory measures were available and would have been just as effective., The employer will have a chance to rebut your prima facie case in court. To do so, the employer must provide a non-discriminatory and legitimate reason for the challenged action. The employer must simply articulate a reason, they do not have to prove it was the actual reason for the decision., You will then have an opportunity to discredit the employer's reasoning. You can do this by proving the employer's reasoning is not factually correct or that it was not the true reason for their decision.If you can do this, you will win your federal lawsuit and will receive a judgment in your favor.

Know your own conscious or unconscious feelings.,
Educate yourself.,
Acknowledge differences among communities of color.,
Celebrate differences instead of being colorblind.,
Make friends with people from different races.,
Write down your stereotypes and biases.,
Be kind to yourself.",How to Help Reduce Racism2," Every person has stereotypes and biases about people from other races.Think about what stereotypes (i.e. exaggerated belief, image, or distorted truth about a person or group) you may have and ways you may be discriminating (i.e. treating people unequally). You must understand your feelings before you can address them.Take the Project Implicit Hidden Bias Teststo uncover any bias you may have. You may feel defensive or upset when you read your results. Just take a deep breath and remember that you can change your attitudes and beliefs.
Think about the racism you have seen, experienced, and/or contributed to.

, Read as much as you can about race relations, white privilege, and ways to reduce racism. Read books, listen to music, and watch movies about other cultures as well. Learn about the history of the culture and current happenings. Listen to other people talk about their experiences with racism.


Talk to people within your racial group about your attitudes and beliefs before you have cross-cultural conversations. There are conferences and alliances that allow you to work out your own feelings before you begin the work.Educating yourself is the best way to change your attitudes and beliefs.

, People are grouped into large racial and ethnic groups such as White, Indian, Black, Latino, etc., but there are differences within each group. For example, do not assume that all Black people have the same culture. Black can include people from Jamaica, North Carolina, and Nigeria. Each of those areas has a different culture. Ask people questions about where they grew up, what holidays they celebrate, what kind of foods do they like to eat, etc., It may seem like a good idea to pretend everyone is the same color, but you will miss out on how differences are natural and good.Value diversity instead of ignoring it. Race is often linked to cultural differences (e.g. language, holidays, clothing, etc.) that influence how a person experiences the world. If you are colorblind, you are not acknowledging these differences.


Ignoring a person's race could be offensive to that person. A person may feel like you are ignoring an important aspect of who they are.

, Working with, going to school with, and having close relationships with people from different races helps reduce racism. These one-on-one relationships can help correct any misinformation and stereotypes you have about different groups of people.Put forth an effort to meet people from different races. Join a club,sports team, or organization where you can meet people.

, Pick groups that you have generalizations about and write down your opinions about each of these groups. Be completely honest with yourself as you write. Once you have everything written down, write down where these ideas came from. Did they come from your parents? Did you have a personal experience? You may not even know where the ideas came from.Share your findings with someone from your same racial group if you feel comfortable. This way you will be free to discuss your feelings without offending anyone else.

, Every person has racist thoughts. Accept that this is normal, and it is a good thing that it bothers you. It will be uncomfortable to think about and talk about racism. Instead of being sad or feeling ashamed, put your energy into changing yourself and learning as much as you can.

Speak up when you hear racist slurs or jokes.,
Deal with racism in your family.,
Be an ally.",How to Deal With Racism2," People often ignore racial comments or jokes out of discomfort, not knowing what to say. But preparing a response ahead of time can help you to feel empowered to respond and do your part to stand up for what is right. There are several approaches you can take depending on your personality, the relationship you have with the speaker, and the situation:


Consider saying, ""That's not ok."" In some situations, like in the middle of class or when you have to get off of the bus, you might not have the time or ability to go into a full-blown conversation about what someone has said, but you can simply let them know that their behavior has crossed a line. You'll feel good knowing you stood up for what is right.
Try saying, ""Wow, that was really racist. Why did you say that?"" Opening up the conversation will help the person reflect on whether they should have said what they did.
If it’s a joke, try saying, ""Why is that funny?"" in a very serious tone, like you really don’t get the joke. Forcing someone to explain why it's funny makes the person have to consider the racist implications of what they have said. After they explain, if they still seem to think it's funny, you might say, ""That's really racist.""

, Sometimes the worst offenders are members of your own family, like your dear Grandpa or your own mother. Your family member might make racist jokes or comments, or might actively discriminate against other races (for instance, not allowing you to date a black person or not allowing an Indian friend to visit your home). It can be a tricky situation for you, since the person might be someone you respect and need to obey (for instance, your parents if you still live at home).


Stay calm, but let your feelings be known. Family is built on love and trust, and you should be confident to let your family members know when they have said or done something that is offensive. Don't yell, don't get personal, but do let them know: for instance, you might say ""I didn't like what you said,"" ""It bothered me that you said that,"" or ask them to explain why they say things that are racist. This might open the conversation and provide an opportunity for you to teach them why their behavior is problematic.
Be aware that sometimes this will escalate the problem; for instance, if your Uncle Bill knows that racist jokes bother you, he might purposely tell more.
If your parents have rules about who you can befriend that are racist, you have a choice to make. You can abide by their rules while you live in their home, or you can choose to go behind their back and disregard their rules. Realize that doing this might have consequences for you if they find out.
Sometimes, nothing you can do or say will influence a racist family member to stop doing or saying hurtful things. You can choose to avoid that person as much as possible, and you can continue to let them know how you feel about their racism, but unfortunately sometimes it just won't help. Learn from their choices and do your best to avoid harboring prejudiced or bigoted ideas or habits.

, If you are against racism, but you are not a minority, you can play an important role in confronting racism when you see it. By learning to recognize acts of microaggression against people of color, you can use your position of privilege to help fight racism in all its forms.Practice talking about race in ""safe spaces."" Racism is a hard topic and people who are not minorities are often taught that they should not talk about or ""see"" racial differences. This makes it really hard to fight racism when it occurs, because you may not have experience talking about race at all. Find other allies who want to combat racism, and practice acting out scenarios of racism that you might encounter in your daily lives."
"
Meet people who are different from you.,
Talk about race.,
Contribute.",How to Deal With Racism3," In some parts of the world it can be hard to get to know people of other races. It's natural to gravitate toward people who seem similar to you, and sometimes that means we end up with friends who are all of our own race. Go out of your way to learn about other cultures and ways of experiencing the world. This will enrich your own perspective of the world and help your friends, family, or children to view friendships with people who are different as normal and acceptable.


Visit cultural fairs, festivals, and meet-and-greet activities in your community. Visit the local library or community center to find out information.
Join a club, start a new hobby, visit a church or house of worship, or join a team to meet new people.

, Race has become a very taboo topic because many people have been taught since childhood that its rude or inappropriate to discuss race. But as long as racism exists, discussion, willingness to learn, and empathy are vital; studies show that talking about race leads to increased understanding and tolerance.Take the opportunity to initiate discussion.


If you are a parent, talk to your children about race. Don't shush them if they mention that someone is a different color than they are; its normal for kids to notice differences. Teach them that differences are good! Say something like, ""Yes, isn't that neat? Joe has dark skin and you have light skin. We are all so different!""
When your children are old enough to understand, talk to them about racism. If you are a minority, you can prepare your child for what she will likely encounter and help build up her self-esteem and confidence so that she will know how to react appropriately if something ever happens. If you are not a minority, it's still vital to talk to your children about racism. Teach them the history of race in your country, and talk to them about why some people are racist towards others (prejudices, stereotypes, bigotry, etc.).

, If you are able, donate money or volunteer with organizations that work to end racism in your local community or nation. Some examples in the United States include:


The Southern Poverty Law Center
The Anti-Defamation League
The Human Rights Campaign

"
Know the difference between racism, bigotry, and prejudice.,
Understand how these three intersect and relate to racism.,
Understand the history of racism in the United States and around the world.,
Learn about how racism is connected to systems of power.,
Recognize the results of racism.,
Understand that not all racism is obvious.",How to Deal With Racism4," Often times these words are used interchangeably in the media or in conversation, but there are differences that are worth understanding. Knowing the difference between these concepts can also help you in conversation, when people often use the wrong term for what they mean.


Racism has to do with a system of oppression of a group of people based on their race, skin color, or ethnicity. In general, racism involves a majority race or ethnic group creating laws, policies, systems, and cultural norms that favors their own race at the expense of minority races or ethnic groups.
Bigotry, on the other hand, is about hatred. Bigotry means hating an entire group of people because of who they are and/or believing that your own group is superior, and it is not limited to race or ethnicity; you can be bigoted towards a group based on religion, gender, sexual orientation, race, disability, etc. For example, the Holocaust was motivated by bigotry, as are all hate crimes in United States law.Prejudice (literally meaning ""to pre-judge"") means assuming you know something about a person because of a group they are affiliated with. While it usually carries a negative connotation, prejudice isn't always obviously bad. For example, its prejudiced to assume that all Asians are good at math or that all black people are good singers or good athletes. Those are stereotypes based on race. You can also be prejudiced against a person because of their religion, gender, disability, etc., so like bigotry, prejudice is not limited to race.

, Sometimes racist policies or practices are ""obvious"" (at least when we look back on them historically), for example, the United States' history of slavery (which at the time was legally and religiously justified as natural and acceptable) was based on a racist system. Other times, people disagree about whether or not particular policies or practices are racist; for example, some people argue that Affirmative Action policies (which require companies in the United States to hire a certain quota of people from different demographic groups) are racist, while other people argue that AA policies help prevent racism.


Because racism is about a group in power mistreating a minority group, ""reverse racism"" (which is often used to describe when a member of a minority group mistreats a member of a majority group because of their race) is a misnomer. It should actually be called ""bigotry"" or ""prejudice"" rather than ""racism.""It is important to keep in mind that you can support racism without being bigoted. In fact, you can support racism without even knowing it, since racism is a larger system of oppression.

, A sad but sobering reality about the nature of human civilizations throughout history is that nearly all major civilizations have struggled with racism. This is because racism is about those in power (the majority) mistreating those without power (the minority), and race is one of the major identity fault lines that people have historically used to designate who has power and who doesn't.


In North America, the history of racism arguably starts with the conquest of indigenous tribes (Native Americans or Indians) by white European settles. Literally, one racial group had more power than another (in the form of weapons and diseases that wiped out entire populations).
During the Victorian period in Europe, racism became cemented into Western thought through supposedly ""scientific"" findings about the differences between the races. With influences from Darwinian evolutionary theory, scientists believed that white Anglo races had evolved further than others., Even though many major systems of oppression like slavery have been abolished in many places around the world, large and small racist attitudes and policies are still a problem in every country.

, Because racism is systemic, its effects can be seen in the media, government, school system, and even in religion.


Notice stereotypes about different races and ethnicities in television, books and movies. The popularity of video and computer games provides even more avenues for racism. Contact the people behind racist products and explain your objection. Refuse to support any business or organization that permits racism.

, In day-to-day life, ""microaggressions"" are more common than obvious blatant hostility, but can be just as hurtful. As the term suggests, microaggressions are small acts of discrimination that many people might not recognize at all-- but over time, for people of color, they become obvious and hurtful.A microaggression can be anything from subconsciously moving away from a person of color on the train, asking a black woman if her hair is really ""hers"", or asking an Asian-American where she is ""really"" from.
Microaggressions, unlike blatant acts of hate, are often unintentional. This makes it harder to ""prove"" it happened for the person of color, who risks appearing too touchy or being accused of pulling ""the race card"" if she objects to these types of acts.

Ignore them and their comment.,
Get to a safe place.,
Report them to a superior.,
Know when to take legal action.",How to Deal with Racist Name‐Calling1," One tried and true approach to dealing with racists is not dealing with them. Don’t give the person any of more of your attention. Keep walking, working, or doing whatever you were doing. They’ll get the message., While some people make racial remarks simply out of ignorance, others do so out of hatred. If at any time you don’t feel safe around a racist, ignoring them is the best bet. Don’t say anything. Get yourself to a safe place where others are present, such as a restaurant or public building., If a racial remark happens at your school or work, you can tell someone in charge. This ensures that others in authority are aware of potential racists. It also helps you create a record of the incident in case there are further issues in the future.

You might go to a teacher, guidance counselor, or supervisor and say, ""I was called a racial name and I'd like to report it."" Tell the person, in detail, what happened.
Keep in mind that they may not do anything about the initial incident. But, be sure to report any further incidences to them. If they don't act, reach out to someone else in charge, such as their supervisor., If the person who called you a racial name is someone in authority (such as an employer, business owner, or teacher), you may need to take legal action due to discrimination. Certain websites such as RacistReport.org can help you find a lawyer who handles racial hate crimes."

You are not. Being mistreated or stereotyped because of your skin color is hurtful. And no matter what is put out in the media about racism no longer existing, your feelings are very valid.As a test of the seriousness of the situation, check yourself a few minutes or hours later. Does the comment or behavior still bother you? If it does, that’s a sign it was inappropriate and should be handled accordingly.;
, If you are faced with racism, it can help to discuss the matter with someone you think will understand. This can be a friend, partner, or family member of the same race who may have had to deal with something similar in the past.


This person can help you decide how to handle the racism. Or, if you feel as if the comment or behavior was only minor, you might choose to simply vent to your loved one and get it off your chest.Talking it over with someone who gets it may help ease some of your anger or frustration.
You can say something like ""Yesterday this girl at school told me that I was pretty intelligent for a black girl. Has something like that ever happened to you?...How did you handle it?""

, Micro-aggressions are often seemingly minor comments that may not be overtly racist but still upset the receiver. Sometimes, people don’t even know they are being discriminatory with these comments/behaviors. One potentially effective way to stand up for yourself is to not allow the issue to pass by without incident.If someone said something ugly to you or acted in an unfair way towards you, it may help—them overcome their own ignorance and you feel better—if you call them on it. Say something like “Excuse me, but what did you mean by that?” Request that the person explain their actions. If they claim to not know what you’re talking about, state the facts and wait for their response.
If you do not feel brave enough or think the person deserves your reaction, speak out in some other way. Write a detailed social media post giving testimony to the racism you encountered. Get the message out there to shed insight to those who are ignorant of racism’s existence and impact., Black people are often shamed for bringing attention to racism. Members of the majority group (whites), often disregard stories of racism and counteract that blacks are actually the ones who are racist.You can anticipate hearing all of the above when you make the choice to speak out against racism. But, you must not let that stop you from using your voice.


Prepare yourself by anticipating how you will respond to backlash and getting your family and friends on board for support. Remind yourself that negative comments directed at you are out of fear or ignorance. If someone doesn't know you personally, try your best not to take their insults personally.

, You should not feel in danger simply because of your skin color. If someone says or does something to you that makes you feel threatened, contact your local authorities and report the incident. For example, if you are mistreated, bullied, or harmed as a result of racism you need to take it to the authorities.


For lesser acts of discrimination, you can tell your teacher, coach, parents, employer, or even reach out to a local civil rights organizations such as the NAACP.

, Generations and generations of racism have caused some African Americans to have a poor sense of self-worth. Is your sense of self-worth jeopardized by living in a society that revolves around white privilege? Studies show that blacks who face racial discrimination have more chronic disease and a shorter lifespan.Check yourself to see if racial discrimination is making you think any less of yourself--your health could depend on it.


Look deeply at your thoughts, feelings and beliefs. Do you frequently find yourself buying into stereotypes about African Americans?If you spot some anti-black beliefs, strive to change them by first bringing awareness that they happen. Then, you can look for ways that African Americans defy stereotypes. When you find yourself playing into these stereotypes, recall all the examples of blackness that does not meet the given criteria.

, Because you live in a society that has historically oppressed people of color, you have to work double-time to convince yourself of your worth, especially when negative messages abound about your people in the media. It may seem forced at first, but try to engage in a few activities that help you boost your self-worth.Create a list of everything you love about yourself.
Surround yourself with people who are compassionate, understanding and supportive.
Question whether negative thoughts are realistic.
Celebrate your similarities and differences from others.
Take care of your mind, body and soul.

, This may seem unrelated to dealing with racism, but it’s highly important that you lead a life you enjoy no matter your race, culture, or creed. Taking the time to get involved in activities and endeavors that you are passionate about can help you buffer unwelcome racial micro-aggressions that you encounter.


Things you enjoy might include spending time with friends who are fun or awe-inspiring. You might also engage in hobbies such as playing sports, creating a work of art, or watch television shows that represent your race in a positive way.
Of course, these things won’t change anything or make racism go away, but they can help build your self-esteem and lift your mood. Find whatever it is that makes you smile and do more of it!

, There are many terms which are often used interchangeably with racism, such as prejudice, stereotype, or discrimination. When people mistake the true meaning of racism, they fail to see its true impact. Racism is the belief that some groups of people have traits or characteristics that make them superior or inferior to other groups.Historically, whites have been the dominant race in many societies. Therefore, racism towards blacks occurs because they are thought to be inferior to whites in some way.

, It might be easier said than done, but try to find the patience and compassion in your heart to not perseverate hate. Of course, it’s perfectly natural to feel upset, disappointed, hurt, or rejected after facing racism, but it’s important to not allow those negative feelings to poison your heart. Remember, hate cannot triumph over hate, only love can do that.


Send out good vibes in the face of racism by repeating something like ""I can not change your heart, but I can use mine to offer love."" You can even remind yourself before reacting in an unhelpful way that ""Two negatives only make a positive in math.""

, Learn about your racial heritage and the history of racism. Strive to correct inappropriate viewpoints you hear about black history or blacks in general. The more you know about what people in your race have encountered and overcome, you will probably feel a greater resolve to stand firm in fighting racial hatred.Decide whether you want to educate some people or not. Keep in mind that everyone won’t be worth your time to try to discuss issues about race. Some people will be willing to hear your side of things and others will be resistant to hearing any opinions that differ from their own.When you make the decision to educate, challenge people's stereotypes by asking ""How do you know all black people are that way? What proof do you have?"" Listen to the response and then say ""I have evidence that there are many African Americans who do not fit your description. Are you willing to change your opinion?""

, Some of the fight has to go into the halls and offices of your local, regional, and national politicians. Do what you can to spread the message about anti-racism and educate others about the existence of subtle racism like micro-aggresssions.


Research racial justice groups and volunteer your time and efforts towards advancing their cause. Volunteering is a wonderful way to impact your local community, help you develop empathy for people from all walks of life, and make new friends.Or, simply sign a petition to bring more attention to racial problems facing people like you in your area and abroad."

Ask them to repeat themselves.,
Explain why the comment is inappropriate.,
Deliver a comeback about their own racial group.,
Commit to making an impact against racism.",How to Deal with Racist Name‐Calling2," Make the person repeat what they said to you. This way, they must have the courage to say it again when they have your full attention. Also, you have the opportunity to verify what you heard before reacting.Once they repeat themselves, you might simply use silence to show your disapproval or you might ask questions like, “Do you really believe that?”, In some situations, particularly if the person is close to you or if they may be regurgitating what they’ve heard elsewhere, it can help to educate them. If they are willing to listen, let them know why their comment was hurtful, racist, and inappropriate.You might say, “I’m assuming you spoke out of ignorance on this subject, so I’ll correct you. It is very hurtful to hear you make comments about my skin color or racial group. Even if what you said is true for one person, it’s not true for us all. I’m sure you can think of many differences among people in your own racial group… Please don’t say that again.”

, Most people who make racist comments aren’t accustomed to people turning the tables on them. Make a point to show them what it feels like to be called a racist name by repeating a stereotype you have heard about their racial group.

Once you’ve shared the stereotype, you might follow up with something like, “Now, I don’t believe that about your race, but you can see how it feels to be the victim of a stereotype. Maybe next time you’ll think twice about repeating one again.”Only do this with someone you know and whom you think is likely to be receptive to your example.

, Another way to do something positive for yourself and potentially impact others who experience racist insults is volunteerism and advocacy. Look up groups in your area that stand up against racism or inequality. Join one and do your part to reduce racial intolerance.

Start by visiting the United Nations’ website to learn what you can do to fight racism."

Take a few deep breaths.,
Count to 10 (or 100).,
Drink a sip of water.,
Shake it off.,
Call a friend for support.,
List why you’re awesome.,
Treat yourself.",How to Deal with Racist Name‐Calling3," Breathe deeply before you react out of anger. Take a few seconds to collect yourself and ease any mounting tension. Inhale from your nose for a few counts. Hold the breath briefly. Then, exhale from your mouth for a few counts. Repeat one or two times., A great method for keeping cool after being insulted is counting to 10. You can do this while you practice deep breathing. With each exhale, you might mentally count “1,” “2,” and so on. This can help you get back to a space of calm before speaking to the person.You are more likely to have a productive conversation with the racist person if you are calm and have your emotions under control.

, Some people may be triggered after being called a racist name. You might feel a dramatic rise in anger or anxiety. Water is a terrific “grounding” element, which serves to reconnect you with the environment around you. Plus, sipping cool water may give you time to decide how you want to respond., There’s a popular saying about “letting things roll off your back” when people attempt to degrade you. Sometimes, this is much easier said than done. But, it might be better to act out the concept by wiggling a little in your seat or shaking your arms.

Mentally envision the comment trying to catch a hold to your skin, but you keep shaking until it falls to the floor, unable to harm you.

, It helps to have support when someone has called you a racist name. Even if you consider yourself to be relatively thick-skinned, hurtful comments can still affect you. It’s best to share what you’re feeling with someone who may understand.You might say, “Something happened today. Can I talk to you about it?”

, Being called a racist name can negatively impact your self-esteem. Therefore, nothing helps you bounce back from an insult better than reminding yourself of all the reasons the person who insulted you was wrong. Make a list of all your best attributes. Hang it up on your bathroom mirror or place it on the nightstand beside your bed.Whenever you remember the hurtful comment, repeat the list aloud like, “I am outgoing,” “I am caring,” or “I am a talented trumpet player.”

, Self-care is essential as you recover from being called a racist name. Do something really special for yourself to remind you why you’re important and worthy. Think outside of the box and really treat yourself to something you wouldn’t usually do.This might be a night out in the city with your closest pals, a lounge day at home with a blanket and a good book, or a weekend shopping spree.

Recognize the different levels of racism.,
Acknowledge your privilege.,
Look at examples of racism in history.,
Think about your own experiences of racism.,
Talk to others about their experiences of racism.",How to Become Proactive Against Racists and Racism1," There are several different levels of racism that occur in our society that can be grouped under the larger idea of “racism”. It may be helpful for you to understand the different levels of racism so you can be aware of which level(s) you are engaging with. This can help to strengthen your protest against a certain level of racism and give you the education necessary to make a change. The different levels of racism include: Structural racism: Structural racism refers to a system of hierarchy and inequity that is ongoing, where white people are given preferential treatment over people of color. This level of racism is wide-ranging and promotes the power and privilege of whites over Black, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Arab, and other races. Due to structural racism, there may be inequalities between whites and other races, where white people have more access, opportunity, and power, intentionally or unintentionally. All other forms of racism come out of structural racism.
Institutional racism: This level of racism occurs between institutions in society, such as education, health care, mass media, law enforcement and business. Institutional racism occurs when there is discrimination in the workplace, the classroom, the courtroom, or the media, where individuals in institutions create unfair policies and rules based on race. Racial bias often comes into play in institutional racism, where a person in a position of power, such as a police officer, treats someone differently or negatively because of their race.
Individual racism: This level of racism occurs between individuals and within individuals. Individual racism often occurs due to individual prejudice, individual privilege, and individual beliefs about race that are influenced by the dominant culture.;
, Another key step to being an ally for anti-racism is to take a step back and think about your own privilege. A privilege is a right, favor, or advantage that is granted to one individual or group, and withheld from another individual or group. As a person in the world, you are born with a certain level of privilege, based on your race. This means that based on your privilege, you may be given more opportunities and access, or you may be given fewer opportunities or access.

Acknowledging your privilege will allow you to approach anti-racism with a good sense of where you stand and where you are coming from. A white person, for example, will have more privilege than someone who is Asian or Latino. This can be unintentionally, but is nevertheless a fact of the system of structural racism we live in. If you have white privilege as a white person, this does not mean you cannot engage in anti-racism actions. On the contrary, as someone with white privilege, you should focus on what you can do to be an ally and a supporter of people who have less privilege than you.

, To get a better sense of how structural racism, institutional racism, and individual racism came to be, you should study up on the history of racism in your country. Doing this will give you a better understanding of why racism is a systematic and ongoing problem.You may consult historical texts on specific events, such as the evolution of slavery in the United States or the internment camps for the Japanese in Canada. You may also do a web search on recent events that have occurred, such as the refugee crisis in Syria or the police shootings of unarmed Black men in Ferguson, Missouri.
Once you find more information on a racial event in history, you should look more closely at the role of racism in the event. Ask yourself several questions, including: Who had the power and highest amount of privilege in this situation? Were there racial reasons that caused this event? Did structural, institutional, or individual racism come into play, and if so, how?

, To get a more personal sense of racism, you should consider if you have experienced racism in your life and in what circumstances. This could be a moment where you were discriminated against due to your race or where you witnessed someone else being discriminated against due to their race. Even small moments of racism, known as microaggressions, such as a casual racist joke or an unintentional racist comment, can lead to larger issues of injustice and bias.Being conscious of your own experiences of racism will also make you more aware of when it is occurring and more conscious of your own understanding of racism. If you are a white person, for example, you may not have experiences of racism in the same way as a person of color. Often, white privilege means that white people have more power in a situation and are not subject to racism at the same level as someone with very little privilege., Starting a dialogue with others about racism is one way you can educate yourself about how and why racism still exists today. Talk to friends and family about their experiences of racism. Ask them why they think they were discriminated against and how it made them feel. Listen and discuss the meaning of racism with others to get a better sense of how it affects individuals on a personal level.Though it may be painful to discuss experiences of racism with others, know that by talking about these issues, we can learn and grow. Staying silent and not saying anything or sharing your thoughts and feelings will only reinforce the system of racism that we all deal with every day. Discussion and dialogue are positive steps towards working against racism, even if they can be difficult or uncomfortable."

Call out racist actions online.,
Flag and boycott websites that have racist content or ties to racism.,
Start a dialogue around racism on your social media.,
Create anti-racist platforms and share them with your network.",How to Become Proactive Against Racists and Racism2," You may notice that a friend has posted a racist image on their Facebook profile or a relative has commented positively on a racist joke on social media. Rather than scroll past it and ignore it, call out the person’s racism. Staying silent and ignoring the content will not make it go away and the person may feel they can get away with making racist comments with no consequences or accountability.You may leave a comment that discusses why you believe the posting is racist and how it perpetuates racist stereotypes of a group of people. You may also acknowledge your own privilege in your posting but note that is important that we all recognize and call out racism so it does not seem acceptable or okay.
For example, maybe your friend posts an image of a white person wearing blackface. You may comment on it by saying, “This image is racist towards Black people and represents the lack of power and privilege Black people have experienced throughout history. I think you should remove this image and apologize for posting it. Racist imagery has no place on social media, or anywhere else in our society. If you are curious about how and why blackface is racist, you should read more about the history of blackface in America and how it perpetuates harmful stereotypes of Black people.” You may then include links to reputable sources online that explain the history and background of blackface.
If the person made a comment affirmative of racism, such as ""I agree that black people are evil and should be condemned"", then speak up telling him or her that is a very insensitive and racist thing to say. Tell the person that a lot of them are good people and they do not deserve to be discriminated against just for their skin color.

, If you come across websites, webpages, or social media groups that have racist content, you should flag them as hate groups or containing hate speech. You can flag them by writing to the hosting company of the group and noting that the group is promoting racism. You should then recommend that the group be taken down, as the hosting company should not support racism in any way.You may also want to make your flagging and boycotting of the website public by commenting directly on the website or sharing the website on your social media and calling them out for their racist content. You may then recommend that people boycott the website, as well as any services or products they sell. This could help to build public pressure on the site or group, and cause them to reconsider their stance on race.

, You can also be an active contributor to the conversation around racism by talking about racism on your social media accounts. You may post one article or text a day that discusses racism on your Facebook page or you may share personal stories of racism on your blog. You may also comment on other people’s postings about racism to keep the conversation and dialogue going. Doing this can allow you to use your social media to participate in the fight against racism.If you are a white person, keep in mind you carry white privilege with you. This means you are bringing your privilege to any conversation you are having about race, even online. While it is important that white people get actively engaged and involved in acknowledging racism, white people also need to focus on being allies to people of color and avoid dominating the conversation.
This may mean that you read and share content written by people of color, rather than just texts written by white people. This will allow people of color to speak for themselves and still feel supported by white people. You may also ask people of color how they feel about certain racial issues or topics, rather than posting your own personal ideas on the issue.
If you are commenting on a post by a person of color, do so respectfully and without trying to take over or dominate the conversation. Show an awareness of your privilege and be willing to learn and listen to people of color. This will foster a healthy and honest discussion.

, You can also use the internet for good by creating anti-racist platforms, like an online publication or an online social group that discusses social justice and race issues. Doing this will help you to give more opportunity for people of color to connect, share, and work together to fight racism. You should then promote these platforms and invite people from your network to join.When you are setting up your platform, you should focus on having an equitable and diverse community of users. This could mean making sure you have people of color involved in your platform and in positions of power. You should also ask for opinions and input from people of color so your platforms are useful and effective.

Do small, daily actions to work against racism.,
Stage a protest against racism in your community.,
Partner and collaborate with existing anti-racism groups.,
Have in person discussions with others about anti-racism on a regular basis.",How to Become Proactive Against Racists and Racism3," It may feel overwhelming to try to address racism on a structural or institutional level as one person in the world. Instead, you may want to focus on how you can be proactive against racism on an individual or personal level. This may mean doing small actions throughout your day to address and work against racial bias. Even a small action can have positive consequences and poke a hole in larger racial issues.


For example, you may choose to have lunch at an ethnic restaurant instead of your usual stop at McDonalds to support ethnic businesses and work against racist stereotypes of ethnic food. Or, you may have a discussion with a Mexican co worker about a race based holiday, like Cinco De Mayo, and ask the coworker more about their holiday. This will allow you to have an informed, respectful conversation and learn more about your co worker’s experience.

, Perhaps one of the most direct ways you can stand up against racism is to organize a protest in your community. You may protest in response to a specific racial issue that affects your community, such as the police shootings of unarmed Black men in your city. Or, you may protest a specific racial event that affects you and those around you, such as the presence of a white supremacy group on your college campus. Getting out into the streets and protesting in person can be a powerful way to respond to racism with the support of others.You should communicate the plans of your protest to your friends, peers, and relatives. You may also circulate information on your protest on your social media so people can join and stand with you in solidarity.

, Remember that you do not have to try to work against racism on your own. Reach out to existing anti-racism groups on campus and in your community. Partner and work with them on a specific racial issue or volunteer your time to a racial cause. Getting involved with existing groups can also allow you to learn more about how to protest against racism and how to take on a useful role in the fight against racism.You may want to start by looking up the student groups listed on campus and contact them about getting involved in anti-racism initiatives. You may focus on social justice groups and groups that address specific social issues that are tied to race.
You can also do an online search for community groups in your area who work on anti-racism projects. You may donate your time or your knowledge to help support the project and ensure it is a success.

, Working against the system of racism in your country is a process and will not be achieved in days, weeks, months, or even years. It is an ongoing fight and requires continually discussion and action. You can keep the conversation around anti-racism alive by having in-person talks with others about race.This may be with your group of friends or peers at school, or with your coworkers in the workplace. Share any information you learn about racial stereotypes and call out someone if they do something racist. Use a racist moment as an opportunity to discuss why racist ideas of a certain group exist and why it is important to dismantle these ideas.

Recognize that children are not color-blind.Unless your child is literally blind, they can see that other people have different skin tones, and may begin making associations if they notice patterns that relate to skin tones.,
Expose your child to media involving characters of all races.,
Be a good role model.,
Explain differences in an accepting, casual manner.,
Be truthful about injustice when it happens, and when they learn about it in school.When your child witnesses someone being mean, or something unfair, be honest about the situation instead of trying to cover it up.,
Remember that one racist remark doesn't mean your child is 100% racist.",How to Explain Racism to a Child1," Using words like ""Native American"" and ""white"" allows children to have words for what they see, and can de-mystify it., Because media tends to focus on white people, it may take a conscious effort to consume inclusive media.This is crucial for white children as well as children of color.


Buy dolls of various races, not only white dolls.
Discuss stereotypes as you see them. If your child notices a lot of black athletes, for example, explain that this is a stereotype and that there are many black people in various roles: doctors, nannies, lawyers, biologists, professors, et cetera., Children copy what they see others doing, so be an example of an accepting, humble person. Be aware of the language you use around your child and make sure you don't make racist comments or jokes in front of them, as this could encourage your child to use racist behavior. If someone calls you out for being accidentally racist, listen to them carefully and apologize.


If you notice someone being a victim of racist behavior, stand up for the victim, as your child would mimic your behavior if they were ever placed in a similar situation.
Do this even when your child isn't looking. It's part of being a good person, and you'll be a role model for other people (children and otherwise) who are watching.

, This shows your child that diversity is nothing to be afraid of. Speak calmly about how being different doesn't make someone weird or bad, it just means that everyone is unique. Explain how different groups of people are different in some ways (languages, traditions, etc.) and similar in others (loving families, dreams about the future, etc.), and that this is a positive thing.For example, ""Mommy has dark skin because she is black. I have light skin because I am white. And you are both! People come in all different colors."" Or, ""Angel speaks differently because his family speaks Spanish at home. It doesn't make him weird.""
When explaining, make sure that you make the message age-appropriate. For example, if your child is between the ages 3-5 use literal examples such as ""Eggs come in different colors, but they are the same on the inside."", Give a clear explanation of what was wrong and why. This can teach children that adults aren't always right, bad things do happen, and it isn't the victim's fault.


For young children, keep it simple. ""Yes, it was wrong and hurtful of him to say that to Daddy"" or ""Life can be unfair. Sometimes we can change it, and sometimes we can't"" are examples of simple explanations.
For questions like ""Why don't white people like us?"", explain that there are some mean people in the world, but not everyone feels this way.Trying to hide the truth from the child will only make them curious and confused. It's better to offer an honest explanation, even if it's highly simplified.

, Children test boundaries and explore ideas, and your child may say things that they don't fully mean (to see how others react). Providing loving and clear guidance can help your child learn what is and is not okay.Ask questions to encourage critical thinking, like ""Why do you think that?"" and ""How do you know that?"" Explore their reasoning together.

Deal with impostor syndrome.,
Remember that racist comments are not about you.,
Release the stress of being a cultural “representative”.,
Be informed.,
Use humor.,
Find similarities with those around you.",How to Feel Normal if You're from a Different Race1," Impostor syndrome occurs when you believe that your abilities are not up to par as those around you. You may believe you received a scholarship or a job offer because of your race, somehow making you less qualified than those around you. You may try to overachieve as a result of feeling “not good enough” or feel great dissatisfaction or guilt in your studies or profession. You may fear the day the “truth” comes out and people believe you are a fraud. It’s important to recognize that you have value for your own characteristics and achievements.Be aware when feelings of being an impostor come up. Understand the difference between reality and feelings. When feelings come up, use the statement, “Even if I feel undeserving, it doesn’t mean I really am.”
If you feel like an impostor, know that you are not alone. Even some high achieving individuals suffer from impostor syndrome.
Remind yourself that you work hard and deserve the things you have.;
, Remember that racist comments reflect a problem with the person who holds those beliefs, not you. Experiencing prejudice or discrimination does not automatically make you less valuable or mean there is anything wrong with you.It’s important to feel empowered by who you are and not “less than” other people.[


If you do experience prejudice or discrimination, take it seriously. Report the prejudice to someone who can help. For example, school bullies might exclude you from participating in a social group due to your race, or they might call you hurtful names.These are both actions that should be reported to a parent, teacher, counselor, or another figure of authority. You do not deserve this treatment, and you don't have to put up with it.

, If you are a minority in a group of people racially different than you, don’t feel pressure to represent your race.You may feel like people have negative associations with those in your racial group, and you want to prove them wrong. Remember that you can’t change people’s judgments, no matter how hard you try. There is great variation within your race, and you cannot represent everyone as one person.


Don’t allow people to see you as a representative, either. Remind people that while stereotypes exist, everyone is unique and not to judge a whole group by one person.

, When faced with discriminatory comments, be ready to fire back. This can be empowering for you to have a response and to use information as power.When faced with insensitive comments or racism, be ready with events, facts, or statistics that help you educate people that may be less aware of how these comments affect people.


When people are overtly ignorant about other groups, you can help them understand it better. Even a comment like, “When you put Chinese people down, it perpetuates a mentality of them being less than you” is helpful.
You can also say, ""When you say that Black people are better at sports, you're essentializing a whole group of people, which isn't fair.""
You can also use the power of facts in your favor. For example, if someone makes a remark about how immigrants hurt the community, you can reply that immigrants often own small businesses and contribute to the economy.Or, if someone has said that immigrants are ""criminals,"" you can tell them that immigrants are much less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens., When experiencing stress related to race, empower yourself to not back down. While some people may fire back, you may take a lighter stance by adding a bit of humor to the situation. Especially if you are within a group of friends and someone says something offensive, say something light and funny, yet still makes a point. Using humor can be a bridge to talk about an uncomfortable topic but in a more approachable way.
You can say, “""Well, my girlfriend is Indian, and I haven't noticed that with her... should I call her and ask her if that's true?"" or ""That's a cool joke, can you tell it to my Nigerian friend? Do you think he'd like it?""

, It may be easy to see how you differ from those around you, but challenge yourself to see the similarities between yourself and those you feel different from.Remember that underneath all the cultural and physical differences, we share more similarities than differences because we are all human.


As humans, we all feel fear, joy, nervousness, pain, excitement, betrayal, and love. Even when you feel different, remember that despite cultural differences, we have experiential similarities that make us all human.
Find activities that you enjoy, and share them with a group. This could be joining a sport team, taking a sewing class, or engaging in any activity that you can enjoy with other people.

Assert your boundaries.,
Question the racists in your life.,
Avoid laughing at racist jokes.,
Avoid spending time with racist people.,
Find ways to fight racism.",How to Avoid Influences of Racism and Racist People1," Know where your boundaries are, and decide what you’ll do if someone crosses them. Let the people in your life know what kind of behavior you expect from them.For instance, if you’re hosting a family gathering and some of your relatives are using racial slurs, you could say, “I don’t find that language acceptable. Please don’t talk like that in my house.”;
, Ask something like, “Why do you say that?” Their answer may reveal where their prejudice is coming from. Alternately, they may realize they’re being racist and back down, rather than defend their comment.Asking questions is usually a better tactic than arguing. If you start arguing right away, the person will probably dig in their heels and deny they said anything wrong. Asking questions can also help to keep you calm and prevent things from becoming too heated.
If the person is receptive, you may be able to explain why their comment was racist. Don’t waste your time trying to educate people who are unwilling to listen, though. Also, consider whether the person may be using racism and racist comments to get attention. It’s best to ignore these people as well.

, You’re not obligated to laugh politely at a joke you find offensive, even if everybody else is. Staying quiet and not cracking a smile will let the joke-teller know where you stand.However, if the joke was about someone who is with you at the time, then make sure that you speak up about why you find the joke unacceptable. Don’t try to speak for the person. Just say why you find the joke offensive.
If you know the person who told the joke, consider telling them why you don’t find it funny.

, If certain friends or family members always have something negative to say about people of other races, limit the time you spend around them. Seek out the company of people whose ideas you respect and want to emulate instead.Decide on what you will say and how you will say it if they say something about your increased absence.

, Look for concrete steps you can take to fight racism in your social circle and your community. Stand up for people who experience racism, take their experiences seriously, and get involved in anti-racist community events and programs.If you are not a member of a marginalized race, be thoughtful and respectful of the people who do experience racism. Don’t try to speak for them or draw the spotlight onto yourself.

, You will feel very lazy during the summer, so don't wear a lot of makeup, but still, take care of yourself. Wear some waterproof mascara, full coverage foundation(be sure to take it off at night),add a small amount of blush to give you a shimmering glow, and don't forget lip gloss (you'll want your lip gloss that blends with your lips).

Be honest and open, starting from a young age.,
Don't fear questions.,
Encourage critical thinking about the media and its stereotypes.Your child will see racial stereotypes on the media.,
Use stories to explain racism.,
Teach your child that there are different types of racism.,
Find a video on YouTube about racism.,
Teach them to stand against racism.,
Teach white children to use their privilege for good.,
Discuss concrete strategies for how your child can stand up when they see racism.",How to Explain Racism to a Child2," This will help them to grow as a person, as if they ever experience racist behaviors as a child they would understand that it is inappropriate; however if they didn't know what racism is and they witness racist behaviors, they may mimic it and cause offence to others.


If you try to hide the subject of race, it won't stop children from noticing. However, it may lead them to think that there is something shameful about the topic., Instead, consider them teachable moments. If your child asks about race, says something racist, or asks about something racist they heard, this is an opportunity to teach them.It's okay to say ""I'm not sure"" or ""Let me take some time to think about that.""

, You can help them learn not to believe them by teaching them to think critically and question the messages they hear.


Is it fair that the villain Jafar looks more stereotypically Arab than the hero Aladdin, and how might people who look ""stereotypically Arab"" feel about that?
If Asians are left out of movies, could they be left out on the playground too?
How could your child be a good helper?

, Teaching your children about racism through stories about people who fought against it, such as Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Cesar Chavez, and more can help your child to understand more about racism and how times have changed because people have stood up for what they believed in.


This can also help your child to learn how to have empathy, an important skill for children to develop.

, Children usually mistake racism for being just about skin color, however that isn't the case as racism can be about race, hair color, nose shape, hair texture, etc.


Ensure that your child understands that racism is bad no matter what, whether it's about someone's skin tone or the flatness of their nose.

, If you are worried about using the wrong words when explaining to your child about racism, or if you are bad at explaining things then watching a video would not only be helpful to you, but it would also help your child to visually experience what racism is.


Visually experiencing something will help your child to spot when someone is being racist and this will allow your child to evaluate the situation and put a stop to it.

, Make sure your child knows that any type of discrimination is hurtful and wrong, even if it was meant as a 'joke'.


Teaching your child to stand up for victims of racist comments is helping them to understand what behavior is acceptable and what behavior isn't.

, After hearing the terrible things that have happened in history, children will most likely be upset. These conversations can be painful and messy--which also means that your child will learn and grow a lot.Explain that because of their privilege, people listen to them more. They can use this to defend people of color from racism. Turn the conversation into a positive message about how they can stand up for others.Encourage them to listen to people of color if they say that something is racist or hurting them. Listening matters, and it makes the difference between a ""white knight"" who rushes in to wildly defend others, and a good ally.
Explain that children of color can speak for themselves, and should have this opportunity. If one of their friends is having trouble doing this, suggest that the child help their friend brainstorm strategies for speaking up, and that they have their friend's back., Can they intervene using their words? When should they get help from an adult (and what do they do if the adult ignores the problem)? You can even role-play if they are interested. Discussing clear strategies will help your child know what to do when a situation arises.


If your child does this, tell them how proud you are."

Have a good support network.,
Maintain a positive cultural identity.,
Improve your self confidence.,
Challenge your negative thoughts.,
Join a diverse organization.,
Start social action.,
Remember that you are not alone.",How to Feel Normal if You're from a Different Race2," You are not the only one who feels ‘different’. Find solace with other people who share similar experiences. Knowing that other people have similar experiences can help you feel supported and not alone.Race isn’t the only thing that makes people feel different. Sometimes people feel different for looking different, having physical or mental disabilities, or having experiences that make them feel alienated. Include these people in your support network, too, and support those who feel marginalized.

, Celebrate your heritage by knowing your cultural history, cultural practices, and by engaging with people from your culture group.Having positive associations with your cultural/racial group can strengthen your own feelings of pride in representing your racial group.


Join or start a cultural organization at your school.
Research some of your cultural traditions and ask your family to start participating in them.
Discover role models from your culture or race that inspire you.
Be proud that you are different and that you can teach other people about your own background. It’s exciting to share something new with people!

, Having a positive racial and cultural identity is important to your self confidence.Learn to feel good about yourself and your abilities. What unique traits do you have that make you shine? By realizing that you are talented and unique in your own ways, you can see yourself as having many identities, not just one identity as a certain race.


Find hobbies and activities you enjoy. Learn to swim, dance, or draw.

, Replace negative thoughts with more positive thoughts. If you think “I don’t deserve this” or “I’m too different to fit in with this group”, try and come from a different angle.Instead, replace these thoughts with “I have worked hard and I deserve to be happy and fulfilled” and “Although I may feel different, I can learn from them and they can learn from me.”


Use self affirmations as a way to boost confidence. Choose meaningful affirmations to say or write every day, such as “I am worthy”, “I am talented” and “I love others and am loved”. Affirmations are beneficial in changing beliefs that we may have about ourselves and replacing them with positive ways to see yourself., It’s important to feel accepted for who you are, and joining a group or organization that celebrates diversity yet respects the individual identity can be helpful in feeling unity with other people. By joining with other people that may have similar experiences in different contexts, you can begin to feel aligned and united with more people, and begin to have an in-group identity.Join a student organization at your school or university. If there isn’t one, consider starting an organization.

, If you’ve experienced prejudice, racism, or discrimination, document it and bring it up to an authority (like a teacher, professor, or police officer).It should not be minimized and it is not okay to receive that kind of treatment from another human.


Start a student organization at your school that supports people experiencing similar feelings as a result of race.
If you want things to be different in your community or in your school, collect other people who support the cause and present your case at local town halls, government agencies, and at your school. Remember that you can change things for the better!

, Even if you are the only person of a certain race in your community, realize that there are people all over the world that look like you and feel similarly. You are not the only person who experiences feeling different; many people of different races live in communities that are different from them. You are united with a group of people from your race as well as united in shared experience with many other people who feel different than those around them.

Spend time with people who are different from you.,
Be interested in others.,
Empathize with others.,
Recognize and celebrate differences.,
Apologize sincerely if your words or actions have hurt someone.",How to Avoid Influences of Racism and Racist People2," Seek out friends and acquaintances from diverse racial, cultural, and religious backgrounds. You’ll be less likely to be influenced by racist ideas if you know and respect people of other races in your personal life.As you develop close friendships with people, you can ask them about their experiences with racism to gain new perspectives on it. Listen carefully and don’t dispute them when they share their experiences.
Be aware, however, that having friends of other races isn’t enough by itself to prevent you from being racist. If your friends of color do not speak with you about racism, then you have acquaintances and not friends.

, Instead of making judgments about others, cultivate a sense of curiosity about what their lives are like. Ask questions and keep an open mind about the answers you get.Be polite when you ask questions. Don’t ask anything too personal, unless you already know the person well.
For example, you might say, ""I noticed the unique pattern on your scarf. Does that represent your cultural background? I'd love to know more about it.""

, Instead of assuming that you could never understand someone, try putting yourself in their shoes. Imagine what it would be like to live their life. Look for similarities between your own experience and theirs.Empathizing is especially effective when you combine it with curiosity. You’ll probably find that you have a lot in common with others, regardless of race.

, Don’t try to pretend race doesn’t exist, or it will become the elephant in the room. Avoid claiming that you’re color-blind. Race often has a profound impact on a person’s life, and it’s important – not racist – to acknowledge this.Acknowledge and celebrate the differences that you have with other people and speak openly about the richness that diversity brings.


Telling someone that you don’t think of them as being part of a minority group is often insulting and hurtful, even if you don’t mean it that way. It implies that you think they are somehow “better” than other members of their group, and it dismisses the unique problems they may face as a minority.

, When you’re in the wrong, swallow your pride and admit it. Ask the person you hurt to forgive you, and let them know that you won’t make the mistake again.For instance, say something like, “Anthony, I’m really sorry that I made that racist joke last week. I didn’t realize that it would hurt your feelings, but now I see why jokes like that aren’t funny.”
Don’t expect your relationship with the person to go back to normal immediately. It may take some time for them to trust you again.

"
Be willing to own your mistakes.,
Examine your own biases.,
Learn to identify systematic racism.,
Distinguish between prejudice and racism.",How to Avoid Influences of Racism and Racist People3," If someone tells you that you’ve said or done something racist, listen to them instead of becoming defensive. Acknowledge that you may have some biases you weren’t aware of. Look at your mistakes as opportunities to learn to treat others more equitably., Be honest with yourself about your thoughts and beliefs. Ask yourself whether you have prejudiced thoughts about any group of people.Prejudice doesn’t just involve using derogatory language or excluding others. Making assumptions or behaving a little differently around people of other races can also indicate prejudice.
For instance, if you cross the street or put a protective hand over your purse when you encounter someone of another race, the behavior is probably rooted in prejudice.
Don’t let guilt or shame stop you from recognizing any biases you have. You’ve got to acknowledge a problem before you can fix it.
Take some time to consider how your prejudices may have developed. Does your family also hold these views? Did your peer group contribute to these views? Did your views come from societal messages? Taking the time to reflect on where your views might have come from can help you to understand yourself better and make changes in your life.

, Racism is built into many established institutions. It exists in the educational, economic, political, and legal spheres, to name only a few. Learning about the racial biases in society’s systems will help you spot faulty and prejudiced thinking when you come across it.Redlining, the practice of refusing loans, insurance, or other services to residents of non-white neighborhoods, is one example of systematic racism., Many people use the words prejudice and racism interchangeably, but they aren’t actually the same. Prejudice is the act of judging a person negatively based on a factor like race, even if you don’t know them. Racism, on the other hand, is a system that limits minority groups’ access to important resources.Resources include things like health care, housing, jobs, and education.
Prejudice occurs at an individual level, while racism occurs at a societal level.

Decide on a route.,
Decide on the number of days you want to spend climbing a single mountain and choose your accommodation.,
Acquire appropriate attire.,
Pack for the climb.,
Arrange a guide.,
Rest thoroughly and prepare yourself mentally.",How to Prepare for a Mountain Climb in Vietnam," Climbing a mountain, especially one like Fansipan, is not something you can spontaneously do after months of a relatively sedentary lifestyle. If you have decided on conquering a mountain in Vietnam, your training should begin months in advance, as you will need good fitness and endurance that cannot be achieved overnight. Running, hiking, and wall climbing are great ways to boost your fitness, and doing these activities with weights in your backpack will help you get into even better shape. Do these regularly in order to help strengthen your muscles, build your endurance, and familiarize yourself with the likely challenges of mountain climbing.;
, Thoroughly study the peak you wish to climb. Read reviews of past climbers about the challenges they faced on their excursions and the tips and advice they have for future climbers. Research the specific challenges and features of the mountain you want to climb so that you understand every aspect of it. For example, Fansipan has a jagged, steep nature, making it slippery and unpredictable at times.


Pay special attention to weather conditions. This can a play a huge part in your overall experience up the mountain, for better or for worse. Choose dates for your climb based on seasonal weather and weather forecasts for that time.

, Study the different routes different climbers have used to climb the mountain. If there are more than 1 route available, study them all and read reviews about each of them. Take note of the difficulty, length, and popularity of each route, and use this and other information to decide on the route that you will choose.

, Hikes on Mount Fansipan and in the surrounding area range from one to three days. If you prefer taking it easy and slow, you can stay overnight on the mountain and leisurely complete your climb. Many popular mountains have accommodations provided at specific points on the mountain; for example, Fansipan has a small village at 1,500 meters (4,921.3 ft) up the mountain and an overnight camp at 2,800 meters (9,186.4 ft). You can also carry your own tent and sleeping bag, but this means extra weight up the mountain. If you want, you can also complete the hike in one day.

, Proper clothing will make your climb much more pleasant, and can keep you safe and warm in extreme weather or an emergency. Clothes should be light and of a good synthetic material to wick away sweat and keep you comfortable. Always bring wet weather gear in case of rain or other bad weather. Gloves and warm hats will make a huge difference in cold weather. You will also need shoes with a good grip and plenty of support for your feet and ankles - a quality pair of hiking boots is indispensable, but make sure to break them in well before your hike to avoid blisters.

, You will need basic necessities such as ample water, hearty meals for each day of your hike, plenty of snacks, extra clothing, a map, and a well-stocked first aid kit. You might also want a camera, sunscreen, extra food, a water purifier if there will be a water source you can draw from, and anything else you think you might need.

, When climbing a mountain in Vietnam, it is pivotal to have a guide to show you the way and help you navigate language and cultural differences. Guides are also useful in providing some interesting insight about the mountain, its history, and the surrounding locality, making your entire climb interesting and even educative. There is a sense of security when using a guide as they know the mountains of Vietnam like the back of their hand. Inquire about the guides available and book them well in advance to make sure you have the perfect guide for the excursion.


Many booked trips will include an itinerary for the climb and accommodations. Keep your plans and desires for the length and difficulty of your trip in mind when choosing a guide.

, For a night or two prior to your climb, make sure you get all the rest you need. There are plenty of resorts around most popular mountains in Vietnam that cater to climbers like yourself and will pamper you before and after your climb. However, don't just laze about - mild exercise can help keep your body fit and ready to go. Prepare and motivate yourself for the climb mentally as well as physically.

Dubai while being a year round travel destination is most suitable to be visited at the beginning of the year and towards the end of the year when the weather is cooler.


This is also the time that the city looks its best and there are plenty of activities for the whole family. During the rest of the year it is too hot and humid to get about comfortably specially with children in tow and sometimes dust storms make life somewhat difficult. However something to consider would be that accommodation is at its cheapest during the hot months. Getting about by air conditioned taxis and frequenting only air conditioned spaces many offset the uncomfortable weather conditions.;

Understand your threshold for adventure.,
Research your adventure options.,
Find a suitable accommodation.,
Prepare for your trip.,
Make sure that you are always safe.",How to Plan an Adventurous Vacation in Kuala Lumpur," Wild adventure is not for the weak hearted. You need quite a bit of gumption to withstand staggering heights, free falls into nothingness, and beating the mighty waves. However, Kuala Lumpur offers an array of activities that cater to varying thresholds. You don't have to be an adrenaline junkie to indulge in the Malaysian adventure, for there are plenty of mild yet wild activities to choose from. Think about what adventures you enjoy and what is going to far, and then decide how extreme you want your vacation to be.;
, Check out amusement parks that offer roller coasters, water rides, extreme sports, and even a scare park. If you are looking to do something more natural, head to the mountains for climbs that will be difficult but rewarding. Kuala Lumpur is also home to fascinating underwater scenery that can be explored through scuba diving, or go white water rafting or kayaking for more water adventure. The more research you do, the more possibilities you discover, so search online and read books and travel blogs to discover everything Kuala Lumpur has to offer.

, Choose a hotel or hostel close to the activities you want to take part in. Again, extensive research will help you make the best choice. Whatever hotel that you end up choosing, make sure that you make reservations well in advance so that you can enjoy the best rooms at the best rates.

, If you plan on going mountain climbing or scuba diving or doing any other physical activity, make sure you physically prepare yourself well before your trip. Run, climb, lift, and train to build the endurance to conquer the challenges that await.

, Adventure can be great fun, but if you're not careful, it can also be really dangerous. Never perform high risk activities without the assistance of a professional instructor or a guide. Always check and double check gear to make sure it is appropriate for the activity and ensure that each activity satisfies international safety standards. Once you clear your ground work, you are good to go!

, If you know why you want to leave home, choosing a destination will be easier. Determining whether your goal is to relax and unwind, have new adventures, see famous or ancient sights, or provide your children with lifelong memories will determine what kind of destination you should choose., Instead of making this a chore, have it be a fun activity. Over the course of a few days, weeks or other long duration you wish (e.g. 1-3 months), spend some time talking about each place and why it would make a good destination.

, If you are traveling with children, someone elderly, or someone with a disability, you may want to consider the destination that would be accessible.

, While you may take more time after choosing a destination to find great deals on travel and hotel arrangements, doing a quick online search of approximate costs to travel to each destinations may help you narrow your choices based on your budget.


Keep in mind expenses to travel, stay, eat, and play while you are developing your estimates.

, Ideally, everyone who is traveling will agree on the same place. If there is disagreement, find a way to compromise.


Consider taking turns selecting vacation spots. If you decide to go with your first choice this year, let another travel partner select the next vacation destination.
Find a happy medium. If everyone’s first choice for a destination is widely different, find one that everyone would like, even if it is not on the top of their list.
Pick a destination out of a hat. If there is no compromise on the horizon, let fate choose for you. Write down all of the destinations and put them in a jar or a hat. Then have someone (ideally, an unbiased third party) pull a name out. That’s where you’ll go!

, Depending on the season, a destination which is normally too hot or cold for you to consider might have a more enjoyable climate at a different time of the year. This might also be reflected in a lower cost, if you decide to travel out-of-season., Different airlines can offer widely variant prices for similar flights, so be sure you shop around if you’re planning to fly.

, Remember that booking a flight and hotel together may save you money if the website offers specials or discounts.These websites often compare flight prices from different websites for you, all in one place.

, While flying is the quickest way to travel long distances, other options such as taking a train or bus or even renting a recreational vehicle may be less expensive. They may also be more fun, particularly if traveling with children.

, Reaching your destination is only one transportation consideration. Once you have arrived in the area, you will need to figure out how to get from the airport, train station, or bus station to your hotel. You may also have plans to travel locally while on vacation.


Call the concierge at the hotel you’re staying at and ask whether the hotel offers complimentary or reduced-fee shuttle service to and from the airport. If they don’t, ask for any advice on local ground transportation.
Rent a vehicle if you will need to get around a lot once you have reached your destination. If you’ll be doing a lot of sight-seeing in areas that are spread out, a rental car will be a better option than taxi services. Be sure you know your hotel’s parking policies and fees.
If you don’t plan to leave your destination once you get there (for example, if you’re staying at an all-inclusive resort), you may not need a rental car. Consider a taxi or shuttle from the airport instead.
If you are going to an urban area, search online for the city’s public transportation options. Areas with subways, trains, or bus systems often offer daily or weekly passes that are much cheaper than rental car fees.

, If you’re planning to drive to your vacation spot, be sure your car is up-to-date on basic maintenance.Check the air pressure in the tires.
Change the oil if it has been 3 months or 3,000 miles since the last change.
Be sure that all essential functions are in good working order: check wiper blades, headlights and taillights, brake pads, hoses, and belts.
Be sure you have a spare tire and working jack.

, This can help you compare hotel prices, ratings, and amenities., Consider options like free breakfast, free wifi, in-room amenities like mini-fridge, microwave, and television, as well as options like having a good view or being near public transit lines.

, For very active vacations, a hotel room is often little more than a place you will sleep at night, and a lower cost will leave you with more money to spend on activities or meals. If you’re planning a more relaxed vacation, you may want a comfortable place to relax in luxury.

, A hotel is not the only option for vacation accommodations. Consider trying another type of housing when making your travel plans.


Friends or family may have a guest room that you can stay in. If you vacation somewhere that you have connections, ask around. You may be surprised at the hospitality of even somewhat distant acquaintances.
Local bed and breakfasts often offer more charm and personalized service than traditional hotels.
Many vacation spots have condos, houses, or cabins that individual owners rent out themselves or through property management services. Try searching online for “house rental” + your destination.
Renting a recreational vehicle (RV) or motor home may be a good option for traveling. The RV functions as both your travel vehicle and your hotel room.
Camping is a fun option for anyone who loves being outdoors. Some camping areas and state parks offer amenities such as bathrooms and showers, so it doesn’t have to be “roughing it” completely!

, Even though they may be considered old-fashioned, a printed travel guide can be one of the best companions for your travel. They will have suggestions for activities and ratings for specific companies. The information in reputable guides is usually very accurate.

, Make sure you think of all of your travel companions when booking activities. If you are traveling with children, be sure planned activities are kid-friendly. If someone in your group has health or dietary considerations, try to be respectful of those as you plan the trip.

, If you want to do something special, like a tour of a special collection at a museum, a whale watching trip, a performance, a sunset cruise, or a very fancy dinner, make reservations ahead of time.


If you are going to a popular place during a busy season, special events may fill up, so you will want to be sure to book ahead.
Be sure to find out about cancellation policies or rescheduling if you are booking far in advance.

, If you are planning a vacation, it’s likely that you are making plans for yourself and other people. It may be fun to plan a surprise—a nice dinner or an exciting excursion—for someone who is traveling with you.

, As tempting as it may be to plan every moment of your vacation to be sure you get in every activity you want to do, resist the urge to over-plan. A vacation is supposed to be a break, after all, and a little leisure time or room to participate in an unexpected opportunity can make your trip even more fun and exciting.

, If you have a long list of activities to do or sights to see, rank them based on how important they are to you. That way, you will know to make time for the items at the top of the list.


If you don’t get to every item, you may be able to return to the same vacation spot in the future and finish your wish list.

, The further in advance you plan your trip, the more time you will have to save for it.


Know how much you will need for each aspect of the trip—transportation, housing, food, tips, activities, and all associated fees—and then plan extra for unexpected expenses.
For expensive or special trips, consider asking family and friends to chip in to your travel fund in lieu of gifts for holidays or birthdays.

, Well in advance of your trip, start a list of what you will need to take with you. Keep the list out and add to it anytime you think of something else.


Think about things that you use every day that you will absolutely need while you are away.
Be sure to include or even pre-pack very important things, like medications. Be sure to fill any necessary medical prescriptions before leaving for vacation.
Be sure you know about the weather of your vacation spot so that you can dress appropriately while you are there. You may want to pack a few layers to allow for unusual weather.
Search online for vacation checklists. There are helpful resources that guide you in packing for different circumstances.
If you are flying, be aware that many airlines charge customers per bag, so packing light will save you money. In addition to limits to the number of bags, most airlines limit the weight of each bag and will charge exorbitant fees for overweight bags.
Regardless of your mode of travel, consider packing a first aid kit, snacks, and entertainment for the travel time. Car trips and air travel both involve long periods of potential boredom, so consider bringing along games or activities for the travelers, especially if you are traveling with children.

, If you have pets, you will need to be sure they are cared for in a safe environment while you are away.


If you are driving, you may be able to bring your pet(s) with you. Be sure you know the pet policy of the hotel you’re going to stay at before you get there. Some may charge a deposit or restrict dog breeds.
Boarding your pet at a vet or a kennel may be an option. Be sure you know about the pickup and drop-off times so you can retrieve your pet appropriately upon your return.
Hiring a pet sitter to come to your home may be the best option for animals who do not adapt well to new environments. If you have dogs, be sure that the pet sitter has been to your house (several times if possible) while you are home so that the dogs understand that the person is allowed to be in the house.

Know where the different regions of Slovenia are located.,
Know the cities.",How to Plan a Trip to Slovenia1," The climate is Mediterranean, but this only applies to the coast. The climate is also continental, there being summers which have mild to hot weather, as well as colder weather in the eastside plateaus and valleys.

, The majority of the Slovenian population speaks the language of Slovenian, which is their native language. Thus, it would be a good idea to brush up on that language. Some people also speak Hungarian, Italian, and even German!


Always be aware of which region you are in. There won't be anybody who can speak German on the Croatian coast and vice versa. In many restaurants, there are menus in different languages, and sometimes they are even included in one menu. Just ask for it!

, They are the Coast and Karst, Julian Alps, Central Slovenia, Southeastern Slovenia and two others. These regions are described below.


Coast and Karst -- this region contains the cities of Ilirska Bistrica, Piran, Postojna, and Sezana. Basically, it's the southwestern portion of Slovenia and it includes caves, hills and the coastline.
Julian Alps -- consists of Bled, Idrija, Jesenice and Triglav National Park. It has enormous northwest lakes and Mount Triglav.
Central Slovenia -- this region is home to the capital, Ljubljana. It also contains the cities of Kamnik and Kranj.
Southeastern Slovenia -- Dolenjske Toplice, Kocevje, and Novo Mesto. This is the southeastern region which includes the rivers of Krka and lower Sava.

, There are several cities in Slovenia, including the capital, Ljubljana, Maribor, Celje, Kranj, Novo Mesto, Nova Gorica, Koper/Capodistria, and Velenje. Ljubljana is the largest city, and Maribor is the second-largest.

If you are a Schengen member, you can gain a visa that is valid in all other countries that have both signed and executed this treaty.;
, You can find more information about airport and international bus services from the Ljubljana Bus Station website. During weekdays, connecting buses between Trieste, Italy and Kober and Piran (both Slovenian cities/towns) are often available. In addition, everyday bus trips between Trieste and Ljubljana are available, as well as trips between Gorizia, Italy and Nova Gorica, Slovenia at least once an hour. This trip can also be done by walking.

, Slovenia's main international airport is the Ljubljana Airport and the central part of the national carrier Adria Airways, which provides flights to several cities across Europe with connecting flights to Southeast Europe.


Additionally, the Irish Ryanair services flights from Dublin to Pula across the Croatian border. You can also get to western Slovenia from the Trieste Airport in Italy, and you'd need an hour's drive to get to Ljubljana by highway. You can also take the airport in Klagenfurt, Austria, or the Italian Treviso Airport which provides other entryways to Slovenia.

, There are very good connections with every neighboring country, except for Italy; there are gaps in railway connections in Italy. The most popular connecting routes are found to connect with Vilach or Vienna in Austria, Budapest in Hungary, and Zagreb in Croatia. Travelers can also use the poorer railway connection from other points in Italy, in order to reach Gorizia.


Some destinations offer special international routes, and some even provide contingency tickets that can sell out quickly, but typically they are very cheap. There are also City Star tickets for return trips that are going somewhere from Slovenia.

The first thing to do when planning an expedition is to come up with a mission statement.,
Use a map to plan your route to and from your destination.,
Study books about previous expeditions to the area.,
Decide on a start date and an end date for your expedition.,
What type of ground will you be covering?,
Are there any natural sources of food or water along your planned route?,
Are there any deadly creatures you should watch out for along the way, such as snakes or poisonous spiders?,
Make a list of everything that could go wrong on the expedition.,
Assign each member of your team an essential duty.,

Here is a sample mission statement: ""I plan to lead my team through the Atlas mountains in Morocco. We will observe the hill tribes living there, and take some fantastic photos of the people and the landscape."";
, Work out how far your team will travel each day and plan where you will camp each night. Plan at least one alternative route both there and back in case you come across any obstacles in your journey.

, Read and compare the accounts of at least three different people.

, Investigate the type of weather you can expect in the area at that time of year, as this will affect the clothing and camping equipment you will need to take.

, Is the terrain flat or mountainous? Do you need to take ropes and climbing gear, or would it be wiser to take cross-country skis?

, How many days will you need to travel before you reach them? This will affect your calculations of how many days' food and drink rations you need to carry at the beginning of your journey. Remember that a lot of water is not potable(safe to drink) so you may have to take water purification equipment, Iodine crystals whilst not the nicest tasting, is one of the quickest, easiest and lightest per litre of water purified.

, This will influence the medical supplies you pack., What if someone gets sick from food poisoning or breaks a leg? Make a list of the supplies and equipment you'll need to deal with each situation.

, These duties might include map reading, shelter building, monitoring rations, fetching water, cooking, gathering wood and building fires, keeping the camp clean, and watching out for dangerous animals.

, Give a copy of the plan to everyone who will be going on the expedition. Leave a copy with someone who is not. This person can alert the authorities if you don't return on time.

Do something extravagant.,
Find ways to keep the memories.,
Throw a party for friends and family.",How to Plan a Romantic Elopement," For instance, perhaps you could go back to the campus you met and fell in love on. Alternatively, maybe you fell in love with each other while hiking on a favorite nearby trail. That might serve as a romantic backdrop to your elopement.The place you and your partner choose to elope doesn't have to be extravagant. As long as its somewhere that's meaningful to the two of you, it can be romantic.;
, If there's a place the two of you have always wanted to travel, an elopement is a perfect time to do it. You can be a bit extravagant; it's your big day. Maybe you've always wanted to see New York in the winter, or maybe you've always wanted to venture to Japan. Now's the time to do it. You'll make amazing new memories together while tying the knot., Another option is choosing a destination that is considered romantic. For instance, you could visit France (Paris, the city of love), or take a trip to Florence, Italy. You could try a romantic tropical getaway, or visit the snowy mountains of Colorado.

Think about options that may not have been open to you with a big wedding, such as getting married at a museum or small garden., You don't need to spend a fortune to elope. For instance, the two of you could take a week at a campground or a state park cabin together. You could get married at one of the park's idyllic spots or in a city hall.

, City hall may not seem romantic to you, but you can make it romantic by adding extra special touches. For instance, you could get a pretty dress and bouquet of your favorite flowers. Afterwards, you could hire a horse-drawn carriage to drive you through a nearby park. Adding little details to a city hall wedding can make it a budget-friendly romantic elopement.

, If you and your partner are traveling far away, it will help to hire someone to plan the wedding for you in that area. Yes, you're just eloping together, but if you want some of the traditional elements like a photographer, a venue, and so on, a wedding planner can help you find appropriate people in the area you're going, which takes some of the stress out of it.A wedding planner can also help you look into things like getting a marriage license in the place you're visiting, which may have different laws than where you're from.
If you don't want to hire a wedding planner, make a list of the things you do want at your elopement. You'll need to spend at least a couple of days in the months before your elopement going through reviews online to find people to fill those roles. At the very least, you'll need to find someone to marry you!

, While travel agents aren't absolutely necessary anymore when planning a vacation, they might be helpful in booking a romantic getaway. Plus, you'll be able to focus on each other rather than all the nitty gritty details.

, Budgeting for an elopement is much like budgeting for a wedding. Sit down, and think about what you'll actually want for your elopement. Look at average costs for those things in the area you're visiting by researching prices on the internet. Next, seriously look at the money you have to spend on an elopement. You may need to make some cuts on the elopement, or you may need to be extra thrifty for several months to afford what you want.Talk to family members who would've contributed to the wedding. For instance, if your parents would have paid for a wedding, they may be willing to contribute to an elopement. However, keep in mind that an elopement may be a sore subject with some people.
If you want to remember your (not-so) big day with a photographer, it will likely cost you the same as if you'd had a big wedding. That is, it's usually based on how much time the photographer will spend with you, so take that into consideration when looking at costs., Of course, the traditional look for a wedding is a wedding dress and a tuxedo. However, with an elopement, feel free to be more open with your clothing choices. For instance, you or your partner could wear a dreamy, flowing dress in pastel vintage lace. Another option is a 1950s style dress with a full skirt in a flowery print. Instead of a tux, think about a vintage suit or slacks and a button-up shirt. You can dress up or down as much as you'd like.


Another option is to borrow clothing. You or your partner could wear your mother's wedding dress, for example.

, You're going to get a lot of different reactions to eloping, and it can leave you feeling guilty about your elopement. However, it's important to remember that this day is about each other. You shouldn't feel guilty about doing what you want. Don't let the guilt ruin your elopement., Just because you elope doesn't mean you have to leave everyone behind. If you want, invite your parents to come with you or a close friend to witness the ceremony. It's your day; stick to who you want to be there., Even if you stay close to home, consider adding something extravagant to your wedding. Maybe you want to spring for a professional bouquet. Maybe you and your spouse want a fancy dinner afterwards. Doing something a bit lavish will help the day feel more special., A wedding photographer is still a good idea, even if it's just the two of you, as they will help capture your special day. After all, you and your spouse will be the only ones who witnessed it, so you won't be able to ask friends and family what they thought. Plus, you can make family members feel included by showing them photos.If you don't want to hire a photographer, at least take a camera along to capture some pictures.
You could also spend some time writing about it at the end of the day. Save what you write to read on a later anniversary.

, If you still want to find a way to celebrate with your friends and family, host a big party to celebrate instead of having a wedding. That way, people will feel included, and you'll get to extend your celebrating a bit longer."

If the pumpkin is dirty, wipe it down with a damp cloth.;
, Most people cut the top part out, but some people like to cut the bottom out so that they can place the pumpkin over a candle like a lantern. Whichever you choose to do, make sure that it is big enough so that you can reach inside the pumpkin to scoop out the seeds. Here are some tips for cutting the lid out:If you are cutting the top part out: angle your knife towards the stem to prevent the lid from sinking into the pumpkin.
If you are cutting the top part out: cut a V-shaped notch into the lid. This will help with placement when you put the lid back on.
If you are cutting the bottom part out: angle your knife straight down into the pumpkin. Don't cut a notch, and discard the part you cut out.

, You can use the plastic scoop that came with your pumpkin carving kit, a large metal spoon, or even an ice cream scoop to do this. Discard the fibrous pulp, but consider saving the seeds. You can dry them, roast them, and then eat them.

, Use long, even strokes, and discard the pulp each time. Keep going around the pumpkin until you are back where you started. This will get rid of any last bits of pulp or fiber.


The best type of spoon to use for this is one that has a thin, ""sharp"" edge.
Use the longest part of the spoon rather than the pointy tip. This will allow you to cover more surface area and leave behind fewer grooves.

, Avoid plastic ones or flimsy ones, as they are more likely to break.You can use any shape you want. Stars are one of the most popular shapes, but you can also use other fall-inspired shapes as well, including pumpkins, bats, and leaves. You can also use other shapes that have nothing to do with fall, such as animals.


Smaller cookie cutters are less-likely to warp than bigger ones., If you are going to have a child help you carve the pumpkin, consider tapping the cookie cutter gently with a hammer or mallet until it pierces the skin. This will keep the cookie cutter steady while you child does the rest., Place a wooden block over the cookie cutter, then tap the wooden block with your hammer. The wooden block will help distribute the pressure more evenly. Keep in mind that some parts of the cookie cutter won't go into the pumpkin all the way; this is simply due to the pumpkin's curved surface.Don't pound the cookie cutter all the way in. Leave at least ⅛ inch (0.32 centimeter) sticking out.If your pumpkin has thinner walls, the cookie cutter will likely go all the way through. If your pumpkin has thicker walls, the cookie cutter may not go all the way through, and you'll need to finish cutting the shape out by hand., If the cookie cutter is stuck, use a pair of needle-nose pliers to wriggle it out.Use the pliers to grip different sides of the cookie cutter when pulling it out, rather than just tugging on one side constantly.

, You can also use the little saw that came with your pumpkin carving kit. Use short, up-and-down sawing motions to do this, making sure to cut all the way through the pumpkin., Stick your hand inside the pumpkin and place your fingers against the shape, then push on it firmly until it pops out. If you can't get the shape out, tap it gently with a regular hammer (not a rubber mallet, if you were using one earlier) until it pops out., Sometimes, there may be bits of fiber stuck to the inside edges of your shape. If you see this, carefully pull them away with your fingers, or scrape them away using a metal spoon., Leave at least 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of space between each shape. This will prevent the pumpkin from becoming too weak and breaking., If you cut the top part out of your pumpkin, place the tea light inside it, light it, then place the lid on tip. If you cut the bottom part out of your pumpkin, place your tea light down on the sidewalk, light it, then place the pumpkin over it.


You don't have to use real candles if you don't want to. Consider using a battery-operated one instead. Some can look very realistic!
Another alternative to candles is a glow stick. They are safe and come in many different colors.

Place your pumpkin in a visible location.",How to Paint a Pumpkin," A good pumpkin for painting has a smooth, even surface with no bruises, scratches, or blemishes. Pumpkins with light or very light or shallow ribbing will have the smoothest surfaces. Avoid pumpkins with too many lumps and bumps, or they will be difficult to paint. Look out for any cuts or wormholes that will cause problems, and make sure that the pumpkin is flat enough to sit upright.


Watch out for any soft spots in the pumpkin because that may be a sign of rot. You want your pumpkin to be fresh and to last as long as possible.
Almost any variety of pumpkin can be painted, but the following are especially good: Baby Pam, Sugar Pie, Neon, Lumina, or Cotton Candy.;
, Gently remove any dirt or grime using a dampened paper towel or a baby wipe. Use a soft, dry cloth to thoroughly but gently dry your pumpkin. Avoid brushing the pumpkin with a hard brush because you might bruise or scratch your pumpkin or just damage the skin.


Take care not to get the stem area (top) or the blossom end (bottom) of the pumpkin wet. This can cause the pumpkin to rot.

, Before you start painting, you should have your heart set on a design. Almost any design can look good on a pumpkin, as long as it's not too complicated. Faces are popular, but you could also choose a black cat, bats, a haunted house, geometric shapes, or anything you like. Once you've chosen your design, lightly sketch it on a piece of paper for reference.


Let the shape of your pumpkin inspire your design. For example, a squarish pumpkin could become Frankenstein's head.
Who says painting pumpkins is just for Halloween? You can paint your pumpkin to echo a fall theme, such as painting leaves or scarecrows, or just paint something completely random on your pumpkin.
Have fun with painting your pumpkin and paint a self-portrait or a portrait of a member of your family.

, Though this is optional, applying a sealer to the pumpkin's surface before painting will help the paint better adhere to the surface. Purchase a craft-grade sealer at a hobby or craft store. Sealers are available in either aerosol cans or squeeze bottles, according to your preference.


Use a brush to apply a liberal coat of sealer evenly to the entire surface of the pumpkin, and allow to dry thoroughly. Clean this brush thoroughly if you plan on using it for painting.
Give the sealer time to dry before you move on to paint the pumpkin.

, You can use the natural color of your pumpkin as the background for your design, or you can paint the entire pumpkin another color. Use an acrylic paint to paint the pumpkin. If you have other paint at home but aren't sure if it'll work on the pumpkin, test it out on a small part of the pumpkin to see if it sticks first.


Pick a color that complements your design. If you're drawing a goblin, pick an eerie green color for your background.
Paint your pumpkin in sections, allowing each to dry before moving on to the next. This way, you won't be stuck holding a pumpkin dripping with wet paint.
Watch out for the wet paint on the bottom. Make sure you don't set the pumpkin down on its bottom when the bottom is wet, or it will stick.

, With a permanent marker and a stencil, or a pattern you have made yourself, lightly trace your design onto your pumpkin. Don't overthink it. You'll be painting over what you've traced, so it doesn't have to look perfect. If you're feeling uncertain, you can start drawing the design with a pencil first, and then go over it with the permanent marker.


To keep the pattern or stencil steady, it might help to tape it in place.
To create straight lines, stripes, or shapes, tape pieces of masking tape to your pumpkin in the desired pattern.
Optional: Use transfer paper (graphite paper) to trace your design. Transfer paper is a popular craft product used to transfer a design or pattern onto any surface. Here's how to use the transfer paper:
Print out or draw your design on a piece of paper.
Tape a piece of transfer paper to the pumpkin.
Tape the paper with your design on top of the transfer paper.
Use a pencil to trace the outlines of the design.
When you're finished, remove the two layers of paper, and you'll find the outline of your design traced onto the pumpkin.

, Using acrylic paints, paint your design onto your pumpkin. You can use any tool you like to paint: paintbrushes, cotton swabs, sponges, or cotton balls. Keep a damp cloth at your side to quickly clean off any mistakes. Pretend that you're just painting an ordinary canvas. This one just happens to be round.


If you are using light colored paints, you may need to add additional coats.
Make sure your paint is thoroughly dry before adding layers on top.
Make sure that the design covers all of the visible parts of the pumpkin so you're not just tracing it onto the front. Step back to admire your pumpkin to see how much of it is actually visible.

, When your paint is completely dry, spray a light layer of craft sealant all over the painted areas of your pumpkin.

, If you like, you can make your design even more fun and exciting with decorations and embellishments. Wait for the pumpkin to dry and then add a variety of fun adornments to your creation.


Glue yarn or raffia around the stem of the pumpkin for hair.
Sprinkle glitter on wet paint to add sparkle.
Using glue dots, a glue gun or craft glue, add googly eyes, sequins, rhinestones, pom poms, beads, or craft foam shapes.
Top your pumpkin with a hat for a final touch.

, Put your pumpkin somewhere that will catch the eye whether it becomes the centerpiece of your dining table or sits on your front porch. Make sure it's in a place where people can see it head-on.


If you're placing it outside, try to keep it out of direct sunlight or heat to make it last longer.

, Use a scrub brush or an old toothbrush to remove any stubborn dirt.

,, A vinyl picnic tablecloth works well and can be reused (Think green!).

, Using the orange paint, cover the entire rock. For a more realistic pumpkins, use varying shades of yellow and orange. Use brown to make the ridges of the pumpkin for a more realistic look.


If you would like your pumpkin to look like a jack-o-lantern, decide how you would like to the face to look and paint it on with black paint. If you want it to look as though it is lighted, paint the eyes, nose, and mouth with yellow, then outline them with black.
If you want to add a stem to your pumpkin, use a green or brown pipe cleaner. Wind the pipe cleaner tightly around a marker or wooden dowel, slide it off, then use hot glue or epoxy to secure it to the rock. You may need to use a little glue to keep the coils compact. You can also make a little vine coming off the stem with this method, just stretch out the coil after you slide it off and glue it at the base of the stem.
Pumpkin Snowman or Pumpkin Topiary: To make a ""pumpkin snowman"" or ""pumpkin topiary"", choose round rocks of graduated sizes. Start with the largest on the bottom, then glue the rocks one on top of the other. Remember that if you make it too large it will get quite heavy, so plan accordingly. You may also need to glue the bottom rock to a board for stability. This board can be painted and coated with sealer to make it weather resistant.

You will need enough clay to cover the surface area of the pumpkin you wish to create, as well as enough to create a stem.Because you probably won’t be able to find mass amounts of orange clay, you can purchase white clay and use paint to color it accordingly.;
, This will be used twice for this project. Unless you have orange clay handy, you will probably be working with white polymer clay. To create the orange color for the pumpkin and the brown color for the stem, you will need to dye the clay with acrylic paint. Additionally, after the clay dries, you can add more color and detailing to your pumpkin (and stem) by painting it again with acrylic paint.Don’t forget to purchase a few paintbrushes, if you don’t have any.

, You probably already have these at home, and you’ll need them for this project. Look for heavy-duty paper like a paper bag. This will be used to create the form of the pumpkin. You will need enough foil and plastic wrap to cover the surface of the pumpkin, whatever size you choose to make it., You will be creating the pumpkins and stems separately. This makes them easier to mold and paint. You will need some glue to attach the stem to the pumpkin, and you want it to be a sturdy bond. Mixed media glue works well for this.Your local craft store will have some. If you’re not sure if a glue will work to attach polymer clay together, ask!

, To make sure your beautiful, homemade pumpkin holds up, you’ll want to seal it. While the acrylic paint will be pretty durable, it can be good to add a second coat of protection if these decorations are going to be put in storage for part of the year. For this project, you’ll need to purchase a polyurethane varnish, which works well on polymer clay projects.Depending on the look you want for your pumpkins, you can choose sealants with a matte or shiny finish.

, Making the entire pumpkin out of one dense ball of polymer clay would require a lot of clay. Instead, you’re going to create the form of the pumpkin with your paper! Roll a couple of pieces or strips of your paper into a ball about the size that you want your pumpkin.Don’t worry – it doesn’t have to look perfect. Just get the paper rolled up as best you can!

, The paper ball will start unraveling the moment you take your hands off of it. The aluminum foil will hold it in shape. Once you’ve molded a piece of aluminum foil around your paper ball, you can start to mold it into more of a pumpkin shape. This is the pumpkin form that will create the base of your clay project.The great thing about pumpkins is that they’re naturally bumpy, so don’t worry about trying to make it perfectly smooth.

, It’s important to not start working with the clay until you’re ready to use it, because no bake polymer clay will start slowly drying out once it’s out of the package. Grab as much as you think you will need to cover your pumpkin form. Warm it up by kneading it in your hands, and then add a few drops of the orange acrylic paint into the clay. Then, continue kneading until the paint has mixed into the white clay and you’re left with orange clay. The more orange paint you add, the darker orange your clay will be.Your hands will get a bit messy during this step. If you want to use gloves you certainly can. Otherwise, you can clean your hands when you’re finished with a bit of soap and water., After you’ve gotten your clay to a shade of orange you’re happy with, it’s time to roll it out. You can use a rolling pin for this step, or any cylindrical object with a smooth surface. Place your clay on the surface you’re working on, and use your rolling tool to stretch and flatten it out. Continue going until you’ve created a flat piece of clay large enough to cover the pumpkin form you created.Don’t roll the clay paper thin, or it could break or tear as you wrap it around the pumpkin form.

, Place the center of your clay slab on the top of the pumpkin. Then, carefully fold and wrap the sides over the rest of the pumpkin, making sure everything is fully covered. Once you’re satisfied with the placement, begin smoothing it out. Blend the places where edges of clay meet, being careful not to tear the clay.No bake polymer clay can start to get dry as you work with it. Keep a small cup of water at your workstation so you can wet your fingers while you work with the clay.

, Take a new piece of polymer clay out of the package, and repeat the dying process to make it brown. Then, roll out three pieces of the brown clay along your flat, creating tubes or strands of clay. Cut the tubes into small sections, whatever length you want your pumpkin stem to be.Once you’ve created your pieces, grab three or four of them and gently press them together.
Gently knead and roll the pieces together so that they dry together, but still have the appearance of distinct strands of clay stuck together. This will create the dimensional, ridged look of a real pumpkin stem.
Flatten the stem at the end, where it will attach to your pumpkin.

, Once you have wrapped your clay around the form and you’re satisfied with how it looks, it’s time to add the ridges and grooves. However, you want to make sure that you don’t tear the clay, which would expose the aluminum foil, and you don’t want pieces of clay to get stuck to your tools. To avoid this, wrap the pumpkin in plastic wrap. Now, you can add your texture details with less chance of clay getting stuck or ripping., Real pumpkins aren’t smooth, so this is an important step to make it look realistic. You can use anything from a pencil to a dull knife to add these details. Start from the top of our pumpkin and bring your tool all the way to the bottom, creating long vertical lines. You can add as many as you like, but remember, the clay will start drying so it’s important to work efficiently. You will not be able to change the shape of the clay later., After you've created the ridges and you're satisfied with the texture of the sides of the pumpkin, you'll need to add a bit of detail to the top. The stem will need a flat surface to be glued to. Using your fingers, gently press down on the top to form a little indent that will fit the stem. Place the stem to the top of the pumpkin to ensure it fits properly.

, If you are satisfied with the colors of your clay after it has dried, you can skip this step. However, some people like to touch up their clay with a fresh coat of paint or a little bit of detailing. Grab your acrylic paints and your brushes, and start painting however you want. You can use a light orange around the entire pumpkin and fill in the ridges with a darker shade of orange, or you can keep everything one color. You can paint the stem brown or add a bit of green. This part is totally up to you, so get creative!


Remember, the paint doesn’t need to be perfect and even. Pumpkins are naturally textured and different colors, so embrace a little bit of mess.

, It will feel dry to the touch pretty soon after painting, but it’s best to let it sit overnight. The surface of the paint will dry faster than the full coat, so play it safe and give it some extra time. You don’t want to risk messing any of your painting up by handling it too soon., Once your paint is completely dry, it’s time to attach your stem to your pumpkin. The easiest way to do this is by adding a dollop of your mixed media glue to the top of your pumpkin. Then, press your stem firmly into the glue, adjusting it until you’re satisfied with its position. Wipe off any excess glue.Give the glue a couple of hours to dry. Even after the glue is dry, avoid picking up your pumpkins by the stems, just to be safe.

, You can do this before the glue is dry. Applying the sealant is the final touch, and it will blend your stem and pumpkin together by adding one, cohesive finish. It will also protect your pumpkins from any wear and tear. Spray over the entire pumpkin and stem, and let them dry overnight. Now, it’s time to find a spot in your home for your gorgeous homemade pumpkins!"

Choose a fresh pumpkin.,
Clean your pumpkin thoroughly before carving.,
Scrape the inside of your pumpkin thoroughly.",How to Maintain a Carved Pumpkin1," Before you begin to carve your pumpkin, make sure the stem is thick and strong and that the skin is not punctured. Broken skin allows bacteria an entry point, which speeds decay.


If the pumpkin is already a little soft in the pumpkin patch, even in a tiny area, it's well on its way to rotting. That small soft spot will be a caved in pumpkin in a matter of days. You want a pumpkin with a nice hard body, no give when you press it gently, and even color.;
, This helps prevent bacteria from entering before you've finished carving. Gently wash the outside of the pumpkin with lukewarm soapy water, and ensure that your carving tools are clean.

, This will remove all of the gooey parts that are prone to mold and decay. Using tools sold specifically for pumpkin-carving won't necessarily extend the life of your pumpkin, but tools that are very sharp will create cleaner cuts that will help it last longer. Ragged edges provide more surface area for decay-causing bacteria to settle in, and too much unnecessary sawing will bruise and soften the pumpkin.


The thickness of the pumpkin will not greatly alter how quickly it rots. If you scoop away too much by accident, don't fret.

Mist diluted bleach onto the entirety of the pumpkin.,
Spray the inside, outside and cut surfaces of your pumpkin with a commercial pumpkin preserver.,
Place your carved pumpkin in a tub or large bowl filled with cold water, carved side down.,
Rub the raw edges of your pumpkin with a thin layer of petroleum jelly.,
Put your pumpkin in a cold place.",How to Maintain a Carved Pumpkin2," This kills microorganisms that speed pumpkin decay. You can do this by adding bleach to your cold soak water (if soaking the pumpkin) or by using a plant mister.


Use about 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of bleach in 1 qt. (946 ml) of water. Some professional pumpkin carvers use lemon juice instead of diluted bleach; use a 50/50 solution of lemon juice and water.

In several tests done by enthusiasts, bleaching was the best (by far) method of pumpkin preservation., These preservation products, which are an alternative to petroleum jelly, bleach and lemon juice treatments, are usually available where pumpkins are sold. They are specifically designed to help keep a carved jack-o'-lantern fresh.


If you opt for the bottle of Pumpkin Fresh, you may want to buy two. You'll go through that baby in no time flat. Commercial sprays, in a few studies, have held up to bleach, or even surpassed it., Let it absorb the water for at least 1 hour; however, you can leave it in for up to 8 hours.


This will create a firmer pumpkin that will resist dehydration for longer than an untreated pumpkin. Dry the pumpkin completely after soaking.

, This works best when done right after the pumpkin has been soaked, since it helps seal in moisture. If the pumpkin starts to become dehydrated and shriveled-looking, soak it in cold water again and repeat the application of petroleum jelly. Pumpkins can be soaked for up to 8 hours.


Vegetable oil can be substituted for petroleum jelly. Either way, know that this is a method that has received mixed reviews.

, The ideal temperature for storing pumpkins is 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 5 degrees Celsius). If you live in a cold climate, keeping your pumpkin outdoors (and out of the sun) might work. In warmer climates, covering it with plastic wrap and storing it in the refrigerator until you wish to display it slows the process of decay. Be sure to prevent your pumpkin from freezing, since a frozen pumpkin will soften considerably within a few hours.


Whatever you do, just make sure the temperature is dry and stable -- those two factors are the most important.

Let your hair loose.,
Use a pale foundation on your face and powder your arms and legs white.

,
Choose a dress of either black or red, and with a bit of lace somewhere.,
On a part of your neck, like at the side of it or just above the collarbone, get out some fake-blood, ketchup, paint or even red lipstick/lip-gloss.,
When making physical contact with anyone, hold your breath.",How to Look Creepy Yet Fun on Halloween1," It's especially effective if it's long hair, and any color works. If you want,you could sprinkle some talcum powder on your head but that probably wouldn't give off the air of a haunted, good-looking vamp.;
,, You can have a long dress or a mini-dress, either works. For the black dress, wear hot-pink punky opaque tights that will look awesome, and black heels. For the red dress, black opaque tights and red heels work. Get novelty fangs from Tesco, Co-Op or Asda.

, Paint on two fang marks to create that just-bitten look. Rim your eyes with black kohl whatever your hair colour, and black mascara, and perhaps black eyeliner too. Either choose pink or red lip-gloss/lipstick for your lips.

, Carry around a plastic bottle of cranberry juice (that's a better option than wine) and beforehand rip off the label, or buy some liquid cherry candy.

Put your hair up in a messy bun and entwine it with ivy and grey and white ribbons, before sprinkling on talcum powder.,

, Try going for something that's a little lacy, a bit vintage maybe. Obviously, invest in the usual pointy witch's hat. Wear black opaque tights or white ballet tights, teamed with pointy black Goth boots to finish off the look for a fun, Gothic look.

, The usual - that is black kohl-rimmed eyes and black mascara, black eye shadow maybe, purple under-eyes. You know the drill! Use a clear lip-gloss, or perhaps for the full-on Goth look black lipstick and smudged eyeliner.

, If you want, at the beginning of year leave on outside and it'll rot until you like it. Those plastic imitations are OK, but hardly real-looking. Try for wood and prickly hairs for the mop. Every so often, burst out cackling and for your trick-or-treat bucket have a small plastic cauldron.

, Use toner, moisturizer, shower every day all year to achieve magic-looking skin.

, The bodice should be skinny and old-looking, the skirt a little frilly and lacy. Team this with opaque black tights. Choose black pumps or very small heels for this look, or even black Converse to have a bit of fun with it. And black, lacy wings are awesome.

, Smudge the eyeliner if you want, which could look cool if you want to be a cool Goth fairy.

, Can you imagine an evil Halloween fairy smiling? Of course, smile if you want, and flit around because you are a fairy. Walk with your head in the clouds,and tell the most amazing dark fairy stories when it's time for horror stories.

Purchase enough fresh bacon to cover your body.,
Purchase a flesh-colored outfit from a cheap retailer or find something in the local thrift store.,
Buy two or three packages of heavy-duty safety pins and one roll of brown duct tape.,
Cook each piece of bacon in a large frying pan.,
Transfer each piece of cooked bacon to a plate covered with paper towels.,
Lay the flesh colored clothing out on a large flat surface.",How to Make a Bacon Halloween Costume1," Keep in mind that you'll need to cook the bacon before creating your costume and given that bacon shrinks after cooking, you'll want to purchase more bacon, not less.


Purchase approximately 1 lb. (450mg) of bacon per appendage; you'll need more if you're taller than average.
Keep the bacon refrigerated until you plan to cook it.
Opt for pork bacon rather than turkey bacon. Pork bacon will curl and plump up better than turkey, which provides you with a more interesting design.;
, Instead of slapping cooked pork directly onto your body, create your costume using flesh colored pants, a t-shirt, shorts or a dress.


Purchase your clothing from an inexpensive retailer. You will be attaching real bacon to the outfit and probably will not want to wear it after Halloween.
Buy an outfit made of a breathable fabric. Materials like cotton will help to soak up any residual bacon grease and keep you clean during the festivities.
Pick up clothing that is appropriate for the occasion – if it’s going to be cold, wear long sleeve shirts and pants or even thermals underneath. You certainly won’t want to cover this outfit with a coat!

, The best way to affix pieces of bacon to your flesh colored clothing will be to jab the safety pin through the top of each cooked piece of bacon and then pin it to your clothing.


The brown duct tape can be used to secure the bacon to your clothes if the safety pin does not hold it properly.

,


Use a frying pan that can accommodate approximately 5 to 10 pieces of bacon at a time.
Cook the bacon over medium to low heat to avoid burning.

,


Allow the bacon to cool on paper towels for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.
Pat each piece of bacon with a paper towel to remove excess grease.

,


Lay the clothes on your kitchen table or a large countertop.
If the clothing is wrinkled, use an iron to remove creases before proceeding.

Determine your dog’s basic size.,
Take your dog’s breed into account.,
Measure your dog.,
Determine your dog’s temperament.,
Search online for costume ideas.,
Check the sites of big retailers.,
Try a small retailer.,
Do a safety check.,
Introduce the costume slowly.,
Look for signs of stress.",How to Find a Dog Halloween Costume Online," Many manufacturers keep to standard sizes like small, medium, or large; occasionally branching out to X-small or X-large. So it's important to first establish which category your dog falls under. You want to take into account not only the size of your dog, but it's weight.


For example, you may have a little dog, but it might be quite round. This could make them a medium rather than a small.;
, Besides their basic size, you want to consider their head size, paw size, chest size, the thickness of fur, even the shape of their ears. Though a Dachshund and toy fox terrier might be similar in size (i.e. small) the shape of their bodies is very different. The length of on a Dachshund is going to require a different size than one on a terrier.


The same can be said for a Chow compared to a Boxer. The amount of fur on the Chow is going to require a different size than the Boxer's slim frame.

, Some sites will list the exact measurements of their costumes along with basic sizes, so knowing your dog's measurements can help ensure you get the perfect fit. For the most accurate sizing, take a tape measurer and have your dog move next to a wall while standing upright on all four paws. The trick to this is to measure their height against the wall, rather than directly against the dog, which can lead to errors.To measure their chest, take a measuring tape and wrap it tightly around their middle. You want to start right behind their front legs for the most accurate number.

, Not every animal enjoys being dressed up, let alone being paraded out in front of tons of strangers. Before you purchase a costume, it’s best to think about your canine friend’s personality. If they’re more of a reserved, skittish dog, it might be best to spare them the discomfort. However, if they’re a social dog, they’re less likely to mind dressing up and going out for Halloween.

, Typing ""small dog costume,"" or ""large dog costume"" into Google or any other search engine will lead to a plethora of results. However, you can get even more specific by using keywords like ""cutest costumes for small dogs,"" or ""funniest dog costumes."" If you already have an idea in mind, you can even try searching for that specifically with ""dog costume"" attached. Then you can browse the results to narrow down what you want.


You can also take your own costume into account and try to find a replica or similar version for your dog!

, Places like Spencer’s Gifts, Fun City, Amazon, and Petsmart are likely to have a myriad of different dog costumes. Accessing these places online can also help guarantee you will find the costume you want in your dog's size. Though they can run out of stock, it is less likely with their online shops.


Many of these sites will also have a standard return policy if the costume doesn't work.
Browsing these online stores is also a great way to get some costume inspiration.

, If you are having difficulty finding a costume that you like, going for a smaller retailer like Etsy might garner more success. Since it's a site for small business owners, you are likely to find more creative and diverse costumes. You may also be able to find a seller who will make a costume to your exact specifications/needs.


This direct contact with the sellers/providers will also allow you to be more precise in sizing.

, After you’ve picked out a costume, you want to make sure that it will work well on your dog. For example, double-check that it’s not too restrictive. You don’t want the costume to cause breathing or movement problems. To do this, look at the size of the leg holes and the tightness of the top.


You can also have your dog try on the costume and return it if you notice any problems.

, Similar to most new things, you want to help your dog get used to the costume before your throw them into it for an extended period of time. Try to order/purchase the costume two weeks beforehand and acquaint your dog with it piece by piece.First, allow the dog to sniff and investigate the costume while giving them treats. Then, after a couple of days, drape the costume over them and give them treats again. Finally, after a couple more days put them in the costume and provide even more treats.
The idea is to have the dog associate wearing the costume with good things.

, Even after you are out and about, it’s important to continuously check that your dog is okay. Though they may seem happy and content at first, wearing a costume for an extended period may become uncomfortable. They may also be disturbed by people oh-ing and aw-ing over them if you take them out.


If you notice they have their ears pinned back, their tail tucked, and are cowering, try to remove them from the situation."

Pierce one piece of bacon with a safety pin and affix the bacon to your flesh colored clothing.,
Reinforce the pinned bacon using brown duct tape.",How to Make a Bacon Halloween Costume2,"


Begin with the shoulders, and then move to the torso, back and pant or shorts legs. If you're wearing a dress, begin with the shoulders, then move to the dress torso and work downward to the hem on both your front and back.
Line the pieces of bacon closely together. Allow for no more than ½ an inch (1.3cm) between pieces for the ultimate coverage.
Align the bacon in a “row format.” When you finish one row, move downward and repeat the pattern.

, Roll a piece of tape into a circle so that the sticky side faces outward. Stick the roll behind each piece of bacon. Press down firmly onto the flesh colored clothing to ensure adhesion.

Ask a friend to help you carefully put the shirt, dress, etc. over your head. This will minimize the chances for squashing or losing the bacon strips.
Re-attach any bacon pieces that fall off during the transition from the flat surface to your body.

, If needed, follow up with more duct tape rolls and add safety pins to each piece of bacon.

, It's a greasy costume, so take along a tarp if you're sitting in a car or on anyone's sofa. And be careful not to brush up against anyone else's costume in case you transfer bacon fat and spoil the fabric of their outfit. Most of all, be prepared to be the center of conversation because everyone will want to know why, how and what next.


It's a good idea to have a friend accompany you when wearing this costume. They can help restore missing bacon pieces you've dropped and can alert people to give you wide berth as you're approaching them or when you're squeezing into the drinks line.
Be aware that your costume may be seen as offensive by some people. Be prepared for some grossed out reactions by having a funny remark up your sleeve to lessen the tension. And last but not least, don't get into an argument over what is basically a one-off, never-to-be-repeated costume; just respect their distaste, agree it's not to everyone's liking and promise not to sit too close.

Try to start your planning around six weeks before Christmas. This will not only give you enough time to plan the party, it also will allow you to invite your guests early so that they won’t plan anything else for that day., Don’t plan your party too close to Christmas. Many of your guests may be leaving town to visit family, so if you plan your party the day before Christmas, many people may not be able to come. Instead, try to hold the party at least five days before Christmas.The weekend is usually the best time to hold the party, because your guests won’t have to go to work in the morning.
Also decide if you want your party to be during the afternoon or a night. Most parties are held in the evening, but try to choose what is best for you and your guests.
Get some input from your guests if you aren’t sure when people would be able to make it.

, If you are holding a Christmas party for your coworkers, you may be able to hold the party in the office. However, if you’re holding the party for family or friends, you will need to either hold the party at your house, find someone who is willing to host the party, or rent out a location.


Renting out a space can be expensive, so if you feel comfortable holding the party at your house, this may be the most convenient and cost-effective solution.

, Decide in advance whether you want your guests do a gift exchange like Secret Santa or White Elephant. This is not a necessary part of the party, but it can add some excitement and give your guests an activity to bond over.To do a Secret Santa, give your guests the name of another guest, preferably a person that they already know, to buy a gift for.
For White Elephant, all guests bring a small or funny gift that anyone could enjoy. Then each guest picks whichever present he or she wants during the party.

, Once you have pinned down the details of the date and time of your party, send out invitations either by email or mail.


Make sure that the invitations include the date, time and address of the party.
Also make sure that the invitations tell your guests to RSVP, so you will have a sense of how many people will be at the party.
If you decide to do a gift exchange, give your guests the information on what they need to bring.

, Draw up a general budget of your party. Unless you are renting a space, providing food and drinks will probably be the most expensive aspect of your party. Decide if you are going to have catered food, or if you are going to prepare food. If you are doing catering, call up the caterers and ask for an estimate for the amount of people you are inviting.
If you are preparing food yourself, estimate the approximate cost of ingredients for dishes you plan to make. You can consider holding a potluck-style party where each guest brings a dish if you trying to cut down the cost.
Consider if you need to rent anything like chairs, tables or coat racks to accommodate guests.
Consider the Christmas-specific decorations you will have at your party, such as the Christmas tree, as well as garlands, stockings, or other small pieces of décor.

, If you have decided to go the catering route, call the restaurant or service you are getting your food from. Make sure that the catering company offers a wide range of food so that everyone will be able to find something they like. Tell them the date of the party, and ask them how you should proceed in getting their catering delivered.Catering companies will do all the hard work of preparing and delivering the food, so that all you will need to do is pay.

, If you have decided to prepare food on your own, decide on a menu that will appeal to all your guests. Make sure to have one or two vegetarian options.You don’t have to offer your guests a full meal. Finger foods are ideal for Christmas parties because they are easy to eat and are often easy to prepare as well.
Make sure to provide desserts as well as savory items.
Some good examples of tasty and easy to make foods are: deviled eggs, veggies and dip, bruschetta, pigs in blankets, and gingerbread and Christmas cookies.

, Many Christmas parties serve alcoholic beverages. Decide if you want alcohol at your party. You may decide to buy alcohol and mixers at the store, or you may want to prepare a large batch of alcoholic punch or a batch of your favorite cocktail. Do what you feel is best for your party., Depending on what you decide to serve, try to prepare your food as early in advance as you can. If the food must be fresh, prepare it the morning of your party. Remember that if you are serving hot foods, you can always warm them in the oven or nuke them in the microwave before serving., Even if you want to prepare most of your food, there are still things that you will probably want to buy. These include drinks like soda or alcohol, and also snacks like chips and cheese and crackers. You also may want to buy fresh fruit or veggies like strawberries that your guests can enjoy.While you are at the supermarket, remember to buy any plates, napkins, cups or utensils your guests will need to eat.

, If your party is at a rented venue, the space should already be ready and set up. However, if you are holding the party at your house or your office, you will likely need to do some major cleaning.Start by cleaning all surfaces and putting everything in its place.
Then take a step back and assess if there is enough room for your guests. If the room feels too cluttered or crowded to hold a large amount of people, start to move things into other rooms to make sure there is enough space for everyone.

, You will need to put out long tables for holding food. You also should make sure that there are enough chairs to hold about a fourth of your guests. Your guests are going to mingle and walk around, so you don’t need to have as many chairs as you have guests. However, aim enough chairs or couches for elderly guests or for guests who get tired of standing.

, The Christmas tree is the most important focal point of a Christmas party. Place the tree so that it’s in a prominent, central location while still not being in the way. Decorate the tree with lights, garlands, and ornaments, and place a star at the very top.


Remember to plug the lights into an outlet and turn them on before the start of the party.

, Make sure the rest of the space follows a Christmas theme by putting out stockings, tinsel, mistletoe, red and green ornaments, and any other decorations that fit the Christmas spirit.Don’t skimp on the decorations—a good Christmas party needs plenty of Christmas décor.

, If your friends or coworkers are bringing their kids, you will want to set up an area with games or fun activities for them. This will keep kids entertained, occupied and out of trouble!Set the kids area slightly apart from the hustle and bustle of the party.
Consider the ages of the kids coming to the party when picking out games. For instance, Monopoly would be too complex for three year olds, while older children would be bored by toys designed for younger children.

, Set up food at a long table, with savory appetizers at one end and desserts on the other. Make sure that there are plenty of plates, napkins and utensils at each side of the table so that guests can help themselves.Also consider putting out toothpicks if you are serving food like fruit or shrimp cocktail, which are easier to spear than to eat with you fingers or with forks.
If you are serving hot food, heat it up 30 minutes before guests are scheduled to arrive.

, Make a playlist of your favorite Christmas songs, mixed in with other party music. Use speakers to play the music at a normal volume.When making your playlist, think about your audience. Consider that your coworkers and your older relatives may be at the party, and play music that is not too aggressive or too inappropriate.
If you don’t know what kind of music to play, consider having a site like Pandora or Songza make a playlist for you.
If you are planning a large party at a venue, consider hiring a professional DJ.

, Glaring lights can kill a cheerful holiday vibe. Dim overhead lights, and turn on any standing lamps or other light sources. Consider hanging Christmas lights along the walls to give your party a twinkling, warm light.


You also can put candles on tables and shelves; just make sure that the candles are held in jars, or other safe containers. Also make sure to monitor the candles after you light them, and keep them out of reach of children., Part of your role as host is to greet each guest as they join the party. Warmly greet them and ask them how they are. Let them know where everyone is, and that they should help themselves to food and drinks.Say something like, “Hi Jasmine, so glad you were able to make it! Come in, everyone is in the living room. Help yourself to food!”
You can also give your greetings a personal touch by asking or saying something pertaining to each individual. For instance say, “How’s your new job going?” or “Is Chris going to be able to make it?”

, Also ask your guests as they come in if you can take their coat and/or purses. Either put them on a coat rack, or put them in an unused room so that your guests will be able to pick them up later., Once all your guests have arrived, go mingle with everyone. Try to chat with at least all of your guests a little bit, and have some food. Remember to smile, and try to enjoy yourself. Remember that everyone who accepted your invitation appreciates the effort that you went through to put on this party., There’s always one person who drinks a little too much at Christmas parties: make sure that person isn’t you. As host, you are the most critical person at this party, so you don’t want to drink too much and lose focus.Even if you feel like drinking could help you feel less nervous, try not to have more than one or two drinks.

, About fifteen minutes after everyone has arrived, make an announcement or propose a toast. This is a way of thanking everyone for coming and showing how much it means to you that they are at your party.


You can say something like, “I just wanted to say, thank you all for coming! It’s so nice to see all of you together. Here’s to a great holiday season!”

, As host, part of your job is to make sure that your guests are comfortable. It could be that some of your guests only know a couple people at the party, and they may not know how to meet other guests. Make sure to introduce guests who may not know each other and get them started on a conversation.An easy way of introducing people is to say something like, “Hey Alyssa, have you met Sally? She was in my class at UMass.”

, If you are doing a gift exchange, start it about midway through the party. This gives time for your guests to eat, drink and chat with guests.Make an announcement like, “Alright, is everyone ready to do Secret Santa?”
Give your guests instructions about how to exchange gifts. Say something like, “Everyone gather over to this side of the room, and bring your gifts. I’m going to read out who everyone’s Secret Santa is, and when I call your name, go ahead and exchange your gift!”

, At the end of the night, start to wind down the party. Use subtle methods like turning down the music, or putting away food, to signal that the party is over. As your guests leave, smile and thank them for coming."

Ask anyone who is contributing to the party how much they can pledge and add it up. Then, list the major components of the party and allocate money to different categories. Your major costs will include:


Invitations. Try not to spend more than 5%.
Decorations. Depending on what you already have, you may need to spend up to 10%.
The cost of entertainment. This should be minimal, but not more than 5%.
Party supplies. While you may already have paper plates and napkins laying around, consider putting aside 10% for this cost.
Food and drinks. This could take up to or even more than 60% of your budget.
Miscellaneous. Consider allocating 10% for unexpected costs.;
, The best and cheapest place for your Christmas party is likely your home. Not only can you use your home free of charge, but you’ll be able to cater your party, and have plenty of time to set up decorations. In addition, you’ll be able to take advantage of any Christmas decorations you already set up.


Dedicate a part of your house, like a living room, sunroom, or dining room, to your party. Close off the rest of your house to guests., While you don’t typically think of invitations as a large expense when throwing a party, the cost of cards, envelops, and stamps can add up quickly. To avoid this cost, invite your guests with an electronic invitation. Do this by either sending them a personalized email or by using a service to send your invitations.


Create your invitations with graphic editors like PicMonkey or Canva.
Use Evite websites like Paperless Post, Punchbowl, Celebrations, or Green Envelope., To meet your budget, reuse decorations from prior years. In addition, ask friends and family if they have old decorations you can use for your Christmas party. Focus on:


Ornaments
Garland
Christmas lights
Pine cones
Holiday-themed serving plates
Bows and ribbons, If you’re planning your Christmas party in advance, take time to visit garage sales in the weeks or months before. You’ll likely find every sort of decoration you could want.

, Christmas decorations are most expensive in the months leading up to the holiday. To avoid this expense, plan ahead and buy decorations in the off season. While you may be able to find decorations for sale for cheap in the spring or summer, the best time to buy is the week or two after Christmas when stores are trying to get rid any Christmas decorations they have left.


You may be able to buy decorations for as much as 90% off during the weeks following Christmas.

, In addition to reusing old decorations, you can create your own from things you have lying around the house or from inexpensive items you can purchase at a craft store.Make your own tree ornaments. Use pinecones or old pieces of metal to make new and exciting ornaments.

Wrap candles with holiday ribbons or fall leaves. Take green and red pieces of ribbon and wrap regular candles in them.

Decorate a wreath. Use old ornaments, ribbons, and other Christmas decorations to turn a boring wreath into an exciting one.

, Food is one of the costliest elements of throwing a Christmas party. As a result, focus on inexpensive food that is appropriate for the season. Some season-appropriate inexpensive foods are:


Turkey
Stuffing/dressing
Green beans
Cornbread
Apples

, Go through your Sunday newspaper and other ads for any coupons you could use to buy food for your Christmas party. If you have a certain food or product in mind, run an internet search to see if there is a manufacturer coupon available. You'll be surprised about the good deals you'll wind up with.


Use smartphone applications like Walmart's ""Savings Catcher"" or Target's ""Cartwheel."" In addition, regional supermarkets like Publix have Facebook pages and applications of their own.

, Buying in bulk is one of the easiest ways to lower the cost of your food. To buy in bulk, either visit stores like Costco or Sam's Club, or buy the largest pack of whatever product you want. In the end, you'll wind up saving per unit or per ounce.Don't buy something you don't need just because it seems like a good deal.
After you figure out what you need, compare prices of like items. You may find that its not worth you getting a 30 pack versus just getting the 10 you actually need.

, Think about turning your Christmas party into a potluck where everyone brings a dish. This will not only save you a lot of money, but you’ll get people invested in the party itself.


Coordinate what your guests are bringing. You can either start a list that people can access on the internet, assign people dishes, or make a list of suggested foods and allow people to pick what they want to bring.
Some items to suggest include: pumpkin pie, Christmas bean salad, Christmas cake, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, snickerdoodles, dinner rolls, and Swedish meatballs.
Supply items that others did not provide. In the end, you might find your guests did not supply all of the essentials – like dip to go with chips., Along with food, drinks – especially alcoholic drinks – are the largest expense of Christmas parties. To defray this cost, offer only a few drink options and buy them in bulk. Consider:


Serving only one signature alcoholic drink. For example, serve eggnog with rum, whiskey, or brandy. If you’re having a lot of people at your party, buy the largest sized bottles you can at your local liquor store. Figure that guests will have 2 or 3 drinks each, and calculate how much you will need.
Buying two liters of soda, gallons of tea, or buy a punch mix. Avoid individual servings like cans of soda., If your budget is too tight for alcohol, inform your guests that they are welcome to bring their own drinks. You can do this by writing a line on your evite or by telling them in person. In the end, your guests will be able to get into the holiday spirit with their own spirits., Gift exchanges are a fun activity for Christmas parties that shouldn't cost you much at all. To do a gift exchange, instruct all of your guests to bring a small gift that costs between $5 and $20. Then, there are numerous ways you can exchange the gifts.


Guests can exchange the gifts with each other.
Guests can place the items under a tree and then pick a different gift. If you choose this, you can turn it into a ""white elephant game,"" where guests wind up stealing gifts from each other.
You can create a ""Secret Santa"" list where people are assigned another person to buy a gift for.

, A really fun and cheap way to provide entertainment is to host a holiday karaoke contest. To do this, use a karaoke machine or set YouTube up on your television. Then, invite people to compete to see who can sing the best Christmas tune. Think about using songs like:


""Jingle Bells""
""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree""
""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer""
""Walking in a Winter Wonderland""
""Santa Baby""
""Jingle Bell Rock"", Don’t pay for a band, buy holiday music, or otherwise pay for entertainment. Instead, rely on free music services on the internet (like YouTube, Spotify, and Pandora) or from other sources like your cable provider's music channels. Ultimately, you’ll be able to enjoy most of your Christmas favorites without spending a dime."

If you want the gift to be a total surprise, make sure you hide it well and act naturally before you give it to them. The less they see it coming, the happier they will be.
If your partner is anti-surprise, let them know you have something special for them. They still won’t know what the gift is, so it won’t be spoiled, but they will be aware that you have something prepared.;
, If you’re presenting your significant other with lacy lingerie and a sex toy, consider giving them their present in privacy. If you think they’d enjoy getting a huge bouquet and a piece of jewelry at a romantic dinner, then present it that way. Some people love romantic gestures in public while others prefer sharing the moment alone, so just try to determine which your partner would prefer.

, By concealing the present in a gorgeous wrapping paper and placing it in a beautiful bag, your significant other will be even more giddy and excited at the moment of the big reveal. You can even increase the excitement and anticipation if you leave the wrapped gift in plain sight, before giving them the chance to open it.If you've purchased the gift from a store, ask if the clerk will wrap it up nicely for you. If you're on your own for this part head to a craft store to pick out the best wrapping supplies.


If you're not a crafty person and don't know the best way to wrap the gift, check out YouTube! There are tons of tutorials on the best way to present a gift., Often times, this can be the most memorable and touching part of a gift, so don't leave this until the last minute. Think about the occasion, reflect on your feelings towards the recipient, and don't be nervous about getting sappy. A perfectly written card is the cherry on top of the romantic gift.Flatter the person you're giving the gift to. Tell them all the reasons why you love them, and why they deserve this gift.
Get nostalgic, and talk about special moments you've shared. Look forward to the future, and talk about what else you hope to experience with them.

, Whether you’ve chosen to present your gift in private or in public, make sure that you’ve set the mood. If you’re at home, candles, flowers, and soft music are all great ways to create an intimate mood.If you want to give your gift in public, choose somewhere with dim lighting and a sexy vibe. Wine or champagne is a bonus in either scenario!


Deciding the atmosphere that works best for your partner is absolutely the most important piece of advice, however.
If your partner feels uncomfortable at swanky restaurants or is allergic to scented candles and flowers, use common sense. Worry less about creating the perfect “stereotypical” romantic evening, and more about making your partner feel loved and happy.

, Sometimes the process of giving and receiving a gift can be a gift all on its own! If your present consists of multiple pieces, think about giving it piece by piece throughout the day. This will keep your partner excited and feeling loved all day long. If you want to get really creative, construct a scavenger hunt for your love! You can give them clues that will lead them to their gift at the very end.Don't be shy to enlist the help of your lover's family and friends. They may be able to help you pull off a really fun and special gift presentation.

, Tell them why you chose that specific gift for them, and why you think they’ll like it. This gives you an opportunity to show the thought and love that went into picking the gift.If you explained it all in the card, just instruct them to read that first.


Your sweet explanation why you chose the gift may mean more to your partner than the actual gift. It’s a chance to show them how well you know them.

, Remember, life is not perfect and something can go wrong that could make the situation slightly uncomfortable. When it comes to giving romantic gifts, that awkwardness could most likely arise if they aren’t happy with the gift, or if they do not have a gift for you in return.


If it’s clear in their face that they don’t like the giftand it’s not something they enjoy, don’t be afraid to address it. Tell them that you really want them to have a gift they will adore, and you’d love the opportunity to pick out something new with them. Reduce any tension by showing them you are not hurt, and that your intentions with the gift were good.
If you expected a gift in return and don’t get one, don’t take it to heart. Smile and tell them that you loved getting them something, and that they shouldn’t feel obligated or guilty that the gift-giving was one-sided. You can be upset, and maybe even address it, later, but don’t ruin their gift by dwelling on your nonexistent one.

, It can ruin the mood if they are gushing their thanks and you brush it off. It can be uncomfortable to accept another’s enthusiastic appreciation, but don’t sour the moment by saying something like, “Ehhh, it was nothing.”Tell them that they are very welcome. Explain why you think they deserve the gift, and tell them you're happy that they enjoy it.
If you want to be extremely romantic, tell them that every day with them is a gift and you're happy to return the favor!

, This may seem obvious— on your partner’s birthday, on Valentine’s Day, on your anniversary, or on another special date. However, if the romantic calendar date falls on a week day and you’re celebrating on the weekend, you'll have to decide when you want to exchange gifts. If it’s a “just because” gift, then you can give it whenever you think works best.


If you opt to wait for your celebration with your partner rather than the actual date, make sure they know something special is coming so they don’t feel like you forgot!

, You may see them on the morning of their birthday or your anniversary, but giving a romantic gift may work better at nightfall. However, if your significant other finds early morning to be the most amorous and dreamy time of the day, give them their gift then! Every couple is different, so consider your own personal style while planning the presentation.The most important thing is to decide when you think your partner would most appreciate receiving the gift.

, For example, If your anniversary falls on a Saturday but you just found out that your partner’s parents will be visiting all weekend, maybe you should consider presenting the gift early. If you’re giving an extremely romantic gift, you don’t want to create any discomfort or embarrassment by choosing the wrong time. Similarly, if you planned on giving your significant other a sweet letter and gift at dinner but they are having a rough morning, maybe give it to them early to help cheer them up.The important thing to do is to give your romantic gift when you feel like the timing is most perfect.
Remember, plans are great, but they can be changed. It’s your gift, after all!

, Your parents have obviously tried hard, so you must be grateful of that. Say something like ""thank you mum and dad, I know you tried hard""

, Saying ""I hate my stupid present"" won't get the best results. You may be thinking that, but say something like ""I'm ever so sorry, but I don't play The Sims anymore"" or ""sorry mum, but Evanescence isn't my thing"". Be mature and make sure you apologise, or at least sound apologetic.

, Some parents might apologise and offer to exchange it in the store for you, whilst others might be upset, offended, or they might not understand. If they apologise and offer to exchange it, thank them and decide whether to accept their offer (or be really mature and say that you can exchange it yourself). If they are upset or offended, apologise again and tell them that you know they tried hard, and either leave it there or politely ask if you can exchange it (it might be better to have this conversation later if they are really upset or angry).

",How to Make a Basket from an Egg Carton," While plastic ones probably could be used, they're liable to split when cut and be more fiddly, so this article is focusing on the cardboard ones. Any color is fine––if you've been collecting them and have a variety of colors, you might like to use a few different ones to liven up the baskets.;
, Cut as many cups as baskets you'd like to make. Cut with care, to maintain scallops around the top of the cup.

, Cut circles from the lid of the egg carton. The circle should be the same diameter of the top (open part) of the cup.

, This will balance the basket, ensuring that it doesn't topple over. Only proceed to the next step when the glue has dried. (It helps to press down on the circle, placing your finger into the base of the carton cup.)

,


Pierce two holes either side of the cup, just down a little from the top of the cup, at even heights.
Push one pipe cleaner end through one hole and loop around to keep in place.
Push the other end into the other hole, again making a loop to keep it in place. The handle should now form an arc over the top of the carton cup, serving as the basket's handle. It's now a miniature basket.

, If you need to cut it, do so, but account for the edges to make sure they stay looking pretty. If using fabric instead, it's a good idea to edge the fabric with pinking shears, to ensure a pretty final look.

, This doily should make a border around the outside of the circle, wider than the basket.

, Glue or staple on artificial flowers and leaves to complete the basket. Arrange them so that they are to the side, and not in the way of putting things into the basket.


If you'd like, tie a ribbon bow in the middle of the handle, at the top.
Markers can be used to decorate the sides of the basket. Draw small flowers, ladybugs, birds, etc., to enhance the basket's appearance.

, It can contain all manner of small items, from miniature chocolate eggs, seeds, beads, tiny pencils, little dolls, candies, jewelry, and more.

, If something won't set for formatting, you can skip it. Try to format the photos in different shapes, which adds beauty to your gift.


You can use a program such as simple PowerPoint for formatting. In PowerPoint, you have different formatting tools, which make your photos look even more beautiful and the way you want them to look.

, Be sure to choose one that won't dominate your photo. Try choosing a background of the occasion for the gift, a background related to the gift receiver's favorite color/place, a background with more plain space, or a background filled with small units such as flowers or images.

, Arrange them in a beautiful pattern. Try to fix them in  an order of occasion/sequence. They should appear in a ""go for overall"" look, and not  in very different shapes (which may look odd).


Keep a minimum number of photos in order to leave some space for other additions.

, Decorate the remaining empty space with cute little things which the receiver loves, such as some cute cartoons holding flowers, the receiver's favorite items such as cars and pets, numbers/letters made with jewellery like pearls and diamonds, and God's idols.

, Border your background if you'd like, and if you want to show more creativity. Choose the border which suits your background. Select it depending upon the occasion/anything which may highlight your background.

Asses what you already have.,
Separate what you need from what you want.,
Consider the price.,
Don't just register to register.

,
Decide how much you want to register for.",How to Register for Gifts,"


Do some serious inventory before you start to register for anything. Maybe you want an upgrade on something, or maybe you forgot all about something you already had. Take notes as you go so as to be very thorough with your assessment of what you own. If you are registering for wedding gifts, perhaps you want to categorize your list by room of the house. Or, if you are registering for baby gifts, consider dividing your registry list up by the type of need, such as bath time, sleeping and feeding.;
,


Registering doesn't just have to be practical. It is your chance to get some fun items you wouldn't buy yourself. Consider registering first for the items that are necessities. Then, once people begin to purchase some of those items, begin to add a few of the more recreational gifts. There is a good chance, if you think the item would be more fun then practical, that your friends would agree and may be more tempted to purchase those items rather than the ones you actually need to have.

,


Although people want to buy you special gifts for the major events in your life, most of them are still conscience of the price tag. Be realistic when you are choosing items and determine if someone in your life will truly spend that amount of money on that item. If the answer is no, remove it from your gift registry.

,,


If there aren't very many things on your registry, particularly for a bridal registry, it is often an indication you would prefer to have money. Be thorough on your registry, but don't fret if it doesn't look like very many items. It is important, though, to consider the number of bridal or baby showers you will be having and counting the number of people that will want to bring a gift. It is more customary to give cash as a wedding gift, but not typically for a shower.

You may comment on the kindness and generosity of the present. ""What a generous present!"" or ""how kind of you!"";
, If you struggle to bring a smile to your face to show gratitude for something you'll never use, or something you never wanted, try to appreciate the thought behind it. It's always possible to offer a few words of thanks concerning the thought they put into it.


""Thanks so much! What a thoughtful present!""
""I really appreciate that you thought of me!""

, Think about why they gave you the gift, and thank them for that reason. Even if the gift giver made a bad choice, they probably had at least one good reason for it.


""You must have remembered that I love chocolate!""
""Thank you for these colorful socks; you know I like to keep my feet warm.""
""Thanks for the CD! I'm always looking to expand my collection.""

, Ask your giver about the gift and how they thought of it. This is good distraction from discussing whether or not you'll use it, how often, etc. Ask them where they bought it, ask them if they've got one themselves, or ask how best to use it (if applicable). In general, when reacting to a gift you don't like, put the burden of the conversation on the person who is gifting, and not yourself.""Do you have this CD too? What's your favorite track?""
""I don't think I've ever seen socks like these; where did you get them? Do you have a pair yourself?""
""I definitely don't have a sweater like this--how long did it take you to knit? How long have you been knitting?""

, If you don't have a moral issue with telling small lies to spare the feelings of well-intentioned people, go ahead and say you like it. Most people consider it polite to tell small lies about gifts rather than telling the giver you are disappointed.


However, you should avoid telling a big lie. Say you love the present, but don't say it's the best present ever, or promise to use it every day.
If you don't lie, just avoid saying that you hate the gift.
""Thank you! What a great present.""
""This is wonderful, thank you! Where did you find it?""

, If the person who gave you a gift is someone who knows you well, someone with whom you have a lot of rapport, just tell them the truth if they push. You can laugh about it together.


A bad gift is not a big deal, but lying could make it into one.

, If your gift giver senses you don't like the present, they may start asking you questions about whether you ""really"" like it, or when you will use it. Either tell a tiny lie, or counter their questions with more questions so that you don't have to answer theirs.


If you can, coax them into offering a suggestion on how/when to make full use of your gift. Then give a quick ""I'll be sure to do that"" and move on.
In the case of a gift that is clearly mean-spirited, it's acceptable to throw any poise and respect out the window. Don't be afraid to tell them they can keep it.

, Once you have opened the gift, immediately thank the giver. If you open and then pause, you will seem disappointed.

, Look your gift giver in the eye while you thank them! If you don't like the present, you probably won't make properly admiring faces while you look at it—but you can always look into the face of your gift giver and appreciate their kindness.

, If you are a good actor, grin or beam at the person who got you the gift. It might help to remind yourself that they were trying to make you happy! That alone is a gift. Only smile if you can do it while feeling relatively natural.


Don't force a smile! It will look fake.

, If you are a bad actor, one way to hide your face and your disappointment while also displaying gratitude is to give the gift giver a hug. If you are on hugging terms with the person, immediately hug them after you open the present.


A hug is truthful—it's a loving way for you to tell them you appreciate the love behind the gift.

, You don't need to feign excitement. Instead, summon up warmth for the sweetness of the gift-giver, who is trying to please you by giving you a gift. Think to yourself,""they were trying to please me by giving me this.""


If you can, smile. If you're a bad actor, just thank them.

, While sound advice for any gift you receive, the thank you note has an added importance for those gifts you couldn't stand. It will put to bed some (if not all) of the worry the gift-giver might've had about your attitude towards the gift (or the giver having gifted it). Send it a week or so after you received the gift. As with receiving it, mention the thought behind the gift more than the gift itself. Be non-specific as to your involvement with the gift after the fact, possibly nothing more than ""I'm enjoying it.""""Thanks so much for coming over and spending some time. I can't believe you put all that effort into knitting something for me--thanks again.""
""Just wanted to send my thanks for coming over the other night. So glad you went out of your way to get me a gift, happy to have another CD for my collection.""

, If you're truly aiming to deal with the gift outright, you can always pass it along. A caution, however: don't get caught doing this. Even if you were straightforward about your feelings from the outset, it's thought of as tacky and insincere to pass along a gift already gifted. At the very least, make sure the person to whom you're passing it along to will appreciate it greatly. Your only defense in a situation like this is to insist--honestly--that you've given it to someone who could really enjoy it. Either that or donate it to charity., Usually, the anxiety and awkwardness associated with the moment of gift-giving is unique to that moment. In time most come to appreciate the scope of the gift and realize (as you should) that it was truly the thought that counted. So if you weren't forthright from the beginning, don't be afraid to let your feelings be known after the fact if pressed on the issue.


Tell them you gave the gift a try, but didn't like it. Pretend as though this was as much a surprise to you as it is to them hearing it.
Do your best to make light of the situation, but never seem as though you regret receiving a gift. A thoughtful but unwanted gift is always better than none at all.
Ask them if they'd like it back. If it was something they themselves have pined after or use themselves, offer to let them have it. Most people will say no out of courtesy, and this you'll have to accept. Never try to push it on them or you'll come across as rude.

, Given the appropriate occasion, such as your birthday or one of the winter holidays, consider having a wish list. It doesn't necessarily need to be a list itself, but know what you're aiming to get. For those of your family or friends who can't help but gift terribly, lay it on thick to them what it is you really want from them. If the desire is really to just avoid the bad gift, make your suggestion something cheap and easily attainable.


""I'm still working through the last CD you gave me. I'm really looking forward to 's next release though, should be out before Christmas.""
""I love those socks you gave me, I wear them around the house all the time. There's these shoes though that I'm really pining after; I think they sell them at .""

, For the chronic bad gift-giver in your life, go out of your to find out just what they would like. Don't be afraid to even ask ""what would you want to get?"" If they try to demure or offer an ""anything'll do,"" press them on it. Everyone always has something in mind, so find out what it is. The hope here is that they'll mirror your effort when it comes to gifting next.

, If they just won't quit, it might be time to say something before you have a room dedicated to gifts you never wanted. Hopefully you know your gift-giver enough to explain to them without offending them. If not, be prepared for them to become upset even if it's not really justified. Sometime after they've given the gift, pull them aside and tell them honestly ""I'm not really sure this gift is for me.""


""You know I love music, but this is just really not my style. I'm more into .""
""I can't thank you enough for knitting this for me, but I'm not sure it fits with anything in my wardrobe.""
""I think I need to be honest: I've never found a way to pair any socks you've given me with anything I own. I can't thank you enough for the gift, but I've no use for any more socks like this.""

In advance, buy some small lotions and perfumes at stores like Bath and Body works and keep these in a drawer or cabinet.,
Put some tissue paper at the bottom of a gift bag, and spray with sparkles if wrapping a girly present.,
Cards!",How to Put Together a Great ''Last Minute'' Gift," If you have boy relatives (everybody does), buy some mini flashlights and small gadgets and put them along with the girl stuff. Other things to buy are lip gloss, iTunes cards, nail polish, etc. Make sure you have colored tissue paper and small gift bags to wrap it! Be sure to remember where you placed them, because nothing is worse then forgetting a present!;
, Neatly place the item(s) inside. Make it look professional! Take the tops of the tissue paper at the bottom, and bring them to the top, hiding the spot where you can see the gift with extra tissue paper!

, Forgot gifts? Make a card! Place a couple dollars inside the card, to make up for no gift! Make sure you also include a card with the gift, present or not. It's always friendly when you give a merry, bright card!

Choose a gift that's sentimental.,
Give her flowers that aren't roses.,
Stay away from cliches.,
Make her a cake.,
Buy her something moderately priced.,
Make her a gift basket.",How to Pick a Birthday Gift for a New Girlfriend1," It will probably touch her heart if you buy your girlfriend something sentimental.


For example, you could buy her something that represents how you met! That's probably not going to be too over-the-top, but it will convey that you are someone who's thoughtful and pays attention to details (and that you're happy you met her).
Maybe you met in a coffee shop; get her a mug from there.Maybe you met her in a bookstore. Get her a book from the section she was in when you first saw her.
The point of such a gift is to show you care without being too romantic because it's early on. The benefit of such an approach is that it's just a coffee cup! Yet, it also has a deeper meaning.;
, Roses are probably too romantic for a new relationship, and they're kind of a cliche anyway.


You could look up the meanings behind other flowers. Send her a bouquet with a card that says, ""Did you know calla lilies are said to symbolize magnificence and beauty? Happy birthday, and I just wanted you to know I'm glad we met, and I hope you have a nice day today!""Other flower meanings would work too. Daffodils would be a great choice because the yellow flowers symbolize new beginnings! It will up the romance if you have the flowers delivered.
Purple irises symbolize eloquence. Gladiolus symbolize strength of character. The goal here is to match the flower to something about her that you admire, and let her know the meaning.

, You want to make an impression when a relationship is new. It would be a mistake to ignore her birthday because most people appreciate being remembered.


However, you want to put some thought into it without seeming like you are getting too serious too fast. So avoid cliches. That means you should forget the box of chocolates.
It also means that you can bypass the cheap bouquet of wilted roses at the local grocery store.Instead, strive for something that shows you've noticed her uniqueness, and you're a person who is thoughtful. That will make the best impression.

, She might appreciate your effort, even if you're not really a very good baker!


Alternatively, you could buy her a cake with a creative saying on it that will have some meaning to her.
You could also keep it lighter by making or buying a cupcake for her. Many communities have specialty cupcake stores. Buy her a creative flavor.
Most people appreciate having a cake on their birthday, so she will probably appreciate the effort and, if you actually made it, and it's not perfect, she might even laugh (in a goodhearted way) and find it endearing.

, The goal here isn't to spend too much money, but to show you've put some thought into it.


You could buy her a pair of fluffy slippers, or a new iPhone case in a color that you know she likes. If she drinks, you could buy her a nice bottle of wine, and read up on the winery, so you explain why you picked that brand.
Avoid buying her clothing if you've just met. It can be very perilous to try to guess women's sizes!
Buy her nice stationary, or a print you got at a local art fair. A good rule of thumb is to spend between $15 and $50 for a first gift. Spending more than $100 might make it seem like you are trying too hard to impress., This should be one you actually put together yourself. Inside it, place inexpensive items that are things you know she likes.


If she likes Snickers, for example, put some in there. Ditto with Cherry Coke. Or funny socks. Add in a book you know she would like, and a couple movie tickets if she likes those.
You could include a small stuffed animal (depending on her age; that works better if she's under 25).
Put mostly food items in the gift basket or other things that relate to things she likes to do. If she loves golfing, you could include a new set of golf balls, for example!"
"
Buy something practical.,
Buy her tickets to a future event.,
Offer to do something for her.,
Buy her a book.",How to Pick a Birthday Gift for a New Girlfriend2," If it's a new relationship, it's a good idea to err on the side of practicality versus romance.


Don't buy her something that she'll laugh about to her friends, though, such as a toaster or a vacuum cleaner.
Rather, buy her something that you've noticed she needs. She will probably appreciate your thoughtfulness. You could also buy her something more artistic for her house, such as a pretty vase you found.For example, you could buy her an espresso machine, and tell her you've noticed she likes espresso (if she does), but that she only has a regular coffee machine.

, However, don't make it too far into the future. That might be presumptuous if the relationship is new.


What does work is to buy her tickets for an event that upcoming weekend (but maybe inquire gently as to whether she is available). You could also buy her tickets to a new movie she's been talking about wanting to see.
These could be tickets to a local wine festival, to a concert for a band she enjoys, to a book reading, or to any number of things.Another possibility is to give her a card indicating the event you'd like to take her to, and choose one that doesn't require tickets (like a local fest). That way you're not making assumptions about her time. These gifts are called ""experience gifts,"" and they produce memories if you do them together!Take her to an amusement park!

, Maybe you noticed that her hedges need trimming or that her refrigerator is making loud noises.


Tell her for her birthday you would like to come over and help her out with X, Y, or Z. She will probably appreciate the fact she can rely on you.
Give her a nice card that explains that, although the relationship is new, you are enjoying getting to know her, and wanted to do something that shows her she can rely on you as the relationship progresses.
Smile and say, don't worry, when things aren't so new, I can be a romantic person too! But I'm trying to be respectful, and take it at a nice pace.

, This gift has a dual purpose. It shows her that you are a person with intellect and also that you have a sense of her likes.


Pick something that relates to a topic she is interested in. You probably can't go wrong with a book of poetry! Try E.E. Cummings or, if she is Irish, William Butler Yeats.
Let's say she is a lawyer. You could get her a biography of a lawyer she admires. In other words, try to tie the book into her life somehow.
Whatever you do, don't buy her a cheap pop culture paperback (unless it's a book she mentioned, or the book a movie she loves was based on) and don't buy her a self-help book! Along the same lines, you could buy her a CD from a band she likes.

Write her a poem.,
Give her a nice card.,
Give her vintage jewelry.,
Invite her to dinner.,
Buy her a candle.,
Treat her to a spa.",How to Pick a Birthday Gift for a New Girlfriend3," Even if you're not the best writer of all time, the fact that you tried will probably please her. The poem should be light and fun, not heady and about love at this point.


One benefit of writing a poem in a new relationship is that poetry is subjective, meaning there are many ways to interpret it. And, in the beginning of a relationship, you will generally want to be a little mysterious still.
You could focus the poem on an attribute of hers that you like. Don't only think physical (but, if you do, pick something like the color of her eyes or her smile). Keep it short!
Instead, focus on a trait of hers you admire. Maybe it's how she talks to everyone the same, no matter their socioeconomic status. Maybe it's that she loves animals. Maybe it's that she is fearless or hard-working.

, You could find a card that is geared toward a new relationship. Hunt around in the card aisle.


Find one that doesn't convey platonic friendship, but isn't gushing with love, either. You can find poems with statements that fit an early relationship.
Inside the card, write something short but heartfelt. You could write something like, ""I've really enjoyed getting to know you, and I'm glad we met. Happy birthday! I look forward to seeing how this evolves.""
A nice touch would be to include a pressed flower inside the card representing a trait you see in her. Alternatively, you could write her a handwritten letter that expresses that you are happy you met her, and explains what attracted you to her.

, Everyone knows that jewelry connotes seriousness in a relationship, especially if it's a ring. So stay away from rings! It's too soon!


However, that doesn't mean you can't give her jewelry just because the relationship is new. You can, but it should be something more decorative than romantic. You could get ideas of what she likes from her Pinterest page, if she has one.For example, you could pick up a pair of vintage earrings, and tell her you knew they'd look good on her when you saw them because they reminded you of the color she was wearing when you met.
You could buy her a pretty bracelet, turquoise earrings, or basically any type of jewelry that is not a ring! Avoid gemstones like diamonds for now. Go quirky and artistic, not expensive.

, Tell her you know she might be busy on her birthday, but if she's not, you'd love to take her to dinner. You could also make her dinner! Since it's a new relationship, don't assume she is spending her birthday with you, though. Ask her a few days before if you can take her to dinner for it!


Ask her what her favorite restaurant is, unless you already know it. Pick something she will like or simply ask her where she would like to go. Make sure to pay!
Come armed with a card. A dinner is an inherently romantic setting if you pick a place where you have to dress up.
The other benefit of inviting her to dinner is that you will have a chance to talk to her and get to know her better. Make sure you tell the server it's her birthday!

, Candles are great because they have a romantic connotation, but they also can be simply decorative.


Buy her a candle with a romantic scent, like cinnamon, ocean mist, or vanilla. Vanilla is an aphrodisiac.Try not to pick something too homespun, like apple or pumpkin pie. The goal here is to send her a subtle signal that you want to pursue more than friendship.
Put the candle in a pretty bag, and include a nice card that thanks her for the time you've spent together.

, Tell her you know she has a lot on her plate at work (if she does), and that you wanted to make sure she takes time for herself!


Give her a gift certificate for a massage at a reputable local salon, or for a manicure or pedicure.
You could also treat her to a facial, but a massage might be a safer route because she won't think you're implying she needs it!
You could just give her a general gift certificate to the spa, and include a list of the services inside, letting her pick!

Give a cash gift to friends or family.,
Pay attention to exclusions to taxable gifts.,
File a Form 709 if circumstances apply.,
Realize that gifts are not tax-deductible.",How to Make Sure Your Cash Gifting Is Legal1," Cash gifting is when you give someone any amount of money without an exchange of goods or services. You can give cash gifts without paying taxes under a certain limit.Any cash gifts under $14,000 per person in a calendar year are not taxed. Cash gifts under this amount are not required to be filed as a gift underneath that limit.
Cash gifts over the $14,000 limit are applicable to be taxed. This is per person, so if you give $28,000 to your son and his spouse then it will not be taxed. It is usually the responsibility of the donor to pay taxes over this amount.;
, There are some exclusions to taxable gifts. Even if you are over the $14,000 limit, you may not have to pay taxes on these types of gifts.Tuition or medical expenses are excluded from taxable gifts. If you are paying tuition for your son or daughter, you won’t have to pay taxes on those gifts even if they are over the limit.
Gifts to your spouse are excluded from taxes for the most part. Since you are considered a unit by the IRS, you do not have to pay taxes on gifts to your spouse.
Any amount given to charities or political organizations are also not taxed as gifts. These usually fall under a separate classification for tax purposes.

, If the gift is over the $14,000 exclusion amount, you have to file a Form 709, which reports the gift as not meeting exclusions. For the most part, you will have to pay some taxes on your gift.Gifts that exceed the minimal exclusion ($14,000) to multiple people require you to file a Form 709. This does not apply to gifts to your spouse though.Gifts that are not for immediate use, but rely on future interest, may require a Form 709. Cash gifts require that the gift can be used immediately in order to count as an exclusion.
Any interest in property that you gave your spouse that’s not for immediately use requires a Form 709. This is especially true if that interest is given for only a limited time.

, Gifts are not usually tax deductible unless they are sent to charities rather than individuals. Unless your son or daughter is literally a charity, legally speaking, you cannot deduct gifts given to them.If you are giving to charities, especially when paying from a business account, this is usually deductible under your taxes. The charity must be legally recognized by the IRS.
When donating to friends or family, they must be a legally recognized charity for you to be able to deduct the gift on your taxes. Otherwise, you must follow regular cash gifting procedures.

Receive a cash gift from family or friends.,
Be prepared to pay taxes if the donor does not.,
Be aware that cash gifts are irrevocable.",How to Make Sure Your Cash Gifting Is Legal2," If you receive a cash gift, your requirements are only to file for taxes it if it is above the $14,000 per person limit. You will still have to report it so it falls under the “annual exclusion” for gifts.When you receive cash gifts, you have to file it under an “annual exclusion”. This “annual exclusion” states that the amount of money you received can be used immediately.
Even if you will not be using the full amount of the cash gift immediately, it can be filed as an immediate use. The IRS just wants to verify that your cash gift is not an investment or payment for goods or services, which are both taxable.

, For the most part, donors are required to pay taxes if they do not meet the ""annual exclusion"" requirements. However, you can arrange to pay the taxes instead.In many cases, the donors will pay the taxes of the gift. If they pay you more than $14,000 per person, then taxes will be due.
You can arrange to pay the taxes instead of them if you desire. If your parents are giving you money for a house down payment, you may want to pay the taxes on it rather than having them pay taxes on their gift to you. Be sure to talk to tax accountants first before making such arrangements.

, If you receive a cash gift from a relative, there can be no stipulations on that gift. Once it is gifted, it belongs to you permanently.In the case of cash gifts for house down payments, your family can set this up as a loan if they wish to have legal recourse in the future. You can usually get banks to set up loan paperwork between individuals for a fee.
Family members that want their money back or some form of payment after a cash gift have no legal recourse. In order to be considered a gift, the amount can have no requirements on its use.

"
Recognize cash gifting clubs.,
Think about what a ""gift"" truly means.,
Don't believe success stories.,
Take your time when you hear a pitch for cash gifting.,
Report cash giving.",How to Make Sure Your Cash Gifting Is Legal3," You may occasionally be contacted by people or websites promising a windfall of money. These are “cash gifting” schemes that are illegal and can cost you money or even jail time.Cash gifting clubs work by new participants paying money out to join the scheme. These initial fees go to those who have been in the cash gifting scheme the longest.Though money is promised, those joining cash gifting clubs almost never receive any money. After paying money to those at the top, they only lose all of their money.

, If you were truly getting a gift, then it would not be necessary for you to make an investment or give the person or club something in exchange for the gift — true gifts are given with no expectation of something in return.As with cash gifting between friends and relatives, cash gifting cannot be transactional. If cash gifting schemes argue that you will receive payment, this is illegal per IRS guidelines for cash gifting.Even if ads say that members of the club consider their investments a gift, expecting nothing in return, don't fall for it. This is an attempt to cover up the club's illegal activity.
Any cash gifting schemes cannot require members to do anything based on their cash ""gifts"". This means that those who you give money to are not required to give anything back in return.

, Very few members of cash gifting clubs ever receive any money. If anyone does, it is usually only those at the very top running the scheme.You may hear many success stories when first learning about a cash gifting club. Realize that these stories are either made up or extremely rare. And, if they are true, chances are they are exaggerated.
Only those at the top of the pyramid get any money in the scheme. You are not going to make any money as someone at the bottom of the pyramid.

, If someone is pressuring you to make a decision on the spot, walk away. If the person says you will lose out on this amazing opportunity if you don't join immediately, walk away. Anyone who is making a legal, legitimate offer will allow you time to consider your decision.If someone is pressuring you into making a decision today, it may be a bad decision. Take a day before you decide anything about your finances.
Emotions can play a strong part in your decision making. Never make a financial decision when you're feeling emotional, especially if those emotions are overwhelmingly positive.

, If you are contacting by a cash gifting club, you can report them to the authorities. Either your state’s Department of Justice or the IRS has online forms or phone numbers where you can report cash gifting clubs.Find your state’s Department of Justice website. If you search for cash gifting, you should be able to find a form to contact them by e-mail or phone.
You may also want to contact the IRS; however, it may be more difficult to get an immediate response from them.

Purchase/find a coffee mug.,
Create your mug design.,
Paint the background first.,
Transfer your design directly to the mug.,
Add your message.",How to Make Your Own Personalized Mug," Make sure the mug has no writing or design on it. White is preferable to use as your “canvas.”


Repurpose one from home. Use a special mug your friend or family member loves from home as long as it is plain and has no design. You will also want to make sure it’s in decent shape--you don't want to personalize a mug that’s on its last legs.
Purchase one from a craft store. Many craft stores sell a variety of plain, white mugs in a variety of sizes for a low price.
Wash and dry the mug before personalizing. Even if it's a mug from home, make sure it’s been thoroughly washed and dried before you being your craft.;
, On one hand you could do your best Jackson Pollock design on the mug (and splash paint it), however if you intend to put a name or specific shape on the mug you’ll need to map it out and perhaps even create a design template to use as your guide.


Search online for designs you like. Print the design and create a template using tracing paper. Look for a design with bold lines that will fit nicely on a mug. Avoid complicated designs as painting/transferring it to the mug may be difficult or too time consuming.
Purchase letter stencils that will fit the mug. Personalization means that you may want to put a name on the mug or even a cute “inside” saying. Find lettering that will compliment your design so your overall mug flows.

, You may want to “layer” your personalized mug by first painting the background unless you want the white background.


Select a color that will compliment and not conflict with your overall design. You should choose something neutral but soothing to cover your mug.
Consider only painting one side of the mug or go for a two-tone mug. Depending on how you plan to design the mug you could just paint one side or you could select two colors for either side. Make sure the colors work well together-for example, you could select school colors from the recipient’s university for the dual colored mug.
Wait for the background to completely dry before painting the main design. Otherwise, paint could combine and create a messy look.

, Use a wax-pencil to transfer the design to the mug by tracing or just following the printed design.


Consider using thin masking tape to block off certain areas of your design to help keep paint lines clean.
Cut out the design so you can paint around it. In the event you will be creating more of a graphic type design comprised of circles and shapes, you could cut out your shapes and lightly tape (using tape rings on the back of the paper) the shapes to your mug. Then you could paint over or around the shapes to create a “reverse” effect.

, Wait until the mug is completely dry and then add the recipient’s name or message.


Consider using a paint pen instead of a brush. Unless you are working with wide-set lettering, try a paint pen for more control over the letters. Make sure the paint is made for ceramic application.
Include a few special personal touches inside the mug such as an insider saying or even a few handmade hearts or stars. Nothing like a little unexpected surprise says, “personalized” so add an intimate saying or joke between the two of you inside or underneath the mug.

Create a pair of paperclip earrings.,
Make a plant terrarium.,
Build a “bread in a jar”.,
Make cookies or other baked goods.,
Create a photo collage.",How to Make Handmade Gifts1," To make this fast, simple, and inexpensive gift, you will need: embroidery floss, earring clips, paper clips, and a clear, quick drying glue like Fabri-Tac.You should be able to find all of these supplies at your local craft store.


Unfold the paper clips so they create even, triangle shapes.
Slide the earring clips onto the triangle paper clips and secure the two ends of the triangles together. Secure the ends with clear tape to ensure they stay together.
Knot one end of the embroidery floss to one corner of the paper clip. Glue it in place with the Fabri-Tac.
Run a dab of glue along the entire base of the paper clip to keep the floss in place. Continue to wrap the floss around the paper clip, creating an even layer of colorful floss.
Once you have wrapped the entire paper clip or made your desired design, finish the earrings by trimming off any excess floss and gluing the last strand of floss in place.;
, This is a good homemade gift to make with friends, as supplies like soil and gravel are cheaper in bulk.You will need a bag of tiny charcoal, a bag of clean soil, a bag of gravel, a small glass or plastic bowl (look for this at your local craft store), a variety of succulents, moss, and any other small decorative rocks or sticks (found at your local nursery or plant store), a small scoop, a set of chopsticks or pencils, and a spray bottle with water.
Make a work area by covering a table or the floor with newspapers. Put a layer of gravel in your container. Then, sprinkle a some charcoal bits on top of the gravel. The charcoal will absorb the earthy smell.
Add a layer of soil on top of the gravel and charcoal. Make sure it is an inch or two deep, or deep enough to support the succulents.
Give the bowl a light spray with the water bottle, and clean the sides of the bowl. This will make sure the soil is moist enough to hold the plants. Then, pat down the soil with your hand. You could also adjust the soil so it is diagonal in the bowl. This will showcase the plants better.
Use a chopstick or a pencil to dig a hole in the soil that’s just big enough to insert the plants. Trim the stem of the succulents and plant the remaining stem. For greenery that has deep roots, trim the roots and leave some of them so they can grow back into the soil.
Add sheet moss to fill in the holes around the plants. The moss is preserved so it won’t grow, but it will maintain its color and add a nice decorative detail to the terrarium.
Finish the terrarium by adding in any small decorative items like stones or sticks. You can also add tiny toy animals or birds. Get creative and personalize your terrarium.

, To make this heart warming homemade gift, you’ll need a clean milk bottle or a 1-quart mason jar. You can also customize the ingredients to make any variety of bread. For this example, we’ll be focusing on Chocolate Chip Oatmeal bread.You’ll need: 2 cups all purpose flour, 1 cup rolled oats, ½ cup granulated sugar, ½ cup brown sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, ½ teaspoon cinnamon, ½ teaspoon salt, ½ cup chopped walnuts, and ½ cup chocolate chips.
Pour the flour into your bottle or jar. Tap the sides of the bottle so the layer is even and flat. Then, slowly add in the oats, granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon into the bottle one at a time. Tap between each layer so they are nicely distributed in the bottle.
Add in the walnuts and chocolate chips as the last two layers in the bottle.
Cut a small piece of paper and write down the recipe, as well as the wet ingredients to add to the bottle of dry ingredients (1 ½ cups buttermilk, 2 large eggs, and ¼ cup melted butter).
Make sure you also add a note about baking the bread in a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan at 350 degrees Fahrenheit in the oven for about 50 minutes. Feel free to also draw or doodle on the paper as a finishing touch and then stick the paper to the bottle of dry ingredients with tape.

, This could be the person's favorite recipe for shortbread cookies or a new recipe for dark chocolate brownies that you think the person will like.


Look for recipes that involve only a few, easy to find ingredients and don't involve a lot of bake time to keep your gift within budget., This is a great way to make a very personal, one of a kind gift for someone. Use a program like Photoshop or collage softwareto build a collage on your computer or get really hands on and collage photo copied or scanned photos on a piece of poster board.


To make the collage even more impressive looking, get it framed professionally or purchase a frame from a craft store and frame it yourself.

Make a set of printed coasters.,
Make a teacup candle.,
Make a bath tea scrub.",How to Make Handmade Gifts2," You can customize this homemade gift by using printed paper or photographs to make a set of unique tile coasters. For a set of 4, you will need four 4” x 4” pieces of paper (or printed photographs of choice).Head to your local hardware store and pick up: four 4.25” x 4.25” plain white tiles, Mod Podge Gloss, Rustoleum Crystal Clear Enamel, a 3” foam brush, and a pack of ⅜” self adhesive felt pads.
Use the foam brush to apply a light layer of Mod Podge Gloss to the tiles.
Place your piece of patterned paper or photograph in the center of the titles and run your finger over the sides of the paper to remove any air bubbles. Allow the titles to dry for 15 minutes.
Apply three coats of Mod Podge Gloss over the top of the paper on each title. Allow for 15 minutes of drying time between each coat.
An hour after you have applied the third coat of Mod Podge Gloss, spray each title with the Rustoleum Crystal Clear Enamel spray in a well ventilated area, preferably outside. Apply two or more light coats in a steady back and forth motion, slightly overlapping each coat. Wait 30 minutes for the titles to dry.
Finish the titles by adding the felt pads to the four corners of each title.

, This is a great way to turn pretty, decorative teacups into a practical, homemade gift. Look for teacups at thrift stores or second hand stores.


You will need candle wax flakes or paraffin wax, several wood kabob skewers, scotch tape, sharp scissors, candle dye or food dye (optional), a double boiler or bowl and access to a stove.Lay two skewers side by side on the top of the cup. Slide the wax wick into the center of the cup, so it sits between the two skewers. Then clamp shut the opposite ends of the skewers by taping them together. This will help the wicks stay straight as you pour in the wax. Repeat this step until all the teacups have a supported wick.Fill a shallow pan or double boiler with water and place it over medium to high heat on the stove. Place a bowl into the water and pour in your wax flakes. Because the wax is broken up into flakes, it will melt faster and more evenly than a solid block of paraffin wax.
As the water and bowl heats up and your wax flakes start to melt, add in any candle scent or a small amount of color (via food dye or candle dye) to the wax. Use a skewer to stir the flakes and mix in the color.
Once the wax has melted completely, use oven mitts to lift the bowl out of the water and carefully pour the wax into your teacups. Try to avoid getting wax on the skewers laying on the top of the cups. Fill the teacups up until about a quarter of an inch of the cup is still showing. Immediately wash your bowl to stop the wax from drying on the bowl.
Wait at least three to four hours for the wax to dry completely and then remove the skewers and trim your wicks as desired. Once the wax is dry, it will look cloudy, smooth and hard to the touch.

, Tea is a great antioxidant for your skin, especially when it is used as part of a bath scrub. To make a green tea scrub, you’ll need three ingredients: granulated sugar, green tea, and grapeseed oil. You can find grapeseed oil online or at your local health food store. Substitute olive oil for grapeseed oil if you’re looking for a cheaper, easier to find alternative.In a large bowl, add 1 cup of granulated sugar.
Add ⅛ cup of your chosen natural oil. Mix the oil and the sugar together with a spoon or with your (clean) hands.
Brew and cool ¼ cup green tea. Then, add the tea a little at a time to the oil and sugar mixture.
Stir well and check the texture of the scrub. Ideally, you want it to resemble applesauce. Adjust the texture by adding more green tea or sugar, depending on your preference.
Pour the scrub into a mason jar or jar with a tight fitting lid. If you want to add a bit more scent and texture to the scrub, cut open a bag of green tea leaves and mix it into the scrub.
Spruce up the presentation of the scrub by adding a label or ribbon around the jar.

Create an ombre tiered necklace.,
Make a bleach painted t-shirt.,
Make canvas art with duct tape.",How to Make Handmade Gifts3," You’ll be working with wire to create this homemade gift, so make sure you have good needle nose pliers and a wire cutter. You’ll also need a roll of chain (gold, silver, or bronze, depending on what you’d prefer), three different colored spandex strips, gold jewelry loops, a gold clasp, scissors, and tape.Cut the first length of chain to size. This will be the piece that will go around your neck so make it around 24 inches long.
Prep the spandex strips. Cut them about a half inch wide and keep them very long. Stretch them so they turn into round thin pieces of string.
Use a piece of tape to create a needle at one end of the spandex, kind of like the end of a shoelace. Tie one end of the spandex onto the chain, as far down as you want the color to start. Thread the spandex through the chain to make the first tier of the necklace, about 11 inches centered at the bottom of the necklace.
Cut the next length of chain 1-2 inches shorter than the first chain. Thread the spandex through with the same process. Cut another length of chain 1-2 inches shorter than the second chain and thread the spandex through. Repeat the process so you have three lines of the first color.
Cut the chain shorter and shorter and thread them through with the second color and the third color. You should now have: three lines of the first color, two lines of the second color, and one line of the third color.
Use the gold jewelry loops to attach each level to the level above it. Use the needle nose pliers to fasten them.
Finish the necklace by attaching a clasp.

, Bleach is a simple and inexpensive way to play around with fabric dying and create a personal gift for someone. Keep in mind bleach is toxic so keep it out of reach of children and wear protective clothing and gloves when handling it to avoid contact with your skin.You’ll need fabric safe household bleach, a synthetic bristle paint brush, a glass or ceramic bowl, a dark colored cotton blend top, a towel or rag, white chalk, and a piece of cardboard.
Place the piece of cardboard inside the shirt to create a flat workspace. Use elastics or clips to attach the cardboard to the shirt so it doesn’t move around.
Sketch out a phrase or design on the shirt with the chalk. Think about using a personal phrase or a unique design ideal for a gift.
Prepare a bowl of undiluted bleach. Dip your brush into the bowl and drag it on the edge of the bowl to eliminate any drips. Use steady strokes to trace the outline of your phrase or design. The fabric will soak in the bleach quickly so work efficiently to complete your design.
Once you’re finished, step back and look at the design. Fill in any uneven or missed spots with small dabs of bleach on your brush. Use the towel to clean off the brush.
Let the shirt dry outside in the sun for several hours to let the bleach process and lighten the shirt. Hand wash the shirt and hang it to dry before gifting it.

, Look for a sturdy canvas that will fit the desired space. Canvas can be pricy, but keep in mind duct tape costs almost nothing, so this homemade gift shouldn’t break the bank.You can also use washi tape to make canvas art. Washi tape comes in a variety of colors and textures, so play around with patterns and designs to make a unique work of art.
Paint the canvas a solid neutral shade or a brighter shade, depending on your preference. Add on strips of duct tape, criss crossing as you go, or create a geometric shape.
You can paint the resulting triangles or shapes a darker hue to create contrast."

Select which dried beans you want to use in your mix.,
Layer your beans on the bottom of the jar.,
Place a bay leaf and bouillon cube on top of the beans in each jar.,
Attach a note with directions to the side of your jar.",How to Make Soup Mix Gifts1," There are a variety of different types of bean soups that you can make for your soup mix. Beans that you could use include pink beans, black beans, baby lima beans, lentils, black-eyed peas, red kidney beans, pinto beans, and great northern beans. Make sure to use dried beans so that your mix can stay fresh.You can use anywhere from three to five different types of beans to create your soup mix.


Southwestern bean soup uses dried black beans, kidney beans, and great northern beans.Beans are perfect for soup mix gifts because they do not need to be refrigerated.;
, Layer the beans you've selected on the bottom of a mason jar, placing the most colorful beans on the very bottom of the jar. If you are using three variations of beans, use a 1/2 cup (113 grams) of each type of bean. If you are using four or more different types of beans, use 1/3 of a cup (75 grams) of each type of bean.Use one quart (.95 liter) mason jars when creating your gift.
Shake the jar lightly to settle the beans as you layer them.
From the outside of the jar, the beans should make colorful layers.

, A flavored bouillon cube and bay leaf will add flavor to the broth of the soup. A vegetable or beef bouillon cube will taste best with this recipe. In addition to this, you can also add other ingredients like salt, pepper, dried basil, or chili powder, depending on how you usually make your bean soup.


When adding spices to your soup, add anywhere from 1/2 of a teaspoon (1.3 grams) to a full teaspoon (2.6 grams) of your dried spices.
To make a basic bean soup, you could add 1/2 teaspoon (1.3 grams) of salt and a pinch of black pepper to your jar.
To spice up your soup, add one teaspoon of ground cumin (2.6 grams) and 1/2 teaspoon (1.3 grams) of dried chili flakes to your jar.

, It's important that the gift recipient knows how to cook the soup once they receive it. Fold up a piece of paper that contains directions on how to cook your bean soup. To cook most bean soups, bring a pot with at least 6 cups (1.41 liters) of water to a boil and add the ingredients in the bean soup. Once the ingredients are added, set the heat to low and let the beans cook for at least two hours.

To liven up your broth, add 14 ounces (1.41 liters) of canned tomatoes to your soup.

Layer dried rosemary, dried sage, and dried thyme on the bottom of a jar.,
Add dried chopped onions, dried minced garlic, and bay leaf to the jar.,
Dump 2 cups (200 grams) of egg noodles on the top of the soup mix.,
Put celery seed and a chicken bouillon cube over the spices.,
Attach directions to the side of the gift.",How to Make Soup Mix Gifts2," Use 1/2 a teaspoon (1.13 grams) of each ingredient and add it to the bottom of your soup mix.These powdered spices will add flavor to the soup. Do not use the fresh variations for these spices unless you plan on gifting your soup mix within a day.


Use one quart (.95 liter) mason jars.
If you do use fresh spices, make sure to keep your soup mix refrigerated.

, Add one tsp (7.80 g) of dried chopped onions and dried minced garlic to your mason jar. These final ingredients will add additional complexity and flavor profiles to your chicken noodle soup. Make sure to use the dry spices and not fresh ones or else your soup mix will be perishable.

, Dump wide egg noodles on top of the other ingredients. You can also swap the egg noodles for vegetable noodles, elbows, or a different type of noodle. Thick egg noodles will help soak up some of the broth better than thinner noodles.

, Add a 1/2 teaspoon (1.13 grams) of celery seeds and one or two chicken bouillon cubes to the mix. The chicken bouillon cube will transform your dull water into a broth. You can replace your chicken bouillon cube with beef or vegetable cubes to create beef or vegetable soup, respectively.Unwrap the bullion cube so that your gift receiver can just dump the ingredients into a pot.

, To make the chicken noodle soup, heat one tablespoon (5 mL) of oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add a diced carrot or another vegetable of your choice and cook it for five minutes. Once it's hot, add the ingredients from your mason jar and three cups (709.76 mL) of water to your pot. The soup should take about 10 minutes to cook fully."

Use ribbon and fabric to decorate the lid.,
Apply custom made stickers or labels.,
Paint the sides of the gift.,
Sterilize the mason jars before using them.",How to Make Soup Mix Gifts3," Place the piece of linen over the lid of the jar, then fold down the sides. Wrap a ribbon to secure the cloth to the jar and you'll have created a custom mason jar. This will give it a unique style and will add to the aesthetics of the gift.Take inspiration from the time of year.
Light orange and red are great colors for the autumn.
Experiment with different textile designs to create a truly unique soup mix gift.
Red and white ribbon is a great option if you celebrate Christmas.

, A label can be an additional touch that adds character to your gift. Think of something related to the holiday or occasion. For functionality, type the cooking directions onto a piece of label paper and stick it to the side of your gift. You can also put the name of the soup so that the person receiving the gift knows what it is.


Your label could say ""Happy Birthday"" or ""Happy Holidays!""

, You can use glass paint or alcohol ink to tint your mason jar another color. Being able to see through the glass is what makes soup mix gifts so interesting, so it's smart not to use a paint that will conceal the ingredients inside.You may have to seal your paint with an acrylic sealer to keep it waterproof.

, Sterilizing your jar is an important step you have to take before making these gifts. To sterilize your mason jar, submerge it under boiling water for 10 minutes. Wipe them down thoroughly with a paper towel or cotton cloth and seal the lid. Cleaning your jars will ensure that no foreign bacteria will be trapped in your soup gifts."

Get your supplies.,
Choose your fruit.,
Wash and dry your berries, grapes, and kale.,
Cut the melons in half.,
Prepare the pineapple.,
Prepare your bowl.,
Assemble the pineapple flower heads.,
Create the pineapple flowers.,
Skewer the remaining fruit.,
Assemble the arrangement.,
Wrap the arrangement in plastic.",How to Make Edible Arrangements1," Along with the fruit you’re going to need, you will also need something to hold your fruit arrangement. You can use a carved out watermelon or pumpkin, a flower vase, a planter, or a bowl. Choose a holder that’s appropriate to the size and shape you want your arrangement to be. Other supplies you'll need include:


A good sharp knife and cutting board
Floral foam (alternatively, use a head of cabbage or lettuce)
Bamboo skewers and toothpicks
Flower-shaped metal cookie cutters
Aluminum foil and plastic wrap
A melon baller;
, Most fruit is suitable for an edible arrangement, but there are common ingredients that get used because of their color variety, size, and texture. Of the common fruits that are used, you can make a basic arrangement with one:


Pineapple
Cantaloupe and one honeydew
Quart of strawberries
Pint each of blueberries and blackberries
Bag seedless grapes
Bunch of kale or another large, leafy green

, Leave the leaves on the strawberries for additional color. Remove stems from other fruit, such as grapes. Cut the excess stems off the kale. Set it all aside.

, Scoop out the seeds. Clean out the two halves of the cantaloupe by scooping out spheres with the melon baller. Set the melon spheres aside with the berries.


Peel the honeydew. Place the melon halves flat-side down on a flat surface. Follow the rounded contour of the melons with a knife to remove the rind.Cut each melon half into crescent-shaped wedges that are about an inch thick on the bottom. Cut the wedges in half widthwise. These will be used as flower leaves.

, Cut off the top and set it aside with the melon balls and berries. Cut off the bottom inch and discard. Without peeling it, slice the remaining pineapple into rounds that are half an inch to three-quarters of an inch thick. Use the cookie cutters to press out the center of each pineapple slice into flower shapes.


You can use different sizes and shapes, or you can make each flower-shaped pineapple piece the same.
You can also use other shapes for the pineapples, such as hearts (great for Valentine’s Day) stars, or even holiday-themed shapes.

, Fill the bowl with floral foam. Cut the foam to fit if necessary. Cover the foam in a layer of foil, tucking the foil inside the bowl to cover the sides of the foam. This will prevent pieces of foam from getting on the fruit.Then, lay some kale over top to cover the foil. Position the kale so the leaves spill out over the sides of the bowl.


A head of cabbage will also work as a base into which you can place your fruit skewers. Put it in your bowl and cut it to size if necessary. Lay kale over it and position the leaves to overhang the top of the bowl.
The overhanging kale will create a nice green base for the arrangement, and make it look a little more like a traditional flower arrangement.

, Cut your toothpicks in half. Use the toothpick halves to fasten a melon sphere, grape, blackberry, or blueberry to the center of each pineapple flower.Make sure the toothpick doesn’t stick out the top of the melon or the back of the pineapple.

, For each flower, you will need two honeydew half-crescents and one pineapple flower head. Skewer a melon wedge so it sticks out perpendicular to the skewer with the crescent facing the ceiling. Skewer the second wedge in the same fashion but on the other side, and with the crescent facing the floor.


Insert the top of the skewer through the bottom of the pineapple flower and insert it about halfway into the pineapple flower. Make sure the flower is vertical, with the flower head facing outward, not the ceiling.
Position the two melon wedges so they are about an inch below the bottom of the pineapple, like leaves on a flower stem.
Repeat until all the pineapple flowers have been put on stems and given melon leaves.
Use mini marshmallows or gumdrops to secure the flowers in place if they won’t stay positioned on the skewers.

, Fill each skewer about halfway down with assorted fruit: blueberries, blackberries, grapes, and melon balls. Top each one with a strawberry, with the pointed end facing up (skewer the stem end first).


Make sure the skewer doesn’t stick out the top of the strawberry.
If you run out of strawberries, top the remaining skewers with a melon ball, honeydew crescent, or blackberry.

, Start by arranging the pineapple flowers. Spread them out evenly around the arrangement, securing them in place by sticking them into the foam. Cut the skewers to different lengths to create depth. When you have the flowers in place, fill in the holes with the remaining fruit skewers. Again, cut the skewers to different lengths and place them evenly around the arrangement.You can also use the pineapple top as the center of the arrangement, and arrange the flowers and skewers around it.
Fill in any open areas at the bottom with kale.

, Store in the fridge until you need it. To guarantee freshness and the brightest colors, make your arrangement the day you need it.

Identify the homeowner’s life stage before shopping for items.,
Consider adding a special touch.,
Don’t overwhelm the jar.",How to Make a Practical Housewarming Gift1," For a first time home owner, the basics such as screwdrivers, extension cords and tape measures are a great idea. However, if this is the homeowner’s second, third or even fourth home, you may want to stuff the gift with items that may be specific to either the new area or home (for instance, moving from a large home to a condo).;
, In addition to the practical, find at least one item that may have function, but also is unique and/or speaks to the individual homeowner’s taste. For example, if the homeowners have a fondness for all things British, include a Union Jack hand towel in the jar or Royal Family coasters.


Gift cards to home improvement or bed and bath stores are also a good idea and add a special touch.

, The idea is to give a gift that has thought and function but not to provide all the tools they need. For instance, instead of the value-pack of nails opt for a smaller pack. If the homeowner needs more, he or she can get them--the idea is to offer something to get the homeowner started.

Gather your supplies.,
Select your vegetables.,
Prepare the vegetables.,
Ready the foam tree.,
Skewer the vegetables with toothpicks.,
Assemble the tree.,
Decorate the tree with pepper slices.,
Arrange remaining vegetables on the kale.",How to Make Edible Arrangements2," Along with your vegetables, you will also need a knife and cutting board, toothpicks, a serving platter, a large floral foam cone, and aluminum foil.

, You can use most vegetables to make a vegetable tree, but broccoli and cauliflower work well to create the bulk of the tree. You can experiment with other vegetables, but a good start will include:


A bunch of red kale
Three or four carrots
A pint of cherry tomatoes
One yellow and one orange pepper
One cucumber

, Wash and dry all the vegetables. Remove stems and seeds from the kale, peppers, and carrots. Peel the carrots as well.


Cut the carrots and cucumber into two-inch long chunks, and cut each chunk lengthwise into quarters.
Cut the peppers into very thin strips.
Remove the stalks from the broccoli and cauliflower and cut them into bite-sized florets.

, Cover the cone with aluminum foil. Place it in the center of the serving platter. Surround the tree base with kale.

, Insert the toothpicks into the remaining stalks on the broccoli and cauliflower florets and into the bottom of the cucumber and carrot sticks. Skewer the tomatoes.

, Starting at the bottom, stick the other end of the toothpicks into the cone and create a circle of alternating cauliflower and broccoli florets around the base of the cone. Try not to leave any open spaces.


Directly above that row, insert a row of vegetables, alternating between carrots stick, cucumber sticks, and tomatoes. Continue up the tree, alternating between rows of broccoli/cauliflower and other vegetables, until you have covered the entire cone, including the tip.
Overlap the vegetables as much as possible so there are no open spaces.

, Use the natural curve of the pepper slices to stick them into the spaces between the other vegetables and string the slices around the entire tree like ribbon.

, If you have any vegetable pieces left over, remove the toothpicks and arrange them at the base of the tree on the bed of kale. Wrap the tree in plastic and store in the fridge until you are ready to serve or present it.


Consider serving the vegetable tree with vegetable dip, hummus, or spinach dip.

Gather your equipment.,
Choose your edible flowers.,
Arrange the flowers.,
Wrap the bouquet.",How to Make Edible Arrangements3," To give the bouquet as a gift, you’ll need tissue paper, clear plastic gift wrapping, an elastic band, and twine. Grab a vase as well that you can use to arrange your bouquet before packaging it.


You can also leave the bouquet in the vase if you aren't giving it as a gift or don't want to package it.

, While not all flowers are edible, there are many that are, and they are delicious in salads, soups, teas, sorbets, and many other dishes. You can select flowers based on color, look, or just what’s available.


Edible blue or purple flowers include: borage, hyssop, chive, violet, lavender, cornflower,lilac, clover, and dame’s rocket.
Edible pink or red flowers include: honey suckle, bee balm, waxed begonias, tuberous begonias, apple blossoms, banana blossoms,English daisy, and carnations.
Edible orange or yellow flowers include: nasturtium, mustard, zucchini and squash blossoms, daylily, calendula, and dandelions.
Multicolored flowers or flowers that come in multiple colors include: Johnny jump ups,roses, and chrysanthemums.

, Leave the stems long, but if you need to trim them down, cut them with garden clippers or a sharp knife.Start with the largest flowers (all of the same kind), and place them in the vase. Space them around so they’ll be balanced (though not even) throughout the arrangement. Always work with uneven numbers of flowers.Then select your second largest flowers and space them around in the arrangement as well. Constantly turn the vase around so you can see it from all angles.
Fill in empty spaces with bunches of smaller flowers, and add some depth and height by adding tall flowers like lavender.

, When you have finished arranging your bouquet, remove it from the vase, being careful not to let the flowers slip out of place. Hold the bouquet near the top of the stems and place an elastic band around them loosely to keep them in place.


Use tissue paper to wrap the stems and surround the flowers. Wrap the paper with clear plastic wrap. Tie the bouquet closed with the twine just below where the flowers meet the stems.

Shop for the container first.,
Purchase gift items.,
Remember to get your specialty item.",How to Make a Practical Housewarming Gift2," Before you fill the container, you need to know the size and amount you can add. Consider purchasing a container that can also be re-purposed and used later to hold a variety of items but something that isn’t so big the homeowner will need to find a place for storage.


Make sure the container either has a lid or can be sealed. You can also seal the top with a piece of fabric and ribbon if you fall in love with the container and think the homeowner will too.







, Gather items to fit inside the container and envision everything someone might need during those initial days in a new home. Consider making a list before you shop and possibly bring the container along for the shopping spree to ensure everything fits inside.


Consider going with a theme for your gift, such as a picture hanging theme. Purchase everything needed to hang multiple pictures/paintings in the home including a mini hammer or small electric screwdriver.
Don’t over-spend on items, especially if you aren’t sure whether the homeowner already owns the item or not. For example, don't purchase the top-of-the-line screwdriver in the event the homeowner already has one (or may have one in storage or packed in boxes).

, This item will hopefully be positioned front and center inside the jar so make sure it is sized accordingly and fits amongst the other items.

"
"
Remove price tags from purchased items.,
Examine packaged items to ensure they fit nicely inside the container.,
Place items inside container.,
Add lid and seal.",How to Make a Practical Housewarming Gift3," Depending on how the tags are placed, either use a razor blade to lift tag stickers or you can cut away the area of the package that contains the sticker. Using a black Sharpie marker to black out the price may also be a solution.

, In some cases you may want to remove the item and allow it to free-float inside the jar. For example, a screwdriver or mini hammer can be removed from the packaging to accommodate for space.

, There’s no special way to do this, however make sure everything fits comfortably, leaving space for the special item to be positioned toward the front/outside of the container.


When positioning special item, slide it in last and make sure you can see it after everything is in place.







, If you are using a standard lid, just screw lid on and add a ribbon.


Consider including a gift tag along with the ribbon. This can include a special message from you and/or a list of items inside the container.

Buy a tall and transparent jar or container, with a lid.,

Write notes to your receiver.,
Make sure your layers are thick enough to cover the notes.,
Start layering.,
Wrap the gift.,
Be creative.",How to Make a Simple Sentimental Gift," Preferably, it should be something that has a very firm lid, to prevent spills. A pretty container that will be useful for future purposes is ideal. You can use any container, but this gift idea will work best if the container is fairly tall, and a little wide. The next steps will give you an idea of how you'll be using the container to provide a better idea for the size and type.;
, Pick different kinds of chocolate pieces. These can be chocolate rosebuds, smarties, chocolate pebbles, white chocolate chips, etc. The idea is to choose things that will contrast each other. Each item will be in its own layer in the jar. You can choose to create a pattern of layers if your jar is tall enough and you have enough chocolate.

, The width of the layers depends on your container. This depends on how thick you want your layers to look, how many ingredients you have, and how small your chocolates are. Keep the number of layers you plan to make in mind.

, The notes will go in between each layer of chocolate.They should be small enough to fit within the width/diameter of the jar, and should correspond with the number of layers you have (e.g. if you have four layers, write four notes). The first note can be at the very top of the layers and include an introductory 'To:_____ From: _____.' How you present your notes, how many, how you arrange them, and the length of the notes are up to you. If you're writing long notes and can't fit it into the container, try folding the paper, but make sure the folds are tight to prevent the note from unfolding on its own.

, Having a clear jar is for aesthetic purposes. It won't look pretty if there are pieces of paper visible through the jar (unless this is part of your design).

, Place the bottom layer of chocolate into the jar. Once you've placed your first layer evenly, place your last note on top of it. Remember, this is the note your receiver will read last. Once in place, cover the note up with the next layer of chocolate (which should ideally look pretty different from the first) and then place your second last note. Repeat until your jar is filled or you're out of layers. Make sure all layers are even, to create a sediment appearance through the jar.

, This will be a bit tricky if you used a round jar or container. If wrapping paper seems impossible, wrap ribbon around the container and tie a bow.

, This gift is a reflection of the feelings inside you, after all.

Hang the pompom by sticking a tack through the fishing wire.",How to Make a Paper Pompom1," You'll want to use between 8 and 13 sheets per pompom, depending on how thick the paper is. The thinner the paper, the more sheets you should use.;
, To do so, fold the edge of the paper in about one inch. Then, flip over the entire stack of paper and do the same thing on the other side. Repeat until you have one long strip of paper with accordion folds.

, Once the paper is folded, trim the edges. For soft, feminine looking pompoms, round the corners. For more dramatic pompoms, cut them to a point. Don't worry if you don't get the cuts as perfect as you'd like. While shaping the edges of the paper will definitely have an effect on the shape of the pompoms, you will not be able to notice small details or mistakes once they have been folded out.

, Bend it in half.

, It should be placed as close to the center of the paper as possible. Twist the ends of the wire together to keep it in place.


Don't worry about making the wire super tight. In fact, keeping the wire slightly looser will make it easier to fan out the pompom.

, Then, thread the fishing line through the wire and tie a knot. Be sure that there is plenty of fishing line hanging out—you will use this to hang the pompom later.

, Slowly lift the top sheet of paper until it is standing straight up. Repeat with the first four layers, then flip the pompom over and repeat. Continue until all the paper is fluffed out.


Use gentle, slow movements to do this, or you risk ripping the paper. To push each piece up as far as possible, try running your first and index fingers along the accordion folds from the outside of the pompom to the middle. , Enjoy your new decoration!

Mix in a photo oil color extender to create pastel colors.,
Dab a cotton swab very lightly in a color.,
Touch up the lines of your tinting with a clean cotton swab.,
Repeat with as many colors as you would like to use.",How to Make Gifts Out of Photos1," You can print this at home with a digital printer or order black and white matte photos from a drugstore or online photo printing company. Choose a profile or classic photo for this project.


Hand-tinted photos give an appearance of being from a different era. They are ideal to decorate a home, because they look more artful than the average amateur digital photograph.;
, These colors are specially designed to accent photographs. Keep in mind the objects or faces in your photograph, and choose colors that will accent the figures.


For example, if you are going to tint a face, then use pink, yellow or brown for lips and hair respectively. If you have a door in your photograph, consider tinting it red or blue to make it stand out. Whatever you tint will become a focal point of your photograph.

, Gather a handful of cotton swabs. They will be your paint brushes.

, You will use this palette for easy access to your colors as you tint your photograph. Place a cotton swab near each color, so that you don't mix colors.

, Place a dab of photo oil paint on your palette and mix the extender in with a cotton swab.

, Paint it on your photo in a circular motion. Use paint very sparingly on the photograph; you can always add another layer if you want a deeper color.

, Do this while the paint is still wet. Once the paint dries, it is permanent.

, Allow the photo to dry completely. Place it in an attractive frame and give it as a gift.

Glue the cardboard semicircles onto your honeycomb paper.,
Use the needle and thread.,
Hold the cardboard on both ends.,
Glue the cardboard pieces together.,
Hang.",How to Make a Paper Pompom2," The size of the circle is completely up to you—small circles will make small pompoms, and bigger circles will make bigger pompoms.

, You should have two identical half circles.

, Cut down the paper you are going to use so that it is significantly smaller than your sheet of scrap paper. Then, place one sheet of paper flat on top of the scrap piece.

, Keeping it flat on the scrap paper, evenly divide the honeycomb paper into 4 to 8 sections (depending on how large your paper is). Instead of folding the honeycomb paper, draw lines on the scrap paper where each fold would be. Alternate mark colors every other line.


If you do not have scrap paper, you can make these marks directly on your paper, using a pencil or thin pen.
If you are using a piece of paper that is 4.25""x5.5"" (half of an 8.5""x11"" piece of paper), consider spacing your lines between 1 1/4 and 1 3/4 inches apart. , Keeping your honeycomb paper flat on the scrap paper, run the glue stick vertically across the honeycomb paper where you have made marks in that color.


If you are using a thin paper, such as tissue paper, hold it firmly and gently work your glue stick from the middle of the paper to the edges to prevent tearing.

, Rub firmly to make sure it sticks.

, Apply glue along the lines of the opposite color as last time. Place another piece of tissue paper on top and rub across to ensure the glue sticks.

, Be sure that you alternate glue lines between each sheet to continue the honeycomb effect.


For a multi-colored pompom, change the color of your paper halfway through the gluing process.
For a stripe pattern, change the color of your paper every 5 sheets or so.

, When you're done gluing sheets of paper, place one of the semicircles on top of the paper and trace loosely around it. Then, cut out the paper so that it is very slightly larger than the cardboard.

, Once you have cut out the honeycomb paper, glue one piece of cardboard onto each side.

, To ensure a uniform effect, pull the threaded needle at the top corner of your semicircle. Tie a loose knot, cut the thread, and repeat on the bottom corner.


Be sure you've left some slack in your knots, or the pompom will not open. Leave the thread long on one end—you can use this to hang the pompom up later.

, Pull apart slowly and round into a ball. The honeycomb pattern should become more apparent as you open up the pompom.

, This will allow the pompom to hold the spherical shape.

, Enjoy your new decorations!

Place a medium-sized line of glue down the length of your cork.,
Glue 2 corks horizontally right next to the 2 vertical corks.,
Attach a hanger to the back of the cork board.",How to Make Gifts From Recycled Materials1," If you want to make this craft soon, you can inquire at a local restaurant or wine bar to see if they will save wine corks that they usually throw away.

Keep in mind a 16 by 20 inch (40.6 by 50.8 cm) board requires approximately 100 corks, if they are evenly cut in half.;
, This will serve as the backing to your cork board. Choose something that already has a frame around the edges, or make a frame out of reclaimed wood or metal.

Think about preferences of the person you are planning to give the gift to. A cork board is a great gift for wine lovers and it can be used in the kitchen, hallway or office. Choose a frame that reflects the interior décor preferences of this person.

, Allow it to dry., This is not necessary to create a cork board; however, the board will be sturdier and more durable if you glue on a flat surface. This part of the project may take a few hours, depending upon the size of your cork board., Gather all your corks nearby., Place it vertically in the top corner of your frame, making sure there isn't a space between the frame and the cork. Glue and place another cork next to it vertically., The width of these corks should equal the length of the vertical corks. Continue this pattern, gluing corks in groups of 2 horizontally and vertically across the board.

You may need to cut your corks into smaller sizes near the end of the board to ensure there is no empty space between the corks and the frame. Allow the glue to dry completely according to package instructions.

, Wrap it and give it away as a present.

For a twist on this project, use a smaller frame to make a trivet or smaller pieces of cardboard or MDF to make a set of coasters.

Put your coupons in the order you desire.,
Punch two holes on one side of each coupon.,
Tie ribbon or string through the hole-punched holes.

,
Finished.

",How to Make a Coupon Book for Tasks," You should start thinking about how many favors you would like to owe them. An average number of coupons should be about five, but you can decide if you'd like more or less depending on their needs and relationship with you. Don't worry about the size, because you can always put them in a book no matter how many you have.;
, Do not do coupons that you know you would never do in a million years, but do something rather that is a boring task they would not want to do and needs to be done. The task should not take more than twenty minutes. Think about your recipient and what kind of everyday tasks they are always moaning about. Here are some ideas to get you started:

Walk the dog or care for the pets. If the person you are giving your book to is a pet-lover, then tell them they can have the afternoon off to shop and you'll wash, walk, feed and play with the dog. There are a lot of variations in the pet category, so get creative! (You could teach them a trick, buy them some treats, or take them to the pet salon.)






Do the dishes, shine the silverware or empty the dishwasher. These dirty and tedious tasks will allow your recipient to put their feet up while you labor away and will really make them quite happy.






Do the laundry, fold the clothes or sort. Tons of laundry being done will give your recipient a peace of mind and no worries about putting away mounds of unfolded wrinkled laundry. As a touch, say you will iron them as well.






Organize. If you are a great organizer, share your skills and tell them you will clean out their desk or organize their bookshelf in their desired fashion, especially if this person has a very cluttered, stressed life.






Do some yard work. Rake the leaves, shovel snow or mow the lawn - these tiring tasks will give your recipient a break to sit back and relax.






Babysit. Have you ever heard your recipient saying they were dying for a night out but couldn't because they could never find a babysitter? Offer to babysit their kids so that they can go out with no worries, and even though you may be plotting to muzzle Dora the Explorer back at home, they will appreciate it more than ever. Make sure you ask for no pay, because this is a FAVOR.






Fill in for someone. If your person made an agreement to show up and volunteer or coordinate something, step in and help yourself and allow them to play hooky for a day. You can say something like, ""I'm sorry, Alicia couldn't be here today, but I'm here to help!""







, This is where you can get really creative. Style it, prettify it and make it stand out. You can make one plain one and then photocopy it and write in the main points, or you can make each one unique. It should probably be a rectangle like a coupon is, but you might want to make it a heart. Either way, it should be able to fit all of the details of this task you are fulfilling and should be the least bit creative.
A good size for one coupon, if you are making a rectangle coupon, should be about eight by five inches.






Use card-stock paper for your coupons to make them official and professional looking.






The information on your card should consist of the task name (e.g., walking a dog), what days you can do it (e.g., Mondays or Thursdays), how many uses it is good for (e.g., two times), contact information and address (e.g., to use, call 111-222-3333, or visit 9 Sherry Lane), any details you'd like to include (e.g., eligible for one hour, also includes feeding and bathing, doesn't apply to Pomeranians, etc.) and its date of expiration (e.g., ends exactly one year after receiving).






Leave room for punching holes or stapling.







, If you are very organized and have some time, you can even sort them for things like ""Pets"" or ""Food"" or ""Fashion"" or ""Yard Work"" or something like that by having a card with the category, and putting the coupons that follow after that.


Put a cover card saying "" 'Alicia's Coupon Book' by Xavier...Merry Christmas!"" or something along the lines of that if you'd like to.







, Each hold should be at around the same area as the next coupon so you can combine them easily.

This method will also work on other types of paper as well, such as printed images, photographs, scrapbook paper, or even wrapping paper.

, If the image is already in a box, then cut out the entire box. If the image is part of a larger image, then cut out just the shape.

, Place the image a sheet of scrap paper, image-side down. Cover the entire back of the image with glue. Then, flip the picture over and press it against a sheet of cardstock. Smooth the image out to get rid of any bubbles or wrinkles.


The best type of glue for this would be a glue stick. You can also use rubber cement or spray adhesive.
If you are using liquid glue, apply a thin layer of white or clear-drying glue using a paint brush.

, If your image has an irregular shape, such as a rolling pin, you can follow the original shape. You can also cut a new shape around it, such as a square or circle. The original color of the cardstock will be part of your gift tag design.


If your image is square-shaped, consider cutting it out using a pair of zigzag scissors.

, You can use the standard ""To... From..."" message, or create your own. You can also use personalized names, such as: ""Beloved Wife,"" ""Doting Date,"" ""Beautiful Daughter,"" or ""Wonderful Son."" If it is near a holiday or special occasion, you can write the appropriate greeting instead, such as ""Happy Holidays"" or ""Happy Birthday.""

, Be careful so that you don't punch through your message.

, You can use just about any type of string, including twine, ribbon, yard, or metallic thread.

, Fold the piece of string in half. Poke the folded end through the punched hole in the tag, creating a small loop. Slip the two loose ends of the string through the loop, and tug on them gently to tighten the knot.

, Simply tie the two loose ends of the string around the handle of a gift bag.

, You can use any shape you want, such as a square, heart, or circle. You can even use scrapbook punches to punch out fancier shapes. Make sure that the tag is no larger than the palm of your hand.


To make a standard gift tag shape, cut a rectangle out first. Then, snip the corners off of one of the narrow ends to form a point.
To make a folded tag, cut out a square shape, making sure to align one of the square's edges with the folded part of the card.

, You can outline the image on your tag with metallic pens or glitter glue. You can also glue on small rhinestones or sequins to make it fancier. Let the tag dry completely before continuing.

, You can use the typical ""To... From..."" message, or you can create your own. If it is near a holiday you can write the holiday greeting instead, such as: ""Happy Valentine's Day."" If it is near a special event, such as a birthday or graduation, you could write: ""Happy Birthday,"" or ""Congratulations!""


If you made a folded tag, then write your message inside the tag instead.

, If you made a folded tag, be sure to punch the hold through both layers.

, Just about any type of string will work. You can use yarn or twine for something more rustic. If the tag is fancier, you can use ribbon or metallic thread instead.

, Fold the string in half first. Then, poke the folded end through the hole, creating a small loop. Slip the two loose ends of the string through the loop. Tug on the loose ends gently to tighten the knot.

, Make sure it's not something very strong because that could give her a headache. You never know. It's better to be safe, than sorry. Also put a mini deodorant and a small cheap, but nice smelling body splash. Be careful that your friend doesn't take offence and assume you have a low opinion of her standard of personal hygiene.

, She might be having a bad day because it's that time of the month. Put 2 tampons, 2 pads, and 3 panty liners. You never know what they prefer. Some girls only use pads, some only use tampons so just put everything in there.

, If they don't like plain water, then they can have some lemonade. If they do like water, then they don't have to drink it.

, Something that will fill them up a little bit if they didn't have breakfast. You can also either put some money or a food bar in there if they forgot lunch money.

Write a heartfelt card.,
Try making a scrapbook.,
Make friendship coupons.,
Make a deck of complimentary cards.,
Make a flower arrangement.,
Make a gift basket.",How to Make a Homemade Gift1," When all else fails, this simple gesture makes a great choice for almost any occasion. While cards can be purchased at nearly any supermarket or department store, piecing together your own from craft materials can make a statement about the time and effort you're willing to spend on the recipient. The most important part of the card, though, is the words you write on it. Try to be sincere and honest while writing something that your friend is going to find sweet or entertaining.


You don't just have to write straightforward expressions like ""Thank you for always being there for me."" Feel free to get creative — poems, limericks, jokes, acrostics, and even short stories can make a card really shine.;
, A scrapbook isn't just a great gift — it's a way to remind your friend of all the great memories you have together. If you need a quick gift or you don't have enough photos for an entire scrapbook, try making a collage on a single piece of paper or posterboard. In either case, you can decorate the photos and the border around them with cut-out quotes, stencils, drawings, and more.


To make a scrapbook, you'll just need a few pieces of construction paper, some glue or tape, a skinny ribbon, a hole punch, and lots of photos of you and the gift recipient. Paste the pictures in any sequence you want on your sheets of paper. For example, you may want to begin with photos of when you first met. Decorate the pages with printed-off quotes, doodles, inside jokes, stickers, glitter, or whatever else you want.
When you're ready, punch holes in one side of the stack of papers and tie them together with ribbon to make a book. Don't forget to leave a blank sheet at the front for the cover.

, These are fantastic gifts for family members, boyfriends, and girlfriends. The basic idea here is to make a small book of cards or ""coupons"" from scratch. On each coupon, write a favor or an activity that you know the gift recipient likes. For example, if you're giving the coupons to your boyfriend, you might write ""I will give you one free back rub"" on one of the coupons. When you're finished, tie the coupons together with ribbon and decorate them as you wish.


See our article on homemade coupon books for more help with this task.

, This is sometimes also called ""52 things I Love About You."" For this gift, you take an ordinary pack of cards and turn it into something special by writing compliments for the gift recipient on each one. You may want to brainstorm first so you don't run out of ideas halfway through. When you give the gift, offer to use the cards to play your favorite card game together.


For this gift, you will need a full deck of cards, 52 blank sticker labels, and markers, glitter, and other supplies, if you want to decorate. Put a label on each card. If you can, leave space for the number and suit so you can still use the cards to play. Write something you love about your friend on each label. When you're done, decorate the cards and the box how you wish.

, This makes a great gift for Mother's day. Pick a collection of flowers that you think look good together, then put them together in a vase or decorative arrangement. Try using objects from around the house for this. For example, an old rinsed-out wine bottle makes a great vase. Don't cut flowers from your garden (or a neighbor's) without the permission of whoever is responsible for taking care of it.


Another great way to make a flower arrangement is to buy a hard foam sphere from a local craft store (these are usually quite cheap). Cut it in half to make a dome, then bore holes in it with a pen or pencil. Paint this how you wish. When the paint dries, put flowers, twigs, and other pretty objects from outdoors in the holes.

, This is an excellent way to give the impression of a homemade gift even when some of the things you're giving are bought in the store. A gift basket is exactly what it sounds like — a decorative basket filled with small gifts the recipient will enjoy. For example, if your friend loves movies, you might fill the basket with a selection of classic DVDs. Try combining a mix of storebought and homemade gifts in the basket for a personal touch.


Making a gift basket is easy. Start by filling a basket with tissue paper, shredded cardboard, or decorative packing material. Wedge small gifts into basket, arranging them in a pleasing pattern. Place the card in the basket with the gifts as well. If you wish, decorate the basket by hand or wrap it in cellophane before giving it.

Bend a wire coat hanger into a circle shape.,
Cut some string into 3 to 8-inch (7.62 to 20.32 centimeters) pieces.,
Tie each string to each piece of candy.,
Tie the candy to the coat hanger.,
Keep tying the candy until the wreath is all covered and you can't fit anymore candy.,
Tie a piece of ribbon into a bow around the top of the wreath.Wrap a piece of ribbon at the base of the hanger, and tie it into a bow.,
Use the hook to hang your wreath.",How to Make a Candy Wreath1," Simply bend the bottom, sides, and top until you get a circle. It doesn't have to be perfect. Don't cut the hanger part off; you can use this later on to hang your finished wreath!If you can't find a wire coat hanger, you can also use a metal ring instead.;
, You will be using these to tie your candy to the coat hanger base. The measurements don't have to be exact, so you could even wrap the string several times around a DVD case, then cut it to create many short pieces of string.

You will be eventually trimming the string down. If you'd like a more decorative wreath, however, you could leave the string uncut. In this case, consider using curling ribbon instead.

, Try to get the string right between the twisted part of the wrapper and the candy itself. You only have to tie the string to one side of the candy, and you not need to create a double knot.Do this step for all of the candy that you have.

You can use any type of twist-wrapped candy, such as peppermints, Jolly Ranchers, taffy, and butterscotch.

, Take one of your tied candies, and use the tail ends of the string to tie it to the hanger. Tie the string in a tight, double knot.For a neater finish, snip the loose ends of the string off. For a more decorative finish, leave the string uncut; it will become part of the wreath's design., Gently push down on the candy as you tie it so that it squishes together and gives you a fuller wreath., Cut the tail ends of the bow at into angles or into V-shaped notches. The ribbon can be simple satin or velvet, or it could be one of those fancier ribbons with glitter or printed designs., If you'd like the hook to be less visible, you can paint it to match your wall or door. Ordinary acrylic paint will do, but enamel/model paint will also work. Nail polish will also do in a pinch."

Find some colorful cardstock.,
Cut a shape out of the cardstock.,
Decorate the tag and let it dry completely before continuing.,
Consider making a layered tag.,
Write your message on the back of the gift tag.,
Punch a hole near the top of the gift tag.,
Cut a piece of string about twice the length of your finger.,
Thread the string through the hole.,
Tie the tag to your gift.",How to Make Gift Tags4," You can use a blank sheet of cardstock, and decorate it later, or you can print out a pretty image instead. If you are printing an image on your sheet of cardstock, feed the paper one sheet at a time through your printer, or it will get stuck.

, You can cut out any shape you want, such as a heart, circle, or square. You can cut these shapes out by hand, or use a fancy-shaped scrapbook hole puncher.


To make a standard gift tag shape, cut a rectangle out first. Then, snip the corners off of one of the narrow ends to form a point.
To make a folded tag from a sheet of cardstock, cut out a rectangle first, then fold the rectangle in half.
Consider printing out images on cardstock and cutting them out. Be sure to feed the cardstock through your printer one sheet at a time.

, You can decorate it however you want, but consider matching it to the gift bag, the holiday or event, or to the recipient's personal tastes. For example, if you know the gift recipient really likes cats, consider drawing a cat on the tag. Here are some more decorating ideas to get you started:


Draw designs with metallic pens or glitter glue.
Glue on small rhinestones or sequins.
Stick on some washi tape around the edges of a square or rectangular card to give it a fancy border.
Attach stickers that match the holiday, season, or event. For example, if the tag is for a birthday gift, you can use candle- or balloon-shaped stickers.

, Once you have decorated your tag, cut a smaller shape out of cardstock, and decorate it as well. Attach it to the tag using a small piece of foam mounting tape; this will help give it that 3D or layered effect.


You can match the smaller shape to the larger one, or use a contrasting shape. For example, if your tag is square-shaped, you can make the smaller shape a heart.

, You can use the usual ""To... From..."" greeting, or create your own. For example, you can use personalized names, such as: ""Beloved Wife,"" ""Doting Dad,"" ""Sweet Daughter,"" or ""Wonderful Son."" If it is near a holiday, consider writing the holiday greeting, such as ""Happy Holidays"" or ""Happy Valentine's Day.""


If you made a folded card, then write your message inside the card instead.

, Be careful not to punch through your message. If you made a folded card, be sure to punch through both layers of the cardstock.


You can also use double-sided adhesive or tape to affix your tag to the gift.

, You can use just about any sort of string for this, such as twine, yarn, ribbon, or metallic thread.

, Fold the string in half first, then poke the folded end through the hole in the tag. Slip the two loose ends of the string through the loop, then tug on them gently to tighten the knot.

, Wrap the two loose ends of the string around the handle of a gift bag or ribbon that is around a wrapped present, and tie them into a tight knot.

Make a blanket.,
Make a personalized candle.,
Give a heartwarming picture with a custom frame.,
Make clothes or accessories from scratch.,
Make a piece of DIY art.",How to Make a Homemade Gift2," If you know how to quilt, a blanket makes a great homemade gift. Personalize the blanket to fit the person you're giving it to. For example, you might use a checkerboard pattern where every other square is decorated with things that have to do with the person who's getting the gift. For example, if your friend is a mountain climber, you could decorate one square with a picture of a climbing carabiner.


When you're picking out fabrics, consider the occasion. For example, if the blanket is a Christmas present, you may want to use green and red fabrics, or if it's for Valentine's Day, you can use red and pink. If it's for a birthday use the person's favorite colors.
See our main article on making quilts for more help.

, This is another good choice for Mother's Day. To make the most basic version of this gift, grab a small jar, decorate it however you wish, and place a good-quality candle inside. For a more professional look, you can even fill the jar with liquid wax and put the wick in yourself. If you do this, try adding a small amount of perfume or fragrant materials like lavender to give the candle a pleasing scent.


If you have construction paper and paint, you can decorate your jar for a ""stained glass"" effect. Cut the paper into a shape or design that makes sense. Glue it or tape it to the inside wall of the jar. Paint the inside of the jar with a thin layer of paint and allow it to dry. Carefully peel the paper out and its shape will be imprinted on the glass.

, While it can be expensive to have a picture professionally framed, this method lets you give a memorable gift for fairly cheap. Have a picture of a happy memory shared by you and your friend and have it enlarged to portrait size at a photo developer's. Buy a cheap frame from your local craft store (it can even be made out of cardboard). Decorate it with doodles, quotes, glitter, or whatever else you want before you put the picture in.

, Clothing that you knit or sew yourself can make the perfect gift — whenever your friend wears it, they'll think of you. Knit hats, head warmers or socks can be some of the simplest projects for beginners since they can be knit by following the patterns on looped guides called ""looms."" However, with a little sewing know-how, you can make more complex clothes. For example, a worn-out pair of jeans can become a stylish new jean skirt. There are many, many projects you can try — it's up to you to pick one your friend will like.


Don't feel like you have to make a piece of clothing — accessories can often be quicker, easier and just as appreciated. For example, a duct tape wallet makes a durable yet stylish gift.

, This is your chance to really let your creativity shine. Paintings, sketches, pottery, sculptures, and many other forms of art can make unique presents. You can even try making a non-physical piece of art, like a song. Don't be afraid to give a piece of art that's not perfect — it's the effort and creativity that count.


For one piece of wall art that's fairly beginner-friendly, you'll need spraypaint, a small sheet of plywood (2' × 2' max), and a yard or two of wooden dowel material. Cut the dowel into a few narrow strips, spray paint them, and glue or nail them to the plywood to make a frame around the edge.
Next, cut the dowel crosswise to make many small pegs that are almost the same size, but not exactly. Spraypaint these pegs different colors. Use wood glue to stick them inside the frame randomly until it is completely full. When the glue dries, you'll have a uniquely textured, multicolored piece of art to give to your friend.

Wrap a 16-inch (40.64 centimeters) Styrofoam wreath with 1½-inch (3.81 centimeters) wide floral ribbon.,
Unwrap the peppermint candies.,
Hot glue the peppermints to the wreath.,
Coat the wreath with clear, glossy spray sealer.,
Glue a ribbon all the way around the edge of the wreath.,
Cut a 3½-foot (1.07 meters) piece of fancy ribbon and wrap it around the top of the wreath.,
Thread some more ribbon through the top of the bow, and tie it into a loop.",How to Make a Candy Wreath2," Choose a color that matches your peppermint candy, such as white or red; if your peppermint candy is green, then you could even use green ribbon. This will give the hot glue something to stick to. It will also conceal any Styrofoam that might show through any gaps.Secure both ends of the ribbon to the back of the wreath using hot glue.

Choose the kind of Styrofoam wreath that is flat on the back, as opposed to one that is a tube shape. It will be easier to fill with candy.

, You will be gluing the candies directly onto the wreath to create a tiled, mosaic effect. If you'd like a non-permanent wreath, one where you can pull the candies off to eat, leave the candies in their wrappers.

You can use other types of candies for this method; a mixed bag of Halloween candy would work great!Leave these candies in their wrappers, however.

, Arrange the candies in a brick-like pattern instead of straight rows. This will help conceal any gaps. Start gluing from inside the ring first, then work your way outward towards the outer edge. Stop when you are 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the back edge. Your candies likely won't fit all the way, so you will hide it with a ribbon trim.Do not cover the back of the wreath with candy.
If you are using a mixed bag of candy, consider laying them in a random order and overlapping some of them.This will give you a ""bushier"" wreath.

, Take the wreath outside, or into a well-ventilated area. Coat the entire wreath using spray sealer, then let the sealer dry. If you need to, give it a second coat. This will keep the candy from getting dirty or sticky.If you made the wreath using regular candy, you do not need to spray it. The candies' original wrappers will protect them.

, Remember the 1-inch (2.54 centimeter) gap you left unfilled along the back edge of the wreath? Now is the time to hot glue a strip of ribbon to that edge. Glue the ribbon a little bit at a time; that way, the glue won't set too fast.

You can use the same floral ribbon you used to wrap around your wreath in the very beginning. You can also use a fancier ribbon instead.

, Tie the ends of the ribbon into a large bow.If you'd like, you can cut the ends of the ribbon at an angle or into a V-shaped notch., Use this loop to hang the wreath over the front of your door, on the wall above your fireplace, or wherever you'd like."
"
Cut 4 feet (1.22 meters) of 22-gauge floral wire and bend it in half twice.,
Wrap the wire around the top of a 16-inch (40.64 centimeters) Styrofoam ring to make the hanger.,
Lay a piece of cardboard or foamcore on your work surface.,
Attach two pieces of candy to a greening pin.,
Line the inside of the Styrofoam ring with the prepared candies.,
Prepare more candies, then start pinning them to the outside of the Styrofoam wreath.,
Fill any gaps with individual candies.,
Attach a bow near the top or bottom of the wreath.,
Thread some more ribbon through the top of the bow and tie it into a loop.",How to Make a Candy Wreath3," This will eventually make the hanger for your wreath., Place the wire behind the wreath, with the bent part 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) above the top. Wrap the loose ends of the wire around the wreath once, then wrap them around the base of the wire loop. Wrap the loose ends once more time around the wreath, then poke the ends into the Styrofoam., This will not only protect it, but also make attaching the candy to the greening pins easier., Lay the candy flat on the cardboard or foamcore, and poke one of the greening pin's legs through the wrapper—just between the twist and the candy itself. Do this for the other piece of candy and the other leg.Repeat this step with about 40 to 50 candies.

You can do this with any type of wrapped candy, from taffy, to Jolly Ranchers, to peppermints, to butterscotch candies.
Avoid poking the pins through the wrappers outside of the twisted part. The candy will be more likely to fall off.

, Take a greening pin, and poke the prongs into the Styrofoam. Push it all the way into the foam, pinning the candies against the wreath. Keep doing this until the inside part of the wreath is all covered with candy., Work your way from the outside of the wreath towards the inside. You don't have to worry about covering the back of the wreath, because it will be resting against a door or wall., Use T-pins (for quilting) to secure single candy pieces to any holes or gaps in the wreath., You can make your own bow, or buy a pre-made one from the craft store. Secure the bow to the wreath using a greening pin. If the pre-made bow has wires attached to it, you can simply wrap the wires around the wreath and twist them shut in the back., Hang the wreath wherever you want. To eat the candies, simply untwist the wrapper, and pull the candy out. leave the wrapper on the wreath."

Hot glue the candy canes together to form heart shapes.,
Arrange the candy cane hearts to form a circle, with the points facing inwards.,
Glue the candy cane hearts together where they touch.,
Make a smaller wreath in the same fashion using 12 mini candy canes.,
Glue the mini wreath on top of the larger wreath, right in the middle.,
Glue a round peppermint to the center of the wreath.,
Spray the wreath with clear, glossy sealant to make it last longer.,
Tie a ribbon to the top of the wreath to make a hanger.,
Hang the wreath up when you are done.",How to Make a Candy Wreath4," Take two candy canes and glue them together where they touch. This would be at the bottom of the cane and at the tip of the hook. Do this for the rest of the candy canes so that you end up with ten hearts.

For a nicer looking wreath, take the candy canes out of their wrappers first.
Candy canes don't have to be just red and white. You can use ones in different colors too, such as pink, blue, or rainbow!

, The long, straight edges of the hearts should be facing one another. Don't worry if the straight edges don't completely touch one another; as long as the candy canes are all touching at the bottom, you will be fine., This will be mostly along the long, straight edge of each heart. Don't worry if the candy canes don't touch all the way along the straight edge; focus on the center of the circle.

For a fancier touch, tie a piece of red or green ribbon around the candy canes where they join, near the top. Tie each ribbon into a pretty bow., Take the mini candy canes out of their wrappers first, then glue them together to form six mini hearts. Glue the hearts together to form a circle with the points facing inwards., Make sure that the centers of both wreaths match up., Take the peppermint out of its wrapper first, then cover the back with hot glue. Gently press the mint into the center of the wreath.The best type of mint to use for this would be the red-and-white ""starlight"" kind of mint.

For a fancier wreath, hot glue more mints onto the top of each large candy cane ""heart,"" right where the two arches come together.

, This is a must in areas that get hot and humid. It will prevent the wreath from getting sticky.Spray the front first and let it dry, then flip the wreath over and spray the back. If you need to, do this step twice for more coverage.

Be sure to spray outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. The fumes from the spray can get strong and cause headaches.

, Thread a red or green ribbon through one of the hearts, then tie the ends together to make a loop., Even though you sprayed the wreath with sealant, you might still want to avoid hanging the wreath in areas that get hot, damp, or humid. When the holiday season is over, store the wreath between two sheets of wax paper."

Establish a budget.,
Decide who to tip.,
Check that they are allowed to receive tips.,
Consider giving gifts as well.",How to Tip During Holidays1," Tipping can easily become expensive, and you may have to buy gifts for other people as well. Before you start, decide exactly how much you can afford to tip this year. This will help you decide how many people to tip and how much to give each person.Do not feel bad if you cannot afford a large tip. Tipping is to demonstrate your gratitude, and even a small tip will be appreciated by those who work for you.If you cannot afford to tip everyone who provides you a service, you might consider giving a few of them a card instead. While this may not contain money, it will still express your gratitude in a meaningful way.;
, In general, it is good to tip people who have provided you a regular service in the past year. These could be people who provided a personal service, child care, pet care, or maintenance. Some services that are commonly tipped around the holidays include:


Dog walkers
Dog groomers
Hairstylists
Manicurists
Gardeners
Housekeepers
Cleaners
Doorman or superintendent of your building
Babysitters
Full time nannies

, Not all businesses allow their workers to accept tips or gifts, and it may be considered a conflict of interest for some professions. Always check with the company to make sure that they allow their employees to accept tips or gifts. Do not force someone to accept money if they are prohibited to do so by their employer.It is more appropriate to give teachers a gift from their students rather than cash. Some school districts discourage or prohibit gifts from students, so check with your child’s school first.
Some medical workers such as nurses, hospice care workers, or physical therapists may be prohibited from accepting cash by their institutions.In some places, municipal workers, such as trash collectors, may be restricted from accepting cash on the job.Civil servants, such as postal workers, are not allowed to accept cash. If you want to give your mail carrier a gift, it cannot exceed $20 in value.If company policy does not allow cash tips but does allow gifts, you might consider a gift card instead.

, Cash is not always expected for a tip. You can still express your gratitude through a small gift. It could also be something inexpensive but meaningful, such as a mug, box of candy, or calendar. This gift could also be a gift card to a store or a local restaurant.


If you are tipping someone who cares for your child, you should include a small gift from the child themselves. This can be a handmade gift, such as a painted ornament or framed drawing.
If you want to thank a team of nurses or health professionals who have helped you in the past year, platters of food or cookies are often appreciated.If you are tipping a team that has worked for you, such as a cleaning service, you should give each person a small gift or a gift card in a lower amount."

Steer away from ""lover's"" gifts.,
Be goofy or crude in your card.,
Be a little impersonal about giving him the gift.,
When in doubt, consider chipping in for a group gift.,
If all else fails, drop copious hints that you're just friends.",How to Select a Gift for Your Best Male Friend," Since this person is presumably your best friend, you should probably have a good idea of his hobbies and interests. Giving your guy friend something that reflects these interests or, better yet, something that helps him perform his hobby, is almost always a safe bet. These sorts of gifts will usually be warmly received — you're giving something he likes and will actually use while also showing him that you put some thought into the gift.


If you aren't sure what your guy friend likes to do, a quick trip to his house or apartment should clue you in — just look at what he has lying around and what's on his walls. For instance, if you see a stack of Nintendo magazines, there's a good chance he's a gamer, so a new game or some Nintendo memorabilia would be a good option. Along the same lines, if you see a Metallica poster on his wall, there's a good chance he's a fan of the band's music, so a concert DVD or some band merchandise may be in order.;
, If you're worried about your ability to choose a gift your friend will like, err towards something that he'll find lighthearted or humorous — after all, it's hard to read too deeply into a gift when you're laughing your head off! You may want to play off of an inside joke the two of you share or just simply go for something that's funny in a more general sense. The latter is a little more impersonal, but also a little less likely to give the wrong impression, so use your judgement. Below are just a few ideas to get you started:


Comedy movies and standup recordings.
Novelty gifts — T-shirts with funny slogans, strange knick-knacks, crass board games, and so on.
Prank gifts — things you know he hates (like a jersey for his favorite sports team's rival), things that are amusingly out of style (like ugly 70s sunglasses), bizarre non sequiturs (like a sack of potatoes), and so on.
Something clever that plays off of his name — e.g., if he's named Brian, you might consider a Life of Brian movie poster.

, One sure-fire way to please your guy friend while steering well clear of awkward misunderstandings is to give him something that's purely functional — that is, something that's useful to him, but not necessarily very ""warm"" or intimate. For instance, if this guy friend spends lots of time lifting weights at the gym, you might consider getting him a pair of fingerless weightlifting gloves, some gym shorts, or even a few weights for his home. These sorts of gifts show that you pay attention to what your friend likes to do but are usually very low-risk because they aren't likely to offend him or come across as overly affectionate.


The potential problem with these sorts of gifts, of course, is that they can sometimes come across as cold. Giving a plain, functional gift to someone you've known your whole life may lead to hurt feelings if your guy friend is sensitive about this sort of thing, so be aware of this possibility.
You'll also want to keep in mind that certain functional gifts can send unintentionally rude messages. For instance, while a subscription to a health food magazine may be useful, it may send the unfortunate message that you think your recipient needs to lose weight.

, Another great way to show your appreciation for your friend without sending the wrong signals is to make your gift all about your guy friend and his circle of friends (which includes you, obviously, though you don't necessarily need to pick a gift that you would enjoy personally.) For example, if your guy friend is in a band with a few of his other buddies, a great gift would be to give him a custom-designed T shirt with his band's name on it. You might alternatively want to get him a rhythm-based music game like Guitar Hero — this way, you all can play it together.


If your guy friend has an S.O., the same principle applies, so you might want to consider getting something for the two of them. For instance, two tickets to a show put on by the couple's favorite local band is a fantastic way to give your guy friend an entertaining night out with his favorite sweetheart (with or without your presence — it's your decision.)
This is also a great way to ease tensions if you've recently had a disagreement with some of his other friends. If you get him something that you, him, and the other friends can use together, you're basically offering an olive branch and saying, ""I want us all to get along.""

, Getting your guy friend something that appeals to his sense of masculinity or his image as a gentleman is usually a fairly safe choice. Things like pocket knives, watches, driving accessories, and so on make memorable gifts and are suitable for most young and old men alike. Below are just a few more ideas:


Ties
Tools
Belt buckles
Shaving accessories
Wallets — many guys go long periods of time without buying themselves a new wallet, so this gift will probably be especially appreciated.

, Your gift doesn't necessarily have to be very expensive for it to make a big impression. Making your own gift from scratch is a great way to show you truly care about your friend, and while these sorts of gifts are often much less costly than a similar gift purchased from the store, the time and care you put into the gift will usually be extra-meaningful. Below are just a few fun DIY gift ideas to get you started, but don't be afraid to get creative and make your own!


A piece of art created by you (like a painting, drawing, or sculpture)
A handmade craft item (like a piece of furniture, skateboard, laptop stand, etc.)
A handwoven piece of clothing (like a knit hat or mittens)
Some homemade food (like cookies or brownies — non-perishables are best)
A song written and performed by you (if you're truly bold!)

, If you're really worried about giving your guy friend the wrong gift, let him choose it for himself! Gift cards and gift certificates are good choices for acknowledging that you care for your guy friend without the risks of more personalized gifts. Many people even prefer gift cards to normal gifts. In face, statistically speaking, the more general-purpose the gift card, the better someone is likely to appreciate it.Best of all, these gifts are very convenient to buy — you can usually pick them up at chain grocery stores on the way to your friend's birthday party.

, Guys are often reluctant to tell people what they want as a gift, especially for birthdays, Christmas, and so on. Some guys feel shy about asking other people for things, while others simply don't care much about what they get. This can be frustrating when you're shopping for presents, so don't hesitate to press your friend for details (respectfully, of course.) Usually, even guys who keep quiet about what's on their wishlist still secretly have something they'd like, so start digging!

, No matter your intentions, certain gifts come with romantic ""baggage"" that's hard to ignore, so you'll definitely want to avoid them. As a very general rule, anything you might consider giving your sweetheart on Valentine's day should be off-limits for platonic friends. The consequences for breaking this rule can be dire (especially if your friend has an S.O.), so beware! Below are a few examples of gifts considered ""romantic"" that you should avoid:Cologne or personal fragrances
Flowers
Cufflinks or other jewelry
Fancy chocolates or other fine sweets (especially those in stylish, elegant boxes)
Expensive accessories (e.g., Rolex watches, fine pens, etc.)
Provocative clothing (Funny T-shirts are fine, but silk boxers, terrycloth robes, stylish jackets, and so on are too personal for platonic friends)
Event tickets for just you and him

, Often, it's not the gift itself that makes a guy think that you're sending him signals, but the message included with it. It can be easy to mistake friendly tenderness and affection for something more serious, so you may want to avoid this entirely by keeping things very non-serious in your card. Some overeager guys may see romantic signals in even the goofiest of cards, but the risk is much smaller than with a genuine, heartfelt message. Below are just a few sample ideas for making your gift message pleasantly irreverent:


Write in SMS-speak (e.g., ""H0p U had gd bday. Thx fr b-in a gd fri3nd."")
Be condescending in a funny way (e.g., ""I don't know if you know this, but it was really hard to pick out this card. I was actually hoping I could have it back so I could re-gift it for Amy's birthday next week. Oh yeah, happy birthday."")
Include a dopey acrostic of his name (e.g., for a friend named David: D — Daring / A — Amazing / V — Very cool / etc.)
Draw crude or bizarre doodles in the margins.

, It's not all about what you give your guy friend — it's also about how you give him the gift. Gushing over your friend's reaction to your gift can raise awkward questions even if the gift is something casual, like a new phone case. On the other hand, coolly and casually giving your friend his gift as if it's not terribly important to you what he thinks of it will allow you to escape unscathed.


There's a tricky balance you want to maintain here, however — being too impersonal can come across as rude. For example, leaving an unmarked package containing his present on his porch and not mentioning it to him for a week might make it appear like you don't care about your friend very much. You know your friend better than almost anyone else, so try to keep his sensitivities in mind.

, Teaming up with a few other people to cover the cost for a gift isn't just one way to save cash on an expensive gift — it's also the perfect method to avoid ""sending the wrong signal."" It's very hard to make a group gift come across as a personal, romantic gift from you to your friend. After all, there's a good chance you didn't even pick it out! Best of all, a simple, polite message on the card is the only personal touch a group gift needs, so you don't need to risk the pitfalls of a longer, more personalized message.

, If you're seriously worried about your gift being taken the wrong way, use your card as an opportunity to define your relationship in purely platonic terms. Go out of your way to refer to yourself and your guy friend as just that — friends. Use words like ""buds,"" ""pals,"" ""homies,"" ""dudes,"" and so on. Avoid terms that can be construed as romantic, like calling yourself his ""special friend"" or ending your letter with ""Yours,"". Unfortunately, for some guys, not even this will be enough. In these cases, you may need to simply ignore your friend's puppy love until he loses interest. If he's becoming too distracting to ignore, most relationship guides will recommend being blunt — in other words, telling him directly that you don't want to ruin your friendship with romance.See our article on the subject for more information.

, Rather than buying a card at the store, you can up the ante on your gift by creating a hand-made card. This further highlights the personal and thoughtful nature of your gift.


Take a piece of paper (printer paper, construction paper, or looseleaf notebook paper) and fold in half from top to bottom.
Next, fold it from left to right. Here is the base for your card.
Decorate the front with images from magazines, or draw something with markers.
Include your personalized message and proof of donation inside.
Once again, don’t forget to sign the card!

, Many charities offer Christmas ornaments, stickers, or other small tokens that signify the donation. Wrap up this token and present it to them. This will give them a small physical gift to open, as well as something they can display to feel good about themselves. Include the card that you purchased or made.

, Make sure this digital “thanks” makes its way to your recipient. Include their email address so that the e-card goes directly to them, or forward it to them from your address.


Do this in addition to a physical card and/or token, not instead.
If they are a very public person, many charities allow you to give using a social media platform (like Facebook) and post a “badge” directly on the recipients wall."

Think about the type of floral arrangement you wish to send.,
Consider where the individual will put the flowers.,
Get the recipient's name, address and phone number.,
Locate a well-known, well-established florist with a good reputation.,
Place the order.",How to Send Flowers," Flowers that are in season are usually fresh. They tend to be readily available at a better price than flowers not in season.;
, When you're ordering flowers for a table, the size of the table does matter. A flat long flower arrangement would look great on a dining room table, while something smaller and daintier would be more appropriate on a small table.


Know how much you are willing to spend before contacting the florist.

, The florist will need this information in order to deliver the flowers.

, Keep in mind that you may not have the chance to see the arrangement before the company sends it. Florists that do business with local flower growers and farmers may use only fresh flowers in their arrangements, extending the life of the flowers.

, You can order flowers online, in person or over the telephone. The process is easy regardless of the method you choose.


Be sure to have your PayPal account information, your credit card or a debit card handy when ordering.
Ask the florist about its delivery policy. Most florists include the delivery charge in the price of the flowers, but some do not. The cost of delivery may vary slightly from florist to florist. Some florists offer free delivery, while others charge for it.
Let the florist know the date you would like it to deliver the flowers. Some florists will ask whether you have a morning or afternoon delivery preference.
Provide your billing information once you have made your flower selection. The florist will need your name, address, phone number and payment information.

Write a surprise message in a surprising location.,
Surprise your partner with time.,
Find out what they want.,
Avoid your joint bank account to make the purchase.,
Pack a surprise picnic.",How to Surprise Your Partner with a Gift1," Write a surprise message for your partner. Put it in their wallet or purse, so they are surprised to find a lovely message. You could also mail a message on a cute postcard. In the message, you can tell them how much you love them and give them directions for how to find their surprise gift., One of the biggest obstacles to surprise and intimacy is a lack of time. Take the kids to the park early in the morning and leave your partner in bed so that they have time to sleep in. Get a babysitter for a day and spend it with your partner doing things you love doing together. At the end of the day, give them their surprise gift., If you have been together for a long time, it can be hard to determine a surprise gift that your partner will actually enjoy. If this is the case, you could try asking one of their close friends, as long as you trust them not to tell your partner about it. You could also ask a family member if they have heard anything about what they might want., If you have a shared bank account, use your own credit card or cash to make the purchase so that your partner will be less likely to figure out the surprise.

, Secretly pack a picnic. When your partner gets home from work at lunch or dinner, tell them you are taking them someplace special. Take them someplace that has meaning in your relationship such as a favorite park or historical monument or lookout. Put your surprise gift at the bottom of your picnic basket."

Consider whether you already tip this person on a regular basis.,
Evaluate the type of service you receive.,
Assess the quality of service you received.,
Learn the typical rate in your community.",How to Tip During Holidays2," If this is a service that you tip regularly, you do not have to make a separate tip as a holiday gift. Instead, during the holiday season, increase the typical amount that you give.For example, you might tip your hairstylist every time you see them. So, instead of giving them a holiday tip, give them twice as much as you normally would at your December hair appointment.

, Different types of services might receive different amounts of tips. In general, you want to tip the equivalent cost of a single session or pay period. Some services might require a little more or less however.



Baby sitters: one or two nights pay.

Au pair or nanny: extra week’s pay.

Dog walkers: extra week’s pay.

Dog groomers, house or office cleaners, personal trainers, and hairstylists: cost of a single session.Doormen and building superintendents: $30-$100.If you attend a bar or restaurant regularly, you may want to tip your usual server a little extra than normal.

, If someone has provided you with truly exceptional work this year, you may want to exceed the normal amount. On the other hand, if someone’s work has been lackluster, you may want to consider lowering the tip amount.


Do not spend time worrying that if you do not tip well, you will not get good service the coming year. A tip is a way of saying ""thank you,"" especially around the holidays. If you are receiving service that does not warrant a generous tip, you might consider shopping around anyway.

, Tipping rates can vary by community. This is because the cost of living is different in various regions. People living in cities usually tip more than those living in suburban or rural areas.There are also regional differences as well. Ask around to see what the typical tipping rate is.


If you have friends who use the same service, you can ask them, “I’m trying to figure out what is appropriate to tip our dog walker. Do you mind if I ask how much you usually tip for this service during the holidays?” Some people may be uncomfortable talking about money, so if your friend does not want to say, you can drop the subject.

"
"
Give early.,
Write a personal note.,
Hand it to them at the end of the service.",How to Tip During Holidays3," The holidays are expensive for everyone, and an early tip can really help some people get through the season. It is good to tip early in December. At this time, it does not seem as though the tip is an afterthought, and the recipient can use the tip towards holiday gifts, travel, or food.Generally, the latest you should give a tip is right before Christmas.That said, the recipient might appreciate a New Year’s tip instead.

, A tip is a way of showing your gratitude, and you should make sure that the recipient knows just how grateful you are for their service. Write a note to accompany the tip. You can write it in a card, holiday-themed stationary, or just on a piece of paper. Express your gratitude for their service while wishing them happy holidays.


For example, you might write, “Dear Louise, Thank you so much for your services this year. We don’t know what we would do without you. I wish you happy holidays with your family this year. Thank you again.”
It is best to stick with a generic “Happy Holidays” unless you are certain which specific holidays the recipient might celebrate.
Once you have written the note, put it in an envelope with the tip tucked inside., You should hand the tip over at the end of a typical session. If you pay them at the end of a week, it may be nice to accompany their paycheck with the card. If possible, hand them the envelope in person.


As you hand them the card, you can say, “This is just to say thank you for everything you’ve done this year.”

Explain their donation in terms of numbers.,
Make a logical argument.,
Highlight the convenience of a ""virtual"" gift.,
Tell them you thought long and hard about this.,
Explain your financial situation.",How to Tell Others Their Gift Is a Donation Made in Their Name2," For the more logically minded person on your list, use numbers to represent the impact of their gift. Many charities will explain in numbers what a specific dollar amount can achieve. Include this information in your gift.


For example, if you are donating to a food bank, explain that their generous donation will feed X number of people for Y number of days.

, Ask the person the following two questions: (1) ""Do you think that you would like getting a gift that will make you feel better?"" (2) ""Do you think that giving a donation to a charity will make you feel better?"" If the answer is ""yes"" to both questions, you can simply announce what your gift is.

, This gift will not take up any space in their home. They won’t have to decide what to do with it when they move. They won’t have to spend any time or energy maintaining this gift. You can highlight some of these convenient qualities of giving a virtual gift!


For example, you can say: ""I'd like to give you something of very high quality that takes none of your space and wastes none of your time. Guess what it is?""
It may help to list some of these qualities jokingly, which can lessen the awkwardness. But your message of convenience will still be heard.

, Explain your thought process. This is an especially strong argument for a recipient who is relatively affluent; someone who already “has everything.”


Explain that you spent a lot of time brainstorming what to get them.
List some of the items you considered.
Finally, explain why this was the best choice.

, If money is tight for you this year, giving donation-based gifts can be a way to make your gifts go farther. If this is your case, outline this reality for your friend. It will shift to focus away from what they “didn’t get,” and back toward the actual spirit of giving.If you ordinarily give physical gifts and donate to charity around the holidays, you can save money by combining the two.
Most donations qualify as tax-deductions, which can help you out if money is tight.

"
"
Drop clues ahead of time.,
Make it personal.,
Connect the gift to a personal memory.,
Give them a choice.,
Use imagery.,
Prepare yourself for disappointment.",How to Tell Others Their Gift Is a Donation Made in Their Name3," You can minimize bewilderment by dropping some clues to the recipient before you give them a gift. This will diffuse any disappointment they might feel in the moment. If this is for Christmas, or another mutual gift-giving holiday, this may also cause them to reevaluate what they are giving to you (which is only fair).You can say, “Have you ever heard of people giving donations in someone’s name instead of physical gifts? I think that’s pretty cool. We all have way too much stuff anyway.”

, You want the recipient to have an emotional connection with this gift. As such, select a charity that will be meaningful to them. By donating to charity that they believe in, the large-scale generosity of the gift will be clear. What’s more, the personalized nature of the gift will show that you put thoughts into it. This will make it much easier to explain your gift.


If they are vegetarian or vegan, consider donating to an animal rights group.
If they support LGBTQ rights, perhaps donate to Human Rights Campaign or a similar organization.

, Beyond simply connecting the charity to something they like, can you select something that is meaningful to you both, or to your relationship? What special memories do you share with this person? Do they involve food? Do they involve the outdoors or animals? Choose a charity that connects with those memories.Include a message that explains this connection when you present them with the gift.
You could say something like, “Remember when Grandma used to bake extra loaves of banana bread and bring them to the church before Easter? That inspired me to want to feed the hungry, and I thought it would make you happy to support that cause, too.”

, On a neurological level, giving makes people feel happy. This is what you are giving! However, studies show that when a person has no control over the giving, the happiness effect is minimized.Many websites (such as DonorsChoose.org) allow the recipient to select the charity they want. This makes it much easier to explain your gift, and furthermore, the recipient will get a bigger happiness boost from the act of giving!

, Don’t simply tell the recipient what their donation is doing. Show them! Request an image directly from the charity group or try to download one from their website. Images appeal to a different part of the brain. A powerful image can influence the recipients opinion more effectively than words alone.Print out the image and give it to the recipient.


If the charity is working to feed hungry bellies, show an image of someone being fed.
If the charity is building school for young women, find an image of the women being helped.

, Despite all of these tactics, it is still possible that the recipient will be disappointed with their gift. Try to emotionally prepare for this reaction. Remind yourself of the positive impact of your gift. Most likely, your recipient will get over their initial dismay and come to appreciate the value of such a gift.

Write down the hobbies or sports that he enjoys.,
Talk to him about his interests.,
Read blogs or magazines for the type of gift you plan on getting him.,
Narrow your potential gift ideas down to three.,
Buy an accessory for the guy who has everything.,
Do an activity together.",How to Select a Gift for a Guy1," If you are close to the guy, then you’ll already know what sports or hobbies he participates in. Determine what he likes the most, or something that he may not have all the equipment for and then think of gift ideas around it. It’s okay if your gift isn’t overly sentimental or meaningful. Some men prefer practical gifts.If he plays a sport, new equipment, a signed piece of memorabilia, or tickets to a game are perfect gifts. If you're younger, you could give him baseball cards or a new football.
If he’s into art or music, then art supplies or music equipment make for great gifts. You can even buy him a song on iTunes, or make a playlist if you are on a budget.
If he’s more of the gamer type, maybe getting him a new game or a new piece of hardware for his system or computer would be greatly appreciated.
Artists always need art supplies, so if he’s the artistic type, new brushes or paint would be great gifts.
Musicians are always in need of new gear, whether it be an extra strap for a guitar, cords for a DJ, or strings for a violinist.;
, If you regularly talk to the guy that you’re getting a gift for, you can ask him in casual conversation for things that he wants. Some guys are more open and these guys will likely make their opinion known on things that they don’t have. However, in some friendships, candor can be limited, so make sure the conversation is organic so you don’t send mixed signals, or tip him off to your intentions.You can bring up something you plan on getting him and get his opinion on it without giving away the fact you plan on gifting it to him
Make a mental note of anything that he said he wishes he had in other conversations.

, A good place to find good ideas for gifts are blogs, forums, and magazines. On blogs and forums, you’ll find people who are into the same interests as the guy you plan on getting the gift for. This will give you a heads up about the hottest new product or upcoming event.


You don’t need to create an account or post anything on the forums. Concentrate on reading up on what everyone wants or needs.
Bookmark any useful links you find along the way so you can come back to the product pages later.

, If you have too many gift ideas, you should narrow your selection. Think of what he would appreciate the most, what he would use the most, and what fits within your budget. Think of what kind of gifts would be appropriate for the situation, given your relationship to the guy. If he’s a close friend, family member, or significant other, you may want to have a bigger budget than if he was just a casual friend.


The items that are too expensive for your budget should be eliminated.

, If your guy is successful and it seems like he has everything, it may be difficult to think of something that he wants or needs because he can just get it himself. In these cases, you can buy an accessory for him that he thought he never needed but will come to enjoy. If he likes extravagant things like cars or fine wine, you can get him an accessory that doesn’t cost a lot, like a wine stopper or a custom stick shift. This is useful if you’re trying to save money or you’re limited on funds.


The guy who has everything is probably settled in how he operates every day. Don’t try to change his daily routine.
If you're younger, you can get him a new album or comic book. Think of something that just came out and that his parents haven't bought him yet.

, Activity gifts are great because the gift involves spending time with the person too! You can go zip-lining, go rock climbing, go to the beach, take a hike, explore a cave, or do whatever else is close to where you live. Make sure to stay safe, and follow any guidelines that are set at the activity. If you are a younger person and can't afford an activity gift, ask your parents and see if they can help you with it.


If you're younger, then a trip to the arcade or cyber cafe is a great gift to give a friend. Just make sure that you ask your parents.
If you have it in your budget, then surprising him with a trip is an amazing gift.

Ensure the person who you give a dog to wants a dog.,
Give an adoption kit.Instead of making a pet selection yourself and gifting it to someone, make a gift of dog paraphernalia like a dog bed, collar, leash, and dog bones.This will alert the recipient to the fact that you want to give the person a dog as a gift.,
Think about the recipient’s lifestyle.People with limited time or mobility might not be appropriate caregivers for a dog.,
Factor in the dog’s needs.Puppies often need lots of attention and training.,
Know what dog the recipient wants.,
Be realistic when giving a dog to a child as a gift.",How to Responsibly Give a Dog As a Gift1," Dogs are big commitments, and foisting such a commitment on someone without their prior approval or knowledge could lead to the recipient rejecting the gift.Changing hands so many times in such a short time is stressful for the dog.To find out if the person you plan on gifting the dog to wants a dog, simply ask, “Do you want me to get you a dog?”
Sometimes, even if someone wants a dog, it’s best if they don’t receive one.For instance, if you’re a parent considering gifting a dog to your young child, you should remember that you will be the one taking care of the dog most of its 10-15+ year life, not your child.;
, After they receive this dog paraphernalia, you can travel with them to your local animal shelter and move forward with the adoption process.This will give the person you’re gifting the dog to time to decide what sort of dog they want.
Along with the adoption kit, provide a gift certificate from your local pet shelter in an amount close to the expected cost of the dog the person you’re giving to will want. You might also choose to produce your own “Pet Promise Certificate” using Petfinder’s online template., Dogs need to be walked, fed, let outside, and played with regularly. Making a gift of a dog to someone who works 10 or 12 hours daily is irresponsible unless that person has someone at home to participate in rearing and attending to the dog.Ensure that the person you’re giving the dog to thinks carefully about their schedule, energy levels, and lifestyle when making their choice.Dogs cannot be returned if later, the person who received the dog decides later that dog ownership is not something they are interested in., Older dogs, on the other hand, are often already trained and less rambunctious than younger dogs. Additionally, larger dogs will need more food and water than smaller dogs. Think carefully about the personality and needs of the dog you make a gift of, and match these needs to someone who can adequately meet them.Shots, spaying/neutering, and other veterinary expenses can add up quickly. Ensure the person you’re gifting the dog to can meet these and other, ongoing care needs., Once the person has thought long and hard about the needs of various breeds as well as their own lifestyle, they should have a better idea of exactly what type of dog they want. Ask them to settle on what breed of dog they want, how old they wish the dog to be, and what sex they want it to be.If the person who will receive the dog is still unsure as to which or what type of dog they want, instruct them to do some research. Information about dog ownership can be obtained through the internet and books at the local library. The recipient should investigate breed-specific profiles that offer information about the energy levels and general personalities of various types of dogs., Generally, kids will not be the primary caretakers of a dog that was received as a gift. Prepare yourself to spend a lot of money, energy, and time on any dog that you buy as a gift for a child. But at any age, your child should understand that a dog is a responsibility that they must also invest at least some time in."

Determine how big your canvas should be.,
Decide between wide and long.,
Pick your subjects.,
Scan your artwork.",How to Turn Kids Artwork Into a Gift1," If you decide to simply present the original artwork as a gift, feel free to use any size paper (or, if using paint, a literal canvas) that you like. However, for many of these projects, you’ll be scanning the finished artwork to your computer. If you decide on one of these, use paper that will fit your scanner. Also:


Be aware that changing the size of your scanned image may alter the image itself. For example, shrinking your child’s 8.5 x 11-inch self-portrait to fit a small canvas pouch may cause facial features to condense and blur together. Conversely, blowing up a smaller picture to cover a larger dishtowel may cause the blown-up image to appear pixelated.
To avoid this, use paper that roughly matches the surface area of the item that it will be transferred to. Or, simply trim larger sheets of paper down to size with scissors.;
, Again, if you intend to give the original artwork as a gift, this is less of a concern. However, for artwork that needs to be scanned and transferred, consider the dimensions of the item that it will be transferred to. If the item is wider than it is long, instruct your kids to orient their paper accordingly.


For example, if you’re going to iron your transfer onto a small wide pouch, you’ll most likely want a horizontal image to cover as much surface area as possible.

, Of course, if you want to, give your kids free rein to draw or paint whatever they choose. But also consider instructing them to draw appropriate subjects for the occasion. Ask them to create a custom image that ties directly into the occasion and/or the recipient for a more personalized gift. For example:


If the occasion is a birthday, they could draw a party scene with cake and balloons.
For holidays like Christmas or Hannukah, have them draw a Christmas tree or a menorah.
For relatives like grandparents, aunts, and uncles, ask each child to draw a family portrait, or make it a group project with each family member drawing themselves.

, If you’ll be giving the finished artwork as a gift by itself, skip this step. However, if you’re going to use it to decorate another item (or present copies of one image to more than one recipient), scan the artwork to your computer. Once scanned, crop, minimize, or otherwise edit the image to your liking and save the file.


If you don’t have a scanner, you can either use a smartphone or digital camera to take photos instead.Or, bring the artwork to a copy store to have it scanned and saved to a thumbdrive.

Survey his room or apartment and see what’s missing.,
Talk to his close friends or family for gift ideas.,
Ask him if he needs or wishes that he had something.,
Compare prices for your potential gift ideas.,
Buy him a gift card.",How to Select a Gift for a Guy2," Some guys don’t mind not having the nicest things, some don’t care about the necessities, and others may not have the money to buy everything they need. This might be a new pair of shoes because his old ones have holes, or a new cellphone because his screen is cracked.


Getting a gift that he needs might not have the same “wow” factor as buying something he wants, but it’s likely to get a lot of use.
If his apartment needs repairs, some tools or a toolbox is a great gift.

, Even if the guy doesn’t admit that he needs anything, his friends or family might be more realistic. People who are personally close to the guy, especially those living with him, will have a good idea for things that he needs.Asking people the guy lives with will also prevent you from buying something he already has.

, Talking with your guy will give you good insight into what he needs. Try to not be too forward when you ask him what he needs so he won’t be offended. Instead, listen when you talk to him, and ask him questions to discover if he’s missing anything.


Some guys are more open than others. If you really can’t figure it out by talking to him, you may be able to be more direct and just ask him if he needs anything for his apartment or house.

, Many people have a limited budget when it comes to buying gifts for friends. Because of this, it’s always good to compare prices online and in department stores. Try to always go for the highest quality item, for whatever you are trying to get, so the guy will be impressed. If this isn’t in your budget then you should choose another gift.


Sometimes you’ll find the perfect gift in a place you wouldn’t expect like an outdoor market.
Getting the best price for the item will not only save you money, but will ensure you can upgrade to the best quality gift.

, If all else fails and you're not sure what to get, you can always get him a gift card. Think of what he likes to do and where he usually shops, and aim for a gift card from that store. Determine how close you are with him, how much you have to spend, and how useful the money will be towards a purchase. If you are just acquaintances a $20 or $25 gift card is an appropriate amount. If it's a family member, you most likely want to spend more if it's in your budget.


If he likes working with his hands, then getting a gift card from a hardware store would be a great option.
Gamers or computer nerds are easy to shop for. Get them a gift card to a gaming or electronics store.
If you're not sure what he likes, you can always buy him a general gift card that can be used at most locations that accept credit cards.

Think of something to make that would be meaningful to him.,
Make a list of things that you need to complete your project.,
Buy the materials you need online or at an arts and crafts store.,
Create your gift.",How to Select a Gift for a Guy3," Try to think of a personal moment that the two of you shared and make your gift be related to that. Think of what your talents are, and try to create something that uses your strengths. Don’t worry if you’re not the greatest artist. The quality of the art matters less than the significance that the gift holds for him.


If you are not artistic, a photo collage is personal and easy to create.
If you're younger, you can use an extra white shirt and create designs on it with marker, or dye it. Think of creative things you can do with extra clothes to make an awesome gift for them.
You could make him a painting, compose a song for him, or create an installation art piece.
Read Make Handmade Gifts for more handmade gift ideas.

, If you go to the store and buy supplies, you don’t want to waste time going back because you forgot something. Creating a complete list of all the materials you need for your gift will prevent you from giving the guy the gift late, or worse yet, scrapping the project mid way through.


Remember, if you need photos developed, they may take a day, so be sure to plan out your gift according to your time restraints.
It’s better to have leftover art supplies than to run out in the middle of creating it.

, Once you have your idea, you need the supplies required to create it. Go to your local arts and crafts store, or an online marketplace to buy what you need.


Going to the art store and then comparing prices on your phone is a great way to save money.
If you buy supplies online, make sure to factor in the time it takes for it to ship.

, Take your time and create the gift that you had in mind for him. Remember, the more time and effort you spend will pay off with the final product, so don’t skip any corners or try to rush it to completion. Once you are done, store it away in a place where he won’t find it.


Don’t be scared of the gift not being perfect. What matters is the time and meaning you put behind the gift, not its artistic merit.
If you mess up, don’t be afraid to go back and start over.

Ensure the dog you’ll give as a gift has everything it needs.,
Obtain the dog responsibly.The most responsible way you can obtain a dog you wish to make a gift of is by obtaining it via an animal shelter or humane society.,
Seal the deal.,
Talk to your child if they are the recipient of the dog.",How to Responsibly Give a Dog As a Gift2," Assuming you’ve given dog paraphernalia to the person who will ultimately receive the dog as a gift, there should be no need to buy many more things in preparation of the dog’s arrival at its new home. Still, you and the person who will be bringing the dog home should take a final inventory to ensure that the dog and its new owner have:a collar
water and food bowls
a leash
chew toys
ID tags
a crate or baby gate to confine the dog when necessary

, These are nonprofits or organizations run by local government that house pets that are stray or otherwise unwanted. When the pet population in these shelters reaches maximum capacity, the pets are euthanized. Do the responsible thing when obtaining the dog you will turn into a gift and adopt from one of these shelters.To find out what humane societies or animal shelters are operating in your area, use The Shelter Pet Project’s searchable shelter database at http://theshelterpetproject.org/.
Find out how you and the person you’re gifting the dog to can visit the dogs at the shelter. When the person you’re gifting the dog to settles on a dog they want, ask shelter personnel what the next steps in the adoption process are. Follow the instructions of the shelter personnel.
Do not buy your dog from a puppy mill or commercial pet store.

, After the person who will own the dog fills out the appropriate paperwork, they will retain full legal responsibility for the dog you bought them as a gift. Ensure the person you’re buying the dog for retains the dog’s medical records, receipts for fee payments, care instructions, and related documentation regarding the dog.Pay adoption fees and related costs for the person you’re gifting the dog to.

, In addition to making your dog loved and cared for, you should ensure your child participates in rearing the dog. For instance, if your child is five years old, you might say, “We must always love our dog and care for it.” If your child is a tween or teen, you might say “I expect you to pitch in and help take care of this animal.” Show your child how to do certain dog-related tasks so they can then do them on their own.Assign age-appropriate responsibilities to your child. For instance, if your child is younger than age five, they might be able to help brush the dog, put away dog toys, clean and put away dog bowls, and help fill the dog bowls with food and water.
If your child is between five and ten, they might aid you with exercising the dog, cleaning up the pet’s poo from the yard, and – if the dog is small – bathing the pet.
Older kids can do anything that you would do.
Praise your child for contributing anything towards caring for the dog. As your child grows older, you can reduce the frequency of verbal praise, but should continue to make a point to your child intermittently when they demonstrate their commitment to dog care that they are a great pet owner.
