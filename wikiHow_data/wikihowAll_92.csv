Allow the dog to explore the home.,
Show affection to the new dog.,
Get to know the dog’s body language.,
Separate the dog from other pets at first.,
Reward good behavior in your new dog.,
Be patient with your dog.",How to Responsibly Give a Dog As a Gift3," Instead of smothering the dog with affection and attention as soon as it arrives in its new home – which can be stressful for the dog – allow it to introduce itself to its new family naturally. The dog should be free to roam the house and meet other members of your family when they wish to.Set the dog down and allow it to walk around the home on its own. You should, however, monitor it and prevent it from hurting itself near stairs or any other possible danger zones that it cannot yet use.
Don’t scream the dog’s name in a high-pitched voice or squeeze it in a tight embrace. Discourage your family members from doing likewise.
For instance, you might say, “Please do not engage in boisterous behavior around the dog or smother it with affection. This could cause it undue stress.”

, If the dog you received as a gift is relaxed and comfortable being touched, make a point of petting it often. Dogs love being rubbed behind the ears and patted on the head. Some dogs also enjoy rolling over and getting their belly rubbed. These actions can help you build a bond with the dog you received as a gift. You could also:hug your dog gently
play with your dog
offer treats to your dog
give your dog a chew toy
give your dog a KONG toy
get your dog a dog bone
tell your dog, “I love you, .”

, Dogs send identifiable signals when they feel threatened, aggressive, or sad. For instance, if the dog lowers its head, bares its teeth, and has its hackles raised, it feels threatened and might attack. If it’s walking around with its tail between its legs, it might have done something it feels ashamed of.Encourage your family to respond appropriately to the dog you got as a pet. For instance, if the dog seems scared or threatened, instruct family members to speak in a calm, soothing way to it.

, Keep your new dog in one part of the house and your other pets in another part of the house. Allow the dog to explore and sniff areas of the house where your other pets already roamed freely. Then, confine the new dog in one room and allow the pets you already owned to sniff the areas where the dog you got as a gift was exploring. This will provide an initial, introduction via scent.Introduce the new dog to the other pets face to face. Keep the new dog on a leash. If the new dog and your other pets take a friendly interest in each other, allow them to edge closer and closer together. Finally, when they are sniffing one another face to face, release the new dog from the leash.
If the pets you already own and your new dog seem hostile to each other, separate them and try to introduce them again some other day.
If the dog you received as a gift was a puppy and your other dog is quite large, always supervise their interactions.

, If the dog you received as a gift comes when you call its name, reward it with a doggie treat and verbal praise. For instance, you might say, “Good dog.” If the dog scratches at the door when it needs to go out, do the same thing.You can also give your dog a treat and verbal praise when it obeys commands like “Sit,” “Lie down,” “Roll over,” “Play dead,” and “Speak.”
If your dog sits quietly in the presence of visitors and guests, you can encourage them to continue doing so by offering a treat.
If rewarding good behavior seems to do little to end bad behavior in your dog, consider taking it to a “puppy kindergarten” or obedience school. You can locate such an institution by looking one up in your yellow pages.

, Your new dog might need to be housebroken. It might bark noisily and jump on furniture. But with time and training, you can help your dog become a well-behaved member of the family.To reduce the likelihood of trouble, dog-proof your house be removing things stored in locations where dogs might get into them and cause trouble for themselves or others. For instance, don’t store sharp objects like scissors or knives on low shelves where the dog might get into them.If you have long-term behavioral issues, get professional help by taking your doggie to a puppy finishing school or obedience school. Locate one in your area by looking such an institution up in your yellow pages.

Matte and frame your picture.,
Include hanging or display materials.,
Use magnetized frames.,
Buy a digital frame.",How to Turn Kids Artwork Into a Gift2," Matting isn’t necessary to frame pictures, but it can add visual appeal, especially if the recipient uses mattes to frame their own wall art. If you’re fairly sure of where the recipient will hang it, choose a colored matte that will match that room’s color scheme and/or other matted artwork. Or, to play it safe, choose a neutral color like white or cream to border the picture within a traditional frame.

, If you’re presenting artwork in traditional picture frames, consider adding materials to display them as bonus gifts. Include nails, screws, or adhesive velcro hanging strips to mount them on the wall. Or splurge on a floating wall shelf so they can stand the frames up instead of hanging them., Just about everyone knows that the kitchen fridge has long been the go-to spot to hang kids’ artwork. If the recipient is a traditionalist, stick with tradition! Present your gift in a frame with magnetized backing so they can hang it from the fridge with an added touch of class., If the recipient loves gadgets, scan your artwork and load it to a digital frame that displays alternating images. These can store hundreds of images, so this is also a great idea if the recipient has limited wall- or shelf-space, or even if your kids are just that prolific. For an added touch, intersperse the artwork with behind-the-scenes photos of your family art project."

Decorate a candleholder.,
Iron artwork onto canvas.,
Create silhouettes.,
Decorate a journal.,
Order customized projects.",How to Turn Kids Artwork Into a Gift3," Use clear candleholders to maximize the amount of light that your finished project will provide. For each one, print your scanned artwork onto an 8.5 x 11-inch sheet of plain vellum paper (a translucent form of paper that will allow plenty of light to shine through it). Cut away the excess paper, wrap the image around the holder, and tape the ends together where they meet.Measure the holder’s dimensions before your kids create the artwork. This way you can give them appropriately sized paper to draw on. This helps eliminate the need to alter the size of the image after scanning. It also saves you from wasting printer ink on larger images that will need to be trimmed down to size.
For a more seamless look, add an extra inch to the width of the vellum paper when cutting out the image. This way you can overlap the ends when wrapping them and then use double-sided tape between them so the tape is out of view.

, Choose a plain canvas product to iron your artwork to, like cosmetic pouches or tote bags. Print the scanned image onto iron-on transfer paper, which you can find online or at craft stores. Trim away the excess if needed, remove the sheet’s backing, and then iron the image onto the canvas.Plain white canvas is ideal to avoid clashing colors. However, feel free to use pouches, bags, or other canvas products with solid colors or other designs if desired.

, Transform the original artwork into a double piece of art by using it to create a silhouette of the artist. If you have have a printed photo of your child in profile that matches your desired size for the silhouette, use that. If not, take a digital photo of your child in profile and upload it to your computer. Alter the size of the image on the monitor until it matches your desired size. Then:Tape tracing paper over the photo or monitor and then trace the outline of your child’s head. Remove the tape and use scissors to trim along the outline.
Rub a glue stick over the back of your child’s artwork and then stick the outline to that. Then use your scissors to trim the artwork along the glued outline.
Glue the cut-out artwork to a sheet of stretched canvas, spray the whole thing with clear gloss varnish once the glue dries, and frame your silhouette once the veneer dries.

, Use a bound journal, as opposed to a spiral one. Place your child’s artwork facedown on the worktable and then open the journal on top of it. Trace an outline of the book on the back of the artwork, with an added border of a half-inch (1.25 cm) along each side. In the top and bottom borders, draw a vertical line at each corner of the spine. Remove the book and cut the outline out with scissors. Then:Rub the entire surface area of both covers, plus the spine of the journal, with a clear glue stick. Then line the edges of the spine up with the marks in your border and press the spine into the back of the artwork. Once the whole length of the spine is pressed into the artwork, open the covers all the way and press them into the artwork, too.
Flip the book and artwork over and smooth out any wrinkles before the glue begins to dry. Flip it back over and use scissor to cut a vertical line in the artwork’s border along each mark for the spine. Then make a diagonal cut from each corner of the artwork to the corresponding corner of the journal.
Fold the border’s corners over those of the journals and press it firmly to the inside of the covers. Then do the same with the edges. Apply more glue if it has begun to dry too much for it to stick firmly in place.
Add a protective cover to the artwork. Lay out a sheet of clear contact paper. Attach this in the exact same manner as you did with the artwork.

, If DIY projects aren’t your thing, never fear. Search online for a multitude of companies that will use your uploaded images to create gifts featuring your kids’ artwork. Choose between:


Paper products, like photo books, notepads, and wrapping paper.Necklaces, bracelets, and other jewelry.T-shirts, dresses, scarves, and other clothing.
Bedding, like pillow cases and blankets
Kitchen items, such as plates, mugs, and coasters.

, Make sure that the egg is completely submerged. If you can't decide which color is the lightest, choose a primary color instead., This will take about 2 to 5 minutes. The longer you let the egg sit, the darker it will become., Use a wire egg holder or a pair of tongs to lift the egg out of the dye bath. Set the egg down onto an egg holder or egg carton. Let it dry completely before moving on., This time, dip the egg only two-thirds of the way. The color may change slightly on the egg, because it will be going on top of the first color.

Make hard-boiled eggs.,
Write on the egg with a wax crayon.,
Add names to the egg.,
Decorate the egg with Easter or spring-themed words and illustrations.,
Dip the egg into the dye.,
Use a paintbrush to dye the egg.",How to Write on Easter Eggs1," Before you write on your eggs with any method, make sure to hard-boil them. Start by putting the eggs in a large pot, with one layer of eggs. The eggs should not be on top of one another. Cover the eggs with ½ inch of water. Bring the water to a boil, and then turn the heat down to moderate high. Boil the eggs on low boil for around 10 minutes, uncovered.Remove the hot water and pour cold water over the eggs. Let the eggs set in the cold water for 15 minutes. Add cold water or ice to the water to keep it cold.;
, After hard-boiling the eggs, you are ready to start writing on them. If you plan on dyeing your eggs, you can write one them with a wax crayon. Use a white crayon to draw your design or write words onto the plain, undyed eggshell.Cheap crayons generally are the waxiest and work the best.
When you dip the egg into dye, the wax repels the dye, leaving undyed areas where you have written.

, One fun way you can decorate the egg is to write people's names on them with the wax crayon. Then, you can give the person the egg to dye, surprising them when they see their name appear through the dye.


This is a great way to surprise children. Don't tell them their name is on the egg before they dye it.

, To make the eggs themed, try writing seasonally specific words on them. You can write ""Happy Easter,"" ""Welcome Spring,"" or even silly phrases like ""Egg-celent.""


You can also draw fun Easter and spring pictures. Try decorating the egg with stripes or polka dots, or drawing bunnies, chickens, lambs, or flowers on the egg.

, Make a dye solution by mixing ¾ cup (or 180 mL) of warm water with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of white vinegar and 10 to 20 drops of food coloring. Place the egg into the dye so the entire egg is covered. Let the egg soak in the dye for around five minutes.When you take the egg out of the dye, the dye will not be on the parts of the egg with the crayon.
If you want a lighter egg, take it out before then. The longer it’s in the dye, the more vibrant the color.

, If you don’t want to submerge your egg, you can use a paintbrush to dye it instead. Using the same dye dip, wet the tip of a paintbrush with the dye solution. Then, paint the entire egg. The parts with the crayon will remain white.This method yields a lighter color than submerging the egg.

Use markers.,
Use watercolor pencils.,
Make chalkboard eggs.,
Use ink stamps.",How to Write on Easter Eggs2," Try writing on hard-boiled eggs with markers. You can try permanent markers, like Sharpies, or if you have children, you can use non-toxic markers. Using different colors, write on the eggs and draw designs. You can write on undyed eggs or colored eggs.You may want to write on the eggs in sections and let the colors dry before moving on. This can help keep your fingers from getting covered in marker ink.
Use old toilet paper rolls cut to a smaller height to hold the eggs while you are writing on them.

, Paint your egg with watercolor paint instead of dyeing them. Then, use watercolor pencils to write words or draw designs on the wet paint. Let the eggs dry.Watercolors are not permanent, so the color may come off easily. This can be a fun way to write on Easter eggs, but be aware the designs will not last like dyeing them.

, Write on your eggs like you do other chalkboard crafts. Paint hard-boiled eggs with black chalkboard paint. Let the eggs dry completely. Use white or colored chalk to draw designs or write words onto the eggs., Another way to write on Easter eggs is to use ink and a stamp. You can use plain black ink or buy a colored ink pad set. You may also use any stamps you have, or buy a set of Easter-themed stamps.Dye the hard-boiled eggs any color you'd like. Then, choose a stamp color that will show up on the egg. Dip the stamp into the ink and then tap the stamp to shake off excess ink.
To stamp the egg, carefully roll the stamp back and forth over the curved egg shell until the ink adheres to the shell.
Do this as many times with as many stamps as you'd like. You can use the same or different stamps, and try different colors. Just make sure to wash the stamp between each color you use.

Use stickers before dyeing.,
Write on the egg with a glitter.,
Paint your eggs.",How to Write on Easter Eggs3," Try using small letter stickers or stickers in the shapes of hearts to leave writing on your eggs. Stick the letters to the undyed eggshell.

Explain what you expect from your children.,
Don't go during snack or nap time.,
Have a way to keep younger kids contained.,
Make a plan.",How to Handle Holiday Shopping with Your Kids1," Before you get to the store, explain your rules to your children. You can't expect them to behave if you don't lay out what behavior you want from them. Plus, telling them right before you go in keeps them from weaseling out of situation by saying they didn't know any better., If you try to skip over snack or nap time, your children will just be cranky. Try to go after you've finished both of these activities. You can get around the snack time one a bit by bringing snacks with you for your kids to snack on. Keep in mind, though, some stores may frown upon your kids having outside snacks around the merchandise., If you aren't going to a store with shopping carts, you're going to want to have someplace that will help keep your kid contained. A stroller is ideal, as it keeps your child near you while also keeping them from getting too tired from walking around., Think about what you need to buy, and map out the best route around the store. Make it as efficient as possible, so you don't need to spend more time in the store than you have to. You can get in and get out with little fuss."
"
Praise good behaviors.,
Don't be afraid of a little bribery.,
Encourage them to help.,
Remember sometimes the bravest course is to retreat.",How to Handle Holiday Shopping with Your Kids2," If you notice your child has been acting well, praise those behaviors. In fact, it's a good idea to keep pointing out what they're doing well throughout the day. Reinforcing good behavior encourages kids to keep doing that behavior.For instance, if you notice your child has been good about staying by your side, say so: ""You've been staying right by my side all day. Good job, Robbie!""

, While you don't want to reinforce bad behavior by trying to distract your child with a reward, you can offer them a reward if they are good all day. For instance, you could say you'll get hot chocolate at the end of the day if your child is good all day.Stick by what you say. If your child isn't good, you shouldn't follow through with your reward.

, One way to help kids get in the spirit is to get them thinking about other people. Let them help make small decisions about gift-buying, so they can think about giving it to other people. Not every kid will want to get in on the action, but many kids will love to help.For instance, you could say, ""Which color of socks do you think Daddy would like best, blue or green?"" Alternatively, you could say something such as, ""We're going to buy a toy truck for Casey because she likes them. Which one do you think she'll like?""

, No matter what you do, your children may just not be in a mood to behave through a long shopping trip. If that's the case, the wisest course of action may be to come back another day (if at all possible) rather than just trying to just forge ahead.

Bring a screen.,
Carry a special snack.,
Try the sleep approach.,
Have a plan for the toy section.,
Distract your child while you slip gifts into the basket.",How to Handle Holiday Shopping with Your Kids3," You'll need a couple of small toys with you to help keep your child entertained while you're shopping. It can help to let your child choose which toys they'd like to take so they'll be more likely to be entertained by them. You can also buy a small new toy to keep them distracted., Normally, you probably limit your child's interaction with a screen. However, a big shopping day may be good time to lift that rule a bit. If you let your child have more screen time than they normally do, they'll likely be enthralled, leaving you free to shop while they chill in the cart.Make sure the devices you bring are fully charged, and try to bring a charging bank if possible, so you don't run out of battery power halfway through the day.

, Snacks will help if your child starts to get cranky from hunger. Even better, take something that you normally don't let your kids have, such as chocolate, so they are even more distracted by the snack., If you bring blankets and pillows with you and go early in the morning, you may be able to get your kids to sleep while you shop. Of course, it's never a sure thing that your kids will sleep, but it's worth bringing the pillows and blankets along just in case.While some strollers aren't big enough for blankets and pillows, you can make use of a shopping cart in some places. Either way, the key is to make your kid comfortable, though this advice will likely only work for babies and toddlers.

, You know the toys you'd rather your kids not have, such as the noisy ones or weapons. Try to avoid those sections if possible. If it's not possible, go by them more quickly and land on another section where you can distract your child with something they like (such as dinosaurs)., Try having a store tote on hand that you can slip your kid's gifts into. When you need to pick one up, distract your child by pointing at something else they'll like, such as ""Aren't those dresses pretty?""You can also get the cashier on board by asking them to scan the gifts without letting your kids see while you do something else to distract your kids.

Place a hard boiled egg into an egg holder or hold it over a tray.,
Add a few drops of water into your watercolor paint to make it liquid.,
Dip a pouncer into the watercolor.,
Press the sponge firmly against the top of the egg.,
Lift the brush away and let the watercolor run down the sides.,
Let the paint dry.",How to Watercolor Easter Eggs1," If you plan on using liquid watercolor, use a hallow or blown-out egg instead. This is because liquid watercolors (the kind that come in a bottle) aren't food-safe.


White eggs will give you the brightest results, but you can use browns ones too for a more interesting effect.;
, This method works best with two different colors, but you can use just one color, if you prefer.You can also use liquid watercolor, but keep in mind that it is not suitable for consumption and best for hallow or blown-out eggs.If you are using liquid watercolor, you can make it lighter by adding some water to it.If you don't have any watercolor paint, mix together a few drops of food coloring, 1 teaspoon of vinegar, and 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of water. This makes it food safe too.Most kids' watercolor paints are non-toxic and should be food safe. Check the label to be sure, however.

, A pouncer is a small, round, sponge brush.You can also try sucking the paint up with an eyedropper, although this works better for liquid watercolor., As you press the sponge against the egg, the watercolor will come out of it and flow down the sides of the egg.


If you are using a dropper, simply squeeze a few drops onto the egg in the same spot., This will give you a striped or banded effect. If you want to, you can turn the egg so that the color goes all the way around it., Once the paint dries, you can add more stripes using the same color or a contrasting color. You can even add more water to your original color, and make more stripes in lighter shades."

Blend it in with your original color, if desired.,
Let the paint dry completely.,
Draw a flower shape over the blob using a black, brush-tipped marker.,
Add the stamen.,
Add some leaves.,
Fill the leaves in with green paint.,
Let everything dry.",How to Watercolor Easter Eggs2," Choose some bright colors that you want to use for your flowers. You can use up to two colors for each flower. Add a few drops of water into each pan to turn the watercolor into liquid.


You can also pour some liquid food coloring into a small cup instead.
You can use liquid water color, but keep in mind that it is not safe for consumption, so you'd want to only use it on hallow/blown-out eggs.

, Don't worry too much about the shape right now. You will eventually draw a flower over it, making it look like a field-sketch or illustration done in watercolor.

, Try to make this blob a slightly different shape and size. This will create a petal-like effect for your flower. It can be the same color as before or a slightly different shade.


Use a clean towel to dab away any excess paint.

, You can do this with the tip of your brush or switch to a smaller paintbrush. Again, don't worry if it looks blurry. Yellow would work great with orange, red, or pink flowers. Purple would work better with blue flowers, and vice versa.


You can try dabbing the center of your flower with a wet brush or Q-tip. This will remove some of the color and give you a lighter/white stamen.

, Dip your brush back into your first color. Add a small blob over your stamen. You don't have to do this, but it will help tone everything down and create more layering.

, Once the paint is dry, you can move on to the outlines, or you can add more flowers. You should be able to fit up to three flowers on one egg.

, Make sure that the marker is non-toxic if your eggs are hard boiled. Don't worry about following the outlines of the original blob. Simply draw a flower shape using a wavy, squiggly line. You can even draw outside the blob a little; this will give your flower a more field-sketch look.


Can't find a non-toxic brush-tipped pen? Try a non-toxic watercolor pen. They usually have a brush tip attached.

, There is no right or wrong way to do this. You can make a simple stamen by drawing a circle in the middle of the flower. You can also draw a few, short lines with dots on top. Alternatively, you can draw 5 to 6 small circles close together.

, Draw one or two leaf shapes around your flower using the same black, brush-tipped marker. Try to make them different sizes for a more natural look. Let the ink dry before moving on.

, Again, don't worry about going outside the lines or filling them in completely. This will help lend your flower a more watercolor-like look.

, Set the egg down onto an egg holder or bottle cap so that the paint doesn't smudge. Once the paint dries, you can add the egg into your basket or display it however your like.

Dab different colors of watercolor paint onto it using a soft brush. The paint will start to swirl and bleed together for a tie dye effect., Paint the entire egg a solid color using watercolor paint first. Let it dry completely. Next, paint designs on top using acrylic paints and a thin brush.Make sure that the acrylic paints are non-toxic if you are using hard boiled eggs. Most kids' paints will be non-toxic.


Black, white, and metallic colors work best.
Try simple designs, such as stripes, spirals, or dots!
If you don't have acrylic paints at home, you can use markers (preferably brush-tipped) instead.

, Draw designs on the egg using crayon, preferably white. Paint the entire egg with watercolor paint. You can make the egg a solid color, stripped, or even tie dye! The crayon will resist the paint, creating a unique design.

, There is nothing wrong with going old-school and painting designs onto your egg by hand. Start with your lightest color first, then move onto darker ones. For best results, let each color dry first before moving onto the next one.


Try a striped, zigzag, or polka-dotted design.
Paint your egg to look like a bee or butterfly.

Gather your flowers.,
Remove your flowers from their stems.,
Press your petals in a flower press.,
Boil and wash your eggs.,
Dab PVA glue on the back of your flowers.,
Create patterns.,
Reassemble your petals, if necessary.,
Cover your eggs in a layer of modge podge.,
Let the glue dry.,
Display your eggs.,
Store your eggs correctly.",How to Make Pressed Flower Easter Eggs," You can pick flowers from outdoors or buy them at a local greenhouse. Choose flowers with smaller petals, like forget-me-nots, as smaller petals will fit on your eggs better. While colors in a pastel shade fit well with the spring theme, you can choose any colors you prefer to decorate your eggs.
, Be gentle to avoid damaging the petals. One by one, remove the petals from the stems of the flower. Set them somewhere safe, like on a paper towel or plate, and until you're ready to press them.If you accidentally break a petal's leaves apart, don't worry. You can reconstruct it later while you're decorating your egg.

, You want your flowers to lie flat on the eggs. Use a flower press to press your petals. This is a wooden device with screws on all four corners. Lay your petals on one slab of wood and tighten the screws to press your flowers. The longer you leave your flowers, the better pressed and preserved they can be. You can leave your flowers in the press for a few hours or up to two weeks.If you do not have a flower press, press your flowers between the pages of a heavy book, like an encyclopedia, instead of a flower press.

, Eggs should be boiled before you paint them. After boiling your eggs, let them cool and then run them under tap water. Turn your eggs as necessary to gently scrub down all sides of the shell. Cleaner eggs are easier to decorate and will look neater overall.You can pat eggs dry with a paper towel or let them air dry.

, Take your flower petals. Gently dab PVA glue onto the backs of the flowers. Use the brush that came with your glue and apply the glue using very light sweeping or dabbing motions.Go very slowly here. This will help prevent your flowers from becoming damaged during the gluing process.

, Be very gentle with your flowers as you press them onto the eggs. Create whatever patterns you want using your flower petals. Add as many flowers as necessary to fully decorate your egg.For example, you can have a circle of flowers going around the middle of the egg.
If you have a lot of petals, try completely covering the egg in petals. This works best for flowers with slightly bigger petals.

, If any petals fell apart during the pressing process, you can reassemble them on the egg. Place the petals back together on the egg, gluing them one at a time, to recreate your flower.You do not have to reassemble flowers if you do not want to. For a more spontaneous design, you can try placing individual petals throughout the egg's surface instead of reassembling the entire flower.

, Once your petals are glued on in the design you want, take some modge podge. Use the brush or the utensil that came with the modge podge to gently coat your egg. This will flatten the petals and help secure them to the egg. Use only a light layer. This will prevent the modge podge from being visible when you're done., Set your eggs somewhere where they will not be disturbed. Leave them there to air dry. Times will vary depending on the amount of petals you used. To speed up drying, place the eggs in the sun to dry., Display the eggs as part of an Easter decoration. You can place your eggs in an Easter basket and use it as a centerpiece. You can also put your eggs in candle holders. Use your imagination and display your eggs as you see fit., Eggs will go bad if you leave them out indefinitely. To increase the shelf life of your decorated eggs, place them in their original carton and refrigerate them before and after displaying them for an Easter event.As Easter eggs are often left out for long periods, avoid eating eggs you decorated.

Loosen the paper with water.,
Peel off the paper.,
Use room temperature eggs.,
Hand draw any faded color or outlines once your egg is dry.,
Have extra eggs on hand.",How to Transfer Images to Easter Eggs," Choose the images you want and compile them in a word document. Make sure your images are small enough to fit on eggs.Darker colors, like blues, blacks, and dark greens, tend to work best. Strong outlines also help the images show up better.;
, You do not need special paper to transfer your images onto eggs. You can simply use regular copy paper. If you don't have a printer at home, run to a local print shop to print your images.In case you mess up while transferring your images, it's a good idea to print out a few extra pages.

, Do not simply cut squares or circles around your images. Instead, cut out an outline of the images. Cut around the images, getting as close as possible to the edges. This will help the images transfer to the eggs.Go slowly to avoid cutting into the images.

, You can buy modge-podge at any craft store. Take the brush that comes with the modge podge container. Coat one side of the egg in modge podge, creating a blob of modge podge roughly the same size and shape as the image you're transferring.The blob of modge podge does not have to be the exact shape of the image. Do not worry if your modge podge is a little off.

Go slowly as you peel, to avoid moving the paper around too much. This can smear the image., Images will not transfer as well to eggs just removed from the refrigerator or eggs that have just been boiled. Set your eggs out for an hour or so before transferring images to let them cool or warm to room temperature., Sometimes, color will fade slightly when you remove the paper. You may notice things like outlines have broken lines or there are patches of white where color did not transfer. You can use fine-tipped permanent markers to fill in gaps.Wait until the eggs are completely dry before drawing on them with markers.

, It's not uncommon for some images not to turn out. Images may smear or blur, especially if you're new to the process. Keep some extra eggs on hand in case you have to redo an egg."

For instance, if the person is a sports buff you should get them tickets to see a sporting event.
If the person's favorite band is coming to town, you can get them tickets to see them perform.

, Figure out when the person works or if they have a vacation coming up. Consider their schedule when purchasing tickets and try to choose a time or day when they aren't usually working. You can also ask the person about their schedule without making your gift intentions obvious.

If the person has time off from work coming up, you can purchase them tickets for a longer vacation.

, Tickets make for great gifts because they are an experience that can leave lasting memories. When you are purchasing tickets for someone, consider if you can go with them. If you are good friends, they will appreciate the company, and you can share the memory together.

If you're buying tickets for a friend at school, you can slip them into their locker.

, Don't make your intentions known. Call the gift recipient and ask them to meet you to have a ""serious conversation."" When you see them, build up the situation by saying something like ""Hey, I really wanted to talk to you, but I needed to see you in person. When the person responds, surprise them with the tickets., You can disguise your tickets as a different gift by putting them in a box or wrapping them in something like tissue paper. If you are getting tickets for a concert or show, you can wrap the tickets in a band t-shirt to throw them off.If you want to be funny, you can give the gift to your friend in a very large box so that they have no idea what is in it.

, As an alternative to giving them the tickets in person, you can send them photos of the tickets over your favorite social media platform.

Add patterns to the eggs, if desired.,
Consider giving the eggs a final coating of gloss.",How to Make Papier Mâché Eggs1," The cup will prevent the balloon from rolling away while you work.;
, This will be your papier-mâché glue., Newspaper works best, but you can also use plain newsprint paper from the craft store instead. Don't cut the paper; the ragged edges will help the paper seal together and give you a smoother finish.


Consider using both newspaper and tissue paper. This way, when you do multiple layers, you will be able to see which one you are working on.Avoid using plain printer paper or construction paper. Both are too thick and too stiff for this project.

, Drag the strip across the edge of the bowl as you pull it out. This will remove any excess glue. Place it down near the top of the balloon. Use your fingers or a paintbrush to smooth the paper down so that it lays flat against the balloon.

, Overlap the strips slightly as you work from one end of the balloon to the other. Work your way from the top of the balloon all the way down to the tail end. Do not cover the tail, or you won't be able to remove the balloon.

, You don't have to dip these strips of paper into the glue. Simply stick them to the wet paper that's already on the balloon, and use your fingers or a paintbrush to smooth down the edges.Consider using a tissue paper or plain newsprint for this layer. This way, you will be able to see what's cover and what isn't.
Two layers is ideal for eggs that you want to cut open. If you want a sturdier egg, apply a third layer. You may have to use some extra glue for this one., Use a clothespin to clip the balloon to a hanger or clothesline. Wait for it to dry completely before moving on. It may take up to 2 or 3 days., Once the egg is completely dry, gently tug the balloon tail up so that you expose a bit of the balloon. Pierce it with a pin or pair of scissors and wait for the balloon to deflate. Once it is completely deflated, pull it out and discard it.

, Use the same technique as you did for the rest of your egg. If you wish to fill your egg, then do so before covering up the hole.

, To make the paint really stand out, coat the entire egg using white primer and let it dry. Once you have your white base, you can paint your egg any color you want.

, Once your base color has dried, you can paint designs onto it. You can also draw designs using glitter glue or puffy paints instead.Great Easter designs include: stripes, dots, and squiggles. Try to use soft, pastel colors.

, Once all the paint has dried, spray or paint the eggs with a glossy sealer. You can even use a glittery sealer to give it some extra sparkle.This will help make them more durable.


If you'd like, you can cut the egg in half using jagged, zigzag lines so that it resembles a cracked open egg. When you are done, you can fill each half with fake grass, and place a little chick or bunny figure in each.

Assess whether you can care for a new dog.,
Determine how much it would cost.,
Look at your schedule.,
Figure out whether you have the space.,
Decide whether to keep the dog.",How to Handle a Dog Given to You As a Gift1," You should express gratitude for the gift. Regardless of whether you are excited, overwhelmed or perturbed by the gift, you should show gratitude. You might want to say “thank you” and show an appropriate level of gratitude.If you love the new dog given to you and feel excited about it, you might want to say “thanks!” or “thanks so much!” You may want to give a hug or otherwise show a high level of gratitude.
If you are not ready for a dog in your life for one reason or another, you should still express your gratitude. Remember the positive intentions of the person who gave you the dog and express your gratitude to show that you appreciate the thought.
If the new dog has been given to you in the form of a certificate, you should also tell them that you will be in touch about the kind of dog that you purchase.
If you do not want the dog, you should still express your gratitude for the gift. Although you may not want this particular gift, you should show appreciation for the thought and intention behind the gift. You could say: “Thank you. I really appreciate the thought. Although I am not ready for a new dog in my life, I really appreciate the effort you put into this gift.”;
, Consider whether you have the skill, time and financial ability to care for a new dog in your life. If the gift is a surprise, it is important to properly assess your ability to care for the animal, since caring for a dog is a long term commitment that lasts for the lifetime of the animal. If you knew about the gift in advance, you should make sure you are ready for this commitment.If you do not have the financial means or time for a new dog, you may not be ready for the commitment of a new dog in your life. Although you may have some dog training skills, lack of time and money will be a real impediment to properly caring for the dog.If you have the time and financial means to care for a new dog but lack the skill, you can hire a dog trainer and make the time to learn the necessary skills.
If you have the skill and time but not the financial means, you could look into budget options for dog food and other pet supplies.

, The cost of owning a dog varies significantly based on the type of breed or mixed breed dog that you have received, its medical history and other factors. Taking food, grooming, supplies, toys, veterinary, training, and exercise costs into account, consider how much it may cost you to own the dog for the average lifetime of its breed. For example, the following estimates show the approximate low, middle and high end costs of owning an average size dog that lives for fourteen years:On the low end of the spectrum, it may cost as little as $4,242.00.
In the middle of the spectrum, it may cost approximately $12,468.00.
At the upper end of the spectrum, you could end up spending $38,905.
You should also account for the costs of owning a dog in its first year, which add up to around $700-2,000, depending on the breed and its particular needs., Consider how much free time you have available and whether you want to spend your free time with a dog. In particular, you should consider whether you have time to walk the dog and participate in dog training. If the dog is a puppy or still growing, multiply five minutes by their age in months to give you the approximate exercise time they need. You should give that amount of exercise twice per day. So, if you have received a three-month old puppy, consider whether you have the time to give them a fifteen-minute walk in the morning and in the afternoon. In addition, consider whether you have the time in your schedule to attend regular obedience and dog training classes.If you lack the time, you could look into hiring a dog walker to give your new dog exercise.
If you are caring for a puppy, you can also get an exercise pen and some toys so they can exercise on their own.
Adult dogs will need more exercise.
Consider whether you have the time for obedience classes and regular dog training., You should figure out whether the breed of dog that has been given to you will fit in your house or apartment. Although smaller dogs can be happy in an apartment, many medium and larger sized breeds are happier with more space to run around, such as a larger backyard. Looking at the dog you have received, determine whether you have the space in your apartment, house or other living space.Small dog breeds such as the Chow Chow, Poodle, Shi Tzu, Pug tend to be great for apartment living, since they are small enough that they can enjoy the small floor space.Some medium and larger sized breeds will be content in smaller houses such as the Bulldog or Greyhound., Taking into account your budget, schedule, space limitations, skills and feelings about the dog, decide whether you want to keep the gift. You could write down all of the benefits of keeping the dog and then jot down all of the challenges. If the benefits outweigh challenges, you may want to keep the dog. If not, you may want to look at other options."

Give the eggs away as gifts or use them as decorations.",How to Make Papier Mâché Eggs2," The cup will hold the balloon sturdy while you work.

, You can also mix your own glue by using 2 parts white school glue and 1 part water.

, This will make the base for your egg. One sheet will be enough to coat three eggs.

, This will make the outside of your egg. You can make it all one color or many different colors. Some crafters have noted that lighter colored tissue paper, such as yellow, shows the layering and overlapping more.To make polka dot eggs, punch a ¾-inch (1.91 centimeters) circle in the center of your square using a scrapbooking hole punch. Discard the circles, and use the squares so that you get white polkadots on your egg., Brush on some of your glue onto the balloon, and press a piece of white tissue paper onto it. Smooth it down with a brush dipped in more glue. Overlap the pieces as you cover the entire egg.


Start applying the tissue paper at the top of the balloon and work your way towards the tail. Don't cover the tail up., If the tissue paper on the balloon is already damp, you do not need to apply more glue. Simply press a piece of colored tissue paper onto it, and smooth it down with a little more glue.Remember to overlap the pieces by a little.


If you are making polka dotted eggs, be careful not to cover up the white polka dots!

, You can do this by clipping the tail of the balloon to a hanger or to a clothesline. This can take 2 to 3 days.

, Make sure that the balloon is completely dry, then gently tug on the balloon tail until you expose a bit of the balloon. Pierce the balloon with a pin or a pair of scissors. Wait for the balloon to deflate, then pull it out and discard it.

, Small candies, such as chocolate eggs, work great! Be careful not to overfill the egg; it is still very fragile. If you do not wish to fill your egg, you can move onto the next step.

, Let the patch covering the hole dry before moving on.


Because these eggs are made from colorful tissue paper, they don't need to be painted. You can still decorate them, however, with glitter glue if you'd like.

, To open the eggs, simply tear them apart. They make great gifts for Easter baskets!

",How to Grow Plants to Use as Gifts," The Peace Lily is a green leafy plant that produces an elegant and unique looking white flower; it is a house plant that likes sitting near a window, getting some indirect sunlight (not too much, in other words). Add some sand to the top of the soil of your Peace Lily to keep the soil drained and give it a nicer look. It is best to keep your Peace Lily indoors. However, it can survive outdoors if planted under a tree and kept watered and shaded. It needs to be watered about every other day...just enough to keep the soil moist, but not soggy. To start a new plant, be sure to pull roots and all up, when ready to transplant a piece.;
, You will need your own starter plants from your own garden, or from a nursery or friend.

, Their beautiful green foliage will certainly accent any room. Place philodendrons in front of a window, so they can get some indirect sunlight.

They are great if kept indoors or outdoors, but if keeping inside, set them where they can get some sunlight and they'll be happy plants.

, Add a few stones or rocks to the pot for drainage. Add a little soil and hollow out the middle and place the plant inside. Fill it in around the plant with more soil, leaving the soil at least an inch to 1/1/2 inch from the top of the pot.

Treats.
Crate.
Dog bed.
Leash and collar.
Food and water bowls.

If you plan to use an exercise pen, you should make space in your house and set it up.
If you want part of the house inaccessible, you could use baby gates or another barrier.
Deal with identification.

, When you get home with your new dog, keep them on leash. Take them on a tour of your home. Walk around the house with your new dog on leash and show them all of the rooms in the house. Show them where you will be feeding them and offer them a treat at this location. Then, take them to the part of the house where you have their crate and bed. When you get there, you can let the dog off leash and let them smell their new home., You might want to ask the person who gave you the dog if they have a recommendation for a veterinarian. You could also ask for a recommendation from another dog owner such as a friend or family member, especially if they live in the same neighborhood. Using these recommendations, you should phone a few veterinarians to compare prices on key services. You may want to compare prices on the following services:Annual physical exam.
Vaccinations.
Flea and tick prevention.
Dental cleaning.
Fecal exam.
Heartworm test and prevention.

Refuse the offer of a dog.,
Request that the giver take the dog back.,
Find somebody to adopt the dog.,
Give the dog to an animal shelter.",How to Handle a Dog Given to You As a Gift3," If you have been given a certificate to a pet store or dog supplies with the promise of an actual dog from a local shelter, you should be able to avoid getting the dog. You can simply avoid using the certificate or visiting the shelter to find a dog.


If it is a certificate, you could phone the pet store and see if the certificate can be used for other items, re-gifted or reimbursed.
If you have been given dog supplies and the promise of a new dog, you could tell the person who gave you the dog that you actually don’t want the dog.
If you have been promised a visit to a local shelter to adopt a dog, you could tell the person who promised you the visit that you would prefer to not adopt a dog.

, If you have received a dog that you do not want or are otherwise unable to care for, you should consider telling the person who gave you the dog. You could express your gratitude and then kindly tell them that it was a thoughtful gift but you do not have the time, money, or ability to care for a new dog.


Tell them: “Thanks so much for this heartfelt gift. It is such a beautiful dog. I wish I had the time for a new pet in my life right now but, unfortunately, this is not the case. I am just too busy to handle a new dog. Do you think you can bring it back to the shelter or the pet store still? If not, I will find it a new home.”
If you feel bad about telling them, you could simply express your gratitude and then focus on finding a new home for the animal.

, You should see if you can get a friend or a family member to adopt the dog. You may need to take care of the dog while you search for an adopter. While waiting for a suitable family to adopt the dog, you can take the following steps to speed up the adoption process:Advertise the dog through your personal network. Talk to friends, family, neighbors, veterinarians and other people in your personal network about your situation. Tell them you are looking for somebody to adopt the dog and to tell you if they know anyone.
Share your story on social media. Post a photo of the dog and your story of being unable to receive it as a gift. If the person who gave you is on social media, you may want to avoid this step.
Share the story of the dog with potential adopters. Tell them how you received the dog as a gift and any information you may have about its background, ancestry or medical history.
Ask for help from animal shelters. Shelters and rescue organizations can help you find a suitable family.

, You could try giving the dog to an animal shelter or rescue organization in your neighborhood. Remember that giving your dog to an animal shelter is a last resort, since they may or may not be able to find the dog a permanent home. Many dogs live out their lives in animal shelters, so it is better to find someone to adopt through your personal network.

Send your regards with a sampler tray.,
Order a gift basket.,
Keep it simple with candy.,
Delight with a drink.",How to Give Someone a Food Gift1," Head down to your local deli or supermarket and review their selection of specialty snacks.

, Edible gift baskets are a fun, festive way to show someone that you’re thinking about them. Most of these are made up of fresh fruits and chocolates, but they can also include selections of specialty meats, cheeses, crackers and sweets.

Just tie a bow around the package and your work is done.Look for candy shops in your area that offer high-quality artisan sweets.
Include a variety of candies as an extra with a larger gift.

, Not all food gifts have to be eaten. There are also specialty beverages and drink accessories like mulling spices, foreign sodas or alcohol that can be enjoyed hot, cold or with other tasty fare. Place an assortment of coffees, teas or liquors in a basket with a few simple finger foods, or select a bottle of vintage wine and propose a toast to health, friendship and good cheer.Hot cocoa and cider make great potable presents for the chilly months around the holidays.
Think before giving alcohol. If your intended recipient is underage, pregnant or has a history of alcoholism, it may not be the best gift idea."

Allow the rolls to cool on a wire rack.,
Serve and break the rolls open.",How to Make Resurrection Rolls," To activate the yeast, you need to mix it with a warm liquid. Add ½ cup (118 ml) of warm milk to the bowl of a stand mixer. The milk should be 105°F (41°C).You can use 1% or 2% milk, but whole milk usually results in the best rolls.;
, After you’ve poured the milk into the mixer’s bowl, add 1 tablespoon (13 g) of sugar and 2 teaspoons (7 g) of yeast to it. Stir them into the milk to help the yeast dissolve.If you’re using a yeast packet for the rolls, you’ll need an entire ¼ oz (7 g) packet.

, Once you’ve gently mixed the sugar and yeast into the milk, leave the mixture to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. You’ll know that it’s ready when it becomes foamy., When the yeast mixture is foamy, add 3 tablespoons (43 g) of melted butter, 3 tablespoons (38 g) of sugar, 1 lightly beaten egg, and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of pure vanilla extract. Blend the ingredients together in the stand mixer on low speed until they are fully combined.You can use egg substitute in place of the egg if you prefer.
If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can use a handheld electric mixer to mix the dough.
You can also mix the dough by hand, but it will require more time and effort.

, After the ingredients are mixed, add ½ teaspoon (3 g) of sea salt, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ground cinnamon, and 2 cups (250 g) of all-purpose flour to the bowl. Mix the ingredients in on medium-high speed until a sticky but firm dough forms.If you prefer, you can replace the all-purpose flour with a blend of 1 cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour and 1 cup (96 g) of whole wheat pastry flour.

, Once the dough has come together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use clean hands to knead it until it’s smooth and elastic, which should take 5 to 10 minutes.You can knead the dough in the stand mixer with the dough hook attachment in place if you prefer.

, When the dough is smooth, place it in a large bowl that’s been lightly greased with butter. Turn the dough over once so it’s coated with butter on both sides and then cover the bowl with plastic wrap., Place the bowl in a warm place and leave it to rise. The dough should double in size, which usually takes about an hour.The oven is a good place to place the dough for rising. Turn on its light, but leave the actual heat off.

, When the dough is finished rising, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface again. Use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 14-inch (36-cm) circle that’s approximately ¼-inch (6-mm) thick.If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use any heavy, cylindrical object, such as a wine bottle or thermos, for rolling out the dough.

, Once the dough is rolled out, use a knife to cut it into a 8 equal-sized triangles. Separate the triangles so each is set out individually.A pizza cutter can be handy for cutting the dough.

, Add 3 tablespoons (38 g) of sugar and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground cinnamon to a small bowl. Mix the two together well until they’re fully blended.You can use store-bought cinnamon sugar if you prefer. You’ll need approximately 3 tablespoons (38 g).

, Place another small bowl with 2 tablespoons (28 g) of melted butter beside the bowl with the cinnamon sugar. Dip 8 marshmallows in the melted butter and then roll them in the cinnamon sugar so they’re fully coated.Dip each marshmallow into the butter and cinnamon sugar one at a time. Have a piece of foil or parchment paper ready to set them down on when you’re finished.
If you don’t want to use the butter, you can dip them into water instead.

, Take the dough triangles and place a coated marshmallow in the center of each. Next, wrap the dough over the marshmallow and squeeze it in your hand to ensure that it is completely covered by the dough.Make sure that there are no cracks or openings in the dough, or the marshmallow may seep out during baking.

, To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the rolls, set the temperature to 350°F (177°C) and allow it to fully preheat. Next, line a large baking sheet with parchment paper so the rolls won’t stick.If you prefer, you can use a silicone baking mat to line the baking sheet.

, Once the baking sheet is lined, arrange all of the rolls on it. Cover the rolls with a clean kitchen towel until the oven has finished preheating., When the oven is fully preheated, place the rolls inside. Allow them to bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden brown.Keep an eye on the rolls near the end of the baking time. The bottoms can easily burn.

, When the rolls are finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Transfer them to a wire cooling rack to allow them to cool for 15 to 20 minutes or until you can handle them comfortably., When you’re ready to serve the rolls, instruct everyone to break them open. The marshmallow will have “disappeared” during baking so it serves as an ideal way to teach the resurrection story.Store any leftover rolls in an airtight container. They should keep for 3 to 4 days.

, Although the dye will most likely not stain countertops or floors, it’s best to play it safe by covering the area with newspaper and/or finding a workspace that can handle this activity.

, If you're supposed to boil the water, wait until it has cooled safely before dipping the eggs in it.

, Check that the eggs will fit in those squares, with allowance left at the ends so you can tie it all together with a rubber band. If using pantyhose, cut a 5 inch (12.5cm) long tube for the egg to slip into, then knot off each end.

If you want to give great gifts to people, you must know them very well.,
If you have all this information collected, write it all down.,
Something that shows your appreciation for your love, your family and friends can be very touching.,
Try giving something that you brought from a place you visited together and liked very much.,
Take them to a place you find breathtaking and spend a few days together so both (or all) of you can relax.

Nice wrapping is important!,
Put your personality in the gift too!",How to Give Perfect Gifts to People," Map their interests, find out all about their hobbies, learn about their cravings, and lifelong wishes that were never fulfilled. There is not one person on the world who doesn't enjoy doing something, so don't give up finding this activity.

, Create a document on your computer, and write down every new hint of an enjoyed hobby or relaxation method. Things like John likes fishing in the mountain rivers. Or Jane enjoys having a bubble bath with candles. Now you'll know that a gift for John that's related to fishing will be appreciated, like a book about good locations, or a magazine subscription. Jane loves a bubble bath with candles, so you can buy her candles or meditative music, an aromatherapy gift set, or incense sticks. Whatever suits her personality.

, Try making something yourself. A photo montage, a painting, a statue, a poem, or a calendar with pictures taken together.

, Or find objects that make them remember something beautiful.

,, If you don't pay attention to the looks, the contents will not mean that much. You can ask for gift wrapping in most stores.

, Customizing the wrapping, or writing a cool gift card is not optional!

Cook your own canned goods.,
Whip up something sweet.,
Prepare a special meal.",How to Give Someone a Food Gift2," Nothing represents the warmth and comfort of home quite like a loaf of soft, fluffy bread.

Bread can come in a ton of different varieties, so it makes a great edible gift year-round.You can bake bread in large batches overnight, which is useful if you’re preparing it for a lot of people.
Don’t forget about dessert varieties, such as cinnamon-raisin, banana nut or pull-apart monkey bread., Though cakes and similar confections are usually served up after the presents have been unwrapped, they also make great gifts in their right. Whether it’s a simple yet delicious red velvet cake, a pound cake, strawberry cheesecake, or a key lime, pumpkin or peach and praline pie, it’s amazing what a little flour, sugar and butter can create.Pull from your family’s traditional recipes, or try for something unique and daring to suit the person’s preferences.
Delicate or heavily-decorated cakes and pies will be difficult to present. These should be stored, packed and transported carefully., Show your love with artisan canned food items, just like grandma used to do. Things like homemade preserves, butters, pickles and cheese have really grown in popularity in recent years. These items are simple to make, tasty and infinitely customizable. Best of all, once they’re sealed they’ll stay fresh for months or even years, so you can prepare them well in advance without having to worry about them going bad.Canning is fairly straightforward, but does require some special equipment. Before you add making old-fashioned canned goods to your to-do list, make sure you have all the necessities: mason jars, canning tools, cookware and natural ingredients.These types of condiments are versatile, which means the recipient is free to use them however they like.

, If you really want to spoil someone, give them their own private stash of sugary treats.

These foods tend to keep better than others, but chances are they won’t last long anyway.Candies and sweets are real crowd pleasers, especially around the holidays.
Hand out small bags of white-chocolate frosted Chex mix or caramel corn, or send them straight through the mail.

, One more intimate option is to invite someone to your home and cook their favorite dishes for them.

Know your recipient.,
Keep it fresh.,
Complete the presentation.,
Personalize your gift.",How to Give Someone a Food Gift3," Before you start shopping for tantalizing goodies, think about the person you’re planning on giving the gift to. What sort of foods do they like? What don’t they like? Is there anything they can’t eat? Surprising someone with foodstuffs isn’t as simple as putting a bow on a fruit basket. Try to pick out something you know they’ll be able to enjoy.Find out about any unique allergies or dietary restrictions beforehand. It could be embarrassing to present a tray of cured meats to a vegan, and an innocent sugar cookie could make someone with a gluten sensitivity very sick.
Talk to mutual friends or do a little digging yourself to discover what might make a good gift.

, There’s nothing worse than getting an oversized tin of stale popcorn or some freezer burned tamales for Christmas. Whatever you decide to give, be sure that you have a way of guaranteeing its freshness so that it doesn’t go bad or underwhelm once it’s eaten. It’s usually best to have an idea in mind, then buy or make it right before you offer it to the recipient.Wait until as close to the gift-giving time as you safely can to get things ready.
Refrigerate the perishable items you buy or make so that they don’t spoil.
You won't have to worry about delivery goods going bad, since they'll be shipped out express from the maker.

, Remember, you’re giving someone a gift. Don’t skimp on the visual details. Put your item in a box, bag or covered container and wrap it, if possible. You can even incorporate touches like bows, tags and other decorations to complete the look.Even a covered tupperware container with a few simple embellishments can heighten the anticipation of opening the item.

, Tell the person you’re giving the gift to what made you think of them and why you chose the food you did. Include a handwritten card with some well-wishes, or a list of serving suggestions for enjoying the gift. It might also be a good idea to include instructions for putting the food together or cooking it if it’s not ready-to-eat.Come up with a touching or playful message, like “here are some sweets for a sweet girl” with a box of truffles, or “we just go together” with a wine and cheese pairing.
Briefly describe what they’ll find inside, especially if a food is uncommon or not immediately recognizable.

, Watch the florist give the flowers to you. If they shake them, the flowers might die due to shock.

, Do not put them in a box. Not only is it not as attractive as wrapping them, the box prevents sunlight from reaching the flowers, causing them to wilt and die. Many people prefer to wrap them wrapped in plastic in a cone. Shape some wrapping paper (preferably a transparent sheet) into a cone ,following this add some tape, and gently insert the flowers into the cone. You might have to squeeze them in, but that's fine and you could mix them around until they look just right.

, Cut a small piece of paper, punch a hole in it, add colorful ribbon, and tie.

, The flowers can get bent and twisted in the car or other mode of transportation. The best thing you can do is put them down on the floor very gently and drive carefully. Make sure you don't have any sharp turns and you don't drive over the limit. If possible you could hold them between your legs or have someone else in the car hold them. Make sure they are face-up and don't squirm to prevent them from bending and such.

Give herbs.,
Give added value goodies such as preserves or sauces that you've made from your garden produce.,
Save seeds from your garden.,
Give flowers.,
Give compost gifts.",How to Give Gifts from the Garden," Fresh herbs are loved by many people, especially those who enjoy cooking and growing their own food. There are several possible ideas here:

Snip off a large bunch of fresh herbs, tie a rubber band around them and a ribbon, and give the fresh bundle to someone as a gift.



 


Grow live herbs to give to people. Be sure to use gift-worthy potting containers.






Dry your herbs and give the sprig of herbs as a gift. Be sure to label and if you like, add the culinary uses for each herb to the label. You might like to give the dried herbs as a bundle or already added to little containers.





;
, The sorts of things to make include:


Jams or jelies
Preserves
Chutneys
Sauces
Pickles
Syrups
Candied flowers

, Place seeds into homemade seed packets, label them using your printer or calligraphy hand and let the receiver know that they're seeds straight from your garden. These can be wonderful family heirloom seed sharing opportunities, or you can give seeds to neighbours, as a housewarming gift, or as a way to remind people to plant their own veggie garden.

, As with the herbs, you can choose to give cut flowers in a bunch or give a living flower in a suitable container. When cutting them for a bunch, choose the best flowers and add flair with a ribbon or bow. Making a posy adds special value to the gift.


All flowers can make wonderful gifts, from roses to daisies. Be sure to select the ones that are growing strongest when giving them as gifts to be planted in someone else's garden.

, Why not offer another keen gardener some of your delightful homemade compost, especially where they haven't had a chance to make any? You might also consider making them some compost tea and placing it in a bottle for ready fertilising. Always label clearly and clear the compost delivery with the recipient first!

Purchase quality drinks.,
Give a sampler of drinks.,
Give a gift of homemade drinks.,
Present the gift well.,
Make beer.,
Make cordials.,
Make wine.,
Make flavored spirits.,
Infuse fruit in alcohol.,
Make limoncello or lemonade.,
Make cider.",How to Give Drinks As Gifts," If you're giving purchased drinks, they should be of the sort that the person would either not usually buy for reasons of expense or difficulty in obtaining or because the drink is something the recipient loves. The drink might also be inexpensive on its own but you can increase its gift factor by giving a half dozen or more of the same drink.

, Another idea is to give a sample of a type of drink, such as a selection of fine wine from a particular wine-growing region or a set of different types of ales. This could be a good gift for expanding the recipient's experience of different drink styles or brands.

, Another way to approach giving drinks as gifts is to make them yourself from the finest ingredients. This is an opportunity to show off you skills in the kitchen as well as making the gift very personal. Some ideas of drinks you might like to make yourself include cordials, beer, liqueurs, infused vodka, and wine, depending on your skills and interests.


Don't just see drinks as liquid forms. You could also put together a tea basket filled with tea leaves and tea drinking items such as spoons, teacups and a tea strainer. Or do a coffee basket, filled with coffee beans, recipes for making new coffee styles and chocolate coated spoons for stirring.

, An important part of giving drinks as gifts is the presentation––this can increase the value and enjoyment of the gift.


If making your own drinks, always use attractive bottles, jars and other containers. Label with a unique and interesting label that includes date of production and details about using the drink and any tips.
Don't simply stick a bottle of wine into a wine bottle bag. Instead, consider a beautiful box lined with a soft, silky fabric and finished off with a ribbon. Or place several bottles into a wine bottle basket or perhaps bottles and matching food into a picnic basket. Such additions turn a simple bottle into a complete gift.
Look for unusually shaped bottles when buying the drinks. On their own, these can be an exciting gift and the recipient can decide to keep the bottle once the drink has been consumed.

, Beer gifts can go beyond the liquid drink if you're good at baking and cooking as well. Try making beer cake, beer bread and deep fried beer. And think of beer made from plants other than hops, such as nettle beer. For the non-drinkers, try making ginger beer.;
, Cordials are a lovely gift that will be enjoyed for several weeks after giving. Include a guide for using, as some people won't be certain how to use it, and be sure to include tips for using the cordial when cooking and baking, not just as a drink. Some nice cordials to start with include lemon cordial, rose cordial and raspberry cordial. Another cordial enjoying a revival recently is elderflower cordial.

, If you have the patience, interest and space to make wine, this can be a nice way to share the fruits of your labor with others. Wines can be made from the fruits of summer, such as strawberry wine, plum wine, rhubarb wine and blackberry wine. And if you have a garden, try making dandelion wine.

, From gin to vodka, you can improve on the basic spirits and turn them into something rather special by infusing delicious tastes through them. Think of raspberry gin, chocolate vodka and sloe gin. Rum is great to improve, for example, spiced rum and vanilla rum. And brandy can be turned into delicious flavors such as plum brandy, cherry brandy, apricot brandy and apple brandy.

, Gifts that involve alcohol in food are a great gift and a way to eat your drink! For example, try ginned blueberries, muscat poached quinces and

, There are lots of different possible lemonade flavors, such as cherry lemonade and strawberry hibiscus lemonade. Most lemonade drinks will need to be refrigerated, transported in the same way and placed in the refrigerator again at your recipient's house.

, When you have lots of apples or pears, make cider or perry. Bottle in pretty bottles, label and share the joy of the harvest with your friends. Apples and pears can also be turned into wine or juice.

Ask people who are close to the person for gift advice.,
Personalize the gift wrapping.,
Include a card with the gift.,
Get creative with the giving of the gift.",How to Give a Great Gift to Someone," Personalize the gift by sitting down and making a list of the person’s interests and likes. Try to write down as many specific items or experiences that the person has told you she likes or is known to enjoy.For example, you may write down that your friend likes video games, movies, and Thai food. You may also think about if the person is an introvert, who prefers to experience things in small groups or one on one, or an extrovert who wants to learn new skills and meet new people.
You should also take into account the age of the person. An individual who is 45 years old may appreciate a different gift than someone who is 16 years old. If you have a close relationship to the person, intimate or friendly, you may select a gift that is more personal. If you are not a close with the person, you may choose a gift that is more useful or accessible.

, Think about any items the person many need in her day to day lives or a big purchase that the person needs to do but has been putting off. This could be a new kitchen appliance the person has been eyeing or a new backpack the person needs for a new year of school.Look for practical gifts that still feel like a treat, as the gift may be out of the person’s budget or the person may not have time to get the item herself.
Avoid going too far over their budget or it may be taken as an insult - consider what will be a surprise but not a shock.

, If you can be sneaky, try to look at the person’s online wish lists. Many online retailers, like eBay and Etsy, will allow users to make online wish lists of items that they like or want. If you can manage to get into the person’s account, you can look over her wish list and select a gift from there.Only sneak a look at her account if you are close to the person, such as a familial or intimate relationship, and if you think she will not mind you looking at her account for the sake of a good gift.

, Maybe you have a photograph of the two of you together that you know the person likes. Frame the photograph and give it to her as a sentimental and thoughtful gift that she can display in her home.Another option is to take items that have sentimental value, such as a souvenir from the first time you went on vacation together, and put them in a memory box. A memory box is a decorative box that you can fill with sentimental items and give to someone. The items can act as a collection of memories that you both share.

, Often, giving the gift of an experience can be more impactful than giving a person an item. This could be a couples massage, a sky diving date, or dinner at the person’s favorite restaurant. Think of experiences that will surprise and excite the person, as these will often make a lasting impression.You can also give the person an experience in the form of audio books for a long road trip or drive. This would be a practical gift that would also help the person to fill her time learning and listening to a good story, which would make for a valuable experience.

, If the person is often stressed, overworked, or going through a hard time, offer to gift her your time. This could be by doing all the yard work for a week or by taking her kids out for the day so she has some free time to herself.Gifting your time can also be good for individuals who have physical or mental disabilities, as you can offer to take her for dinner and assist her for the night or run an errand for her that she will not able to do on her own.

, Homemade gifts can make the best gifts, as they are often thoughtful and detailed. Homemade gifts also show the receiver that you spent lots of time and effort on her gift, which she will surely appreciate. Set aside some time and create a homemade gift you think the person will love, such as homemade bath products, homemade cookies mixes, or homemade candles. You could then give the person an individual homemade item or put the homemade items in a basket and give her a whole bunch of homemade things.


Another homemade option is to create a DIY item for the person’s home. This could be a small item of furniture, an item to hang on the wall, or an item for her deck or patio. Think of a DIY you can do that would appeal to the person’s sense of style and bring her joy.
If you have a passion for cooking or baking, a good gift option may be a batch of freshly baked cookies or an offer to cook dinner for the person.

, A hostess gift is what you bring to someone's house when they are hosting you for dinner or for a get together. A classic hostess gift is a nice bottle of wine, but if your hosts do not drink or if you are looking for a more unique gift, you may go homemade. This could be a homemade mix of spices and seasonings in a nice jar or bottle for the host to throw on chicken or fish, or a homemade cake or loaf for dessert, wrapped in wax paper.You could also bring other homemade items like a homemade candle or homemade bath products. Though if you do not know the host well, you may opt for edible gifts that have wide appeal.

, If you are trying to find a suitable gift for an authority figure, like your teacher or your boss, you may opt for practical items. This could be a gift basket of school supplies, full of all of the teacher's essential school supplies for the next school year or a gift basket of tea and coffee, if your teacher enjoys warm, comforting beverages.Or, you could make her a personalized coffee sleeve for her coffee mug.


For your boss, you may want to play it safe and go for a gift that is practical but also thoughtful, especially if you want to impress her. Look for a nice succulent plant in a pot or make her a glass terrarium to brighten up her office. If your boss drinks and enjoys cocktails, give her a seven piece cocktail set or a nice wine opener. If you know your boss' sense of humor, consider giving her a funny calendar for the new year that she can put on her desk., If you are looking for a gift for a work colleague, consider treating him for lunch one day or a nice after work dinner. This will allow you both to take a break from work and de stress, while still remaining professional of course.


If you are trying to think of gifts for several colleagues, consider buying each person a nice bottle of wine or making them nice gift baskets. Try to give everyone the same gift, as you do not want to show favoritism in the office.

, If you are stumped on gift ideas for someone you do not know well, you may want to reach out to any friends or individuals close to them for gift ideas. Pull aside another colleague who is close to your boss and ask her for advice or call another friend who is attending the same event for ideas on hostess gifts. Brainstorm with others for the perfect gift, and discuss ideas beforehand to make sure you both don't end up getting the person the same gift.

, A big part of the fun of giving a gift is watching the person unwrap the gift. Make the gift wrapping personal to the person by choosing wrapping that is in the person’s favorite color or that has the person’s favorite animal printed all over it. Use ribbon or bows on the gift wrapping for an added touch.You may also want to get creative with the wrapping by using a nice gift box or gift bag and tissue paper. Or you may want to make it fun and difficult for the person to get to the gift by wrapping it in duct tape or masking tape. You can then watch the person struggle to open the gift, just reassure the person it will be worth it once she gets to the gift inside.

, Write up a nice card to accompany the gift, as this is considered a considerate touch to any gift. Use a card that expresses how you feel about the person. Often, funny cards a good way to brighten someone’s day and get her more excited for the actual gift.


If you are giving the person an experience in the form of gift cards or a certificate, place them in the card and use the envelope as gift wrapping.

, Rather than simply hand the gift over to the person, get creative and make the gift giving element interesting. Send the person on a scavenger hunt to find her gift or put a secret message in the person’s favorite book that she must decode to locate her gift.You can also leave the gift in an area she may not expect to find a gift and let her experience a surprise that way. Being creative about giving the gift can help to amplify the excitement for the receiver and make her experience of receiving the gift that much better.

Fold the money using origami.",How to Give Money As a Gift," It's important that you give an amount of money that you feel comfortable with. If you make a good salary, consider giving more. If you're struggling to meet your own financial needs, give less. Take a look at your budget and savings account and decide how much you can spare without hurting your own financial health.For example, if your monthly expenses leave you with a small amount of extra spending money, you may want to give less.;
, If the person is a close friend or an immediate family member, you should consider giving them more money. If they are an acquaintance, coworker, or classmate, then the expectations for your gift are lower and you don't have to give as much. Determine how close you are with the person and choose an amount of money that you feel is appropriate., Different occasions call for different amounts of money. For example, at weddings, you should give a gift that covers the cost of your seat and food at the reception. Also, you should think about giving more because this money will likely go towards a honeymoon or another major investment that will help the couple start their life together.Other occasions, like birthdays, typically call for less money because they happen more frequently and aren't as unique or special.


Money is an appropriate gift at events like baptisms, bar mitzvahs, and quinceaneras.
Give more money for unique or special occasions that don't happen often.

, Sometimes people can fall on hard times and money is one of the best gifts that you can give them. It helps them catch up on bills and get essential things for themselves and their family. If the gift recipient is having a hard time financially, consider giving them a greater amount of money than if you knew they were financially secure., The same sum of money can make a large or small impact depending on the age of the person that you're giving it to. If you are getting a cash gift for a very young child, you will most likely not have to give them much because they don't have their own money yet. When gifting money for a wedding or another occasion as an adult, consider giving more so that it can actually make an impact., Putting cash inside of a card or envelope is the most traditional way to give someone money. A card allows you to write them a meaningful message while an envelope can help you personalize the message. Think of creative ways that you can decorate your envelope to make the gift more special and unique.


You can use paint or markers to decorate the outside of your envelope.
Consider getting graphic stickers for envelope decorations.
Your envelope can say something like ""Happy Birthday"" or ""Congratulations!""

, If you can't meet with the gift recipient in person, then sending them money online is a great alternative. You can transfer the money to them through online banking sites like PayPal, or you can use apps specifically designed to gift money to others.


Some money gifting apps will let you personalize a message so that you can make it unique and special.
You can also deposit money into someone's iTunes or Google Play account so that they can purchase music and apps online.

, If you're scared that the person might lose the money, you can always write out a personal check. Checks are safer than cash because they are written out explicitly to the person, and you can cancel and re-write the check if they lose it.

, Instead of getting them outright cash, you can purchase the gift recipient a gift card. Find a store that you know they frequent or purchase a pre-paid card that they can use wherever major credit cards are accepted. Gifting someone money via gift card is a great option because it also allows them to purchase things online.

, Remove all the chocolates from the box and replace it with folded up bills or a gift card. The gift recipient will think they are just getting a box of chocolates before they open the lid to the box., You can spread some chocolates or candy at the bottom of the mason jar and then put folded bills over it. Decorate the mason jar for the occasion using a marker or by putting stickers or decals on the jar. Finish the jar's decoration by adding a bow or ribbon to the top., Fan out the bills so that they form a circle. You can add a couple of large coins on the top of the bills so that it holds them down. Write a note on the inside lid of the box to finish off the gift., Go to a balloon or party store and request that they place the bills inside of 16-inch helium balloons. These balloons will be big enough so that the cash doesn't weigh them down. Tell the gift recipient to pop the balloons for a money surprise!You can also put confetti in the balloons.

, Empty out a tissue box and fill three-fourths of the bottom of the box with paper towels. Then, tape a sticky note or piece of card stock to the top of a cash, gift card, or check. Write ""Pull Here"" on the card stock or sticky note and then place the money inside of the tissue box. When they pull the note, they will also receive the gift of money.You can tape multiple pieces of cash together and then place them in a box for a longer ""tissue.""
You can also decorate the sides of the box to personalize it.

, You can use different folding techniques to create a variety of different animals and shapes. You can fold bills into an money tree, rose, or ring just to name a few. Find different ways to fold up your dollar bills or checks by searching on wikiHow.

The smaller the amount of money, the lower the denominations you'll need to split the notes and coins into to ensure there is enough to fill the holes inside the chocolate box; for example, $10 would need to be about 9 $1 notes and 4 quarters. Or, use a smaller chocolate box.
The currency you're using will also need to be taken into account; there is more coin and note variety in some currencies than in others.

, You'll need to decide which ones require which sorts of folds for the notes and which ones can accommodate coins best. Place the coins in now; you can't do anything else with them.

, This is more fun; try to make shapes that make the notes look interesting, or even like chocolates. When choosing shapes, be sure to align the fold with the size of the hole in the chocolate box. Some examples include:

Fold into squares






Roll into tubes (you can tie with a small ribbon)






Use origami to form chocolate-style shapes






Fold into a 3-D triangle, and stand upright






Fold into a 3-D square and stand upright






Fold so as to highlight an interesting feature on the note; be sure to face it upwards






Roll into a spiral and stand upright.

",How to Make Glitter Eggs," Will you fill a bowl with just the glitter eggs or will you use them to enhance a centerpiece? Also, consider how many centerpieces you will create (which will dictate the number of eggs you’ll need).;
, Also, if you want to use real eggs plan to hard boil them before you cover them with glitter.


Consider what type of material you will use if you plan to glitter fake eggs. The type of material you use may end up dictating the type of adhesive spray or glue you will use to cover the egg with glitter.

, If you plan to use fake eggs, you can most likely purchase eggs at the craft store. Otherwise purchase real eggs at your local grocer.


Purchase adhesive spray. For most applications, Mod Podge or spray adhesive will allow the glitter to hold nicely to the egg. You may want to experiment if you aren’t sure. Purchase a paintbrush to apply the Mod Podge.

Plan an exciting activity.,
Pay for automobile upgrades or repairs.,
Snag some concert tickets.,
Sign the person up for a subscription service.",How to Gift a Service Instead of an Object," The gift you select should be tailored with the specific individual in mind. Put some thought into what kind of things your recipient likes and does regularly, and how the gift might reflect some aspect of your personal relationship. For instance, fitness lovers will appreciate a monthly trial membership at a new gym, while aspiring writer will get a lot out use out of a subscription to an online self-publishing software. Your gift will mean more if it seems like some real thought went into it, rather than just being chosen at random.Compile a list of the person’s known affinities, interests, hobbies or pastimes.
Ask friends, family or coworkers for unorthodox gift ideas if you get stumped.;
, Find out if there’s anything that the person in question has a particular use for. That way, you’ll know that you’re getting them something that they’ll really appreciate. This might be having a new set of brakes installed on an old car, or getting a fallen tree removed from their yard after a bad storm. A little creativity on your part will take the burden of planning right out of their hands.Listen for cues when the person in talks about things they’ve always wanted to do or need to have done.
Don’t be afraid to think outside of the box—almost any service or convenience can be offered as a gift.

, Your gift will be even better received if it comes at just the right moment. This will show the person that you’re thinking about them and provide some much-needed leisure or relief. For instance, a relaxing massage may be just the thing that a busy executive needs after closing a stressful deal. Likewise, exhausted new parents will relish a weekend stay at a top-rated bed and breakfast.


Make sure you have an idea of the person’s calendar so you can avoid scheduling conflicts.
Look into seasonally-appropriate events and services at different times throughout the year to start putting together ideas.

, Even though the service itself is the real gift, having something to go with it that the person can accept physically is going the extra mile. Gift cards are a good way to enhance the presentation of your gift, as they can be delivered in a separate box or card. Tucking a booking confirmation or scheduling notice into a greeting card will also do the trick.If the service is undocumented, or something you plan to do yourself, accompany it with a note that says something like “enjoy your reservations for a candlelight dinner for two at Chez Louis” or “good for five free back rubs.”
Avoid giving the person a receipt, invoice or anything else that displays how much you spent.

, It’s no fun if your recipient already knows what they’re getting. Try to get as much information as you need from friends or relatives beforehand to avoid letting anything slip. Then, present the gift in a way that the recipient won't see coming. A few subtle clues or a well-timed reveal can make all the difference between a delightful surprise and one that’s lacking any excitement.Use another small item to sneak in your surprise gift. For instance, you could attach a gift card for a tanning package to a bottle of suntan lotion.
Help the recipient discover the surprise with a playful word game or scavenger hunt.

, Don’t just pay for a service and leave the rest up to the recipient. Handle details like times, locations and other considerations yourself based on your knowledge of the person and get everything worked out in advance. That way when the time comes, all they’ll have to do is show up or sit back and enjoy the experience.


Leave the selection of custom options and amenities up to the recipient so that they can get exactly what they want.
The general idea is to make your gift as hassle-free as possible so that it doesn’t just become something else that your recipient is responsible for getting done.

, Few things are more indulgent than a full day’s worth of pampering. With reservations at a luxury spa, your recipient will be able to enjoy a deep-tissue massage, manicure, pedicure, hairstyling or makeover in one convenient stop. Spa days make great gifts for both men and women.Spa days are perfect for busy mothers, brides-to-be and couples who don’t get to spend as much quality time together as they’d like.
You can usually book appointments online, meaning you can give a meaningful gift without even leaving the house.

, For the thrill-seekers in your life, look into adventurous recreation opportunities like a scuba diving session, zipline tour or guided rock climbing lesson. You could also rent a night or two at a secluded campsite in a beautiful patch of wilderness. These types of experiences make an exhilarating alternative to mundane, predictable gifts and are sure to stick with the person for a long, long time.Be sure that the person is physically prepared and up to the task before signing them up. Otherwise, they may feel pressured to do something they’re not comfortable with.

, Sometimes the best gifts are ones that check items off the to-do list. An oil change, tire realignment or new set of shocks can spare someone a lot of fretful planning while bestowing other benefits that will come in handy right away. Vehicles can be expensive and temperamental, so the less the recipient has to worry about constant upkeep, the better.


Vehicle-related gifts can be a big help to college students, graduates, newlyweds and other young people setting out on their own.
Make arrangements with a trustworthy garage nearby the recipient and pay for the gifted services ahead of time.

, If you get word that someone’s favorite band or performer is going to be in town, see if you can secure admission. Other productions that make great gifts include the local symphony orchestra, musicals, circuses or magic shows. Concerts and similar events are a lot of fun for people of all ages, and tend to be the kind of events that are talked about for years.You can wrap the tickets themselves as a gift, or forward the event confirmation via email as a surprise.
Consider picking up a pair of tickets so that the recipient will be able to bring a friend along.

, Looking for a gift that keeps on giving? Browse the internet for various subscription services that send out exclusive monthly packages to recipients. You can choose how long the subscription will last based on how much you’re looking to spend, and there are packages available for almost every lifestyle, hobby and interest imaginable.Packages are typically delivered during the first week of the month and contain an assortment of different goodies and one-of-a-kind specialty items.
Some popular subscription services include Birchbox, which specializes in women’s makeup and skincare products, Dollar Shave Club, which sends out a steady supply of razors and other masculine grooming supplies, and Loot Crate, which contains merchandise for gamers and pop culture aficionados.

, Purchase green cellophane and clear cellophane. Cut a row of very thin strips of each color and mix together. Use to line baskets, inside Easter nests and for decoration. This is also good for lining candy and chocolate boxes.


As with the cellophane, the colors can vary if preferred.

, Use green (apple) shoestring licorice to replicate Easter grass underneath chocolate bunnies, lamb or bunny cake displays, etc. Other long green candies local to your area could also be shaped into Easter grass for edible sweet displays.


For cupcakes, Easter grass could be as simple as dying shredded coconut green (or any other desired color) and added to the cupcake tops.







, If you're making a savory dish such as an aspic mold or a rice mold, and you want to add some Easter grass to the base, shredded lettuce can work really well to simulate Easter grass for such edible items.

, If you'd like your kids to learn how plants grow, plant some wheat, sprouts or grass in a shallow container and grow the grass. Grow direct into a basket or display container and make sure to plant the plants in time for plenty of growth by Easter weekend. After it has been used as a gift, the wheat or grass can be planted in the garden, while sprouts can be eaten.

, Plan out the pattern for placing the eggs around the wreath before you start gluing them on. The specific arrangement will be dependent on a few things:

Color scheme: You might like to arrange the eggs so that they're all certain colors, one color, a pattern of colors, etc.






Size: If you only have one size of artificial egg, this won't be an issue. However, if you've purchased big, medium and small eggs, you might like to create a cascading effect that has the egg arrangement descending from large eggs on the outside to smaller ones on the inside.






Placement of other Easter items: If you're also inserting other Easter decorative elements, plan these in now. They might be inserted in between the eggs, or stuck on top of them.







, Use the ribbon to make a loop for hanging. This now becomes the top of the wreath.

One eight-inch wreath
One ten-inch wreath;
, Take the two six-inch wreathes. Use your hands to squeeze them into diamond shapes. These will be your bunny ears on the wreaths. Wicker wreaths are not very strong, so you should be able to push them into the right shapes using your hands.Wicker wreaths do have pointy parts. It's a good idea to wear thick gloves while shaping your ears.

, Use floral wire to tie the eight-inch wreath and ten-inch wreath together. This will be the body of your bunny. Wrap the wire around both wreathes several times. Make sure the wreaths are securely together before proceeding., Use floral wire to tie your bunny ears on top of the eight-inch wreath. This is your bunny's head. Make several loops using the floral wire so your wreath is completely secure.How close together or far apart you want your ears is a matter of personal preference.

, Take your silk flowers. You want flowers with longer stems and smaller flowers. As this is an Easter wreath, pastel colors work best. Place your flowers over all four wicker wreathes and hot glue them onto the wreaths. This will give your bunny shape a pleasant spring-like appearance.You can use as many flowers as you want. How flowery your wreath is comes down to personal preference.

, Take a piece of ribbon and tie it into a bow. Hot glue the ribbon onto your wreath between the eight-inch and ten-inch wreath. This makes it look like your bunny is wearing a bow tie.You can use any color ribbon you want, but pastels match well with the season.

Make a nose with a plastic egg and pipe cleaner.",How to Make an Easter Bunny Wreath2," You need one wire hanger to make a bunny wreath. Use your hands to bend the hanger into a circular shape. Leave the hanger part of the wire untouched. Later, you will use this to hang up your wreath.Strive to get as round of a circle as possible. However, you will be covering your wreath in plastic bags. Parts that are slightly bent or crooked will not be noticeable as long as you have a roughly circular shape.

, Take a plastic sandwich bag without a Ziploc top. Poke your fingers through the bottom of the bag. Then, pull apart the bottom and stretch out the bag until you have a circle-shaped loop of plastic., Take the circular loop you made. Flatten it together into a single line. Then, tie it around the wreath using one knot. When you're done, there should be two looped semi-circles of plastic bag sticking out from either side of the knot., Make loops with more paper bags. Then, tie them to the hanger like you did with the first loop. Use as many plastic bags as necessary to cover the entire circle with looped knots. Push the loops together as you go so you have a very thick ring of plastic., Use a pair of scissors to cut open each loop surrounding your wreath. When you're done, the paper bags will create a fuzzy effect that resembles bunny fur. You should be left with a fuzzy, white circle., Use fuzzy bunny ears on a headband, which you can buy in most department stores and craft shops around easter. Cut off each ear with a pair of scissors. Then, hot glue them to the top of your circle. Place them on either side of the hanger coming out of the top of your wreath.You can glue the ears as close together or as far apart as you want. It comes down to personal preference.

, Take a plastic egg. Hot glue it on the bottom of the wreath, at roughly the opposite side of the hanger. Then, hot glue three pipe cleaners on each side of the egg.

You can choose solid colors or opt for patterns like polka dots. Cut your fabric into long three-inch wide strips. The precise size depends on the size of your wreathes. Bigger wreaths will require more fabric., Take two sawdust wreathes of the same size. Pin one end of your fabric strip onto one of your sawdust wreathes. Wrap the fabric as snuggly as possible around the wreath, moving across the wreath until you reach the end of your strip. When the ends of your strips are connecting, place one end on top of the other. Secure the strips with a pin.You may need to use more than one strip if necessary.
Overlap slightly as you wrap your fabric. This will prevent any sawdust from peaking through.

, Use your other color to wrap the second wreath in the same fashion. Remember to wrap the fabric snuggly and overlap it slightly with each loop. You do not want any sawdust to peak through., Take two hangers. Cut each hanger into two equal halves using a pair of wire cutters. Remove the loop on top of the hanger when you cut them in half. Discard the loop, as you do not need it for the project., Use a pair of scissors to cut the ends of each hanger into pointed tips. This will make them easier to insert in your wreathes., Using a pair of scissors, make four holes on one of your wreathes. You are making two holes for each ear, where you will insert your hangers. Leave about three inches between each ear. Each set of two holes should be about two and a half inches apart., Take your hangers. One at a time, fit them into both sets of two holes. You should be left with one wreath with two triangular bunny ears sticking out., Take your leftover fabric strips. Glue one end of the strip to hanger, near where it attaches to the wreathe. Wrap the strip around the entire hanger, overlapping slightly to cover any bare spots. When the whole ear is wrapped, glue the other end of the fabric strip down as well. Repeat with the other hanger.When you're done, you should have your bunny's head done. You should have one wreath with two colorful bunny ears.

, Use a ribbon to tie your two wreathes together. Tie the wreathes together tightly so your bunny wreath does not fall apart. Tie the ribbon into the bow for an attractive finish.You can use any color you want, but pastels may work best for spring.

Decide on your favorite decoration idea for the door.,
Make Easter wreaths.,
Make a paper decoration.,
Make a bird's nest front door decoration.,
Sew a door hanging.,
Make a tray decoration.,
Make a bunting.,
Make a basket decoration.,
Use fresh flowers.,
Crochet or knit a decoration.",How to Make an Easter Door Decoration," While a wreath is an obvious choice for a door decoration, there are quite a few other interesting possibilities too. Consider what would look best given the type of front door and entrance area that you have, the colors of your house décor and the items you have available. How elaborate or simple you make the decoration is entirely up to your own preferences. The following steps will suggest a range of different Easter door decoration ideas.;
, Starting with the most obvious door decoration, wreaths can bring a lovely festive atmosphere and can hang where your Christmas wreath would usually go. Some ideas for wreaths include:

An Easter egg wreath: Make a wreath with real or artificial eggs glued around it. For more details see How to make an Easter egg wreath.






An Easter bunny wreath: Make a wreath featuring a round of Easter bunny characters and perhaps with a ""Happy Easter"" message on it.






A bird wreath: Make a simple wreath from twigs shaped into a circle. Glue little eggs to the base of the wreath and a hanger at the top. Tie a ribbon bow and glue either under the assortment of eggs or at the top of the wreath.






Make an Easter chick wreath: Using a strong yellow cardboard wreath base, glue several even rows of small yellow fluffy chick toys around the wreath. You can either keep them one layer or cascade or build up the layers, depending on what works best. The more rows, the better. The end result is simply stunning.






Make a woven yarn wreath: Weave yarn around a 3D wreath in various different pastel colors to make a pastel rainbow wreath. Make small felt bunnies or chicks in very simplistic style that mirror the colors around the wreath. Attach by gluing to the base of the wreath. The animals look best if they're of different heights and sizes, and are put together in a muddled row in the base of the wreath's ring.






Make a cross wreath: Make a paper, fabric, crocheted, woven, decoupaged, etc. cross. Attach to the wreath. Place some flowers at the base and on the sides of the wreath. Affix a ribbon to the top of the wreath and hang on the door.







, If your front door (or whichever door you're decorating) is weather-proof, a paper decoration can be a lovely option.

Make a scrapbook Happy Easter sign. Use Easter colors, 3D lettering, glitter, ribbon bows, and other features to jazz it up. It can be in the shape of an egg, bunny or chick, or use the words ""Happy Easter"" themselves as the outline.






Cut out a rabbit or a chick on cardstock. Have your kids decorate it any which way they like. Stick a hole through the top of the paper decoration and thread a ribbon through. Attach to the door.







, Attach a bird's nest in one form or another to the front door instead of a wreath. Provided everything has been carefully stuck into the nest, this feature piece will remain solid on its side.

Consider gluing in some eggs, a chick or two and some feathers. Decorate with ribbon, glitter, buttons or similar items.






Attach with a ribbon, twine or raffia from the top of the nest.






Another method for attaching the bird's nest is to make a cross using long, thin twigs. Attach this to the door with some hangers, then attach the bird's nest to the twig cross. Use ribbon or twine to help keep the shape of the cross.







, Depending on your skills and interests, there are many ideas that you could sew as an Easter hanging. Here are just a few:

Sew a naive art bunny using calico. Make it large and add buttons and embroider features. You can also use fabric markers to add features.






Sew a naive art Easter chick in the same fashion.






Sew small Easter animals in felt. Then attach the animals to various lengths of ribbon and tie together at the top with a bow. A variation to this is to sew felt carrots and weave these into the design. Attach to the door in the center, from the top bow.







, Find an unwanted tray and decorate it with an Easter design. Use decoupage methods to attach cut-outs of bunnies, chicks, eggs and to place the letters for ""Happy Easter"" onto the tray. Attach a long ribbon to each side of the back of the tray, with plenty of height for hanging from the center of the ribbon.

, Bunting is a great way to cheer up a dull door space. Usually flags are used but for Easter, substitute the flags with felt or fabric bunnies, chicks and eggs and arrange these across the length of bunting ribbon or cord in an evenly spaced order. Make as many as you think would look good on the door––just be sure to check the measurements first. This method allows for lots of possible options, including:

All one color bunting or mixed colors






All one style of felt or fabric animal or mixed animals






All felt or fabric eggs or mix the eggs in with the fabric or felt animals.







, Find a suitably sized basket for hanging on the door. Fill it with eggs sitting on Easter grass and perhaps some Easter decorations. Affix a length of ribbon on the center of the basket handle and hang from the door.

, If adding the decoration on the day that you're receiving guests for an Easter meal, a floral arrangement can be very welcoming and pretty. Choose from flowers in your garden or flowers that are easily obtainable locally. Arrange into a bouquet, cascade or around a wreath and attach to the door on the day it is needed.

, If you enjoy crocheting or knitting, you might be able to make a design for Easter using these crafts. As seen in this image, a crocheted cross placed on a crocheted circle with daffodils in the center looks very effective and is an excellent reflection of the meaning of Easter.

, You don't want them to be huge, but make sure they're not tiny at the same time. This will be the bunny's fur so make sure you have enough!

, Make sure the whole plate is covered with the makeshift fur. Don't make the fur too thick otherwise you won't be able to add the rest of the facial features. Think of it as just a coating.

, Simply add a touch of glue to the back of the eyes and stick them onto the face.

, Like the eyes, just sick on a jewel button. Now your bunny can smell you!

, This is where you can get creative. Use the pipe cleaners to make all different shape, colour and size whiskers. Will they be curled at the ends or straight all the way across? Really, it's all up to you!

, If you like, you could hole punch a hole in the top of the paper plate and hang it up somewhere. Before you do this, make sure the glue is completely dry so nothing falls off.

, Also paint the top inside portion of the top terracotta pot. Let it dry (this doesn't take long). The picture shows the choice of a slightly off-white color instead of a bright white.

, You'll need two ears, two arms, and two feet. Be creative with the paper you choose. An off-white paper and pink and white polka dots are demonstrated here. Ink the edges of the paper with a pink ink pad to give it a softer look. Draw in any fingernails or 'toenails' on the bunny.

,,,, This step is optional If you proceed with it, first attach the ribbon around the 'neck' of the bunny (where the two pots meet). Then create the bow-tie, by cutting the ribbon on diagonals and gluing them together. Then attach the bow-tie on top of the ribbon.

Decide on your budget; this will help to narrow your choice from the overwhelming to the manageable.

,
Consider the occasion; do you want to give something they will cherish forever, or something fun that will make them laugh?

,
Think about the personality of the recipient.,
Think about the colours they choose to wear, the accessories they like.,
Think about their circumstances.,
If the gift is something they might continue to use in future, such as skincare products, try to find some that work well as a gift but are also affordable enough to buy again.,
Give a gift you can personalize.,
Does the recipient have a hobby or particular interest?,
Consider these options:


A memory box can make an original gift.",How to Find the Perfect Gift,",, Are they girly, elegant, flamboyant, quirky, eccentric, traditional? Do they like practical things they can use or would they appreciate something decorative?

, Do they like chunky jewellery, fun prints, understated, classic styles?

, Perhaps they have just moved to a new home that needs decorating, or they have a stressful job and would benefit from some pampering products?

, Expensive beauty products tend to get put in a drawer for special occasions because the recipient wouldn't necessarily treat themselves when buying something they use every day.

, A frame could hold a cherished photo or poem; a photo album could be filled with photos from a recent event. You could even put together a 'hamper' of gifts, for example if the recipient has just moved house, you could fill a box with relevant treats and useful products (in pretty packaging of course!).

, For example, if they like making jewelry, why not find them a book about it, and maybe include some pretty beads and jewelry making tools. If they like gardening, what about a trug full of things like gardening gloves, secateurs, gardener's hand cream and a book about plants? Or a specialist cookery class and apron for an aspiring chef?

, You can buy boxes with a glass or perspex cover which slides off, allowing you to cover the back with photos, poems, or artwork, and then accessories the interior with mementos relevant to the recipient or memories you share.
For milestone birthdays like 18 or 21, a photo album showing the stages of someone's life is an imaginative and thoughtful idea (and will require some work!), which can be kept forever.
For another milestone birthday idea, or indeed for a christening, why not fill a beautiful hand-painted box with gifts?
A fun idea for little children (or big ones!) is a treasure hunt which reveals progressively larger presents until the grand prize at the end! For this you can find all sorts of little gifts like pencils, hair clips or bath bombs for example.

Consider what the person is interested in besides Harry Potter.,
Browse some popular Harry Potter product sites.

,
You could also check eBay if you're looking for a rare product, or a cheaper price on a popular one.

,
If you like doing homemade gifts, you could make parchment (try staining the paper with tea) and create an acceptance letter.,
If your Potter fan is into models, you could get them a model of the Hogwarts Express (train), the Nimbus 2000, Nimbus 2001, or Firebolt (broomsticks), or even a model of the Hogwarts castle itself.

,
If you're looking for books like Harry Potter for your gift-recipient, you could try the Harry Potter author, J.K. Rowling's other books, which are 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them', 'Quidditch Through the Ages', and 'The Tales of Beedle the Bard'.",How to Find a Gift for a Harry Potter Fan," If they like clothes and fashion, you could buy a Hogwarts Robe set.

,, This is the fun part: embroider the details on your bunny in the colours of your choice. Don't forget the whiskers, the eyes, the nose and, if you'd like, the little teeth. If you can find a pompom or make your own, by all means sew it to the bunny's behind.

Find a space to work.,
Wrap your gifts on a table or desk.,
Get comfortable.,
Make sure you have enough light.,
Keep everything you need close at hand.,
Group important tools together.,
Stash different materials in separate containers.,
Use a gift wrapping organizer.,
Put paper and ribbons on a rack.,
Measure the paper carefully.,
Make precise cuts.,
Work in stages.,
Use gift bags.",How to Create a Christmas Wrapping Station," Reserve an unused part of the office, garage or guest room that you can convert to a dedicated gift-wrapping station. It doesn’t have to be elaborate—a corner or countertop will work just fine. Grab your wrapping supplies and lay them out in their new centralized location.Your wrapping station should be open, well-lit and out of the way so you’re not continually forced to move your supplies.
Hide gifts and other surprises when you’re not wrapping so they’re not sitting out in plain sight.;
, It might be a craft table with built-in drawers for storage, or you can use separate containers for your materials and work at the kitchen table. An elevated, flat surface will give you a solid base and help you keep track of everything. Set everything out on the desk or tabletop and section off an area to do your actual wrapping.Wrapping from the couch or on a carpeted floor is a surefire way to lose track of smaller items.

, Pull up a chair so you’ll have someplace to sit while you work. Depending on how many gifts you’ve bought, you might be wrapping for hours at a time, which can cause a lot of discomfort in your back and neck after a while. Hunching over on the floor or a squishy couch is definitely not the way to go.


If possible, do some of your wrapping standing up. It’s much better for your joints, posture and circulation.

, To achieve those precise cuts and perfect folds, it’s important that you be able to see everything clearly. Position your light source so that it’s directly over the work station. Give your eyes a break every now and then from the strain of focusing on one spot.Use an overhead light for the best top-down illumination.
Consider getting an adjustable standing lamp that you can bend and twist to suit your purposes.

, Take stock of your gifts, paper and utensils. Arrange each item in a sensible location and don’t move it out of its place. If necessary, establish designated zones for different materials so that you’ll always know where they are when you need them.If you’re right-handed, keep your pencil and scissors on the right side of your work space, paper and tape on the left, etc.

, You don’t want to have to hunt for a given item every time you put it down. Use a shower or over-the-door organizer rack to hold your scissors, tape, ruler, pencil and any other accessories you use for wrapping. Since you’ll be reaching for these materials the most, it only makes sense that they have their own headquarters.Be sure to stock up on refills of ribbon, tape and tags. You may even want to have a backup pair of scissors, just in case.
Try fitting these items into a single basket that you can keep on your tabletop.

, This one is obvious, but have a few individual boxes, bins or drawers to put your paper, ribbons, tags and tools in rather than one big one. Too many people try to keep everything in one container and then get frustrated when they’re forced to rummage through it to find what they’re looking for. Invest in a few plastic storage bins of various sizes and stick to them year after year. If you’re working at a desk or crafting table, take advantage of your drawer space.
Color-coordinate or label each container so you’ll instantly know what’s inside.

, Wrapping paper takes up a lot of space and can easily become torn or wrinkled if it’s left out. Keep your paper in pristine condition by storing it in a organizer box where it can lay flat and not come unrolled. Set the organizer up on your work surface and pull your materials straight from it.This product only costs a few dollars, but can be your best friend if you’re at your wits end trying to find a place for all of your supplies.
Organizer boxes usually also feature pockets for scissors, tape and other tools, allowing you to keep everything together.

, Another option is to buy or make a storage rack and slide rolls of paper and spools of ribbon onto the pegs. You can then pull, measure and cut the exact amount that you need without having to worry about handling the roll itself. A rack can be mounted directly to the wall to save even more room.You can easily rig up a wrapping paper rack at home yourself using a few wooden dowels and a set of hooks.
Arrange your paper and ribbons on the rack by color or pattern.

, An old handyman’s motto advises to “measure twice, cut once.” Take an extra second to gauge how much paper you’ll need, and only use as much as necessary to wrap your gifts. Generally, you should line up the item you're wrapping so that the paper is just long enough to overlap the sides when folded, and wide enough to cover the top, which is most often the broadest surface. You’ll end up with fewer scraps and less of headache that way.If you’re uncertain whether something will fit, do a quick mock-up by seeing how much you can cover with the paper before you cut it.
For gifts with unusual shapes, make strategic folds around the item's contours or cut a sheet of paper specifically to fit a certain form.Making careless mistakes can result in a lot of wasted paper.

, Avoid sloppy folds and rough, fringed edges. Get the angle and length of each cut right before you commit to it. Place a ruler or other long, straight object alongside where you plan on making a cut and then glide your scissors straight down the line.If the paper you’re using is especially thick or your scissors are less than sharp, cut the paper in small, even snips.

, If you have a lot of gifts to wrap, it may be advantageous to carry out the wrapping process in distinct phases. Get each item wrapped and taped, then move on and do all the bow-tying and tagging at once. Establishing a rhythm will help you get and stay in the zone.Wrap your gifts in sessions to preserve brainpower and ensure that each task gets done neatly.

, There’s no shame in opting for a gift bag over the traditional paper-and-bow approach. Not only is it quick and hassle-free, it’s also easier in a lot of cases to fit large or oddly-shaped gifts into a bag than attempt to wrap them. Just stick it in the bag, throw some tissue paper over the top to hide it and you’re all set!It takes about a quarter of the time to put a gift in a bag as it does to wrap it by hand.
If you’re pushed for time or buying something that’s an unusual size or shape, ask the vendor if they can gift wrap it for you.

"
Ask your dad well before the day what sort of gadgets, apps or other technical things he likes are currently being released.,
If you don't want to ask him, or your conversation doesn't really reveal many ideas, you'll need to focus directly on the techie things he already loves.,
Go beyond what dad normally has.,
Update dad's software or hardware.,
If your dad is a reader, check out techie books.,
Give dad some clothing that professes his techie fandom or geekiness.,
Don't be stuck in the mindset of buying something as the only solution.,
Consider the gift of apps.,
Give him a trip away.,
If you're a techie too, consider setting up an afternoon of techie tinkering together.",How to Find Gifts for Your Techie Dad," Ask him if he fancies any of them and why. Of course, act natural, as if this is just a conversation to get him to talk about his favorite pastime!


Take note of what he says. If it's not something likely to stick in your head, quickly write down the names of the things he's mentioned so that you can search for them later online or in stores.;
, Look at what your dad has by way of gadgets, apps, tools and resources. Notice where there are gaps or where things could do with updating. For example, maybe he loves iPods and downloading podcasts, music, etc. but he has an older iPod. You could invest in the latest iPod for him. Or perhaps he needs a case for it, or a groovy gadget for wrapping up the cord.

, If you're concerned that your dad already ""has it all covered"" in his techie interest, consider introducing him to other techie related things that he might enjoy but doesn't yet know much about. Some examples include:


A pen that is able to read and make a record of handwritten notes––this might be ideal for the dad who is techie and loves to travel, spend time outdoors, etc. and totes along a notebook.
A compact disc mixer, so dad can mix his music for fun. Or, give him a portable electronic keyboard so that he can modernize his music playing skills wherever he goes.
A portable light for his laptop, especially if he's always carting it around the house to find some peace!
A slimline travel charger for his iPod or phone that runs on a battery rather than electricity; great if your dad is out and about a lot or travels often.
A new game for his favorite gaming device.
Buy him some cloud computing space to upload his photos, files and other digital goodies.

, Is your dad old-fashioned techie, still playing Atari and using a version of Word you've never heard of? Explain to him that his loyalty to old times is admirable but that he's also missing out on a lot by not moving forward. Be careful though––old-fashioned techies love the way that old things were easily hacked, so the new item may be left gathering dust or it might just find itself inserted into the older technology!

, A book about his favorite techie toys, such as a biography on the inventor of the gadget, a swashbuckling tale featuring techie themes, an insider's guide to pulling apart his techie gadget, etc. Then there are the deeper books about where the internet is taking us as a species, what it means to set information free or to repress it, and so forth, to encourage some deep thinking for dad.

, Look for clothes with symbols, techie phrases or images that you know your dad will love. There are plenty of clothes available through online stores that feature techie or geek symbols, just do a quick online search. Or, consider making your own tee shirt design and printing it yourself.

, Techie dads are just as likely to love DIY hacks that can make his life easier. For example, if you resolve the mess of cords coming off his desk in his home office by coming up with a DIY solution, he'll love it. Here are just a few cool ideas for making your own hacks for dad's gift:



Use bulldog clips to tidy dad's cords under his desk.

Boost dad's wi fi using a beer can. This is great if he likes both beer and all things techie!

Make a multi-purpose hand tool for the dad who likes tinkering.

Turn an old TV into a fish tank. Your dad will be amazed and entertained.

Knit him an iPod cozy, sew him an iPod carrying case or build him a stand for his laptop or iPod. Or, make a laptop bag for him to carry his laptop in style.

Make a duct tape cellphone case for the dad who likes duct tape.

Bake him a cake in the shape of his favorite gadget. There are plenty of photos of cakes in the shapes of iPhones, iPods, computers, keyboards, etc. available online for you to be inspired by. Do a search using an image search engine or check out Pinterest and see what looks possible for your baking and decorating skills.

, If dad loves downloading apps, give him a gift card that covers this pastime to a certain amount. He'll be thrilled to be able to download apps without worrying about being frivolous; it's a gift, so he can try anything out!


You might even like to make suggestions for apps that dad can try out. Write or print these suggestions onto a card that accompanies the gift card. This is a nice way to show that you did more than just grab the card at the store.

, If you're looking for a really big gift, why not find a techie conference that you just know your dad would love to attend? You could cover the flight/travel costs, plus conference entrance and accommodation. Just be sure to check he'll be free for the dates and then make the arrangements. This is a gift sure to floor him.


This might need the help of a friend of your dad's who is willing to go with him or to help with details. Alternatively, consider accompanying him if the conference interests you too.

, Perhaps you could both reverse engineer a gadget that has been annoying you both for a while and see if you can fix it. Or maybe build something new and wonderful together, or at least start the plans for it. Giving dad time with you might be the most enjoyable gift of all.


If you're the organizing type, offer your digital spring cleaning services to dad. Explain to him and show him how to better manage his emails, files and folders and all the digital goodies he is amassing on his computer, cellphone and other electronic devices. If you've always been known as the tidy one in your family, dad will relish this opportunity!

Give him a practical gift.,
Give him something he's mentioned in passing.,
Give him a gadget.,
Ask his family and friends for ideas.,
Say something surprising.,
Surprise him an experience instead of an object.,
Make him something.",How to Come Up with Unique Gift Ideas for Your Boyfriend," Most guys are more practical than they are frivolous. Give your man something that he can use.Tools are always a great gift. When you are a guy, there is no such thing as too many hammers or screwdrivers. If there's a specialty tool that you know he needs, special order it and watch his eyes light up. Or try something really cool like this Estwing 15-Ounce Ultra Hammer or this Hitachi Cordless Nailer.Gloves, wallets, sunglasses, or a nice watch are all gifts that are not only practical, but are items that he would be able to use on a daily basis.If you want him to think of you, give him something that reminds him of you every time he puts it on!
Or give him something unique like a beer making kit or beard wipesthat he didn’t know he could use but can’t keep living without!;
, Think about things he points out when you're out together. This will let him know that you really pay attention to the things he likes.


If he loves having a clean car, buy him a gift certificate from the best local car care center.
If he daydreams about going fishing, a membership to a sportsman's club or a chartered day-long fishing trip would be ideal.

, Men love gadgets! Find something zany and unusual that he didn't even know he needed, like a USB Mini-Fridge or a Swiss Army Knife iPhone case., He may have mentioned a city he would like to visit or a restaurant he's always wanted to try to his sister or his roommate.They might be able to offer ideas you haven't even thought of, and he will be surprised that you took the initiative to do a little research.

, While giving a gift is an action, it also helps to see the gift as something that communicates to your boyfriend exactly how you feel about him. If your boyfriend is artistically inclined, a paint set can say, ""I really admire your creativity.""
Rock climbing accessories might say, “I like your sense of adventure.”
Sexy boxers could say, well, you get the idea.Be careful. The gift might accidentally “say” something negative as well. Personal grooming kits might imply a message like ""I wish you would do a little man-scaping,"" and he might think a gym membership says, “You need to work out more,” when you didn’t mean those things at all.

, While a racecar video game is a nice gift, what about an afternoon at a racetrack, or even better, driving lessons at a speedway? An experience gives him something he enjoys and creates great memories that will last longer than any video game ever would.


A new set of beer glasses might be nice, but go a little further and plan a trip a local brewery to not only buy his favorite beer, but to see it made!
Tickets to see his favorite band, sports team, or comedian would be a great gift not only to open, but to look forward to!
A weekend away to go golfing, camping, hiking, or fishing are all great gifts that he could enjoy alone, with a friend, or together with you., If you give your boyfriend something one-of-a-kind that you spent time and effort on, he will know just how special you think he is.


Surprise him with a jar full of handwritten love notes, a collection of his favorite candies, a hand-knitted hat, a photo book full of pictures of the two of you, or special date coupons are just a few ideas that he would love.Don’t forget that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach! Nothing says I love you like a homemade cake or a couple dozen of his favorite cookies."

Consider who was invited to the celebration.,
Reflect on your relationship with the host.,
Consider giving money in multiples of “chai.” The Hebrew letters for the word “chai,” which means life, are equal to 18.,
Give a Jewish-themed gift.,
Consider giving a practical gift.,
Remember that the party is the real gift for the child.,
Ask the child’s parents about their interests.,
Buy something related to a hobby or interest of the child.,
Give the bar or bat mitzvah something with a story or lesson behind it.",How to Choose an Appropriate Bar or Bat Mitzvah Gift," Maybe your entire family has a relationship with the bar or bat mitzvah, and you are all attending the party. In this case, you may want to bring a bigger gift than if only one person was invited. In other words, bring a gift that is worthy and large enough to be from everyone that was invited to the party.If your entire family was invited, that also means the hosts are paying more for everyone to be there. Keep that in mind! A gift is a way to say “thank you” for a great event.;
, If you have known the bar or bat mitzvah since they were a baby and have watched them transition from child to adult, you may want to give a bigger gift than if you only know them a little bit. “Bigger” can mean anything from more expensive to more heartfelt. You would probably give your very best friend a better gift than you’d give a casual classmate or acquaintance, and this is no different.Regardless if you spend $100 or $10, it’s the thought that counts. You are helping to celebrate their transition into adulthood, and that day will be incredibly special for them whether you shell out a lot of money or not.

, Because of this, 18 is a significant and special number in the Jewish tradition. Often times, guests will give the bar or bat mitzvah money in some increment of 18— $18, $36, $54, $72, and so on! If you’d like, you can give cash, check or a gift card in a multiple of chai.You’re certainly not obligated to give in increments of 18. If you want to give a pre-loaded gift card in another amount, do it! If you’d rather give them a $50 bill, that works too. Any and all gifts will be appreciated.

, Jewish jewelry is a common gift for bar or bat mitzvahs. You can find pieces with “chai” or the Jewish star on it, and you can search in your price range.There are several websites that specialize in Jewish gifts, so you can search around to find a gift that you think the recipient would love. Just keep in mind that they will be receiving a lot of stuff at their party, so don’t bombard them with trinkets just for the sake of it!Find something you truly think they’d like, or opt for money instead.


Many times, friends of different faiths may not feel comfortable giving a Jewish gift, simply because they’re unfamiliar with the traditions and customs. Your gift doesn’t have to be faith-related at all.

, A gift card to purchase a video game may be a fun gift, but something related to academics may be more practical for their future. Many times guests will contribute money for a college fund or other academic endeavor. You can also give money or items that can be used for travel, which makes for an invaluable learning experience for the child., It may not seem normal to give a child an ultra-practical gift or money for far-off college tuition bills. However, the bar or bat mitzvah celebration is the child’s ultimate gift after years of preparation. They are the center of attention amongst all their friends and family, and your support is a present in itself. This Jewish tradition marks the beginning of the bar or bat mitzvah’s adult life, and money and practical gifts are ways to start them off on the right foot., If you’re completely stumped about what to get the bar or bat mitzvah, consider asking their parents.That way, you can still surprise the guest of honor while ensuring that you’re giving them something they would truly like. Consider asking for gift ideas when you send or call in your RSVP.


This can also be helpful to make sure that the child doesn’t get dozens of the exact same thing.

, Whether they’re into athletics, drama, stamp collecting, or animals, get them something that shows you’ve taken note of their passions. If they’re an avid sports fan, maybe you could get them a jersey from their favorite team. If they’re a fashionista, consider getting them a gift card to their favorite boutique. Remember, this is a religious celebration but it is still their birthday. Get them anything you think they’d enjoy!

, This is the first day of their adult life, and you can use your gift as a way to impart some adult wisdom. Consider giving them something that has been significant in your own life. Do you have a favorite book that had a big impact on you? Give them a copy, with a letter explaining why you chose it and what it meant to you. Maybe you have a favorite Jewish recipe, and you could provide them with the recipe and cookware.


By giving the child a meaningful gift, you are also showing them that they are growing up, and you recognize that!

Think about making a present, as opposed to buying one.,
Make a list of their likes, interests, hobbies, etc.,
Always try to personalize the gift to your friend.,
Give an experience as a gift.,
Consider giving a pack of small things.","How to Choose, Wrap and Present a Gift1"," This adds a personal touch, and means you can customize the gift as you see fit. Some ideas for homemade gifts include:

If you can knit, try making:



 


A small drawstring bag, which is often an excellent opportunity to show off all your knitting skills.
A blanket. This is especially good as a gift for a new mother, as the blanket will be smaller and therefore take less time to complete.
A jumper, hat, gloves, etc. Again, these are good for a new baby.


If you are good at cooking/baking, try making:






A delicious, personalized cake.
Some cupcakes/muffins. Be original in how you add embellishments and arrange them.
A delicious meal, maybe one that your friend especially enjoys. The container could also be a gift in itself (for instance, a nice china dish).

;
, Even if they seem irrelevant. Then match up a present to each one, and choose one or more to give to your friend. Here are some examples:


If your friend likes scrapbooking, you could get:

Scrapbooking supplies.
A voucher to a scrapbook supplies shop.
A book about scrapbooking.


If they enjoy knitting, you could get:

Some novelty wool. (e.g. Alpaca, glitter, fuzzy, etc.)
A book of knitting patterns.
Some knitting supplies. Think past needles and yarn - maybe bobbins, stitch markers, novelty needles, circular needles, etc.


If they enjoy cooking, you could get:

Some cooking equipment. For instance, a wok, a BBQ, some embellished skewers for kebabs, etc. You could get something normal, then decorate it with a glue gun and some embellishments. Make sure it's still safe to use!
A recipe book.
An empty cooking-themed notebook for recipes, notes, etc.



, Even if it's a perfectly normal stamp album, you could decorate the cover, then put in some interesting stamps, maybe from your friend's home country.

, Maybe an all-expenses paid trip to the spa, a voucher for a free stay at an organic farm B&B for your environmental friend, etc. Use your imagination!

, For instance, if they like the spa, a basket filled with a pumice stone, organic soap, bubble bath, etc. For a back-to-school gift, try a pencil-case, filled with supplies such as pens, pencils, and maybe a calculator.

"
"
Think beyond wrapping paper.,
Try to make the wrapping a gift in itself.,
Add little embellishments.","How to Choose, Wrap and Present a Gift2"," Consider using a bag, an envelope, a box, or something else. Be creative!

, For instance, put a swimming costume in a beach bag, or wrap it in a towel. Put stationery supplies inside a pencil-case. Put knitted baby booties inside a knitted drawstring bag. Put a jewelry set inside it's own box to keep it together and untangled.

, For instance, tie it all together with a colourful ribbon, add some stickers, spritz it with some glitter spray, stick on an artificial flower, or add some sequins.

"
"
Maybe make a card yourself.,
Write something other than the usual ""Dear _______, Happy Birthday, love ________.""","How to Choose, Wrap and Present a Gift3"," You can get a card blank, then decorate it with stencils, cut-outs, photos, etc.

, Consider writing a poem, limerick, couplet or quote.

"
Give it to the receiver personally if possible.,
Say something.,
Maybe give your friend a hug.

","How to Choose, Wrap and Present a Gift4"," If you can't, make sure it is clear that the present is from you.

Assemble the supplies needed.,
Measure the head of the person wearing the bunny ears.,
Trace out two rabbit's ears onto the white cardboard.,
Use these to trace onto the cardboard box.,
Glue the ears to the cardboard box card.,
Either glue or staple the ears to the band approximately 5 inches away from each other.",How to Make a Bunny Ears Hat," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"".;
, Cut a strip of the white cardboard that measures the circumference of the head. Width-wise, the band should be about 5cm in height.

, Cut the ear shapes out.

, Cut out a second set of ears.


If desired, use pink markers to create an inner ear area and color it in completely pink. This step is optional but adds dimension to the ears.







, This will strengthen them in the wind and as the wearer walks about.

, Glue or staple the band into a circle that slips easily onto the head of the wearer but isn't too loose. It's now ready to wear.

"
Line the bottom of your container or basket with a scrap of burlap, or another loosely woven type of fabric.,
Add outdoor potting soil to about one inch below the rim of the container.

,
Sprinkle an even, uniform layer of grass seed over the top of the soil.

,
Sprinkle a thin layer of soil over the grass seed, covering the seeds no more than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).

,
Very gently, pat down the cover layer of soil.

,
Using a spray bottle, saturate the soil with water.,
Lightly cover the container with white cheesecloth (white gauze, a flour sack towel, etc.),
Place your planted container in a sunny spot outdoors.,
Lift the cloth covering daily and thoroughly water the soil with a squirt bottle.,
You should start to see sprouts in about 10 days.,
Keep the soil moist, not wet.

,
As the grass begins to mature and thicken, pinch out any stalks that appear unhealthy to encourage new shoots of healthier grass to come up.

",How to Grow a Spring or Easter Basket," Note: If you are using a real basket, line the sides of the basket too. (See tips for container and fabric selections.);
,,,,, Allow the water to seep down over the grass seed. (Water should not be floating on the top.)

, Secure the cloth covering to the container with clothespins, a sturdy rubber band, a length of twine, or any type of fastener that can easily be removed during re-watering. (The cloth covering will allow sunlight to encourage your grass to sprout, but prevent birds from snacking on your grass seed.)

, Choose a location where pets cannot gain access to it.

, Allow the water to saturate the soil; water should not be floating on the top.

, Keep the basket covered until the grass has reached a height of about an inch and a half to two inches.

Go with dog toys.,
Spring for a subscription service.,
Get them a harness for walks.,
Buy them a new bed.,
Dress them for the weather.",How to Choose Gifts for New Dog Owners1," Dogs love to play with stuffed toys. Keep them engaged by choosing one with a squeaky center that squeals whenever they chomp down on it. Or, give the owner a break from all the noise and pick a simple plush, silent toy. Or, make them both happy and get both types: one for daytime, one for nighttime.Dog toys are made from a variety of materials, some of which stand up to constant chewing and tugging much longer than others.
Stuffed toys may last the shortest. For a longer-lasting gift, go with toys made of rope, rubber, or EVA foam (ethylene vinyl acetate).;
, Some dogs love every treat or toy tossed their way, while others can be pretty picky about what they find tasty or fun. Either way, consider signing the owner up for a subscription service that will deliver a new batch of different toys and snacks to sample every month or quarter. Such services include:


Barkbox
Petbox
Pawpack

, If the owner is attaching the leash directly to the dog’s collar, give them both a break by treating them to a harness to use instead. These slip over the dog’s head and fit around their shoulders, with another tie that goes over their chest, behind their front legs, and then clips into place on the other side to secure it to the dog. These are great because:They eliminate the risk of choking when the dog pulls too hard on the leash. Choking is obviously stressful, which can make training and walking more difficult.
The leash can be attached to their chest instead. This way you can redirect their attention toward you when needed with a gentle, stress-free tug.
Some designs also allow you to clip the leash to its back in case your dog has very short legs, which might cause them to trip over the leash when its attached to their chest.

, New dog owners have lots of different things to buy when bringing home a new dog, and so they may opt for the cheapest option when it comes to the dog’s bed. If so, treat the dog to a higher-end model, since bargain-basement beds are more likely to wear out and grow less comfortable, especially for older dogs with joint issues. Higher-end brands include:Big Barker
Big Shrimpy
Bowsers
PLAY (Pet Lifestyles and You), Depending on the climate and the season, the dog may need to suit up before braving the outdoors. Stock their wardrobe with sweaters, jackets, and waterproof raincoats to keep them warm and dry in the cold, snow, and rain. Buy a pack of rubber booties to keep their paws dry, too, while protecting them from rock salt at the same time, which can sting them pretty bad.In hotter climates or seasons, springing for a free session at the dog groomers could be an excellent alternative if the dog’s fur grows continually instead of shedding on its own. Such breeds include poodles, shih tzus, and terriers.
Reflective jackets are a great idea if the dog goes for lots of walks at night, regardless of the season, especially if their coloring is black or very dark. "

Assemble the supplies needed.,
Choose which method to obtain the eggshell.,
Prepare the soil or potting soil.,
Position each eggshell in the egg carton.,
Add the wet soil to each eggshell, to about three quarters of the way up.,
Place the wheat or grass seeds across the surface of this soil, so that you can't see the soil underneath.,
Finish off with another layer of wet soil but only enough to just cover the seeds.

,
Start growing.,
Depending on when you're using them and when you started growing them, the grass might need to be trimmed now and then.

,
Place on display for Easter.,
Plant in the garden or a large container after use.",How to Grow Your Own Easter Grass1," You'll find these listed below under ""Things You'll Need"".;
, Removing the raw egg from the eggshell is probably easier than removing a whole boiled egg. The important thing is to have most of the eggshell intact, about three quarters of it as there needs to be plenty of soil for good growth.


Rinse out the eggshells and allow to dry before proceeding.







, Pour some into a large mixing bowl or bucket. Add water to make the soil wet.

, This will keep them snugly in place as you work with them.

, It helps to use a teaspoon to transfer the soil from the bowl to the eggshell.

, It's important to pack them in because you want a very tight bunch of grass growing up, so that it mimics grass growth outdoors.

,, Position the egg carton with its precious contents in a warm and sunny spot, such as the windowsill. Water as needed using a spray bottle.

,, The eggs can be removed from the carton and placed into egg cups or other holders for display alongside other Easter decorations. Or, if you'd like, simply leave the egg carton filled with Easter grass and turn the whole carton into an Easter grass decoration.

, You can continue growing the grass if wished; simply place the entire eggshell and its contents into the new home. The eggshell will disintegrate and its nutrients will nourish the surrounding soil.

Arm them with lots of treats.,
Buy seat covers for the house.,
Outfit their car, too.,
Think beyond essentials.",How to Choose Gifts for New Dog Owners2," Whether they’ve brought home a puppy, a rescue with behavioral issues, or even a well-behaved dog learning to respond to a new name, the new owner is likely to burn through lots and lots of treats while training them. So help them out by stocking them up. Give them both low-value and high-value treats that the dog will be excited to work for.


Kibble and small amounts of regular canned dog food (low-value treats) are perfectly fine for basic training, like “sit,” “down,” and “come.”High-value treats, like fresh meat, cheese, peanut butter, or high-quality packaged doggie treats from the store are great rewards for exceptionally good behavior and/or stressful situations, like visits to the vet and cleaner.
Dogs can sometimes be picky about what they like. Offer a variety so the owner can figure out which ones they respond to the most, as well as identifying any ingredients to steer clear of if the dog has an allergic reaction.

, Whether the dog sheds a lot or likes to dig through the couch cushions, they can easily dirty up or even destroy furniture. Spare the owner the inconvenience of having to constantly clean or even replace couches and armchairs. Buy them some machine-washable slipcovers to pull over their seating, which can then be easily removed whenever they need cleaning. Brands offering pet-specific seat covers include:Elegant Comfort
Leader Accessories
Sofa Shield
Sure Fit

, If the owner likes to take the dog on day trips to the park or anywhere else they’re likely to get dirty, get them a machine-washable car seat cover. Ensure a quick cleanup whenever the dog tracks mud into the car or gets car-sick. Buy a hammock-style cover, which can either be hung between the headrests to the front and back seats to form a hammock, or simply hung from the back seat’s headrests and tucked in between the cushions like a regular seat cover. Other gifts for the car could be:A seat belt tether and harness, which will keep the dog in the back seat and out of the driver’s way.
Either a water bottle with a specially-designed cap that doubles as a water bowl, or a regular water bottle and a collapsible water dish.A dog-friendly tick and flea spray to keep handy for impromptu romps through the woods.

, If the owner appears to be all set with the basics and doesn’t need any items to care for the dog, don’t worry. Celebrate the new addition in their life with gifts that tie in the doggy theme without being directly related to dog-caring. These could be:


Shirts, jewelry, bags, or other accessories with dog-themed graphics or messages.A donation in the owner’s name to their favorite animal shelter or service animal organization.
A session with a professional photographer specializing in pets.
A gift card to a pet store for future expenses.

Customize a dog tag.,
Microchip the dog.,
Buy a GPS tracker.,
Get them a doggy cam.",How to Choose Gifts for New Dog Owners3," There’s a good chance the owner has already picked up a dog collar, but even if so, check to see if they also got a dog tag. If not, choose between creating a tag with the dog’s information (which can then be attached to the existing collar), or ordering a customized collar (where the tag is part of the collar itself). This is a good idea even if the dog already has a tag with its name and the owner’s phone number, but lacks other crucial info.In addition to the name and phone number, dog tags should indicate any special needs the dog may have, such as “NEEDS MEDS DAILY” or “BLIND & DEAF.” Including such information could help the owner breathe a little easier in the event that the dog gets loose.
People change phone numbers, too, and may forget to update the dog’s tags to reflect this.
Dog tags can be created at many pet stores. Customized collars can be ordered online.

, If the owner hasn’t done this already, offer to pay for having the dog microchipped as a backup to the dog’s tags in case it gets lost and loses it collar. This involves the owner taking it to a vet or animal shelter and having them implant a microchip just below its skin. Then they fill in the corresponding paperwork regarding the pet’s name and special needs, as well as the owner’s contact info. Once completed, this is then submitted to the microchip company’s registry, along with the designated fee.Once the dog is microchipped and registered, other vets and animal shelters can scan the chip to find out who the owner is and how to get in touch with them.
Some companies may only charge an initiation fee. Others may charge a renewal fee to keep the dog registered from year to year.

, If the owner lets their dog run around off-leash, or if the dog has a flair for escaping, help the owner keep tabs on it even when it’s out of sight. Purchase a collar with a GPS tracker built inside. Enable the owner to locate it through a corresponding app on their smartphone., Unless the owner stays at home most of the time and/or brings the dog wherever they go, enable them to keep an eye on things even when they’re out of the house. Decide between a variety of cameras that will allow them to keep tabs on what the dog is up to. Options include:One-way cameras like Nest Cam, which allow you to watch over the dog from a smartphone or other device.
Interactive devices like PetChatz, whose app allows you to calm anxious dogs from afar by emitting calming scents, releasing dog treats, or even interacting with the dog through a video display.
Dog’s-eye cameras, which can be attached to their collar and played back later."

Assemble the supplies needed.,
Pour the potting soil or soil into a large bowl or bucket.,
Fill the container three quarters of the way full with the wet soil.

,
Place a layer of wheat or grass seeds across the container, packed in tightly so that you can't see the soil underneath.,
Cover lightly with some more soil and pat into place.

,
Place in a warm, sunny position, such as the windowsill.,
Keep trimmed as needed.,
Use in displays or Easter baskets.",How to Grow Your Own Easter Grass2," You'll find these listed below under ""Things You'll Need"". In selecting a container, choose one that will look pretty or relevant to your Easter display. You might use a hollow rabbit shaped container, or a plain container that can be decorated in Easter patterns and colors. Or, choose one such as a plastic berry container that can be placed easily into the base of an Easter basket rather than going on display.


If you want to be able to grow the grass direct in an Easter basket, line the basket with something waterproof such as plastic wrap, a plastic bag or cellophane. This will prevent the water from leaching into the basket and the soil from going everywhere.







, Pour in enough water to wet and mix through.

,, You will probably need a lot more than you'd need for an eggshell container, depending on the size of the container chosen. Again, the reason for packing in the seeds is to ensure luxuriant growth.

,, Keep an eye on the need for additional water; use a spray bottle. The sprouts should shoot up within a few days, sometimes even in a day.

, The wheat or grass will grown to a good length within 4 to 5 days.

, If using in an Easter basket, it's a good idea to place something like wax paper or a waterproof sheet like the ones found in some Styrofoam meat trays, to protect the base of the basket from any wetness seeping out.

Prepare the eggs.,
Mix the dye.,
Apply a sticker to the egg.,
Place the egg into the dye bath.,
Take the egg out and let it dry.,
Peel off the sticker.",How to Dye Silhouettes Onto Easter Eggs1," You can use hard boiled or hallow/blown-out eggs for this method. If you will be using hallow/blown-out eggs, be sure to cover the holes with some speckling or paper clay. White eggs will give you the best results, but you can use brown eggs for a more interesting effect.
, Pour 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of water into a cup. Add 1 teaspoon of food coloring and 10 to 20 drops of food coloring. Stir everything together with a spoon.Make sure that the dye is deep enough to submerge the egg in.

Try mixing food coloring colors for a more unique shade.
You can use a store-bought egg dyeing kit instead. Prepare the dye according to the instructions on the package.

, Choose a sticker with a well-defined shape. Press the sticker against the egg and run your finger nail across it, focusing on the edges. This will seal the sticker and keep any dye from creeping underneath it.Round or blob-shaped stickers are not recommended because they don't give good silhouettes.
You can make your own sticker buy cutting shapes out of adhesive vinyl., Leave the egg there for 2 to 5 minutes. The longer you leave the egg, the darker the shade will be.If you are using a hallow egg, you will need to hold it down so that it doesn't float., Use a wire egg holder or a pair of tongs to lift the egg out of the dye bath. Hold it over the cup and let any excess dye drip down, then set it aside so that it can dry., Once the egg is dry, carefully peel away the sticker. This will reveal the white (or brown) silhouette underneath. Discard the sticker when you are done."

Prepare your eggs.,
Cut up a pair of pantyhose into squares.,
Place a small flower or leaf onto the egg.,
Secure a pantyhose square around the egg.,
Prepare your dye bath.,
Strain the dye bath, then let it cool.,
Add some vinegar into the dye bath.,
Dye the eggs.,
Take the eggs out and unwrap them.,
Pat the eggs dry with a towel.",How to Dye Silhouettes Onto Easter Eggs2," Hard boiled eggs will work best for this, but you can use hallow or blown-out eggs as well. If you decide to use hallow or blown-out eggs, be sure to cover the holes with speckling or paper clay. White eggs will give you the best results, but brown eggs will also look nice.

The amount of dye in this method is enough for 12 eggs.

, You need the squares to be big enough to wrap around your egg. You should be able to get several squares from one pair of pantyhose.

You can use old pantyhose, but make sure that there are no holes or runs.

, Ferns, smooth leaves, parsley, and small flowers work especially well for this. Avoid anything too textured, however, as it won't give you a good silhouette., Place a pantyhose square over the flower side of the egg. Wrap it tightly around the back of the egg, then secure it with a piece of string. The pantyhose must be snug, or the silhouette won't turn out right.If you don't have any string, you can use a twist tie or small rubber band instead.

, Fill a medium-sized saucepan with 4 cups (1 liter) of water. Add your desired vegetable/spice into the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium to medium-high heat, then reduce it to low. Let it simmer, covered, for 15 to 30 minutes. The dye is ready when it's just a little darker than you want it to be. Listed below are the color options:Red: 4 cups (600 grams) chopped or shredded beets. It will be more pinkish on white eggs.
Orange: Skins from 12 yellow onions on white eggs.
Yellow: use 8 tablespoons (72 grams) of ground turmeric on white eggs.
Green: use 4 cups (400 grams) purple cabbage on brown eggs
Blue: use 4 cups (400 grams) purple cabbage on white eggs
Red-brown: Skins from 12 red onions. It will be darker on brown eggs.

, Place a strainer over a deep glass or ceramic dish. Pour the dye into the dish through the strainer. Discard the onion skins, and let the mixture cool. Anything below 160°F (72°C) is fine. This will keep the eggs from continuing to cook.This is only necessary for hard boiled eggs. If you used hallow or blown-out eggs, you don't have to let the dye bath cool.

, You will need 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of vinegar for each cup (240 milliliters) of strained liquid. This will help the dye stick better to the eggs. Since each vegetable soaks up a different amount of water, it would be a good idea to measure your dye first., Place the eggs into the dye. Make sure that the eggs are submerged. If you need to, add a little more water to the dye bath. Let the eggs soak for 30 to 60 minutes. The longer you leave them there, the darker they will be.If you are using hallow eggs, you will need to place something over them to weigh them down. If they float, they won't dye evenly.

, Use a slotted spoon or a pair of tons to carefully lift the eggs out of the dye bath. Set them down on a towel, then cut the strings and carefully pull off the pantyhose. Peel the flower away and discard it., If you are more patient, you can simply set them out and let them air dry on their own. Once the eggs are dry, you can tuck them into your Easter basket or put them on display."

Hard boil some eggs.,
Wrap rubber bands around the egg.,
Prepare your dye.,
Dye the egg.,
Let the egg dry.,
Remove the rubber bands.,
Dye the egg again, if desired.",How to Dye Striped Easter Eggs1," Because you will be wrapping rubber bands around the egg, hollow or blown-out eggs are not recommended for this method. Let the eggs cool completely before moving on to the next step.
, You can use thin rubber bands, thick ones, or a combination of both. Wrap them firmly around the egg so that they don't fall off, but not so firmly that they break the shell.You can wrap as many or as few rubber bands as you'd like. The more you use, the more stripes your egg will have.
Wrap some rubber bands vertically around the egg for a different look.

, Pour ½ cup (120 milliliters) of boiling water into a small cup. Stir in 1 teaspoon of vinegar and 10 to 20 drops of food coloring. The more food coloring you use, the more vibrant your egg will be.The cup needs to be small enough so that the egg will be submerged under the dye.

, Carefully set the egg into the dye bath. Make sure that it is completely submerged. Leave it there for up to 5 minutes.The longer you leave the egg in the dye bath, the darker the final color will be., Pull the egg out using a wire egg holder or a pair of tongs. Set the egg down onto a paper towel, egg holder, or egg carton, and let it dry completely., As you remove the rubber bands, you will start to see white stripes all over your egg. Discard the rubber bands, or save them for another project., This will alter the overall color of the egg as well as make the stripes colored. You can even wrap more rubber bands around the egg beforehand for more, differently-colored stripes. Remember to let the egg dry completely before removing the rubber bands.If you wrapped the rubber bands horizontally before, try wrapping them vertically this time.
Dye is translucent, so keep the base color of the egg in mind. Some colors create brown when you mix them together.

Peel the tape off.,
Dye the egg again, if desired.",How to Dye Striped Easter Eggs2," This method will work best with hard boiled eggs, but you can use hallow or blown-out eggs as well. If you choose to use hallow or blown-out eggs, however, be sure to cover the holes with speckling or paper clay., You can use strips of tape as they are, or cut them lengthwise to create thinner stripes.Run your fingernail over the edges of the tape to seal it down, otherwise, the dye will creep underneath., Stir together ½ cup (120 milliliters) of boiling water, 1 teaspoon of vinegar, and 10 to 20 drops of food coloring. Pour it into a cup small enough to completely submerge an egg in., Carefully set the egg into the dye. If it is a hallow egg, you will need to hold it down. Leave the egg in the dye for up to 5 minutes. The longer you leave the egg in the dye, the darker it will become., Use a wire egg holder or a pair of tongs to pull the egg out of the dye. Set the egg down some place where it won't roll over, and leave it there until it dries., The egg under the tape will still be white.Discard the tape once you have it off., This will change the stripes from white to colored. Keep in mind that this will also change the overall color of the egg as well. Dye is translucent, so it will mix with whatever color you dyed the egg first. Not all colors look good when mixed together.

Remember to let the egg dry if you re-dye it.

You should also avoid gifts that could come across as offensive to the pet lover in your life, such as products that make unreasonable claims about cleaning up unpleasant odors or with regards to their ability to cure or train a pet. Ask the owner of your local pet store about the durability and appropriateness of the gifts you are considering:


“Is this gift appropriate for someone with a dog that is very hard to train?”
“Is this gift durable or do you think it will break down within the first few months?”
“Do you think this gift would come across well or do you think they might find it offensive?”

Switch colors to make your design more interesting.,
Secure the ends of the threads with glue, then trim them.,
Display the egg with the hole on the back.",How to Embroider an Easter Egg Design1," Try to get a farm-raised egg, if you can. It will have a thicker shell, so it will be less-likely to shatter. You can use a white egg or a brown on, depending on your design., You will be slicing the egg open with a dremel later on. The dust from the egg shell will get into the yolk and make it inedible. If you want to save the yolk, blow the egg out now. You will get an extra hole at the top and bottom of your egg, but you can cover them up later on., Hold the egg over a sink or bowl, then place the tool perpendicular to the side of the egg. Use the tool to slice off a sliver from the side of the egg.Don't cut the hole on the top or bottom of the egg.
If you left the yolk in, watch out for splatters.

, If you chose not to blow out the yolk earlier, you will have to discard it. This is because the previous step would have gotten egg shell dust into the yolk., Be careful so as not to crush the shell. Don't worry if the edges on the hole look jagged. This will be the back of the egg, and you'll get better with more practice., Simple patterns, such as cross-stitch, dashed lines, and zigzags work best. Make dots wherever the lines end, or wherever you'd push the needle through the fabric., The holes need to be large enough for an embroidery needle and floss to fit through. Again, only drill the holes where you'd push the needle through the fabric.Go slowly and carefully; the curved surface of the egg ill make this step tricky.

, This will remove any dust and pencil marks.If you don't have any white vinegar, you can try soap and water or even a piece of bread!, If you blew out your egg earlier, or if you made too many holes, you can cover them up at this point with spackling or paper clay. Smooth the spackling/clay over the hole and let it dry. Buff away any roughness with a damp cloth or fine-grit sandpaper.This only works with white eggs. If you used brown eggs, you could try painting the spackling/clay to match the color.

, Cut a length of embroidery thread. Pull it apart so that you have groups of 2 to 3 strands. Thread one of these groups through your embroidery needle., After you knot the end of the thread, puh the needle through one of the holes, starting from the inside of the egg. Begin sewing on the egg using cross-stitches or simple straight stitches., Finish your first color with the needle inside the egg. Pull the needle off of the embroidery floss, then thread it with a new color. Knot the end, and continue embroidering. Leave the tail end of the first color hanging inside the egg., Once you are done with your design, place a small drop of glue right next to each hole that has thread hanging out of it. Press the thread into the glue. Let the glue dry, then snip off the excess thread with a pair of small, sharp scissors., This will make it look like the entire egg is embroidered and hide the hole from sight."

Draw dots around the template with a permanent marker.,
Drill holes into the egg where the dots are.,
Wrap some tape around the end of your string.,
Weave the string through the holes.,
Weave the string back through the holes, if desired.,
Consider switching to a different color for a more unique design.,
Tie the ends of the string together.,
Snap the two halves of the egg together.",How to Embroider an Easter Egg Design2," Most plastic Easter eggs will open widthwise. These are great for simple designs, like zigzags and stripes. If you are using an image, like a flower or a butterfly, the seam will only get in the way. An egg that opens lengthwise will work much better., Find a simple image online, print it, then cut out. If you can't find an image that you like, you can use a sticker instead, or even draw one.The template needs to be a little smaller than your egg. Don't go too small, however, or it will be hard to embroider.

Flowers, tulips, chicks, and bunny faces are great options.
If you want a simpler pattern, like zigzags or dotted lines, skip this step.

, Double-sided tape would work the best here. If you can't find any, roll a strip of tape into a loop with the sticky side out, and use that instead.If you are using a sticker, simply place it onto the egg.

If your egg opens lengthwise, make sure that the template doesn't cross the seam.
If you want a simpler pattern, like zigzags or dotted lines, skip this step.

, Space the dots as evenly as you can, about ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters). The bigger your egg is, the further apart the dots should be. You will eventually be threading your string through these.If you want a simpler pattern, like zigzags or dotted lines, make the dots where the lines would connect.

, You can do this using a dremel with a small bit. Make sure that the holes are big enough for your desired cord to fit through.You can use embroidery floss, thin yarn, or baker's twine.

, This will stiffen the end of the string and make it easier to thread through the holes.You can also thread the string though a plastic, flexible yarn needle. Don't use a metal one; it won't bend enough to fit the curves of the egg., Thread the string through one of the holes on the egg, starting from the inside. Weave the string over and under through the holes until you are back where you started. Work one egg half at a time.

Leave a long tail of string inside the egg. You'll use this to tie the two ends together.

, Weaving the string back and forth through the holes will leave gaps, just like sewing a straight stitch. If you want a solid line, instead of a dotted one, simply go over your design one more time, this time, making sure to go under and over, so that you fill the gaps in., Finish your first color inside the egg. Cut the strong so that it is a few inches/centimeters long. Thread your second color through the next hole, starting from the inside of the egg. Weave a few stitches to secure the strong, then tie the two ends together in a double-knot. Continue weaving with your second color until you want to change it.

Trim off the excess strings after you tie them together.

, Once you are back where you started, tie the two ends of the string together into a double-knot. Snip off the excess string. If the knot is not secure enough, cover it with a drop of glue. Hot glue will wok the best., If you want to close the eggs permanently, run some super glue along the rim of one of the halves before you push them together. Let the glue dry completely."

Find a perfect gift cover.",How to Choose a Gift for Your Friends," Think about how you can translate information about your friend into a physical gift or experience.;
, Using the mental list of information that you noted, think of gifts that speak to who they are as a person. Buy your music-obsessed friend an album or a t-shirt from their favorite band’s merchandise. Look into fan-club memberships as well.
Get art or craft supplies for an artistic person. Think about art projects they’d like to accomplish, or about work that they haven’t finished.
Look for rare or quirky team memorabilia for a sporty friend. Check out EBay for autographed cards, bobbleheads, stickers or other sports items that others are unlikely to have.
Buy toys for the person’s pets. Pets are important to their owners, and sometimes a gift for a pet can mean as much as a gift for their owner!
Continue to think outside the box. Remember that no matter what your friend’s interests are, your gift should be thoughtful and interesting.

, If you're giving a gift to a close friend, a good gift will be one that you and a friend can both relate to, and one with a great deal of meaning. Think of a gift that symbolizes your relationship, and remember, thoughtfulness and effort can mean more than money. Make a gift that may reference things that you have done together.
Make a scrapbook with all your photos. This can be a great gift, as your friend will appreciate the time you put into it, and it will bring back memories.
Make something simple like a friendship bracelet or necklace to remind your friend of how much you care.

, Sometimes, a meaningful message or letter can be more thoughtful than a physical object. Pair your letter with a gift and you'll definitely make an impression. Don’t make it too long-winded though!

, Simply spending time with someone can show them that you care, and experiences can be even more fun than a physical item that they might not get much use out of. Take a friend out for dinner, drinks, a concert or a movie. As with physical gifts, think about your friends personality and interests and choose a gift accordingly.
Buy your friend a membership to a local museum, aquarium or zoo. They will get free entry for a year as well as special perks for joining.
Go a little crazy! Sometimes, gifts that seem impossible are more reasonably priced than you might imagine. Look into a horseback riding session if your friend loves animals, or skydiving if your friend is a daredevil. Rent a car and check out a state park with an adventurous friend.

, If they're going through rough times financially, sometimes an eased burden is just as meaningful to a friend as a nice gift.

, Make the donation in their name, and they'll get some gifts and perks in recognition of the contribution.

, Sometimes, in gift giving, we go overboard thinking about how to give the absolute perfect gift. However, it’s more important to think about how the gift will affect your friend, and whether or not it is something truly useful and meaningful to them. , But do not reveal that you are going to give or what is in it., Mentally note:


The person's gender
Their age
Whether they live at alone or with family
Whether they’re in school or have graduated

, Think about things that they like or talk about, whether it’s music, movies, art or sports. Think about any skills, talents or hobbies they may have. Try to remember anything they've mentioned wanting in the past weeks, or anything they've had their eye on.

, They may have posted things that they’ve got their eye on or gadgets that they think are cool. Social media profiles can also give a better picture of their interests.

, They may have a wishlist on a shopping site, which will make gifting easier. You can comb through their registry and find something they’ve already selected for themselves. If they do shop online, ask if you can look over their shoulder and see what they’re shopping for.

, If they’re considering buying an item but decide against it, make a mental note of it as a potential present.

, You may overhear them talking about items they'd like to have while they're around friends or coworkers.

, They may have some ideas, and be willing to help. Ask if they’ve ever given the person a gift in the past, how they reacted to it. This may give you a good idea of what to give them (and what hasn’t gone over well).

, They probably know them very well, and can give some advice. They’ll have more intuition about things that the person has been wanting lately.

, Take stock of how many years you’ve known them, how big a part of your life they are, and how important they are to your future.


Best friends are deserving of very meaningful, personal gifts that reflect your years of friendship.
Don’t give people you have just met or don’t know too well overly personal or expensive gifts. Expensive gifts may give them the idea that you’re just trying to impress them, while overly personal gifts might come off as too forward.

, Christmas and birthdays are big, important holidays for which larger gift giving is acceptable. However, there are many holidays like Easter, Wedding Anniversaries, and Valentine’s Day that require different levels and types of gift giving.

, Let your friend know how much you truly care with an extra thoughtful gift, or by throwing them a surprise party.

, Make sure that your gifts fit tradition when attending a bridal or baby shower. A mom-to-be probably won’t appreciate a cast iron skillet any more than a bride-to-be might appreciate a box of diapers!, Gift covers are very effective. You can use a gift cover of hearts if you are gifting him/her for there marriage. You can use gift cover of a baby if you are gifting on her becoming mother. If it is her/him on there birthday you can use a gift wrap of balloons design or bell designed gift wrap. Or if it is your personal occasion you can also create a gift wrap with yours and his/her's images. Just you and him/her.

Add glitter.",How to Dip Dye Easter Eggs," Place your eggs into a large pot. Make sure there is only one layer and they are not on top of one another. Add enough water so that ½ inch (2 cm) of water covers the egg. Bring the water to boil. When the water boils, turn the heat to moderate high. Cook the eggs at a low boil for 10 minutes, uncovered.Drain the hot water and cover the eggs with cold water. You can add some salt to the water if you wish. Leave the eggs in cold water for 15 minutes. Add ice or more cold water to the water to keep it cold.;
, To protect the area where you are dyeing the eggs, lay down multiple layers of newspaper. This is especially important if you have young children. Also lay out a drying area for your dyed eggs.For drying, you can use a cooling rack or an empty egg carton.

, Each color you use to dye your eggs will need a different bowl. Decide how many colors you will use and choose the food coloring for each of those colors. Then, put out one bowl for each color., Place ½ cup (120 mL) of boiling water into each bowl. Then, mix in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of white distilled vinegar. Next, place approximately 20 drops of food coloring in the bowl. Mix it together until the water has become a uniform color.Make sure to place 20 drops of food coloring in separate bowls for each different color.
Gel food coloring will make brighter, more vibrant colors.

, Choose a hard boiled egg and carefully pick it up with tongs or a spoon. Submerge it into the dye. Leave it for around a minute. For darker eggs, leave it in for up to five minutes.When you remove the egg, dry it carefully with a paper towel. Set it aside to dry for around 10 minutes.

, You can choose to dye the entire egg or only part of it. If you want your egg to be a solid color, dip the entire egg. If you want a multi-colored egg, dip only part of the egg and leave part of it uncolored.You can dip that part of the egg in a different color.

, If you left part of your egg uncolored, dip it again after it has set for 10 minutes. Take the egg in the tongs again and dip the undyed section in a different color. Hold it there for a minute before removing and letting it dry.You can re-dip part of the already colored egg in the same color, but leave part of the original dye like it was. This gives you a lighter shade and a darker shade of the same color.

, There is no limit to the amount of times you can dip your egg. You can dip multiple times to create a darker color or dip the egg in multiple colors. Get creative and do something different with each egg.Make stripes by starting with a fully dyed egg, then holding half of the egg in a different color, and then holding a third of the egg in a third color.
Create crazy patterns by holding the eggs at odd angles, causing your colors to overlap. Leave parts of your egg undyed so you have white or brown sections.

, Dyeing eggs in whipped cream can give them a multicolored soft pastel look. To prepare this dye, place enough whipped cream in a glass bowl to cover your egg. Choose one to three colors of food coloring. Drizzle the food coloring over the entirety of the whipped cream.Drizzle between 10 to 20 drops of food coloring. The more drops, the more color you will have on your egg. Start with less drops and dye a few eggs, then add more drops and dye additional eggs for a variety of colors and patterns.
Use a toothpick or a butter knife to drag through the whipped cream, swirling the colors together slightly.
If you want more vibrant colors, soak the hard-boiled eggs in white vinegar for a couple of minutes. Dry before placing in the whipped cream.

, Take your eggs and push them down into the whipped cream. You may want to move them around a little to get the entire egg covered in whipped cream and food coloring.Leave the egg in the whipped cream. The longer you leave the egg, the more vibrant the color will be. Leave them in at least 10 minutes.

, After you have left the eggs in the whipped cream as long as you want, take them out of the whipped cream. Rinse off the whipped cream using cool water. Then allow them to dry.You may want to use gloves or pull them out with a spoon. You may get food coloring on your fingers if you rinse them without gloves.

, If you want to make an egg with a spatter pattern, dip dye your egg in a solid color. Let it dry completely. Take a clean toothbrush and cover the bristles in a different dye color. Run your fingernail along the bristles to splatter the dye onto the egg., For a marble pattern on your eggs, use cooking oil, like canola or olive. Start by dip dyeing the egg in the base color. The base color should be lighter. Let it dry. Then take a different, darker color of dye and mix it with the oil. Dip the egg in the oil and dye mixture very quickly.Mix 1 teaspoon of oil in a cup of dye.
The oil will cause the dye to not stick to parts of the egg and stick to others.

, You can also dip dye using glitter. Use either a plain egg or one you have already dyed. Use a paintbrush to brush a light coat of liquid glue or glue from a glue stick onto the egg in the pattern you want. You can cover half of the egg with glitter, or paint on a design.Brush glitter onto the wet glue. You can also roll the egg in glitter, but a brush helps you cover the egg more evenly. You can also brush off excess glitter with the brush.

, Spread out some pastel shades of paint on a paper or plastic plate. Then, gently roll the eggs through the paint. This should create a tie-dye marble design.Opaque, transparent, dimensional, stain/fill, or specialty paints work well on plastic eggs.Supervise young children when they're playing with paint.
Wear old clothing in case paint splatters.

, Most craft stores sell metallic paint in shades like black, gold, and silver. You can create fun, bold eggs by painting their surfaces in metallic paint.You can paint the full surface of the egg in metallic. However, you can also just paint on metallic shapes. You can paint shapes by hand or use a stencil.

Know the occasion.,
Know what the person may want or need.,
Set a budget.,
Make a gift.,
Get an ""experience"" gift, rather than a material gift.,
Look online.",How to Choose a Gift," Depending on the theme of the party and the age and gender of the host, different gifts would be recommended. You'd get a 13-year-old girl something different than a 28-year-old man, of course. Think of the purpose of party. Are they getting married? Is it for their graduation? Think of these things and you may know already what to get. The present should be something they could use for the purpose of the event e.g. baby items for a baby shower. Below are some sample ideas for different occasions. Try a few of these or think of your own.


Mom's birthday/Mother's Day. Try jewelry, a cookbook (if she likes cooking), a book she'd love to read, a movie you can watch together, or a poem you wrote about her.
Dad's birthday/Father's Day. Get tickets to a sports game, a mug with a funny saying, a watch, or a scrapbook of your memories together.
Teenager's party. Get gift cards to the movies, CD's/iTunes gift cards, a journal, a T-shirt, or a movie.
Gift for a young child. Get a stuffed animal, an easy book, bubble blowers, crayons/markers, toy trucks, or barbies (or other toys).
Gift for your friend. Get a photo frame for a picture of you two, a gift card to their favorite store, a magazine, a book, or some origami.
Baby shower. Get pajamas, bottles, blankets, books, toys, bibs, soaps, nursery lamp, or baby powder.
Wedding. Get cookware, a frame, a platter, ornaments, a wedding canvas, pillowcases, or a vase.

, This step could be the hardest part, but is possibly the most important. You'd want to get them something that is useful and something they like, right? Think of their interests. Are they into soccer? Art? Reading? Ask another person on what they are into. Ask their sibling, parent, or a friend of them to give some ideas without giving away the secret. Or, simply ask them if they have a wish list, either on a website, or a verbal one. Just ask for some ideas or ask what they like, but you can keep it a surprise if you want.


Are they always saying, ""I could really use a _________"", or ""I can't believe I lost/broke my ________."" There's a gift idea!

, Always set a budget. Once you start to get some gift options, make sure you aren't paying too much or too little. The gift doesn't have to be expensive. It's the thought that counts. On the other hand, you shouldn't be paying too little. If you're low on cash, just get a 15 or 20 dollar gift card to a place they like. Look online for great deals. But, avoid the dollar store. That's a little cheap to go there for a gift, but it may give you ideas for one. Think of the item. Should I be paying $30 for a T-shirt?. No. What about $15?. Better. Just use your brain.

, This has 2 positive reasons: if you're low on cash, you don't have to worry about spending a fortune, and it shows how much you care. This is especially great for family members. Instead of just buying a card and signing your name on it, why not make one yourself? Gather up some photos of you and the person you are giving the card to, some markers, paper, stickers, and a few other items and you could make some of these things:


A scrapbook of your memories
A photo frame with a picture of you
An A-Z list of memories
A CD of a song you made together
A video of a dance you two made
Top 10 reasons why they're the best
""Coupons"" e.g. one free sleepover

, Experience gifts include tickets to a game or concert, a vacation, dance lessons, skydiving, and more. These could be very pricey, but are great to give because they'll usually teach them something new or maybe even be a life changing event. Don't feel like you have to get one, but the receiver will be so happy that you got them an experience gift.

, Many deals are online only, and some items are online only. Search up a gift you might want to get and see what pops up. Look at ratings and reviews. You could get extra savings or maybe even a free gift, so consider buying the present online.

Choose a gift with the relevant star sign theme.,
Choose a July flower gift.,
Choose a July jewel gift.",How to Choose a Birthday Gift for July," Those with birthdays in July can be either a Cancer or a Leo. For such people, a gift based on the lion or crab symbols would work well. This could be anything from a soft toy, a trip to the zoo or aquarium, or a piece of art featuring either animal or the symbols.


Look online and in stores and boutiques for inspiration.
Stay within your price range. Don't blow your budget on a crab supper or lion safari in Africa unless you can truly afford such generosity.;
, There are different possibilities here for gift items:

The common flower for July is the larkspur. Each colour of larkspur has its own meaning: pink means fickleness, white is for a happy nature and purple usually signifies a first love. Generally, larkspur indicates a strong bond of love.






The other July flower is the water lily, which signifies purity and majesty.






You could give the actual flowers as a gift, either in cut form or in a container/seed form. Alternatively, find an item which includes the design of these flowers, such as art, books, fabrics etc can all have floral patterns which include these flowers in images. See if there is a flower fairy associated with these flowers if you like, and buy a print or figurine of the larkspur or water lily fairy.

, The ruby is the birthstone for July. Ruby jewellery would be a great present for a July birthday boy or girl, but could be a bit expensive so consider ruby style jewels or items with ruby themes––ruby slippers, perhaps? Anything red and shiny would be good, such as nail polish, lipstick, a model Ferrari even. Anything ruby-colored is a good solution.

Plan ahead.,
Brainstorm ideas.,
Consider a practical gift.,
Use recent conversations.,
Look at her Pinterest.,
Consider her love language.,
Ask her what she wants.",How to Buy Your Girlfriend the Perfect Gift1," Don’t wait until the last minute. By planning ahead, you can decide on a romantic gesture or present that fits the occasion, and you'll have the time to execute it. It also gives you time to order online if you need to.;
, Take some time to brainstorm three lists: a list of things she likes, a list of things you like about her, and a list of things you have in common, which can include inside jokes or memories. Use these lists as inspiration for gift ideas.


For instance, if you know she loves cooking, you could get her an apron printed with some of your favorite pictures together.

, Many people appreciate practical gifts. Be careful with this option, though; you don’t want to give something too boring or mundane. A good question to ask yourself is, “Is this something she will eventually wind up buying for herself if I don’t?” If the answer is yes, don’t buy it. A good gift should be something she loves and/or can use, but she would not buy for herself.For instance, maybe she keeps eyeing a fancy kitchen gadget, but she never has the extra cash to shell out for it, which would make it the perfect gift.

, It's possible she's intentionally dropped a hint about something she may want. Alternatively, maybe you two have talked about something she's really into lately, which can help guide your gift. Using what she says as a source of gift-giving inspiration will ensure you get her something she genuinely likes, and show her that you listen to what she says.


For instance, maybe she's said, ""Taylor Swift's music always makes me happy. I really want to get her new CD.""

, If she has one, this is a fantastic resource for figuring out what she wants without asking her directly.Another source could be her Amazon wishlist, if it's public. Just make sure you're not buying her something that she already owns.

, ""Love language"" is a term used by Gary Chapman to describe what people need to feel loved. If you can figure out your girlfriend's love language, you can get her something she truly wants and make her feel loved. One way you can figure out her love language is to ask her to take a quiz at 5lovelanguages.com. Don't worry, she'll probably find it romantic that you want to know her love language.The first love language is words of affirmation. That means that person feels the most loved when she hears words of appreciation or affection.The second love language is acts of service, which means that person feels the most loved when you do actions for her, such as taking over a chore.The third love language is receiving gifts, which is as it sounds; this person feels loved when you shower her with gifts.For people who value quality time, just spending time with you is the most important thing.For people whose love language is physical touch, being close to you is important, from holding hands to having intimate moments., Use good judgment here; some girls will appreciate your consideration in asking, while others may find it strange. If you do ask her for help, avoid just asking, “What do you want?” Instead, ask her for a list of things or types of things she's had her eye on. This way she won't know exactly what she's getting."

Make her something.,
Make a scrapbook or frame a photo.,
Put together her favorite drink.,
Create some homemade bath bombs.",How to Buy Your Girlfriend the Perfect Gift2," This option is great if you don’t have much money, and often, your girlfriend will value it more if it you made it. Making a gift takes more time and effort than just buying something online, but it doesn't need to take days. Plus, you know it will be unique. Don't worry, you don't have to be Van Gogh to make a beautiful gift she'll love.

, Since most photos are on the computer or phone these days, actually giving her physical photos can be nice. You can either put photos in a simple scrapbook or frame several photos of you two together., Whether she loves tea or hot cocoa, try putting together a little kit of her favorite beverage. For instance, for hot cocoa, you could make a homemade cocoa mix with little packets of marshmallows and several small bottles of Bailey's on the side.If she likes tea, try making an arrangement of all her favorites, plus some fancy honey. Include a fancy mug to top it off.

, If your girl loves to soak in the tub, making bath bombs will be perfect for her. Pick an essential oil she'll love to scent them, and she'll be in bliss.


To make a bath bomb, simply mix 2 cups of cornstarch with 1 cup of citric acid, and 1 3/4 a cup of baking soda by shaking it through a sieve.Fill up small spray bottles with water. If you want to color you bath fizzies, add 6 drops of food coloring.Measure out 1 cup of powered mixture. Use the spray bottles to add small amounts of water to the powder. Mix it up after each spray. The mixture is ready when it holds together when squeezed.Add in the essential oil. For an essential oil with a heavy fragrance (such as peppermint), add 5 drops; use 6 if it's lighter (such as lemon). Stir the fragrance in. Put the mixture in small baking molds, preferably ones that hold about 1/4 cup, enough for one bath. If smaller, use two bath bombs per bath. Repeat for the rest of the dry mixture."

Clean the house.,
Make her food.,
Shine up her car.",How to Buy Your Girlfriend the Perfect Gift3," Maybe you don't want a clean house to be the whole gift, but if you live with your girlfriend, showing you care by cleaning the house is a nice gesture. Make sure you think about all the regular chores, from cleaning the bathroom to doing the laundry., You could make her brownies (mixes make brownies very easy), and you customize them by adding chocolate chips, caramels, candy, or raspberry preserves, anything she'd like. Don't forget to take her allergies and likes and dislikes into consideration. Alternatively, if you want to step it up, try making a whole meal. Pick a simple recipe or play to your strengths., If she's like most people, she doesn't always have the time to keep her car in order. Find a way to ""borrow"" her car. Take it out, and clean it up, inside and out. Just be sure not to throw anything away--that could lead to trouble!

"
Look at handcrafted websites.,
Try craft or art fairs.,
Find something in line with her passions.,
Take it a step up.",How to Buy Your Girlfriend the Perfect Gift4," Handcrafted websites offer a variety of gifts that are unique. You can find something tailored to what your girl loves or even have a gift customized to her. Check out websites such as Etsy, Custom Made, and Shana Logic., Like websites with arts and crafts, you can find one-of-a-kind gifts at local art shows and craft fairs. While sometimes the prices can be high, you're paying for a truly special gift and supporting your local economy at the same time.

, For instance, if your girlfriend loves drawing, art supplies are definitely an appropriate choice. However, so is a book about art, or a painting by her favorite artist (if you can afford it). Have the gift line up with things she loves.

, For instance, if she loves books, giving her a book is an obvious choice. However, you can go one step further. Instead of just getting her any book, try to get a copy of her favorite book signed by the author. That will make it truly unique and special."
"
Try picking something you can do together.,
Consider giving her a more long-term experience.,
Try a small trip.",How to Buy Your Girlfriend the Perfect Gift5," Instead of giving her something she'll set on her shelf, try giving her something you can go out and do. Whether it's something you both love or something you don't like as much but she does, it will make an unforgettable gift.For instance, try getting tickets to a musical or play. Alternatively, you could buy tickets for a local symphony., For instance, try getting her into a painting class if she's always loved painting. Alternatively, you both could try a beer-brewing class together if she loves beer, which could turn into a life-long passion. Just make sure it's something she's passionate about, which you should know from paying attention to what she says and does.

, Even a short jaunt to a cabin nearby can be romantic under the right conditions. It doesn't have to be super expensive, as long as you think about what you your girlfriend likes. For instance, if she isn't super outdoorsy, take her for small getaway in a nearby city or quaint small town.For an even smaller getaway, try staying one night at a fancy hotel in town.Another option is a ""staycation."" Basically, you both take a day off from work and make fun plans in the city you live in. For instance, you could make her a picnic and go to a park or go to a concert at the botanical gardens."
"
Consider the occasion.,
Avoid gifts that are more for you than her.,
Don't fall back on clichés.,
Be wary of clothing and jewelry.",How to Buy Your Girlfriend the Perfect Gift6," While it might be nice to give a girl a sweet, handmade card to celebrate your 1-month anniversary, a huge romantic gesture will probably freak her out and put too much pressure on the relationship. Likewise, a handmade card will probably not cut it for a 1-year anniversary. However, you have to consider what your girlfriend wants, too; some girls like to make a big deal out of events like birthdays and Valentine's Day, while others prefer to keep things more casual.

, A skimpy outfit or tickets to a sporting event she doesn’t really care about will not earn you any points. Make sure you think about your girlfriend, not yourself, when selecting a gift.

, Popular culture is full of depictions of men giving women teddy bears, heart necklaces, and roses. While some girls may appreciate feeling like they are in a romantic comedy, most will prefer a gift that shows you really know them, and don’t think of them as a two-dimensional stereotype.


If you are out of time and ideas, at least consider buying a stuffed version of her favorite animal instead of a generic teddy bear, a bouquet of her favorite flowers instead of roses, or a necklace that somehow reminds you of her instead of just a typical heart pendant., While these can seem like great ideas, you should think twice about giving clothing or jewelry unless you are very confident that you know your girlfriend’s tastes. It is always a good idea to include a receipt with wearable gifts, so that your girlfriend has the option of exchanging your gift for something that suits her better.

The same pan can be used, but you will need to wash the pan before the next dye.

, Use one cup of vinegar per each cup ingredients. Take your chosen ingredient with the specified amount of water it calls for. For example, 4 tablespoons of chili powder per cup of water for orange.

Go mid-range to high end.,
Consider the season.,
Ask questions.,
Don't be afraid to pick something unusual.,
Know the person's tastes.,
Pick a pretty label or bottle.,
Consider a wine subscription.,
Consider a magnum for a party.,
Buy standard bottles for dinner.,
Go more expensive for special occasions.,
Make sure it's appropriate.,
Make the wine the package.,
Think about adding an accessory.,
Wait for a good time.",How to Buy Wine for a Gift," It's tempting to buy a cheap wine to give as a gift, particularly if you don't know much about wines. However, cheap wine will taste cheap. That's not to say that you can't get a decent wine for a reasonable price. You just don't want to pick the cheapest wine, especially if you've never tasted it yourself.Also, consider who you're buying the wine for. Buying a very cheap bottle of wine for your boss won't endear you to them. Similarly, you may not want to buy the cheapest bottle you can find for a close friend (unless you have a habit of drinking cheap wine together).
In addition, if you're known as someone who appreciates wine, buying a cheap bottle for someone else can come off as you underestimating their taste or simply not appreciating them as much.Also, how much you spend can depend on the wine. For instance, you can get a very tasty Cotes du Rhône (pronounce it ""Coats Do Roan"") for about $15. However, with a Burgundy, you'll need to spend more to get a better wine, usually upwards of $50. Another relatively cheap option is a Cabernet Sauvignon, as even cheap versions of this wine are fairly decent. For Pinot noir, go for at least a $20 bottle, as anything less won't be very good.;
, If you don't know where to start, picking wines by the season is a good bet. You don't necessarily want the same wines in the summer that you do in the winter. In the summer, you want something lighter, for instance, than you do in winter.White wines like Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, and Riesling are good summer choices. Rose and Merlot are also a good bet. These wines are bit lighter.
For fall, you want fuller bodied whites, such as oaked Chardonnay or Viognier. You still want a somewhat lighter red wine, so stick with Pinot noir, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, or a sparkling variety.
During the winter, you can go with heavier wines since you'll have heavier dishes. Cabernet Sauvignon, Bordeaux blend, Syrah, Zinfandel, and Malbec are fine in the reds. For whites, choose oaked Chardonnay. You can also go for a sparkly wine.
In the spring, you want lighter, fruitier wines, such as Chenin Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Unoaked Chardonnay, or Rose. You can also choose Riesling, Moscato, or Pinot noir.

, If you're not a wine connoisseur yourself, gazing at a liquor store's collection of wines can be quite daunting, as you may be faced with hundreds of different bottles of wines. If you're a bit lost, don't be afraid to ask the person in charge of wines for advice. Many will work within your price range to help you find a good, drinkable wine, especially if you can specify a few parameters, such as whether you want a sweet or dry wine., If you know your wines, a unique wine is a good choice because you can introduce your friend or friends to something new. However, don't pick something so obscure that they won't be able to find it again. You don't want to whet their appetite for a wine they can't buy., If you're buying wine as a gift, it's best to know what the person likes to drink. Most wine drinkers have particular tastes, whether they like a dry white wine or a fun and fruity sparkling rose. Consider what you've seen the person drink in the past, and then go for something the same or similar.If you're not sure what the person drinks, consider their general tastes. If they have a sweet tooth, they might prefer a sweeter wine, while if they like to avoid sugar for the most part, they may prefer something drier.
If you're still not sure, ask someone at the store to recommend a reasonably priced popular wine.

, Of course, you don't want to pick a wine solely on what the label looks like. However, when you're giving a wine, the packaging matters. A pretty, well-designed label will be more appreciated than a subdued, boring label, especially since many people will associate the latter with cheaper wine., If you're looking for a substantial gift for someone, think about buying the person a subscription to a wine delivery service. Usually, you pay one price (or a monthly price) for the service to deliver wine for a specified period of time.Some just send a curated selection, while others base the delivery on the person's preferences.
Some also include food with the subscription that pairs with the wine.
Check to make sure wine can be delivered in the state where the person resides, as some states don't allow alcohol to be shipped to people's homes.

, A magnum is a double bottle of wine or champagne. One reason it works well for a party is it's fairly impressive to look at. Plus, because it's double the size, it will last much longer than a single bottle of wine. Your host will appreciate your thoughtfulness.When choosing a wine for a party, sparkling is usually a good option.
If you insist on bringing a standard bottle of wine to a party, give it to the hosts before the party, and let them decide whether they want to serve it at the party or not.

, On the other hand, when you've been invited for dinner to a small gathering, such as a dinner for about four people, a regular bottle is appropriate. A regular bottle will provide enough wine for each person at the dinner, which is why it's appropriate.Ask the hosts ahead of time what they will be serving. Then you can get a wine that matches the dinner, such as a white wine for fish. If you're not sure what goes with what type of food, ask at the store.

, When it comes to weddings or other big special occasions, such as birthdays or Christmas dinner, plan to spend a bit more on the bottle. Weddings especially call for a more expensive bottle. If you don't want to spend that much, skip the wine. You'll be safer buying something off their registry., That is, you don't want to buy wine if the host doesn't drink wine. For instance, maybe the host enjoys alcohol, but they don't like wine. Another situation you may run into is the host may not drink at all, due to personal choice, health reasons, or religious reasons. If you're not sure, ask.

, That is, a wine doesn't necessarily need to be wrapped or put in a bag or box. If the bottle is pretty enough, adding a bow or ribbon is pretty much all you need to do. Besides, most wine packaging doesn't actually hide the fact that you're giving a bottle of wine, which defeats the purpose.In addition, putting wine in boxes can heat them, which can be a problem for more expensive wines. It's much better to try to keep the wine cool. If it's a particularly expensive wine that should be kept in a cellar, consider holding it in a cooler until you give it to your friend.

, If you want the gift to be extra special, include a gift that goes with the wine. You could pick a funky and fun corkscrew or carafe, for instance. You could also choose a wine thermometer, so the person can serve the wine at the proper temperature. Other options include fancy or unique wine glasses or a wall rack., If you and your friend are both wine connoisseurs, pick a moment when you can tell the person a little about the wine. Of course, you don't want to bore someone who's not interested in all the details about the wine, but if you know the person will be interested, wait until they aren't busy doing something else."

Ask the parents what the baby needs.,
Consider giving a basket of goodies.,
Give the parents a diaper cleaning service voucher.,
Give several months supply of pureed baby food.,
Offer to babysit.,
Frame a gorgeous photo you've taken of the baby during the year.,
Choose toys suited to what you know of your baby.,
Give books made for babies.,
Make your baby some fun food with their favorite flavors.,
Spend time with your baby without interruptions.,
Remind yourself that your baby won't remember a thing about being given gifts as a baby.",How to Choose a Christmas Gift for a Baby," They will likely have at least a few things that they'd appreciate for a gift, from clothing to toys and maybe even furniture. If you're not keen to ask them, be observant. Listen to anything the parents mention about wanting or notice whether the baby is missing certain needed items whenever you visit.;
, This could include some baby grooming products, a few onesies, pairs of baby socks, a baby-proof book and a rattle, for example. Add to it whatever you consider is appropriate.


Wrap in clear cellophane with a pretty big bow for presentation. This looks professionally finished.

, This is a great Christmas gift idea to ease their constant cleaning and lets them spend more time with the baby instead of the washing machine.


Choose a service that has a good reputation for reliability and cleanliness.

, This could be organic, jar or frozen food, depending on what you know the parents prefer. This is a great way to give them some more free time with the baby.


Make it yourself. See How to make and freeze baby food for details. You'll need to transport it quickly in a frozen food receptacle and warn the parents that it needs to go straight into the freezer on your arrival. Package with good labels that explain what is inside and the date produced and a suggested use-by date (base the use-by date on whatever the product is and its recommended freezing time, but err on earlier use for the sake of freshness.)

, Here's a great excuse to spend time with the baby and give the parents a well deserved break. This is a great one if you're a godparent or family member who is itching to have more one-on-one time with the baby.

, Print it off and choose a sweet frame that will look good in the parent's house. This is a lovely gift that they'll probably keep on display for years to come.

, This might be new rattles, blocks, a soft toy or some sort of safe and fun baby furniture that lets them bounce, crawl or play.

, Reading can never begin too early with a baby. It's something the baby can hold onto and chew, while you can read the stories to the baby in the coming months.

, For example, perhaps they love bananas; make a plateful of banana slices formed into the shape of an animal. Or, turn the bananas into mini muffins for baby's first muffins.

, There are always things to be done. Let yourself put all those chores to one side and just spend time at baby's eye level on the floor, hanging together and playing together.

, Love, kisses, cuddles and fun together are likely to be of more lasting value than any single gift item.

Gift a pair of lightweight wool socks.",How to Choose a Gift for a Traveler1," Chances are the traveler in your life will want to be prepared for wet weather.

Opt for models that have a slim design, a screen that’s less than 13.5 inches (35 centimeters), and weigh in at 3 pounds or less., If the traveler in your life doesn’t need to lug a laptop around with them on their journeys, a tablet is a great gift that will allow them access at a portion of the weight.

, Flowers are the classic get well gift that can be delivered personally or by a courier. Flower arrangements can be found at the hospital, supermarket, flower store, flower markets, or online flower stores, like FTD and even Amazon.com or Overstock.com.

Local flower shops allow you the opportunity to go in and choose the arrangement personally and they often don't charge very much for a local delivery.
Choose a bouquet with bright colors, like yellow daisies or sunflowers. Avoid white or dark flowers, since your aim is to cheer up the person. Floral arrangements for children can include balloons or a small toy, a helpful distraction during sickness.

, Unlike cut flowers that die in a week or 2, orchids, succulents, ferns or herbs can live through the recovery. Choose a low-maintenance plant, which will brighten a bedside for the duration of the illness.

, Many online stores, including Amazon, Overstock, FTD and smaller companies, design gift baskets that include food, candy, games, tea, books and more. Go to a site that will let you design it yourself, if nothing looks fitting to the person.

, Cover a cardboard box with bright wrapping paper. Go to a store and buy cards, crossword puzzles, a robe, books, magazines, slippers, games, movies, music or candy.


Create a craft or spa basket for a woman that will help her pass the time. Provide the craft materials she needs to sew, knit, paint or draw from her bedside.
Create a basket for a man that includes action movies, handheld video games or computer games. If he is video game oriented, buy a gift certificate so he can choose games that he really wants. If he is into sports, buy him some pay-per-view games.

, Budsies.com creates stuffed animals from artwork, or even from photos! This gift is incredibly personal and can even be used to help a young child draw his or her superhero to help them through an illness.
, If possible, arrange with friends or family to provide food for a week or two, so the person does not have to worry about cooking until they feel better. If you do not have the time to cook, then order a week's worth of food, such as soup, from a site like Home Bistro.

, Many sick people cannot clean their house during recovery. Find a cleaning service in an online phone book and buy a gift certificate; the person can call when the house really needs upkeep.

, Attach it to your gift before delivery. If you have purchased the gift online, make sure to fill out the personal message box that is usually available during checkout.

, A good example is a Zidisha gift card, which lets the recipient make a small business loan to an individual in an impoverished country and dialogue directly with that individual as he or she grows the business and family income as a result of the loan., A visit from a friend or family member is often the most distracting and cheerful thing you can give someone.

Avoid jewellery.,
Figure out their style.,
Look at their registry.,
Consult relevant price guides.,
Get help from an antique consultant or dealer.,
Go to your local antique shop.,
Shop at antique barns and flea markets.Antique barns and flea markets are a great place to find wedding gifts like silverware, quilts, old clocks and artworks.,
Go to estate sales and auctions.,
Shop online for an antique wedding present.,
Look closely at the object.,
See whether you need to determine provenance.,
Ask for the documentation.,
Identify the origins of the piece.",How to Buy Antiques As Wedding Gifts," When it comes to antiques, the functionality of the item is less important than considerations of beauty and historical or familial significance. In this sense, you should search for an item that is unique in appearance and history. For instance, you might consider purchasing a beautiful vase or pot as a wedding gift. Alternately, you might consider purchasing a pen that was owned by a famous individual that the couple admires., One of the more unique gifts is an antique wine decanter. If the couple identify themselves as wine lovers, they may own a modern decanter but they are unlikely to own an antique or vintage decanter. It is a very unique antique that can be found online or at your local antique shop., In general, it is best to avoid large antiques such as dining room tables or dressers, since you probably don’t know whether they have the space for such items and shipping will be difficult. You should also avoid essential items that the couple may already own.For instance, you should avoid purchasing a dining room table for the couple unless it is explicitly listed on the registry.
You may also want to avoid kitchen chairs.

, Although there are some gorgeous antique jewellery items, it will be difficult to determine whether the couple will like them. Stay away from antique watches, earings, necklaces, broaches and other jewellery., You could ask friends about their style or observe their style at house visits. If they have an eclectic style, you may have some leeway in choosing a fun vintage item. And if they have a penchant for mid-century modern furniture or art deco, you will have a better idea about what to look for., You should look at their registry and see if there are any items that could be purchased as antiques, such as essential furniture items or vases. However, unless it is explicitly listed on their registry, you should avoid “essential” house items. The couple will likely have the essential items unless they are explicitly listed on the registry., Prior to shopping for the lucky couple, you should look at the price guide for the type of antique gift you want to purchase. Price guides will give you a sense of the worth of various kinds of antiques, such as furniture, pottery or silverware. Of course, they will not take the actual condition of a particular item into account, but they will give you a sense of the price range of what you are looking for.For instance, Kovels offers a price guide to over one million antique items commonly sold in Canada, United States and Europe., You may want to hire an antique consultant if you are purchasing an antique wedding present that costs upwards of a hundred thousand dollars. However, if you are purchasing something in a lower price bracket (e.g., a thousand dollars), it is best to get to know an antique dealer. Ask friends or family members if they know a good antique dealer, or look online and set up a meeting.If you hire an antique consultant, you want to make sure they are a professional and registered with one of the following antique appraisal and consulting organizations: American Society of Appraisals, Appraisals Association of America, International Society of Appraisers., A fun way to shop for antiques is to go to your local antique shop, look around and chat with the owner. Tell the owner that you are shopping for a wedding present. If you go at a time when it is less busy, they may be able to share more of their knowledge., You can find antique barns and flea markets by looking in the classified section of local newspapers. You could also look at the advertisements in your antique buyers guide or use an online directory such as FleaQuest.If you live in the United States, some of the best flea markets include Brooklyn Flea in Brooklyn, Rose Bowl Flea Market in Pasadena, Renniger’s in Mount Dora, Florida, and Austin Country Flea in Austin, Texas., Estate sales and auctions are particularly great if you are hoping to find an antique wedding present in the category of furniture, silverware, glassware, dishware, niceties, tablecloths or jewellery. If you are looking for a nicety (e.g., vase), artwork, silverware or small piece of furniture, you may find a great deal. In general, keep in mind that it is best to avoid cookware, appliances and upholstered furnishings at these sales since these items experience more wear and tear and lose their value.If you live in the United States, you can use a directory of estate sales. For instance, the EstateSales.net website allows you to search for estate sales by postal code or location. They will also send you a newsletter with listings, if you sign up for it on their website., There are a number of websites that specialize in antiques, so you could shop online. Of course, the challenge may be shipping the item to the couple, especially if you are looking at furniture. So, it is best to use the “search by location” option on the antique or auction website you are using. You also want to find reputable dealers and look closely at the pictures and descriptions, as well as refund policy.Some of the better sites for antique shopping include Chairish, EBTH, Krrb and eBay., The process of verification begins with a close examination of the object itself. For instance, if it is a piece of furniture, you want to look at the material. If it is wood, you want to know what kind of wood it is, which will give you an idea of origins. Unlike modern furniture which is constructed with materials from around the world, antiques tend to be from a particular region. Next, you want to look more closely for signs of aging, repair and distinctive features that could indicate whether the antique is the real deal or a replica.This process takes a keen eye and you may need the help of an antique dealer or consultant, especially if you are not knowledgeable in the particular style.

, If the item you are considering purchasing is valuable because of a connection to a famous collection, house or person (e.g., celebrity), you will need to determine the provenance. The provenance of an item is the story that connects the item to the person or collection that makes it valuable. In most cases, you will not need to worry about this step. However, for many vintage and antique collections that are valued because of fame or celebrity, it is an important process.For instance, if you want to purchase a guitar that was played by Kurt Cobain of the band Nirvana, you will need to know the story that connects the guitar to the musician Kurt Cobain.
If the value of the item is not dependant on a connection to a famous person or collection, you don’t need to worry about this process.

, You should always ask for documentation before making an antique purchase. Documentation includes all of the specific documents that help to tell the story of the item. By examining documents such as estate inventories, photographs, museum catalogs, and auction results, you can begin to connect the antique item to a particular history and connection to a place, time and individual.If the value of the item is based on provenance and there is no documentation, you may not want to purchase it.

, A large part of the price of an item may be determined by its origin. You want to find out where the piece was made. Ask the seller where the item was made, who made it and how it got from wherever it was constructed to their shop. Take notes and find out as many details as possible about the origins and journey of the item you are interested in purchasing. Along the way, ask for documentation that proves the story they are telling you.For instance, late nineteenth century antique furniture from America tends to be worth more than English furniture of the same style and period. The reason is that there were fewer exceptional craftsmen in America at the time, so there were fewer pieces made and they are worth more."

Talk to them about things they're missing.,
Find newer models and upgrade their existing gear.,
Look in their kitchen for broken or old equipment.,
Consider getting them a gift card.,
Ask them what they would like.",How to Choose a Gift for a Cook1," To avoid making your intentions obvious, start the conversation with small talk, and then ask questions about their kitchen. Actively listen to them and take special note of any frustration that they have because of missing equipment. For instance, they could complain about a lack of cutting boards, knives, or other kitchen equipment. All of these things could help you create a mental list of stuff that they may need.


Ask them about missing kitchen equipment by saying, ""How's work going? Is everything going smooth? Is your kitchen missing anything?"";
, While cooks may have more cooking equipment than the average person, it doesn't mean that all their equipment is in perfect condition. Take note of any dull knives, warped cutting boards, or broken dishware. If the cook has a personal knife set but an old and haggard case, consider buying them a higher quality carrying case.

Survey the quality of their current gear and see if you can find better quality alternatives.

Other things that you could upgrade include new pots and pans made of a better material, a more advanced slow cooker, or high-quality leather oven mitts.Pots and pans can be made from a vast variety of materials including cast iron, copper, and carbon steel. Consider getting one of these more expensive variations for an impressive gift., Purchasing a gift for a cook is as easy as giving them a visit for dinner. Suggest a potluck or social gathering so that you can all participate in cooking together. Take a mental inventory of their kitchen and items that may be missing.


To ask for a potluck you can say something like, ""I was wondering if you'd be interested in a potluck at your house. Since you're the cook, I figured you'd have all the stuff we'd need to heat up and prepare the food.""
Sometimes a knife set or pan set will have a piece missing because it broke or was lost. This is an excellent opportunity to complete their set.

, If you're totally unsure of what to get your cook friend, you can get them a gift card so that they can get the cookware that they need. Find cookware shops around where they live or get them a gift card that they can use online. You can also look for restaurant gift cards that they can use to get a free meal and give them a break from the kitchen. Think of the types of food that they like and purchase a gift card for a restaurant that they enjoy.


When getting a gift card it's always good to write an accompanying note.
Some of the best cookware shops include Fante's in Philadelphia, The Chopping Block in Chicago, A Cook's Companion in Brooklyn, and Hardisty's in Santa Rosa., If you don't need to keep your gift a surprise, asking them is the most direct way to understand what they want. Give them a call on the phone or ask them in person. The recipient may not even want you to get them anything cooking related, so be prepared for anything.


You can ask by saying, ""Hey, your birthday is coming up. What do you want for it?""

Give shoes to frequent runners.,
Offer gifts that improve foot comfort.,
Select a self-massaging machine as a gift.,
Invest in the gift of dryness.,
Prevent chafing by giving moisture wicking clothing.",How to Choose a Gift for a Runner1," Frequent runners can go through shoes very quickly. This can be a major expense, and the gift of a new pair of shoes would likely be appreciated. However, runners can be particular about their footwear. You may want to:


Ask your runner which pair of shoes is their favorite. Check the size of those shoes when the runner isn't looking, and you'll have all the information you'll need to purchase the shoes.
Buy a gift certificate to a local running or sports store. This way your runner can go to the store and try on potential new shoes before making a purchase.;
, In addition to going through shoes quickly, runners also have a tendency to wear out insoles and socks. Extra socks and insoles will save your runner on this expense.


Your runner might prefer a certain kind of insole. You might ask them directly which insole they prefer, but you could also look for a label on insoles already in their shoes.

, Runners who can't afford the expense of a regular massage after running might enjoy a self-massaging machine. There are many different makes and models of this kind of machine, so you should research potential options first before buying one.


Reviews for products can sometimes be misleading. For the most accurate evaluation of a self-massaging machine, you may want to test it out.
Self-massaging machines can be found at many general retailers, big box stores, and self-care/beauty shops.
Foam rollers and massage balls are an affordable alternative to a self-massaging machines., Outdoor and cross country runners, at some point, will probably have to run in rain. A light, breathable, waterproof jacket can make rain runs less unpleasant. Other useful rain gear you could offer as a gift includes:

Avoid eating the sweet and fatty food at every occasion that you attend.,
Place foods in a hierarchy.,
Don't eat absent-mindedly.,
Avoid triggers.,
Eat well on Christmas Day itself.,
Keep leftovers in their place.",How to Splurge Selectively at Christmas," Limit it to every few events.;
, Keep the fatty and sugary snacks at the top of the hierarchy and the fruit pieces and vegetable sticks at the bottom. Allow yourself free range down the bottom and eat from the hierarchy as follows:


Go for the vegetables and dip platters. Splurge on the crudites that will have you chewing away for a bit. Be sparing with the dip but don't forgo it altogether.
Enjoy fruit pieces and whole fruits like strawberries without added extras like cream or cheese. Just savour the fruit. You can splurge on berries as much as you want.
Keep the sugary snacks for special. Unless they are something that you really, really like, skip them. If you do like them, savour them.

, Don't eat the nuts just because they're there and you're stuck at a table with boring conversation. Limit yourself to food that you are consciously choosing. Taste it, enjoy it, and then move on to sipping your drink and consciously choosing to stop eating any more of that particular food.

, If you can't stop eating the chips until the bowl is empty, steer clear of even starting.

, Enjoy the meal fully. Provided that you haven't been snacking at every party leading up to Christmas Day, you can afford to indulge on this day and eat that second helping of dessert as wished.

, Just because they're old and cold does not mean they lost calories in the process. Get your eating routine back to normal the day after Christmas and make the leftovers fit into your normal daily diet, not as an excuse to keep on splurging until they're all eaten up!

Plan your guest list.

,
Find a place for your party.,
Make sure the venue of your party is clean and tidy.",How to Plan an Elegant Christmas Party1,", Make sure the size of the party venue fits your number of guests. Make sure each guest has at least 3 square feet of space. Guests do not like too much space. Guests are happy when they feel comfortable.

, Guests hate dirty surroundings. It's a huge turnoff. Make sure there are no strong odors, including both bad and good smells. The fragrance of your party should be neutral. Try to use vanilla-scented candles. 3-4 candles is the maximum number you should use, as some guests do not like certain scents.

"

Plan early.,
Choose a date and time.,
Decide how you will serve food at your party.,
Decide whether you want to do a gift exchange.,
Send out invites.,
Budget the party.",How to Plan a Christmas Party1," You need to give yourself enough time to work out all the details of the party. Try to start your planning around a month before Christmas. This will not only give you enough time to plan the party, it also will allow you to invite your guests early so that they won’t plan anything else for that day., Don’t plan your party too close to Christmas. Many of your guests may be leaving town to visit family, so if you plan your party the day before Christmas, many people may not be able to come. Instead, try to hold the party at least five days before Christmas.The weekend is usually the best time to hold the party, because your guests won’t have to go to work in the morning.
Also decide if you want your party to be during the afternoon or a night. Most parties are held in the evening, but try to choose what is best for you and your guests.
Get some input from your guests if you aren’t sure when people would be able to make it.

, When you hold a party at your home, you have several options as to how you are going to feed your guests. You may decide that you have the time and the resources to cook and bake food for the party and provide alcohol. However, you may decide to make things easier for yourself by making the party potluck style, where guests all bring a dish with them.


You can also make the party BYOB so that you don’t have to provide the majority of the drinks.

, Decide in advance whether you want your guests do a gift exchange like Secret Santa or White Elephant. This is not a necessary part of the party, but it can add some excitement and give your guests an activity to bond over.To do a Secret Santa, give your guests the name of another guest, preferably a person that they already know, to buy a gift for.
For White Elephant, all guests bring a small or funny gift that anyone could enjoy. Then each guest picks whichever present he or she wants during the party.

, Once you have pinned down the details of the date and time of your party, send out invitations either by email or mail.


Make sure that the invitations include the date, time and address of the party.
Also make sure that the invitations tell your guests to RSVP, so you will have a sense of how many people will be at the party.
If you decide to do a gift exchange, give your guests the information on what they need to bring. If you decide to make the party a potluck with a BYOB policy, make sure to also include that in the invite.

, Draw up a general budget of your party. Unless you are doing a potluck, providing food and drinks will probably be the most expensive aspect of your party. If you are preparing food yourself, estimate the approximate cost of ingredients for dishes you plan to make.
Think about if you need to rent anything like chairs, tables or coat racks to accommodate guests.
Also take into account the cost of Christmas-specific decorations you will have at your party, such as the Christmas tree, garlands, stockings, or other small pieces of décor.

"
"
Have dim lighting.,
Choose appropriate decorative items.,
Hang festive decorations like garlands or red bows.,
Use collections of pine cones and glass vases for a classic Christmas accent.

",How to Plan an Elegant Christmas Party2," You should have dim lights. You can find clear Christmas lights at any home improvement store or supermarket (Like Kmart, Target, or Walmart.) Hang enough to be festive, but not too many. Make sure the guests can see! However, do not hang colorful lights as the colors may appear to clash with certain color schemes.;
, With general décor, make sure you have certain tables for each event. Possible tables include a gift exchange table, a refreshment table, or a food buffet table. However, if you have a tree, you won't need a gift exchange table.

, Never hang too many bows or too many garland, as it might turn tacky.

,"
"
If you really want a fancy, traditional party, you must have a Christmas tree.,
Be creative.",How to Plan an Elegant Christmas Party3," In order for the tree to look nice, you must choose a fairly full tree. For tree decorating, you should use clear lights and round red ornaments.

, For a little creative fun, tie a piece of mistletoe to a neat red ribbon and hang it from an archway. If there's not an archway, the ceiling will do.

"
"
Decide if you are going to serve alcohol if your party.,
Serve Finger foods and desserts, these are great for Christmas parties.",How to Plan an Elegant Christmas Party4," If you are, make sure you have sodas or punch for the people who do not drink alcoholic beverages. Make sure water is available, too.

, If you buy the foods from a store, make sure they are presented as if you made them yourself. (price tags removed, plastic coverings removed, warmed if needed, etc.)

"
"
Use the best music.,
Set a date and a time.,
Circulate when the party is going on.",How to Plan an Elegant Christmas Party5," The best music for a Christmas party are classic Christmas songs. Nat King Cole has great classy Christmas songs.

Prepare food.,
Prepare or buy drinks.,
Clean the space.,
Put out tables and chairs.,
Make a festive atmosphere.,
Set up a kids area.,
Set up the food and drinks.,
Turn on music.,
Turn down the lights.",How to Plan a Christmas Party2," If you have decided to prepare food instead of making the party a potluck, decide on a menu that will appeal to all your guests. Make sure to have one or two vegetarian options. Prepare what you can the day before, and buy food at the supermarket like fresh fruit or cheese and crackers.You don’t have to offer your guests a full meal. Finger foods are ideal for Christmas parties because they are easy to eat and are often easy to prepare as well.
Make sure to provide desserts as well as savory items.
Some good examples of tasty and easy to make foods are: deviled eggs, veggies and dip, bruschetta, pigs in blankets, and gingerbread and Christmas cookies.
While you are at the supermarket, remember to buy any plates, napkins, cups or utensils your guests will need to eat.

, If your party is not BYOB, you will have to provide alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The easiest option for alcoholic drinks is to make a signature holiday cocktail in a large batch. This a good option because it will be cheaper than buying a lot of different kinds of liquor, and it is easier for guests because they won’t have to prepare their own drinks.You can also provide beer as an alternative drink to a cocktail.
Also be sure to buy plenty of soda and festive non-alcoholic drinks like sparkling juice and eggnog.

, Before the party, do some major cleaning of your house. Start by cleaning all surfaces and putting everything in its place. Then take a step back and assess if there is enough room for your guests. If the room feels too cluttered or crowded to hold a large amount of people, start to move things into other rooms to make sure there is enough space for everyone., You will need to put out long tables for holding food. You also should make sure that there are enough chairs to hold about a fourth of your guests. Your guests are going to mingle and walk around, so you don’t need to have as many chairs as you have guests. However, aim enough chairs or couches for elderly guests or for guests who get tired of standing.

, The Christmas tree is the most important focal point of a Christmas party. Place the tree so that it’s in a prominent, central location while still not being in the way. Decorate the tree with lights, garlands, and ornaments, and place a star at the very top. Then decorate the rest of the space.Remember to plug the lights into an outlet and turn them on before the start of the party.
Make sure the rest of the space follows a Christmas theme by putting out stockings, tinsel, mistletoe, red and green ornaments, and any other decorations that fit the Christmas spirit.

, If your friends or coworkers are bringing their kids, you will want to set up an area with games or fun activities for them. This will keep kids entertained, occupied and out of trouble!Set the kids area slightly apart from the hustle and bustle of the party.
Consider the ages of the kids coming to the party when picking out games. For instance, Monopoly would be too complex for three year olds, while older children would be bored by toys designed for younger children.

, Set up food at a long table, with savory appetizers at one end and desserts on the other. Make sure that there are plenty of plates, napkins and utensils at each side of the table so that guests can help themselves.Also consider putting out toothpicks if you are serving food like fruit or shrimp cocktail, which are easier to spear than to eat with you fingers or with forks.
If you are serving hot food, heat it up 30 minutes before guests are scheduled to arrive.

, Make a playlist of your favorite Christmas songs, mixed in with other party music. Use speakers to play the music at a normal volume.When making your playlist, think about your audience. Consider that your coworkers and your older relatives may be at the party, and play music that is not too aggressive or too inappropriate.
If you don’t know what kind of music to play, consider having a site like Pandora or Songza make a playlist for you.
If you are planning a large party at a venue, consider hiring a professional DJ.

, Glaring lights can kill a cheerful holiday vibe. Dim overhead lights, and turn on any standing lamps or other light sources. Consider hanging Christmas lights along the walls to give your party a twinkling, warm light.


You also can put candles on tables and shelves; just make sure that the candles are held in jars, or other safe containers. Also make sure to monitor the candles after you light them, and keep them out of reach of children."

Make an announcement to welcome everyone.,
Introduce guests to one another.,
Do a gift exchange about halfway through the party.,
Bring the party to a close.",How to Plan a Christmas Party3," Part of your role as host is to greet each guest as they join the party. Warmly greet them and ask them how they are. Let them know where everyone is, and that they should help themselves to food and drinks.Say something like, “Hi Jasmine, so glad you were able to make it! Come in, everyone is in the living room. Help yourself to food!”
You can also give your greetings a personal touch by asking or saying something pertaining to each individual. For instance say, “How’s your new job going?” or “Is Chris going to be able to make it?”

, Also ask your guests as they come in if you can take their coat and/or purses. Either put them on a coat rack, or put them in an unused room so that your guests will be able to pick them up later., Once all your guests have arrived, go mingle with everyone. Try to chat with at least all of your guests a little bit, and have some food. Remember to smile, and try to enjoy yourself. Remember that everyone who accepted your invitation appreciates the effort that you went through to put on this party., There’s always one person who drinks a little too much at Christmas parties: make sure that person isn’t you. As host, you are the most critical person at this party, so you don’t want to drink too much and lose focus.Even if you feel like drinking could help you feel less nervous, try not to have more than one or two drinks.

, About fifteen minutes after everyone has arrived, make an announcement or propose a toast. This is a way of thanking everyone for coming and showing how much it means to you that they are at your party.


You can say something like, “I just wanted to say, thank you all for coming! It’s so nice to see all of you together. Here’s to a great holiday season!”

, As host, part of your job is to make sure that your guests are comfortable. It could be that some of your guests only know a couple people at the party, and they may not know how to meet other guests. Make sure to introduce guests who may not know each other and get them started on a conversation.An easy way of introducing people is to say something like, “Hey Eliza, have you met Rachel? She was in my class at UMass.”

, If you are doing a gift exchange, start it about midway through the party. This gives time for your guests to eat, drink and chat with guests.Make an announcement like, “Alright, is everyone ready to do Secret Santa?”
Give your guests instructions about how to exchange gifts. Say something like, “Everyone gather over to this side of the room, and bring your gifts. I’m going to read out who everyone’s Secret Santa is, and when I call your name, go ahead and exchange your gift!”

, At the end of the night, start to wind down the party. Use subtle methods like turning down the music, or putting away food, to signal that the party is over. As your guests leave, smile and thank them for coming."

Find a venue.,
Send out invitations.,
Set up catering.,
Set up tables and decorations.,
Check in with guests and the venue throughout the party.",How to Plan a Christmas Party4," If you are holding a large party or an office party, you will have to structure it differently from a house party. You will likely need to rent a venue and order catering, which can both be pricey.If you are planning a party for an organization or for your office, they likely are covering the cost of the party. Check in and make sure you know the budget limit.
If you are paying for the party yourself, assess your finances and your budget before making any arrangements.

, If your party is for your office or a very large group of people, you will need to rent out a venue. Do some research and ask around for recommendations of different venues that host large parties. Then call these venues, see if they are available to host the party on the day that you are planning, and ask for an estimate.

, Once you have a venue and a date picked out, send out invitations to your guests. Make sure that you specifically request your guests to RSVP, since the venue will want to know how many people coming to the party., If the venue you are renting does in-house catering, you can ask them to cater the party. You can also call your favorite restaurant or catering service and see if they can cater. Let the company know approximately how many people will be in attendance and specify the menu items that you want for the party.


Catering services do all the hard work of preparing and delivering the food so that all that you have to do is pay.

, See if the venue you are renting will help you set up tables and chairs. Also be sure to set out plates, cups, utensils and napkins. Then decorate the space for Christmas. Set up a Christmas tree, and hang lights, garlands, mistletoe and whatever other decorations you’d like.


If you are unsure of how to hang things in the venue, ask a staff member how you should proceed.
If the venue has speakers you can use, hook up a laptop and play either a playlist you made or use an app like Pandora to custom make one for you. You also may choose to hire a DJ for a larger party.

, Since the party is taking place a venue, you do not have to act as a host if you don’t want to. For instance, you don’t have to greet each guest as they come in. However, since you masterminded the event, check in with caterers, guests, and the venue throughout the party to make sure that everything is running smoothly."

, Figure on no more than 4-5 children per adult. If there are any more than that things will get out of hand.

, Remember that it doesn't have to be complicated, and you don't have to feed them an entire meal if you don't want to. Cookies, chips, and punch would be plenty. Remember that it is a party, you don't have to serve only healthy food. Collaborate with your kids on this but remember you have the final say.

, See Tips below for some ideas. Remember that not all the games have to be Christmas related. Ask your child to list their favorite games. What do they play at recess? What games do they play when they're hanging out with their friends?

, This should be upbeat with a relatively fast beat - no Bing Crosby or Nat King Cole for the party. You don't have to play it constantly, but it would be nice for having on when the guests are arriving and during any craft projects or quiet games.

, Inventory what you have before you run out and buy more though! Your home doesn't have to look like the Christmas isles in a store. Just use what you have.

, Be sure to say where you are, what time the party will start, and what time the parents should pick the children up. You may also want to say whether or not they should come prepared for a gift exchange.

, Even if you don't believe in doing anything Christmas related until mid-December, if you wait, schedules will fill up and no one will be able to attend the party!

Notify guests by at least a week or two in advance to give your guests ample time to make their plans. You don’t want to throw a party that no one is able to attend simply because you didn’t give them enough advanced notice.;
, Try to check with your friends ahead of time to see what existing obligations everyone already has. This way, you can get an idea about what date is best for the largest number of people.Remember that no matter how well you plan, not everyone will be able to attend your party. The holidays are filled with travel, family, and work obligations, so most people are very busy.
Since the holidays can be such a busy time of the year, you might consider throwing the party a few days after Christmas so more people can come. That way, it’ll still take place during the holiday season, but more of your guests may be available.

, Having your holiday party at home is an easier (and cheaper!) option, but if you are inviting too many people to fit in your home you might want to consider reserving a venue for the event.Some alternative venue options to consider include restaurants, wineries, a local museum, or even a room at a specific event location like an ice skating rink.
Consider how many people you will invite and how much space you’ll need.
Keep your budget in mind when evaluating locations. Remember that you will have to spend more money on food and decorations too, so don’t spend your whole party budget on the venue.

, Decide who you want to invite and make a list so you can keep track of how many people are planning to attend. Consider if you want children to come or not. Invite friends, family, colleagues, neighbors, or whoever else you want to celebrate the holidays with.


Consider creating an event on a social media platform (like Facebook) and invite most of your guests that way. It’s an easy and effective way to get the word out about your party.
You can call the people you are inviting, and if they are not there, leave a message.
Try making invitations you can send to the people you will invite. Make sure to mail them well in advance of the party, as mail is often slow during the holidays.
You can also choose to order professional holiday invitations if your budget will allow.An alternative to snail-mail is email. Although this isn't very professional or official, it is quick if you know the recipients check their email a lot. Many teens and young adults might choose this option over calling and snail-mail.

, One thing to remember about decorating for a party is not to overdo it. Choose one main color and have it carry through all of your decorations.For a Christmas party, good colors to choose would be green, red, gold, or purple.
You can pair your chosen color with white accents to really bring the color scheme together for your Christmas party.

, This will be the first party-related item your guests see when they arrive at your house, so it will effectively set the mood for the entire party. Make sure it matches with your color scheme and is appropriately festive.


You can purchase a wreath at any craft store, or you can Make a Wreath., Instead of strewing decorations all over the room, try to create several focal points instead. This will give the party a much more put-together look rather than just haphazard decorations. It will also help you draw attention to the parts of the party that you want your guests to notice.Some good ideas for focal points at a Christmas party are a decorated Christmas tree, a fireplace, and the refreshments table.

, Decorate a Christmas Tree by putting garlands, lights, and ornaments on it. There are many DIY ornaments on the internet you can make that are very easy. You can also easily buy decorations at any craft store, superstore, and even most grocery stores.Try to Make Christmas Tree Decorations out of pine cones, salt dough, or felt.

, Small decorative touches can really add a lot to the ambiance of a Christmas party. Decorate the dinner table with some small festive accents like Christmas tree ornaments or pinecones. Add some decorative pillows with holiday themes to your furniture.


Try to also include some Christmas knick-knacks around your home. They are a nice detail to a decorative Christmas home.
You can also add some stockings, mistletoe, wreathes, banners, pictures, or candles.

, Delicious food can really help to set the mood for a fun and lively party. Preparing some of the food ahead of time can help you steer clear of any last minute stress that could arise.


For example, if you are making a fresh salad for your guests, you could prepare it the day before and refrigerate it until the party the next day. Just don’t make it too far in advance or the vegetables might get a bit soggy by the time the party rolls around.
Things that can be refrigerated until the party or reheated right before the party are perfect for making ahead of time. This will save you a lot of stress on the day of the party. Some examples include cakes, pies, salads, fruit salads, veggies and dips, and fruit platters.

, Include a variety of items like a meat dish, some sides (vegetables and starches), and some desert. Try to consider if any of the people that will be attending the party have allergies, and plan accordingly.At your holiday party, you could serve a turkey or ham for the main meat dish, along with several sides like peas, corn, potatoes, rolls, and pie.
If your party is more casual, or you don't want to make a turkey, that's perfectly fine. You could tell your guests to bring a dish, or during the party you could have a buffet. There are many Christmas recipes available online.
Be sure to be considerate of any special dietary needs of your guests. Try to include one gluten-free option and one vegetarian/vegan option.

, Everyone loves appetizers at a party. Give your guests a little holiday cheer with some festive holiday appetizers. Try to include some little touches that make the tray more festive – like adding some holiday berries or festive garnishes.You could make a nice cheese platter with pine cones for garnishes or crab salad canapes on a platter of evergreen twigs.

, Consider whether or not you want to serve alcohol at your party. You’ll need to provide a variety of drinks, even if you do not serve alcohol. A good rule of thumb is that the average guest will drink four glasses during the course of the party. Make sure you plan accordingly.If you’re serving alcohol, consider wine, champagne, and/or cocktails.
Whether or not you serve alcohol at your party, you’ll need to serve some nonalcoholic drinks too. Consider sparkling water (fancied up with cranberry juice), nonalcoholic punch, or soda.
Hot chocolate and eggnog are very festive drinks for the holiday season.

, Christmas cookies are a staple of any holiday party. They are tasty and festive, adding to the holiday cheer. You can purchase them in a store or make some yourself.Whether store bought or homemade, display your cookies on a plate or decorative Christmas platter.Try to Make Christmas Tree Cookies from scratch.

, Every good Christmas party needs a well-selected Christmas soundtrack. Include songs from different genres to make sure all of your guests are satisfied. Add classic versions of Christmas songs as well as some contemporary covers. Consider including these songs:“White Christmas” by Bing Crosby
“Blue Christmas” by Elvis Presley
“All I Want for Christmas is You” by Mariah Carey
“Wonderful Christmastime” by Paul McCartney
“I’ll Be Home for Christmas” by Frank Sinatra
“Santa Claus is Coming to Town” by Bruce Springsteen
“Fairytale of New York” by The Pogues

, Making gingerbread houses is a fun activity for people of all ages during the Christmas season. Children and adults alike will enjoy getting their fingers covered in frosting and sneaking pieces of candy while making their house.Make sure you buy all of the necessary supplies such as gingerbread pieces (or graham crackers), frosting, and assorted colorful candies.
Set everything up at its own table so that the mess is contained.
You can even turn it into a competition with a prize for the best gingerbread house., Singing Christmas carols is a wonderful, time honored activity to incorporate into your Christmas party. You can sing along with the stereo versions or have someone play an instrument (if they’re able).


You can even download the lyrics and/or sheet music from online sources if you want to print copies for your guests., This can be a lot of fun for all age groups. The premise of this activity is that everyone brings a silly gift to the party and anonymously selects a gift from the lot. As the game goes on, people can exchange gifts, take gifts from others, or keep their own.For this to work, you’ll have to notify your guests ahead of time so that they can bring a gift and participate. You should indicate that this is a white elephant gift exchange party on the invitation so your guests have at least a week or two to find a gift to bring.
This is a fun way to get to know new people. But make sure you introduce people to get conversations between your guests going.

, Are you going to have a formal sit down meal, or a more relaxed buffet? Write a shopping list and stick to it. Prepare as much as you can the day before the party, avoiding any last minute panics. Keep things simple and easy - the last thing you will want to be doing is slaving away in the kitchen while your guests are having a good time.

, Make sure the area you are planning to hold your party is relatively clean and tidy. Remove any items that you are worried might get broken or in the way, and remember to put out plenty of chairs.

, Greet your guests at the door. Take their coats and see them through to the party area. Make introductions if your guests are not acquainted with each other and start off the conversation.

, This is essential in setting the mood. Have a few CDs ready but don't play them too loudly, people will want to be able to talk.

, Charades or another lively game is always popular at a family get- together, whereas a more adult game will be suitable at a sophisticated get-together. Have plenty of pens, scraps of paper and balloons ready just in case.

, Being the host, people will look at you to set the mood. If you are looking stressed they won't relax. Similarly if you lead the way in having fun - they will follow.

, Especially if you have kids, let them invite friends. It will keep them busy so you can have fun with your friends. Just give them something to do.

Learn that a cookie exchange party is a clever way to encourage the spirit of giving, plenty of warm wishes and lots of fun throughout the day.,
Send out invitations to your guests at least before the date of your cookie exchange.,
Notify those whom are signed up of who is coming, how many people will be there, and how many cookies they will need to bring.,
Request that everyone only makes holiday cookies or expand your collection to include other goodies such as home made candy, chocolate covered pretzels, or other festive sweets.,
Have everyone tell stories.,
Swap family recipes.",How to Host a Christmas Cookie Exchange," With just a little planning, and very little effort, it can be a secret strategy for getting ahead on your holiday baking and ending up with a Santa-sized platter of fantastic cookies in all sorts of tempting varieties.;
, December is a busy and hectic month for most people. For best results, aim for 8-12 confirmed guests. Ask your guests to RSVP as soon as possible, and to let you know what type of cookie they will be bringing. This way you can avoid the dreaded cookie duplication and make sure that their choice fits the exchange.

, Typically you should ask each guest to bring either a dozen or half dozen cookies for each guest, plus a dozen to nibble on at the party.

, Whether you are a host or a guest, you should always try to bake a show-stopping holiday treat. Choose a delectable cookie that is sweet, tasty & pretty. Make yours an impressive melt-in-your mouth treasure that everyone else wants to bring home.

, It could be a story about the cookie's origin, where the recipe comes from, or just a holiday baking memory. Sometimes it’s as much fun trading stories as trading cookies.

, Your friends may have recipes they wish to share, so once the tasting ends, continue the celebration in another delicious way. Be sure to request that each guest bring along copies of their recipe, and put them right on the table next to their cookies. As an added treat, you may even want to assemble a booklet of recipes for everyone to take home with them.

Keep the drinks simple, tasteful, and decorative.,
Set the mood for the party with a Christmas mix.,
Show that the party is about the guests, not the hosts.",How to Host a College Christmas Party," Let your friends know about the event at least one week before it occurs. If mailing out invitations, make sure that they are in the mailbox 10 days before the party. An easy way to invite college friends is by creating a Facebook event. Tell those invited to bring friends. This is a good way to meet people and to make your guests feel comfortable. Have a few close friends help you host the party so that they can invite their other groups of friends as well. This can also work with roommates.;
, Themed college parties allow guests to get dressed up and excited for the event. Cheesy sweater parties are popular at Christmastime. Guests can find sweaters at resale shops, cheaper retail venues, or even in the closet of a friend or parent. Painting sweatshirts is another option for the more creative guests. To avoid awkwardness, make sure that everyone knows the theme of the party.

, Before setting up anything for your party, turn on some Christmas music and get into the spirit of the season. Wrap trees and shrubs in the front of your house with indoor/outdoor lights. This is not only festive, but will make it easier for guests to find your house in the dark. If possible, add a wreath to the front door. If not, tie a large Christmas ribbon around the door to look like a gift. Inside the house, place garlands on any mantles or unused countertops or on top of high cabinets. If a stair rail is present, twist garland around it in a candy cane-type pattern. Decorate each garland with gold beaded garland, ball-shaped ornaments and candy canes. Tie a bow at each end of the banister. On the main table in the house, place a Christmas tablecloth and centerpiece.

, When preparing food for your party, be sure to make it at the right time. Give yourself plenty of time to get the dish ready, but not enough time for it to get cold or melt. Start by preparing foods that will take some time to make. Cookies can be baked up to one day ahead of time and still taste fresh. If you do make them early, remember to keep baked goods covered so that they don’t become stale. Put chips and crackers into decorative bowls or baskets near the dips with which they will be eaten. Keep cold dips chilled until the last minute, and wait to make hot dips until a few minutes before the party. Fruit and vegetable trays should also be kept cold until just before the party begins. Individually wrapped chocolates can be placed in decorative bowls and mugs throughout the room as decoration and for eating.

, Chances are, not all of your guests drink alcohol and some of them will not even feel comfortable around it. To avoid offending any party-goers, consider eliminating alcohol completely from the menu. Use alternatives such as punch, hot cocoa, and soda. Be sure to keep an ice chest near the punch and any other cold drinks being served in case guests want their beverages iced.

, Music is an absolute must at the party. Be sure to make a lively Christmas mix ahead of time that can be played through a CD player or off of an iPod.

, When guests arrive, greet them each individually. If you do not know the guest, try to spend a few minutes getting to know them. Offer guests something to drink and tell them to make themselves at home. Introduce your friends to someone you think they do not know and help get conversations started. Wait until the last guest leaves to start cleaning up so that they don’t feel unwelcome. When everything is cleaned and put away, sit back, relax, and smile because your party is a success!

Admire your work!",How to Paint Easter Lilies in Watercolor,"  You will need a pencil, a sheet of 11"" X 14"" watercolor paper from a pad, an eraser, a support board, primary and secondary watercolors in tubes or a set of dry pads of paint in a tin, an assortment of watercolor brushes, a water bucket, and tissues or paper napkins.
,  Go online and look at pictures of the Easter lily, which is traditionally white.  See how others have drawn the flower by looking at pictures online.

,  If one isn't available, purchase a silk, artificial one.  These craft store flowers are very realistic and have good details. Bouquets from the dollar store give you the shape of the flower but lack essential details.  Just add the details from pictures you've looked at.

,  Use a page or two from a sketchbook, or another piece of watercolor paper.  This will allow you to see the lily's shape and how various parts relate to each other.


,  If you would like to practice how to apply color to the lily, sketches are the way to go. Use your watercolors for practice applying them, too.


If you prefer, color your sketches with colored pencils.  Artist's quality are the best.  They cost a little more but last for a long time and there is more and a better grade of pigment in them than in the child sets.

,  Either orientation of your watercolor paper is fine.  Vertical will allow you to include many blossoms and some buds on one stem.  Horizontal lends itself to placing the flowers in a row, perhaps showing many different angles and views., Sketch your flower in pencil, making it life size.  Correct as you go by erasing bad lines and making new ones.,  Include the stem and make it sturdy enough to support the heavy lily blossoms.  Draw the leaves.,  One way is to immediately paint, in very thin, transparent watercolor shadow shapes on the lilies.  Mix a gray on your palette, from various amounts of the three primaries. Then, dilute a small amount of the gray with clear water and paint with that.

, Not only will you commit to a color scheme, for example, traditional Easter colors of yellow and violet, or any other three colors you desire.  Use a big brush for the background, but change to a round, pointed brush to go around the flowers., Cut their shapes from contact paper, place them on your paper and paint the background first. This is another way to achieve a liquid and fresh background.

, If there are buds, do them, too.

,  Use a pale version of any of the colors in your painting for this.

,  Have four or five stamens coming from the center of the flower. Do this with a liner brush and in one stroke for each.  At the top, make a short, horizontal stroke for the pistil.

, Easter can be rich and satisfying without relying on chocolate and other candies.  A painting of an Easter lily is lasting and can be enjoyed by all for many years.  Creating art can give you a feeling of accomplishment and serve as a special gift to all who view it.

, Alternatively, use any other stuffing material that will keep its shape.

, Leave the rest of the open part that goes around your ankle unstitched  for now, for this part will form the bunny's ears at the end of the tutorial.

, Sew around the bottom part of the sock. Don't stick the needle through the sock though, just sew around it, to create a gathered part (or ""neck"").

, Position the bunny so that you're holding its head up. Press the sides of the sock where the arms will be placed to make sure that there are no cotton balls in the way and simply push any cotton found to be in the way to the side. As well, make sure that there is still cotton on the other side of this area so that the arms aren't flat. Sew an upward, slightly curved line in the the space where you have cleared the cotton. Repeat on the other side to complete both ""arms"". Follow the image for guidance, and if you can't sew without marking the position, then mark the arms first.

, With the head still at the top looking at you, go to what was once the toe of the sock, the non-open end. Center your needle to sew through this part up to the height of about where the bunny's arms end; keep centered as you stitch. Fluff up the cotton balls as needed to help shape the legs. Once completed, this single line should create the bunny's legs.

, Cut small pieces of thin ribbon, twine or yarn long enough for whiskers. Go to the head of the bunny and locate where you'd like to position the nose. Use this line to stitch the whiskers into place - one whisker positioned across the base level of the nose, the other across the top level of the nose. It's recommended that you sew the whiskers on at intervals, for stability. You may even like to weave the thread under the sock threads, if the sock threads are amenable. Each of these stages can be seen in the image.


At this step, once the whiskers are stitched on, stitch a small round nose. Or, stitch on a small button to create the nose if preferred.

, On the part of the sock that normally goes around your ankle, (on top of the bunny's head) cut this in half. Cut straight up to allow the pieces to flop down. You can either leave the ears unstitched if they look okay, or you can decide to stitch them into a firmer ear shape if liked. If they need stiffening, cut small leaf shapes from thin cardboard and insert inside each ear and stitch around.

, You're at liberty to finish the face as wished but the image shows one possible approach of a simple stitched circle to give the effect of the rabbit's snout end, a simple stitched smile and two googly eyes stuck into place. You could also use buttons for eyes and nose and use different colors of thread for any features.

, Anytime you need to replace a bulb in a strand of lights, you should always find a replacement bulb with the same voltage as the original. Look under the tag on the strand of lights to find voltage information.

, Some light strands blink because they have special bulbs that twinkle. If that’s the case with your lights, you can get rid of the twinkle feature by switching out the bulbs.


Oftentimes, the bulbs that blink on these strands will be marked with red or silver tips.However, if they aren’t marked, plug in the strand, let it warm up, and use a small piece of masking tape to mark each blinking bulb., First, unplug the lights. Then, for each blinking bulb, hold the bulb by the base (where the light attaches to the strand) and pull out the bulb and the bottom casing. Remove the bulbs from the casing.If you have trouble removing the bulb and casing, use a screwdriver to pry the light out.

, For every blinking bulb that you removed, you want to replace it with a non-blinking bulb. Insert the new bulb into the case, making sure the two wires on the end go through the holes in the bottom of the case.


Fold the wires back so they rest against the side of the casing.
When you have finished, reinsert the new bulb and casing back into the base.

, When you have replaced all the blinking bulbs and returned them all to their bases on the light strand, plug in the lights and test them. Give them a few minutes to warm up.

, Some lights have the twinkle function run by a control box that contains wires and a simple electrical board. Because this method involves cutting and splicing wires, it requires much more care and attention. Before you start, it’s very important to ensure the lights are unplugged and not wrapped around the tree.

, It will be a small rectangular box, and it’s usually located near the plug. You’ll know it’s the control box because the lights from the wires and the electrical plug will all run through it.

, Some are glued, some are screwed, and some are clipped together. You may need a screwdriver to remove the screws, or you may need one to pry apart the control box.


Once open, remove the contents of the box, including the electrical board and the wires.

, Use wire cutters or sharp scissors to cut the power cord where it’s connected to the electrical board. Then, cut the hot wires and the neutral wire., For the hot and neutral wire, strip about an inch of the wire coating off each of the wires. An inch from the top, use the scissors to cut through just the top layer of coating. Use your fingers, the scissors, or pliers to grip the coating and pull it off.


For the power cable, peel apart the two sides and separate the first two to three inches of cable. Then strip an inch of wire coating off each side to expose the wires beneath.

, Use a multimeter to determine the neutral wire and the hot wires. When you’ve located the hot wires, line them up side by side and then gently twist them all together. Leave the neutral wire aside for now.

, Take one of the two sides of the power cord and twist that together with the hot wires. Then, twist together the other side of the power cord and the neutral wire., Before testing your lights, wrap the exposed wires with electrical tape. First tape the hot wires where they meet the power, then separately tape the neutral wires where the meet they power cord, then tape it all together.


If the two sides of the power cable are wrapped around each other, untangle them.
Test your lights. Be sure to watch for smoke and sparks, especially where you spliced the wires.

, This method will stop LED lights from blinking, especially if they weren’t meant to twinkle in the first place. LED lights will sometimes flicker because electricity only flows through them one way, so when they are plugged into an alternating current power source, they flicker off when they don’t get any power.A bridge rectifier will convert the power going to the lights to direct current, meaning they won’t flicker on and off.You can purchase one at an electronics store or online.
Make sure you buy one that matches the voltage of your lights.

, Again, this method requires extreme caution and is best only pursued if you have some background knowledge about electronics and wiring. You could electrocute yourself or cause a fire if you attempt these steps otherwise.

, Halfway between the last light on the strand and the power plug, use wire cutters or sharp scissors to cut through the two wires. Take the wires attached to the plug and untangle them. Next, strip off an inch of wire coating to expose the wires.


When you have finished, slide an inch-long piece of heat shrink over each wire., Make sure you attach each wire to one of the AC pins on the bridge rectifier. It doesn’t matter which wire goes to which pin, since it’s an alternating current., First, untangle the wires (if they’re wound around each other) and strip off an inch of wire coating from the two wires attached to the light strand. Next, use a multimeter to determine which wire is positive and which is negative.


Make a note of which wire is which, and then slide a one-inch long piece of heat shrink over each wire.

, Solder the positive wire to the positive pin on the rectifier, and the negative wire to the negative pin on the rectifier.

, When you have soldered all the wires to attach the plug and the lights to the bridge rectifier, position the heat shrink over the exposed wires. One at a time, activate the heat shrink by applying the heat from a heat gun or blow dryer to the area.


When you’ve finished, plug in the lights and test them out.

Get an empty can of Pringles.,
Cut a slit in the top of the can.,
Slip one end of the lights into the slit.,
Wrap the lights around the can.,
Place the lid on the Pringles can.,
Wrap the can in tissue paper.",How to Store Christmas Lights2," Make sure you rinse out the inside of the tube- this isn't to protect your lights, but if there are crumbs left inside it could attract bugs to your storage area.


As an alternative, you could also use the cardboard tube from a paper towel roll for this method. The steps will be the same, except you won't be placing a lid on the cardboard tube.

, Using a pair of heavy scissors, cut a vertical slit on the top of the can. The slit should be about an inch long., You can widen the slit with further cutting if the wire from the lights won't fit.

, Work your way down to the bottom of the can, then go back up to the top. Tuck the end of the lights into the same slit at the top of the can. This should leave you with the lights wrapped around the can with both ends resting in the slit on top., This will prevent the ends from slipping out of the slit and unraveling your lights during storage.

, To protect the lights during storage, you can wrap a few layers of tissue paper around the can. This should be done especially if you're placing the lights in a box with other items."
"
Get a plastic hanger.,
Tuck one end of the lights into one of the hooks.If your hanger doesn't have hooks, you can just tie the end to the body of the hanger.

,
Wrap the lights around the outside of the hanger.,
Tuck the remaining end into the other hook.,
Store the hanger.",How to Store Christmas Lights3," Ideally, the hanger will have a little hook on each side of the body. You can still use this method if you hanger doesn't have hooks, but the hooks will make wrapping the lights much easier.

,, Gradually work your way to the other side of the hanger, then work back to the original side. You'll probably have to do this a few times to get the whole string on the hanger.

, Make sure you leave enough string at the end to reach the last hook.If there isn't enough room or your hanger doesn't have hooks, just tuck the end in between the strands of lights.

, You can either place the lights in a box, or, since this is a hanger, you can hang it conveniently out of the way until next Christmas.


If storing with other items, make sure to wrap the hanger in tissue paper for protection.

"
Get a power cord holder.,
Insert the lights into the cord holder and wind them up.,
Plug in more lights if you have them.,
Store the lights until next year.",How to Store Christmas Lights4," These are available at most hardware store. There are several different kinds. You'll want a larger one designed for heavy outdoor electrical cords., Do this carefully to make sure you don't break any lights.

, The good thing about this method is that you can put multiple strands of lights into the same place. Just plug the new set of lights into the end of the old one and keep winding as long as you have room on the holder., You can place the power cord holder on a shelf, in a box, or hang it up if it has a hook.

Pinch the second light of the strand between your index finger and thumb.,
Pull the fourth light up and pinch it next to the second one.,
Continue matching the even lights to the top of your hand and the odd lights at the bottom.,
Wrap the remaining cord around the bunch and plug the two sides in.",How to Store Christmas Lights5," This should cause the first and third lights to fall next to each other in your palm., Now, the first, third, and fifth lights should be in your palm.

, Keeping this sequence going should keep the lights in an even pattern that will prevent tangling., When you're done wrapping, you should have a tight bunch of lights and the two plugs remaining. Wrap the small sections attached to the plugs around the bunch to keep it together. Then plug them into each other and you're all done."

, Make sure it is an uncluttered background so that the pictures look clean.

, For instance, red and green will get well with the Christmas theme.

, Consider the weather and the time of day for the best light.


Avoid taking photographs outdoors on cloudy or overcast days, but remember to also avoid bright sunlight if you don't want to be squinting.

,

Remember to use freshly-charged batteries for the camera so that you can enjoy clicking more photos without worrying about the batteries.






Clean the camera lens for dust and fingerprints.







, Adjust the “image quality” and “image resolution” to their highest settings of your camera.

, While clicking the snaps, adjust the zoom lens so that you get to click the smiling faces of the persons who are being photographed. The receivers of the photo Christmas cards will love to see the faces of your family members and pets.

, It is a good option to avoid the “red-eye reduction” flash setting of your camera as it gives rise to a series of pre-flashes or a steady light. This can become the reason for people to blink abnormally or shut their eyes while the pictures are clicked.

, Put your camera on a tripod so that it remains steady while the picture is being clicked. Or you can ask a friend or someone to handle the camera for you.

, Remind everyone to keep looking toward the camera and not glance away. This helps in getting a better photograph.

, Don't just click one photograph, it is a good idea to shoot again and again. It will cost nothing and you can come up with plenty of options to choose from.

, Instead of choosing just one photograph, you can assemble individual photos of each family member into a collage and use it in the photo Christmas card.

, This can be a long account of what went on during the year, or simply ""Happy Holidays!"".

, Look for a company that deals with photo greeting cards. It is more convenient and economical way to get your photo Christmas cards printed by some professional photo greeting card agency. You can select a card template and have it personalized with photos, family names and greetings."

Decide whether to blow the egg or simply use it hard boiled.,
Make the dye.,
Pull out the paper and discard.,
Draw or paint a design onto the egg with the crayon or hot wax.,
Pour the dye into a small dish.,
Dip the wax designed egg into the lightest dye.,
Remove the dyed egg and dry with a tissue.

,
Light a candle.,
Continue with additional dyes and new wax areas if wished.,
Put the batik eggs on display.",How to Make Batik Eggs," If blowing the egg, do so by making a small hole both ends of the egg, using a pin. Blow out the content (use some strength) and keep the egg and yolk for cooking.


Bear in mind that blown eggs are a lot more fragile than whole boiled eggs.





;
, If you're not using food dye, you'll need to make your own from crepe paper. Cut the crepe paper into strips about 1""/2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) wide. Put them into a bowl and cover with hot water. This will release the dye.

, Add one tablespoon of white vinegar; this sets the dye. Allow to cool before using.

, Any area of the egg where you don't want the dye to color should have wax or crayon on it.


Drip candle wax for clear egg color to show through. The wax is hot, so take care using it and if working with children, do the hot wax part yourself and then let them use crayons on the egg if needed.







, Start with the lightest dye first, gradually building up to the darkest choice over subsequent layers.

, Leave it in the dye until the dye takes and is the desired color.

,, Hold the egg to the side of the candle to melt off the wax. Soak up the melting wax from the egg with paper towels or a soft cloth. Be gentle so as to avoid scratching or marring the design on the surface.


An alternative method to remove the wax is to place the egg in the oven at a moderate setting (350ºF/180ºC). The wax will melt in about two minutes and it can be quickly wiped off with paper towel on removing the egg from the oven.







, Simply follow the steps outlined above up to five times (putting wax on, dipping in dye, removing wax with heat) and graduating from lightest to darkest dye colors.

, They make wonderful additions to Easter baskets, Easter displays or simply added to an Easter table for a quick decoration.


Be aware that with each subsequent layer, it may take longer for the darker dyes to take; just be patient.

Make a list of people to send cards to.,
Choose an appropriate card design.,
Order a custom printed card.,
Make a homemade Christmas card.",How to Send Christmas Cards1," Like St. Nick, you'll want to make a list and check it twice. This way you'll buy enough cards at the store and won't forget anyone. You can also check off people's names as you finish each card.


It's a good idea to double-check the addresses of people on your list during this stage.;
, Select a Christmas card that fits with the holiday or appeals to your loved ones. You could get a card with a Christmas tree, angel, Santa, or red robin on it.


There are also humorous cards available, if you have loved ones with a funny bone.

, Many custom print shops offer holiday themed cards for less than a local printer.These sites typically allow you to select your quantity, cardstock, images, even a family photo, and write a nice message inside.


Many shops have a minimum number of cards they need to print.
Make sure to order your custom cards several weeks ahead of the holidays. This gives the printer plenty of time to get the order made and sent to you.
Take a holiday themed family photo with yourself and loved ones wearing Christmas sweaters. You can upload this to use as the cover image on a photo card.

, Purchase some blank cardstock and holiday themed craft supplies to experiment with your own holiday cards. You can use an ink stamp with the words, ""Merry Christmas,"" on it to make a message inside the card.


Create paper cutouts of holiday items by using simple templates to cut images from recycled paper.You can take images from magazines and turn them into Christmas trees, ornaments, and snowmen. Use a glue stick to adhere the images to your cardstock.
Decorate the card with some white, red, green, or silver glitter to enhance your design.

Plan ahead.,
Make sure you are able to purchase stamps.,
Plan for delays, if the post office is a tiny hamlet post office.,
Plan for delays, if the post office is one of many post offices in big metropolitan cities containing many ZIP codes.,
Know if and when each class of mail is able to be sent to be successfully delivered at the destination.,
Recognize alternate forms of sending the card.,
Give the intended recipient a ""heads up"" (email or phone call) to ensure that the recipient knows that there is a card on its way.",How to Send Christmas Cards On Time in the United States," Write and assemble your Christmas cards within the week following Thanksgiving.;
, Have the envelope containing the card reach its destination in time. Either use the website version of the shipping company try to determine an approximate delivery date and time, or take it to the shipping center or USPS to see what their best route is to bring it to where it needs to go.

While most places from one coast can reach the other coast in about a week during the normal rest of the year, during Christmas, things get interesting, and for a card to travel from coast to coast could then take a week and a half.

, The smaller the town's post office, the harder the office makes it to reach the person in time. With a bunch of different Christmas cards arriving at the same time, the organizational task of keeping things ready to ""head out the door successfully"" is a challenge., When Christmas cards come in to big metropolitan cities, they come in to one post office and are dispersed to their component zip code post office for delivery to the recipient. That change-over could cause problems., Each post office has a certain period of time that they will allow for, before the post office says ""the card won't reach its intended destination for Christmas"". Know these dates.

Select a quicker route if you've missed that style's deadline. Between priority mail (a turnaround of 2-3 days) and express mail (for those looking for a next day turnaround (even on Sundays), the USPS has some type of system to mail your cards and get them there on time.

, While other delivery companies may not like to send things which aren't in their form of packaging, try other companies. Use either UPS or FedEx. Sometimes, these companies can get it there before Christmas (or on Christmas (Eve)), but you'll have to make sure you follow the policies of the other companies as well., Do this if you suspect it could cut it close to the deadline day.

Write a greeting.,
Write a salutation in the middle of the card.,
Finish it off with a closing statement.,
Add a memento or gift item.",How to Send Christmas Cards2," Write ""Dear,"" or ""To,"" and then, the addressee's name. This should go near the top of the inside of the card. Some people like to place the greeting above any pre-printed messages in the card., You don't have to include this if the card already has a pre-printed message. However, it helps to personalize the card with a short holiday themed salutation.


It can be something as simple as ""Merry Christmas!""
If you want, write a little passage just below the salutation! Something like a poem, a short message, or a passage about the person works.

, These are short phrases or words that signal the end of your message within the card. You'll also place your name directly after or below the closing.


For example, you can use, ""From, Your Name"", as a closing statement.
Other closing statements to try include: love, yours sincerely, yours faithfully, best wishes, season's blessings, or even a few X's and O's, which mean ""Hugs and Kisses""., People often include small things, such as photographs, with annual Christmas cards. This serves to update others on how your family has changed and provide more in-depth information that can't be written in the card itself.


Collect together a few family photos or school photos of your children to place inside the cards.
You may also want to purchase a gift card to a restaurant or store where the addressee lives to include as a more substantial item.
You can also write a ""Christmas Letter"" with more information about what has happened during the year. Most letters reference positive events, such as awards, family trips, or new jobs.Save some time by writing the letter in a word processing document and printing out multiple copies for each of the Christmas cards you'll send.

Address the envelope to your addressee.,
Write a return address on the envelope.,
Place your card inside the envelope.,
Put a stamp on the upper right corner of the envelope.",How to Send Christmas Cards3," Most store-bought cards come with an envelope, if not, you can buy one separate. Write the address on the center of the front of the envelope.The address should include the person's name, street and house or apartment number, city, state, and zip code.

, If the post office has trouble delivering your card, they'll be able to send it back to you at this address.


You can write the return address on the upper left corner of the envelope or on the top center of the back flap.

, Most envelopes have pre-applied adhesive on the flap that you can activate by wetting. When you close the flap, press firmly along the edge to ensure a good seal.


You can lick the adhesive on the envelope with your tongue.
You may also use a slightly damp sponge, cotton swab, or an envelope moistener to wet the adhesive.Another option is to use a glue stick to seal the envelope. This works well when the adhesive isn't strong.

, The post office offers holiday themed stamps, if you want to use them on your Christmas Cards. Once the envelope is sealed and stamped you can place it in the nearest postal mailbox for delivery."

Consider possible themes or staging options.,
Choose a setting for the photo.,
Decide what kind of clothing or costumes you want.,
Figure out which camera you’re going to use.,
Ask a friend to take the shots or practice using your camera’s timer function.,
Shoot in the early morning or late afternoon.,
Experiment with different poses and expressions.,
Direct your family to close their eyes and open on three.,
Do some light photo editing.",How to Take a Family Photo for Your Christmas Cards1," Once you’ve decided to take the family photo for your Christmas card, think about what you’d like the photo to look like. For example, you might decide that you want a true-to-life arrangement that features your family doing an activity you all love, such as cooking, camping, or playing catch.If you’re a creative type who loves big, over-the-top projects, you can even develop a concept complete with matching wardrobe, props, and staging.


If you consider your pets to be a part of your family, consider including them in your photos. After all, your Christmas card photo will be all the more memorable and touching if it captures your family in its natural state, and nothing would be more unnatural than excluding an important and much-loved family member!
If you’re drawing a blank when it comes to holiday inspiration, browse through some online photo galleries such as Pinterest and Tumblr to get your creative juices flowing.;
, Once you know what genre you’re going for, you can decide where you want to shoot the photo. Traditional arrangements often feature simple living-room backgrounds of fireplaces, colored lights, and Christmas trees, but you don’t have to limit yourself to these options. If you live near some snowy landscapes or pine or spruce forests, you could set up an outdoor photo shoot with everyone bundled up in winter gear. Or, if you’re more of a city mouse, urban landscapes such as brick facades, old trains, and parks can make for beautiful and unique backdrops to your photo.You can also check out the events calendar in your local newspaper for any upcoming parades, winter festivals, or concerts which could provide effective backdrops for your photo.

, Your grandparents’ family portraits probably stipulated that everyone wear matching black sweaters or all-white ensembles, but contemporary photography demands no such uniform. Just make sure you’ve planned it ahead of time so that everyone knows what they need to show up wearing on the day of the photo shoot.


Depending on what kind of theme and tone you’re going for, you can all wear uncoordinated, everyday clothing, themed sweaters, cozy pajamas, or even goofy matching onesies.
Many photographers will advise their subjects not to wear anything too distracting—for example a loud print or something with a lot of text on it—so keep this rule of thumb in mind if you’re leaning toward letting everyone pick their own ensemble., Plenty of camera snobs and pros will tell you not to bother to take your own photos if you’re not using a professional-grade camera, but this axiom isn’t necessarily true. As long as you’ve adjusted for lighting, exposure, and composition, you can use a basic digital camera or even a cell phone camera to capture your Christmas magic.That being said, if your cell phone is relatively old or has less than eight megapixels, you might want to ask a friend or family member to use their better quality device.If you love taking photos and challenging yourself to get that perfect shot, you might want to consider investing in a high-quality camera. Check seasonal sales and specialty stores to find a good deal.

, Since you’ll want to take as many different and varied photographs as possible, it’s probably easiest to ask someone not posing in the photo to snap the shots. If there’s no one available, though, make sure you familiarize yourself with your camera’s timer function or remote control. Practice taking shots of yourself and others using these functions, then review the results to make sure you’ve got the knack.You can improvise with setting your camera on any available flat surface and adjusting the height, but it’s probably easiest and most dependable to purchase or borrow a tripod.

, Lighting is one of the most important conditions determining photo quality, so pay attention to the time of day and the devices you’re using. If you’re using natural light, shoot in the morning or evening when the sun is on the horizon, as these are the times when light is most dramatic and provides the sharpest contrasts.If you’re photographing indoors, try to shoot in plenty of natural light, or use a ring flash to create effective, rich contrast and shadows.Unless you’re using a fancy, pro-grade camera, try to avoid using the flash. A basic flash shoots parallel to the camera lens, creating flat, washed-out photos with no background., Traditional family portraits generally demand that everyone line up looking toward the camera with grins frozen on their faces. There’s nothing wrong with this kind of photo necessarily, but taking lots of photos throughout the shoot—including ones with candid conversations, laughing, and turned heads—is more likely to capture your family’s natural and unique dynamic.


If you’re using a cell phone camera and it has a burst function, use it! The rapid-fire sequence of shots will be more likely to capture a moment when no one is blinking or making an awkward face.While you shouldn’t discourage movement and natural gestures, aim to keep everyone grouped closely together in order to avoid uneven gaps in your composition., Everyone who has ever attempted photographing a group knows the struggle of getting a shot when no one is blinking. Though it can feel like a game of roulette, you can take the chance out of the equation by having all of your subjects close their eyes. Count to three and have everyone open their eyes on the third count.This trick isn’t fool-proof, and it won’t work when you’re taking lots of candids, but it’s a useful way to make sure you get at least one or two uniformly wide-eyed shots.

, You don’t have to be a certified Photoshop expert to tinker with your photos and improve some basic exposure and contrast issues. When reviewing your photos and deciding which are candidates for your Christmas card, play around with the sliding exposure and contrast scales or the red eye tool—two of the easier functions to master in most photo editing software—and see if it helps."

Check out local photographers’ prices and portfolios.,
Consult your photographer about your ideas.,
Schedule a shoot at least two months before Christmas.,
Ask your photographer for recommendations regarding styling and setting.,
Take direction from your photographer.,
Review proofs when the photographer publishes them.",How to Take a Family Photo for Your Christmas Cards2," If you’re not confident in your photography skills, or you just don’t want to deal with the headache of shooting your own Christmas card, look into professional services that can do the grunt work for you. Not only will they be able to frame and shoot a higher quality photo, but they’ll have expensive, professional grade software to edit and polish your photos once they’ve been taken.


Look for professional photographers online. Many of these independently operating pros might charge out of your price range, but you can usually browse their price packages on their websites.
Be sure not to automatically opt for the cheapest option: while chances are that the professional you hire will be competent, they might have a very different style than what you had envisioned.If you have a friend who recently got married or had another special event for which they hired a professional photographer, ask them who they hired and if they would so again.

, Before hiring a professional photographer, you should meet with them or speak on the phone in order to discuss your ideas for the shoot. If you have very specific ideas of what you want, be sure to let your photographer know so that they can advise you as to their feasibility. If you don’t have much direction, ask the photographer for any ideas they might have, or what their typical Christmas card concepts look like.


Also be sure to ask what kind of refund or re-shoot options they offer. Due to the highly digitized nature of contemporary photography, many photographers will offer free refunds or options to re-shoot your cards at a discounted rate if you’re unhappy with the results.

, Even though you’re using a professional, don’t assume everything will go smoothly. The weather might sour and cause problems with lighting, or you might hate the way your chosen outfits turned out on camera. Whatever the case, you can prevent a Christmas card disaster by planning early so that you have time to schedule another shoot.


If you’re trying to wrangle a large group of extended family and relatives, send out a 'Save the date' notice like you would for a wedding or big party.

, You’re not just paying your photographer for their fancy camera, software, and composition know-how: a big part of the service professional photographers offer is their experience. After all, chances are they’ve shot hundreds of families in many different environments and conditions, and this experience yields valuable insight and strategies for family photo shoots.Take advantage of this expertise by asking detailed questions about how you should prepare for the shoot.


Be specific! Ask what colors photograph well, what kind of makeup will look best in the lighting you’ll be using, and what setting and posing would be optimal for the number of people in your family.

, Not only does your photographer have experience with the technical aspects of composition and cameras, they’re also likely to be well-trained in the art of prompting and directing their subjects. They can put your family at ease, give helpful instructions as to where to look and how to stand, and adjust any buttons or lenses which may reflect and cause glares in the image., As soon as your photographer gives you your photos, browse through them and pick out your favorites. Just be sure to look attentively at all of the subjects in the photo rather than focusing just on yourself: the last thing you want your Christmas card to do is start a lasting family resentment over an unflattering angle or a poorly timed blink.


Many photographers these days use online photo galleries to let you look at the results of your photoshoot. You'll receive a password to access your photos and then you can browse to your heart's content before selecting your favorite.Once you’ve whittled down the photos and made a short-list of card-worthy candidates, gather your family together to get final approval on the photo. This will help you make sure that everyone is happy with the finished product and proud to have the image distributed to relatives and friends.

If they've talked about Easter in other places, they may not realize its biblical importance. Recount the full story to your children. While you can read directly from the Bible, pause to explain parts of the story that may be confusing. Depending on the Bible you use, language may not always be accessible to children.You should tell your children the basic story of Christ's persecution and resurrection. Explain to them how the days of Easter commemorate this. It can be helpful to discuss specific events as they relate to each day of the Easter weekend.
Try to use somewhat simplified language and teach children new vocabulary terms as you go. For example, ""Christ was betrayed by Judas. Does anyone know what the word 'betrayed' means?"";
, If you already have a children's Bible, make use of it. If you do not, purchase one online or at a local Christian bookstore. Children's Bibles often use language, symbolism, and allegories that can help simplify Biblical stories. If your child is struggling to understand the meaning of Easter, this can help., It's okay if you're not completely sure how to explain the story to your children. Even after going over the story with them, there may still be some confusion. Take your kids to church more during the Easter months. Take advantage of extra services and, if they're offered, Sunday school services. It can be helpful for children to hear about the resurrection from Christian figures of authority, such as priests and Sunday school teachers, to get a fuller understanding.If you have time, take your kids to all the services around the Easter holiday. Ash Wednesday, Holy Thursday, and Good Friday services can help your kids understand the meaning of the holiday.
If Sunday school classes are offered before or after these services, have your children attend. This way, they will have an opportunity to hear the stories in a child-friendly manner and ask any questions they have.

, There are many children's books on the market that explain Easter to kids. Rather than focusing on commercial aspects like painting eggs and the Easter bunny, such books talk directly about the resurrection of Christ. You can order these books online or pick them up at a local Christian bookstore.What is Easter by Michelle Medlock Adams is a book for very young children that makes use of illustrations to explain the story of Jesus.
If your kids like the Berenstain Bears books, pick up a copy of The Berenstain Bears and the Easter Story by Mike Berenstain. In the story, Papa Bear explains the story of Easter.
For slightly older children, pick up a copy of C.S Lewis's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. This is an allegorical story that illustrates Christ's redemption and resurrection through an imaginary world.You may have to help children understand the connection to the Biblical story by explaining, for example, that Aslan represents Jesus. This book works best for older kids who already know the basics.

, The resurrection of Christ is a vital aspect of Christianity. Easter is a great time to teach this significance. In addition to explaining the story itself, explain why it matters.Explain to children that Jesus died for our sins. Tell them something like, ""Jesus was the lamb of God because he was a sacrifice. Unlike you and me, Jesus was perfect. Because of that, he was an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of others.""
Try to phrase this in a positive manner. Explain to children that, according to your beliefs, Jesus's death means they themselves will experience bodily resurrection. For example, ""It may seem sad that Jesus had to die, but he was born again. His birth means that we can become perfect too by living through his words. We can also be reborn after death.""

, You want to teach your children the values Jesus lived for during the Easter season. Easter baskets are often part of the commercialization of Easter, but you can make them into a learning experience. Rather than providing your children with their own Easter baskets, have them make baskets for others. You can have your children make Easter baskets to give to others in their church.Have your children place fun gifts in the Easter baskets, such as candy and baked goods. However, you should also provide some gifts that encourage your children to learn about the holiday.
For example, have your kids write out scripture on small pieces of paper. You can have your kids decorate this paper as well. You can then roll up the papers and place them in plastic Easter eggs.

, You do not want your children to feel they're missing out on the fun of the season. Painting eggs can be a great activity for young children. However, try to make the eggs relate to the Biblical story by incorporating Christian symbolism.Use color as metaphor. Have black represent sin, red represent Christ's death, blue represent sadness, and yellow can be his resurrection. You can leave some eggs white, to represent being purified by Christ's death. Colors like green can represent new life.
Talk to your children throughout the process of making eggs. Say things like, ""You're making a black egg. What does that represent? Do you remember what you learned in Sunday School?""

, It's important children understand the positive aspects of Easter. While the story is at times sad, it ultimately represents new life and rebirth. Give your children gifts that represent this and use them as a way to talk about the meaning of Easter.Get plush toys that represent new life. For example, get toys of baby animals like chicks, calves, and piglets.
Some parents like to get kids very small, easy pets, like goldfish. These can represent new life as well. For example, ""That goldfish is very young and new. What does new life have to do with Easter?"" However, only get a pet if you have the time and money for it.

, Hide a variety of items in your house that relate to the story of Jesus. You can hide a rock, two sticks, and something in colors that represent the season. Something green, for example, can represent new life.Send your kids out with a list of items to find. Once children return with all the items, talk to them about how they relate to Jesus.
For example, say something like, ""What do sticks have to do with what we learned about Easter? What kind of object can you make with two sticks?""

, If your children are very young, you may not want to go overboard on details of Christ's death. While you can let children know that Christ was put to death, try to place the primary focus on the resurrection. Talk more about the details of Jesus's rebirth to avoid scaring young children.For example, you can say something like, ""Jesus did die, and it was very sad, but it's okay because he came back to life."" Then, talk over the details of the resurrection story.
This may be confusing at first to young children, who may have trouble understanding the chronology of Biblical events. However, this is just a start. You will have plenty of time to go into further details as your children get older.

, As you start sharing more details of Jesus's death with children, let them know it's okay to be upset. Do not force them to suppress their emotional reaction. Tell your children that it's okay to cry and feel sad, especially on the days of Easter weekend where you talk a lot about the crucifixion of Christ.However, you should also remind of the significance of their pain. Say something like, ""It's okay to be sad, but remember Jesus died so we don't have to deal with this kind of pain alone.""

, As Easter comes to a close, remind your children to focus on new life. Talk to your children about how they will be born again through Christ. You want to end Easter on a positive note. That way, next year, your children will be eager to celebrate the holiday and embrace its religious meaning."

, The first task is to rent a venue; a village hall is the ideal place.

, If this is an event for a school then maybe you can ask some of the teachers to help. If not, then you can ask parents.

, If you're going to be doing craft, then you'll need materials. Buy some colourful card and paper, some glue, glitter, scissors and some pens. If you have a fairly large budget, then maybe you can even buy decorations do make the venue look festive.

, Be sure to send out letters to all the children's parents and maybe make some posters and flyers to advertise the event. This can be done in tandem with advertising for the actual parade, as described below.

, If you want to, you can organise more activities for the children, like Easter cake or biscuit decorating and Easter egg hunts.

, The festivities can start on a smaller scale, at home. You can print simple hat or crown templates onto card and give them out to the children for them to decorate at home and bring to the parade.

, Decide who to invite - whether your friends, or the friends of your children, or a range of local children or students. Particularly if this is a public or school event, send a letter to the parents with a permission slip for the parade, explaining everything about the event.


In your invitations and flyers, make it clear - if using this method - that people will need to come with hats already made or decorated.







, To add a little more excitement to the event, you can make it a competition for the best decorated hat. Provide a prize!

, This could be at a park, a town square, the high street, or anywhere else of your choosing. For public locations, you may need to obtain permits and ensure that certain safety requirements are met. Do your research with the local government, or the owner of the property you're using, so that you're not caught unprepared.

, Decide who to invite - whether your friends, or the friends of your children, or a wide range of local children or students. Make sure you have enough room for your invitees.


You can mail or give invitations to specific children, or advertise more widely with flyers and mailers. However, just make sure that you're prepared for people to attend (even without RSVP-ing). Don't invite the whole town if you can only accommodate 5 children, and on the other hand don't rent out a huge venue if you're only expecting a couple of attendees. Plan according to your audience.







, Maybe a local samba band to march in the parade and provide music.

, To give your location some extra festivity, you can add some lanterns, fairy lights, or handmade decorations made by the children.

, If you want the parade to have a little extra magic, you can get the children to make Easter flags to carry, maybe in the shape of animals like rabbits or chicks.

Check in with your volunteers frequently.,
Show your gratitude.",How to Plan an Easter Egg Hunt," The first thing you need to do is decide on the date and time you want to have your Easter egg hunt. You should keep in mind that people often have family or religious plans the day of Easter.


You may want to plan your egg hunt for the day before, the weekend before, or the weekend after Easter.
Late morning or afternoon work well for the time of your egg hunt. These times give parents a chance to get their kids ready for the day, and younger children will be less cranky having just woken up or already had an afternoon nap.;
, An Easter egg hunt is perfect for any age group. However, it's a good idea to keep the age of your guests in mind. Younger children will need the eggs to be hidden in places they can easily reach, and toddlers will likely need the eggs spread across the lawn.


For older guests, you don't have to worry as much about your egg hiding location. Consider hiding the eggs in trees, bushes, on top of car tires, under or inside objects, and so on., You may want to centralize your egg hunt in one location, or you may want to plan a few separate courses. Separate courses can be especially useful when you have a wide age range of egg hunters. This way you can divide age groups by location.


If you are planning to conduct the egg hunt in your yard, you may want to have a backup plan ready in case the weather turns nasty. This activity will vary according to age group, but you might consider Duck, Duck, Goose, board games, card games, or watching a movie.
You can provide shade for younger children by putting up a large tent or stringing a tarp between posts, trees, or existing structures.
Indoor Easter egg hunts will require you to remove furniture that might get in the way or be potentially dangerous. Pointy edged chairs and tables, glass knick-knacks, and similar items can be easily knocked over and cause harm., When you have a wide range of age groups taking part in the same Easter egg hunt, it might help to use strategies to keep things fair. For example, you might give younger age groups a head start or instruct older children to not collect eggs in plain sight.


These strategies are also important to keep in mind for children with special needs who may need more time.

, The boundary will prevent children from wandering too far away while hunting for eggs. For an outdoor hunt, for instance, the boundary might be the backyard. Tell the kids that all the eggs are hidden within the backyard and that they will find nothing beyond the fence. For an indoor hunt, you might choose a few rooms for the hunt to take place in.


Make sure all participating egg hunters know the boundaries clearly at the start of the game. This will help keep kids from wandering off and ensure better supervision and safety., There may be hazards, like holes, dangerous garbage or litter, or even territorial wild animals, like snapping turtles or blue jays, that can negatively impact your egg hunt. Be sure you thoroughly walk the area to best prevent children from harm from these things.


Beyond the human safety concern, if you are organizing an egg hunt for your company or church, these hazards can be a serious liability.

, This is less of an issue if you're having a closed Easter egg hunt for a specific group, like families in your company or church. But even at a closed hunt, families may bring friends, neighbors, or guests. Open egg hunts can have a large range of participants. It's better to be prepared with extra than to have children disappointed by a scant egg hunt.


If you have a list of participants, you might predict that every third family will bring at least one guest, and plan additional eggs for these potential participants just in case.
If you're having an open egg hunt, you can use previous years to predict participation. You should also take into account advertising and promotion. If you've promoted about twice as much as the year before, you may want to hide twice as many eggs.
How many eggs you plan per hunter is completely up to your preference. Many families may come with baskets, which can make smaller quantities of eggs look sparse. To combat this, you may want to plan 10 - 15 eggs hidden per hunter.

, This will prevent you from losing eggs in your yard or the park, but this will also help you give hints if hunters are having difficulty. Sometimes hiding spots you might think obvious are missed.


A list will also help you to make sure your eggs are spread across the hunting area so that more kids have a chance to find eggs.
If you choose to make a map, it doesn't have to be completely accurate. You might sketch out the basic boundary and use simple shapes to represent things like trees and shrubs., Small candies that fit inside your Easter eggs are a common prize for Easter egg hunts. When using candy as a prize, you should keep in mind the time of day. Holding your egg hunt around midday or early afternoon will be warmer and could result in melted chocolate.You should also take allergies into account. If you've included candies in your eggs that have a common allergen, like nuts, you should inform parents and egg hunters of this before starting.

, At your local dollar store you may be able to find large packages of small figurines, stickers, temporary tattoos, or other toys that fit inside the Easter eggs you'll be hiding. Depending on the size of the prize, you may be able to include a few of these in each egg.Try to select packages of prizes that come in a wide variety. If all your eggs have the same item, children may be disappointed they don't have a unique prize.

, This is an optional variation of the traditional Easter egg hunt. When using clues, you should try to keep egg locations separate to decrease the chances of a hunter or team finding an egg not their own.Coming up with lots of little clues can be difficult and time consuming. To make this easier on yourself, you may want your clue-based hunt to be done in groups.
An example of a clue might look something like, ""The next egg you are looking for doesn't like the sun and it sits like an acorn on the ground.""

, You may have a few eggs that are especially well hidden on your egg hunt course. For these eggs, you can give the finders an extra special prize, like an action figure, a doll, or movie theatre passes.


Some of these extra special prizes might be difficult to fit in your eggs. In this case, you might put a slip of paper in the egg that says something like, ""Give this paper to Mrs. Smith to get grand prize #1."", You could hide some special eggs that look different from the rest, like “jeweled eggs” or “golden eggs.” At the start of the game, you could tell egg hunters that the person with the most special eggs gets a prize.


To make things fair, you might have different special eggs for different age groups. The younger group may need to locate the jeweled eggs, while the older kids should be hunting for special golden eggs.
You might surprise egg hunters with a “hard luck” prize at the end of the hunt. This way, you can give the child that finds the least number of eggs a bonus prize., If you are planning an especially big Easter egg hunt, it may be too much for one person to handle. You might want to look for volunteers among your friends, neighbors, family, or church group. With a little bit of help, you'll be able to coordinate and execute your egg hunt better.


Some people may be worried that they'll be asked to do too much. To get around this, you may want to be specific in your request for help, saying something like, ""Would you help with our Easter egg hunt? I'll only need you for an hour on Sunday."", Some volunteers may treat your egg hunt as more of a social event than a responsibility. By being clear with your requests, you'll send the message that if everyone doesn't do their part, the egg hunt won't be possible.For example, you might say, ""Jane, I'll need you to help keep an eye on the older kids while they're egg hunting. They're a little rambunctious.""

, This will help you have a more complete understanding of what still needs to be done. Some tasks may take longer than you expect, and by checking in with your volunteers, you'll know whether or not someone needs more help than you had initially planned., You don't have to spend a lot of money giving your volunteers individual gifts, although if you did it would likely be appreciated. However, a simple ""thank you"" at the end of the hunt should be enough to let your volunteers know you were grateful for their help.


To make volunteers feel a little extra special, you may want to send each an individual card in the mail. If your volunteers feel appreciated, it's likely they'll be willing to help you again."

, When hiding Easter eggs, the people who are hiding the Easter eggs hide them on top of items because they assume when you search for Easter eggs, that you do not bother to check the top of items because you are excited. Check trees and tree branches, outdoor cooking appliances such as grills, play sets such as slides, and other outdoor items.

, Most people ignore decorations when searching, so be sure to search decorations for possible hiding spots.

, Most Easter egg finders run past plants while trying to find Easter eggs in an Easter egg hunt. Check inside plants such as bushes, flowers, and even trees.


Be careful when searching through plants. Check with an adult if you aren't sure it is safe to search a certain plant. (It might be poison oak!)

, The chances of you finding an Easter egg are more likely when you have a friend helping you. Tell your friend to check a certain area, while you check another area.

, Raffle books are often available in supermarkets, stationery stores and department stores. If more than one person is selling, you'll need enough for each seller and it's always a good idea to have spares, just in case you have a lot of raffle ticket buyers.

, A large Easter egg or lots of smaller Easter eggs in a basket will be the most appealing. It must be worth a reasonable amount, to encourage people to give the raffle a go.


Purchase it from a low-cost place if possible, that way you'll save money and gain more funds.
See whether someone is willing to donate the prize, such as a small business, group of parents or others. Don't pester people for it though, everyone has a budget to meet.

, Wrap it in clear cellophane, place it in a desirable basket or container and add pretty things such as ribbon and glitter. Making it look like something worth carrying home is an important part of attracting raffle ticket purchases.

, If you charge too much, people won't think it's worth the effort, while if you charge too little, you won't cover the costs involved. A couple of dollars is about right.

, Ensure that there is a safe place to keep the cash. Bank it regularly if it adds up to a decent amount.


If a group of people are selling tickets, have one person in charge of coordinating everyone and taking in all the monies by a set time.

, Give people plenty of time to get a ticket for a chance to win the prize.

, Award it to the person if they're present or telephone the winner to come and collect it. It's best to hod an event at which the prize is awarded, as that's much more fun for everyone.

, Attach a tube from the mouth. Use a strong tape like duct tape to attach to the bunny's mouth, attaching it from behind.


Use kitchen paper rolls, nylon fabric tubing, etc. for this part. Whatever you use though, has to be large enough for the sort of eggs you're using, be they chocolate, blown-out or plastic eggs. Test before making the tube.

, Set the board in front of a trampoline. Rest the tube's open end on the trampoline and a basket right near the tube.

, Roll eggs through the bunny's mouth, down the tube, landing on the trampoline and, depending on the force with which the egg is tossed down the mouth, it may bounce into the basket. Do a few runs to see where to best place the basket.

, There are two possible ways to approach here:


Blindfold guests. Have them find and place the eggs into the bunny's mouth. The force for bouncing the egg at the end will have to come entirely from how they flick their wrists, roll the egg, or whatever they choose to do.
Don't blindfold guests. Instead, place a line on the ground they must stand behind and toss the egg into the mouth from. Don't use blown-out eggs for this, as they'll soon break!

, If any eggs make it into the basket, that person is a winner and gets a special prize. Getting the egg down the tube is also noteworthy.


If very young children are playing, even an egg stuck in the tunnel deserves a prize.

Select Easter attire based on the activities planned for the day.,
Choose attire for an Easter Sunday church service.,
Select attire for an Easter egg hunt.,
Select outfits that can go from church to brunch to an egg hunt.",How to Dress for Easter Sunday1," Recommended dress for an Easter Sunday church service will differ from a family brunch or a backyard Easter egg hunt. To choose your clothing, it is important to determine where and when your Easter events will be. Select clothing that is appropriate for the activities, keeping comfort and location in mind.;
, If you have not attended Easter Sunday worship services at the church, call the church office or ask a family member or friend about appropriate attire. Some churches have traditions of formal attire on Easter, while others are more casual. If the church requests formal attire, ask if the women typically wear Easter bonnets. But do not overdo it.


Select modest styles. The purpose of attending an Easter church service is to worship God and celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, so dress in a respectful manner that does not detract from the worship service. Women should select dresses with hem lines that are knee-length or longer, and avoid low-cut shirts. If women wear sleeveless dresses, they should cover their shoulders with a cardigan or dressy jacket. Men should not wear shorts or open shirts.
Avoid denim. Jeans and denim materials are not appropriate for most Easter Sunday worship services.
Choose business attire when in doubt. If you are unsure about how to dress for an Easter Sunday church service, wear clothing you would wear to a meeting at work. Business attire for women indicates a suit or a dress with a jacket, while business attire for men means a suit and tie.

, In most cases, Easter egg hunts are held outdoors, so dress for the weather. Choose attire that is comfortable and allows you to move freely. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as you may be walking or running.


Choose Easter egg hunt attire for women. Consider a sundress with a cardigan, a-line skirt with a sweater set, or capri-length pants with a lightweight top. Cardigans, sweater sets and jackets allow for versatility in the event of hot or cold weather.
Choose Easter egg hunt attire for men. Consider khaki pants and a button-down shirt, or khaki shorts and a polo shirt. Bring a sweater or jacket in case the weather is cool.

, Consider an adaptable business casual outfit if your Easter celebration includes both formal and casual events.


Choose business casual outfits for women. Select dressy slacks or a skirt with a silk twinset, or a sundress with a dressy cardigan. Wear high heels to church, and bring a pair of comfortable flats with you for brunch or an egg hunt.
Select business casual outfits for men. Consider dress pants with a lightweight sweater, or khaki pants with a button-down shirt and a sport coat. Wear the sport coat to church and then take it off for the egg hunt later that afternoon.

Choose spring colors for your Easter attire.,
Select floral prints.",How to Dress for Easter Sunday2," Easter attire traditionally reflects the colors of the blooming trees and flowers of spring. Select Easter Sunday clothing in pastel hues, such as yellow, lavender and pink.


Opt for colors that flatter your skin tone. Not everyone looks good in pastel colors. If pastels make you look washed out, consider brighter tones. For example, instead of wearing a pastel yellow, choose a canary yellow that brightens your complexion.
Pair pastels with dark colors for women's Easter outfits. Depending on your shape, an all-pastel outfit may not be flattering. Women may pair a pastel top with a navy skirt or black pants for a more flattering outfit that incorporates traditional Easter tones.
Add color to men's outfits with pastel shirts. Men can add a subtle splash of color to Easter Sunday outfits by incorporating colors like melon, robin's egg blue and mint green into shirts, sweaters or ties. These pastel hues pair well with khaki, wheat and camel tones for a masculine Easter look.

, Because Easter marks the beginning of spring, floral prints are popular options for Easter Sunday attire. Consider floral sundresses, skirts, blouses or accessories.


Choose flattering floral patterns for women. Large patterns add bulk and can make women look heavier. Women with larger frames usually are better suited to delicately patterned floral tops paired with solid color bottoms.
Consider a floral jacket or cardigan for a chilly day. A floral jacket or cardigan provides layering versatility for an Easter Sunday outfit while also incorporating a springtime motif.
Select floral ties for men. Easter Sunday is not the appropriate time to wear a floral Hawaiian shirt. Rather, men may incorporate a sophisticated floral pattern into a tie or handkerchief paired with a suit.

"

Add accessories to women's Easter attire.,
Select shoes to complement a woman's Easter Sunday outfit.,
Choose accessories to pull together a man's outfit.,
Avoid obvious Easter motifs.",How to Dress for Easter Sunday3," An Easter bonnet (or hat) is the traditional Easter Sunday accessory, but experiment with more modern accessories to create a look that reflects your style.


Consider jewelry, scarves, handbags and hair accessories when putting together an Easter Sunday outfit. When dressing for an Easter Sunday church service, opt for accessories that add to the elegance of your outfit. When selecting more casual Easter attire, consider bold accessories that add a pop of color or make a dramatic statement.

, Coordinate shoes with the style and colors of the outfit. Or for greater versatility, choose shoes in a nude shade that can later be worn with other outfits.


Consider sling-back pumps or patent leather heels for church attire, or strappy sandals or Mary Janes for more casual Easter attire.

, Men may choose a matching belt and shoes, such as a brown belt with a brown loafer, for a coordinated look. Dress shoes should be polished, especially for Easter Sunday formal attire.


Consider adding color to a suit with a tie and matching handkerchief.

, When choosing accessories for men and women, avoid prominent Easter prints, which are better suited for children.

Focus on Easter themed components.,
Decide whether to leave the table bare or to add a tablecloth.,
Choose a color theme.",How to Do an Easter Table Setting1," From the outset, plan to include enough items that suggest Easter to the guests. Typical Easter themed items include:

Baby animals: Bunnies, chicks and lambs. Possibly also foals, piglets and other baby animals but these are not as commonplace for Easter designs.






Eggs: Dyed, colored, real (brown, white, speckled, etc.), artificial eggs (plastic, foam, papier mache, etc.), cloth or fabric, lace, etc.






Nests: For the eggs and chicks to rest in.






Wreaths: Easter wreaths are now more popular, using featuring eggs and writing such as ""Happy Easter"" and perhaps baby animals.






Feathers: In displays, wreaths and as part of Easter crafts.






Spring elements: This includes flowers such as tulips and daffodils, pastel colors, spring blossom (real or artificial).






Easter trees: These are simple trees made from branches or blossom tranches that are then decorated with Easter decorations or foods.






Flowers: Use of flowers that are typical in spring is an excellent way to decorate an Easter table. You can use fresh or artificial flowers, whichever you have and like most; you can even mix and match. Foliage is also a useful addition, to add the sense of green that comes with spring.







, With a tablecloth, you can select a color that matches the Easter theme colors you're working with. With the table left bare, you will focus more on creating the color theme through the items added to the table.

, Add the colors of Easter to the table through the addition of the items in the colors of choice. Typical colors for Easter are pastel pink, pastel green, pastel purple, pastel yellow, pastel green and whites. Brighter colors, such as those representing tulips (pinks, reds and oranges), daffodils (yellows and golds) and other flowers are also acceptable.

Think of what sounds like a good costume.,
Wear some makeup, if it's part of your costume It is Halloween, so you can wear as much as you like.,
Accessorize!,
Wear dresses that go with your costume and show off your legs.,
Be confident!.",How to Put Together a Sexy Halloween Costume," A black cat, vampire, devil, model, mouse, Greek goddess and an angel are some starter ideas. You can try those, but be aware that some are very common and a bit boring. Other sexier costumes are referee, nurse, policewoman etc. Think of your style and what you like. Try to be original; if you're going to wear a common costume, add something to it that will make it unique.;
, Also, make sure the makeup goes with your costume; for example, if you're dressing up as a devil, you might want to wear red eye shadow and blush. You can also use nail polish if you'd like to.

, These are important depending on your costume. If you're going to be an angel, make sure you have the proper accessories a halo, the soft white dress, wings, etc. You could also wear a wig to look different.

, However, that does not mean that you need to around half naked if it makes you uncomfortable and just because it's Halloween. Dress appropriately for the occasion; you don't have to show skin to be sexy and it is not good for an office party.

, Yes, confidence is a big part of putting together and wearing a sexy Halloween costume. Imagine in your mind a shy and sad person walking around with their head down and their back slouched. Now imagine an outgoing and happy person strutting around with their head up and their shoulders thrown back. Which one sounds sexier to you?

Use eggs.,
Use birds and eggs.,
Use chicks.,
Use bunnies.,
Use flowers.,
Use tableware with Easter themes.,
Use an Easter tree as a centerpiece on the table.,
Use a cake display stand and turn it into an amazing display centerpiece.,
Again using a cake display stand, make a home for a bunny or a chick.,
Use Mason jars.",How to Do an Easter Table Setting2," Most people associate Easter with eggs, from real eggs to chocolate eggs. The decorative ideas are absolutely endless, and part of the fun is decorating your own eggs and then using them as part of the table display. Here are some suggestions:

Decorate your own eggs through dyeing, marking or gluing on embellishments. Arrange in baskets, egg cups, clear glass bowls, beautiful tall glasses or vases, small dishes,



 


Use open plastic eggs to place a chick inside on a bed of Easter grass. Place on a plate or in decorative items for display.






Arrange eggs on a wreath and place in the center of the table with a floral display placed in the center of the wreath.





;
, This is a decoration theme that has many possible variations and you'll come up with your own as you experiment with placement. The basics are to find a nest (basket, weave your own, buy craft store versions or find unused real ones that are definitely no longer in use, etc.). The eggs can be real or artificial. If they're artificial, choose colors that match your color theme. If real, dye them or rely on a variety of their natural color differences to make contrast in the display.

, Chicks have long been associated with Easter; adding them to the display will automatically suggest Easter. You can purchase fluffy chicks from art and craft stores in various sizes or you can make your own. Ceramic or other figurine chicks can make great instant additions to a table setting. Here are some suggestions for displaying them:

, Bunnies are another animal often associated with Easter. Bunnies can be made from paper, crocheted, knitted, sewn, drawn, sculpted or purchased. There are many ways of introducing a bunny into the display, here are just a few ideas:

, Flowers at Easter time are an absolutely perfect addition to the table setting. They can be fresh or artificial, or a mixture of the two. Commonly used flowers include tulips, daffodils

,

Place mats can be used to help create the Easter setting theme. They could be as simple as pastel colors or place mats with flowers that you might already own, through to specially made or purchased place mats that contain Easter themes.






Use napkins (serviettes) to evoke the Easter theme. Napkins can be as simple as pastel colored ones or ones with Easter designs printed on them, through to cloth napkins that have been shaped into a bunny or a chick. Another neat way to present a napkin is to choose one in a green color (for grass) and fold it flat, then place an origami bunny atop the napkin. Napkins can also be simply tied around the middle with a ribbon in the color theme you're using.






Use clear bowls and pitchers for all sorts of decorative solutions. Inside clear bowls and pitchers can be slipped bunny and chick figurines, pastel candles, lots of eggs, etc. Let your imagination run wild in how to use the contours of the glass. Another nice idea for evening meals is the placement of floating pastel tea lights in a large clear bowl placed on a bed of Easter grass. The grass will show through the base of the bowl, while the glow of the candles on top will reflect light around the display zone.






Use plates, cups, egg cups and other crockery or dinnerware items that are designed especially for Easter. These can be used for each place setting or simply placed at various points of the table for best effect.







, Make an Easter Tree and decorate it with the color theme for your Easter table. Ensure that it is in a topple-proof container such as a large vase in the same color as your Easter theme and place it directly in the center of the table. Everything else should emanate from this centerpiece and link back to its colors and decorations.

, You can make a very simple but incredibly stunning display piece by arranging as many tall glasses as will fit around a cake display stand. Fill with water to the same level in each glass. For each glass, insert one tall stemmed spring flower. This is best done in situ because you won't want to be moving this display once it's made up!

, Place Easter grass on the cake stand and firmly sit a bunny or chick figurine in the center on the grass. Place a few strategically positioned dyed eggs around the grass and put the stand in the center of the table. Go one further and place the stand in the middle of an Easter wreath that has eggs on it; if the egg layers reach up the base of the stand, this can be an incredibly effective display piece.

, Fill a Mason jar with Easter colored candies (jellybeans, M&Ms, etc.), then a row of peeps and finally top it with flowers. Tie a bow around the middle or around the jar mouth. You'll love how it looks!

"
Be mellow yellow.,
""Bunnify"" your table.,
Go spring.,
Try minimalist to keep it really simple.",How to Do an Easter Table Setting3," Go for a yellow table theme for the whole setting. Choose yellow plates (or yellow rimmed/patterned plates), yellow napkins, yellow Easter displays (especially with yellow chicks), daffodils and jonquils, yellow glass pebbles in a glass bowl, yellow candles and bowls of yellow candies and Easter eggs.


White breaks up yellow neatly without interfering and provides a contrast that will prevent the yellow from being ""too much"".

, Go crazy with bunnies and have them the major theme of the table. Use bunny napkins on the plates, bunny shaped plates for holding sweets and food, crafted bunnies (knitted, crocheted, sewn, etc.) and bunny figurines (look for the ones that are painted to look like chocolate). If your children used Bunnykins or Peter Rabbit bowls and plates, rummage around and pull these out to use again! They're great for holding candies and chocolate eggs.

, Choose a spring theme for your Easter table. This setting will focus principally on the flowers available at this time of year. Perhaps they come from your garden or perhaps you need to buy them; whatever the case, make beautiful arrangements down the length of the table. Reflect the colors of the flowers in the tablecloth, dinnerware, napkins and other table display items. This theme allows for great freedom in adding spring animal babies, including piglets, foals, calves and the like that are not as closely associated with Easter as bunnies, chicks and lambs. Include green foliage in the flower arrangements. Try to make use of a good balance of spring colors, such as pinks, yellows and greens.

, It's possible to overdo the table setting with lots of Easter goodies. One way to sidestep this is to go for the minimalist Easter table setting. Place a small Easter tree with natural branches into a glass vase. Place several neat birds and some blossom at even intervals around the tree but don't add too many––just enough for effect. Place this in the center of the table. Use plain white tableware. Add pastel dyed eggs to a white bowl as a decorative element. Place some flower tops into white egg cups and use napkins with only one color and a simple piece of twine or raffia tied around them.

"
"
Here are some simple place setting suggestions to try:

Arrange the plates in the place setting according to color theme and style.",How to Do an Easter Table Setting4," In the center of each plate, place a bunny or a chick figurine (ceramic, fondant, marzipan, whatever). Allow guests to keep their little find.






Arrange a white plate setting in place. Add a brown/natural napkin to sit flat. Place a small white bowl (for soup or salad) in the center of the napkin and fill with raffia or brown colored Easter grass. Add a real, natural hard boiled egg into the center of the grass. This looks especially effective for a natural or minimalist table setting (see above) and if you vary the natural egg colors between each place setting, it can look superb.






Arrange the plates in each place setting as needed. Add a small chocolate nest with chocolate Easter eggs in the center of the plate, on top of a square or rectangular napkin.






Simple felt cuttings in the shapes of bunnies, chicks and eggs can be strewn randomly across the table or formed into a line. Very effective, very easy to move around and something the kids can keep after.

Hide miniature figurines in the eggs.,
Insert small packages of bubbles into eggs.,
Add a bouncy ball inside the eggs.,
Put stickers into eggs.",How to Choose Non‐Candy Fillings for Plastic Easter Eggs1," There are many kinds of figurines you can use. Some examples of this might include things like Legos, army men, mini ninjas, small models of animals, like cats, and so on. Choose a figurine that aligns with your child’s interests.A wide variety of small figurines can be found at your local dollar store. What’s more, you can often buy these figurines in an assortment so that your child isn’t getting the same figurine with every egg.
Toy stores are another place to be on the lookout for figurines. These are generally a little more expensive than dollar store purchases, but are usually of higher quality.;
, This is an excellent gift for young and old children alike. Plenty of fun can be had blowing bubbles after the eggs are found. You may want to bring a plastic egg along when you’re buying bubbles so you can make sure the bubbles will fit inside.Large sized Easter eggs can be bought at most toy stores, dollar stores, and general retailers around Easter time. These may accommodate the bubbles inside most easily.
Bubbles can be bought from general retailers, toy stores, and dollar stores. Buy an assortment of colors so children can more easily tell their bubbles apart from other children’s.

, Bouncy balls can provide hours of fun to children. Set up some cleaned tin cans outside and have children try to knock these down with their balls. Teach your kids how to play Jacks with their bouncy balls.You may want to make a rule that bouncy balls can only be used outside the house. Bouncy balls can be erratic, and playing with them indoors might result in something being broken.

, Where kids are concerned, stickers are usually a crowd favorite. Hologram stickers, in particular, make excellent Easter egg fillers. Buy these at general retailers, stationary stores, and the dollar store.Buy an assortment of stickers that include things like animals, sports items and players, fantastical creatures, and so on.

"
Tuck away a mini compass in eggs.,
Fill eggs with clothing items and accessories.,
Deposit money into eggs.,
School or art supplies.",How to Choose Non‐Candy Fillings for Plastic Easter Eggs2," These can be useful if your child gets lost. Many compasses can be clipped to things like backpacks and jacket zippers. Teach your child how to use a compass and have them apply their new knowledge with a game that involves this item. For example, you might:Set up a backyard scavenger hunt. Hide eggs in hard to find locations, create clues that utilize compass directions, and teach your kids a useful skill while having fun.

, If your children’s sock supply is running low, roll up pairs into small balls and put them inside Easter eggs. Similarly fill eggs with barrettes, rolled up belts, nail polish, earrings, necklaces, wrist watches, wallets, and more.Cloth items can oftentimes be folded down and rolled up to fit in eggs. In some cases, you might need to use a large sized plastic egg, which are available at general retailers and dollar stores., Even if your kids don’t like typical Easter toys or snacks, giving them money will provide them opportunity to buy things on their own. Get a roll of quarters from the bank and split it among several eggs. For older kids, you might want to use larger bills, like $1, $5, and $10 denominations.To encourage responsible spending of this Easter money, you might want to accompany the money with a small note saying something like, “For school.”
If you know your kids are saving up for a specific gift, like an elaborate Lego set or a video game/system, include a note with the money saying, “For the Lego set you’re saving up for.”

, Many school and art supplies are small enough to fit even in the smallest eggs. Erasers, themed paper clips (like those shaped like bunnies), stamps, sidewalk chalk, sculpting clay/playdough, glue, glitter, mini-highlighters, and rolled up cloth lunch bags are items you might consider."
"
Replace candy with raisins.,
Choose healthy fruit snacks as a candy substitute.,
Choose Easter themed crackers and treats.,
Select a sugar free bubble gum as an egg treat.",How to Choose Non‐Candy Fillings for Plastic Easter Eggs3," You can find raisins sold in mini boxes at most stores. These fit nicely into most normal and large sized eggs. To save money, buy raisins in bulk and wrap them in clear plastic tinted Easter colors. This kind of decorative plastic can be found at general retailers and craft stores., Not all fruit snacks are healthy. Find a suitable, healthy fruit snack at your local grocery store and put individual packages into Easter eggs. Buy a few different kinds of fruit snacks so there’s variety from egg to egg.Extra fruit snacks can be saved for later. Pack lunches with leftover fruit snacks, use them as an after-school treat.

, Many companies produce Easter themed versions of products around this holiday. There are also crackers and treats that are naturally Easter themed, like Cheddar Bunnies. Search the aisles of your local supermarket to find suitable, healthy treats like this., Bubble gum that’s loaded with sugar will still be healthier than traditional Easter candy, but sugar can lead to cavities. For the healthiest option, choose a sugar free gum. Put individual sticks of gum or whole packages into the eggs.


Some kinds of gum come with supplemental prizes. For example, gum that also comes with temporary tattoos on its wrappers would likely be enjoyed even more by your kids.

",How to Make Lady Gaga's Meat Dress for Halloween," According to The Times, to make this dress will cost you about US$1500 to US$2000 if you use the right meat (Matambre). (Although according to Grub Street New York, it is claimed that Lady Gaga herself used only cheap cuts worth up to $100. If so, that's likely to be a lot harder to work with but more affordable.) If you use meat-colored fabric, it will set you back a lot less but you'll need to spend the time dying it to appear like meat.;
, Google for images of Lady Gaga in the meat dress (there are no copyright free versions as yet). Or use the one shown above (no, Lady Gaga is not original). Choose a paper dress pattern that looks reasonably close to this style.

, The meat cuts should come from around the thigh and the back of the leg.

, Have a friend measure you. Use the suitable dress pattern for the template pieces of the dress. It's probably a good idea to either say goodbye to this template or cut double template pieces because it's going to get soaked in blood.


Another alternative is to go to the butcher's and have them do a fitting. Not many butchers are doing this though! You'll find most butchers think this is a crazy idea (which it is).

, Use sharp scissors and a knife.

, Use butcher's twine and a strong, large needle. Or use meat glue. Have a friend help and both of you should wear gloves. This is messy, stinky work. Have air fresheners emitting sweet smells in your workspace to overcome the odor.

, That is, if your friend didn't glue it into place as you stood there patiently. Add a long blond frizzy wig, lots of bright lipstick, and a pair of funny glasses. Wear fishnet stockings and chunky silver jewelry.

, Add twine to keep it in place. Or forgo this really gross aspect and just wear blood colored boots or high heels.

, Don't be surprised at the amount of people who stand away from you and make comments like ""Oooh, disgusting!"". This is fleeting fame; it will soon stink.

, Find fabric that looks like meat or dye or photo print fabric to look like meat. Follow the style of the dress worn by Lady Gaga, only use fabric. While this probably requires a bit more effort, it has the advantage of not being meat. So you won't stink, freeze, or pay too much for it.

How much space do you have in your locker?,
From here onwards, come up with a list of ideas.,
IF you are allowed to, decorate the outside door of your locker.",How to Prepare for Halloween (at School)3," Measure the dimensions before hand, then go to the stationery store and purchase a locker shelf (if you don't already have one). Buy a black one for Halloween, and buy one in your favourite colour because they are usually cheap. Buy an orange locker mat and lay that on the locker's floor.This is your ""blank canvas"".

,


Buy a silver mirror with a fancy border to go on your locker door. Make sure it's silver if you use black and orange.
Buy orange, black and purple sticky notes. Peel off the last sticky note and stick them to your locker door.
Get some cotton buds from home, and rip them up or unwrap them. Fluff them out so that they look like spider webs, and hang them over the corners of your locker. Use an old dead flower, black feather, or a spider ring, and hang them carefully in the ""webs"".
Use orange washi tape to wrap around a mason jar. Place this somewhere in your locker to serve as a pen/pencil holder and a stationery holder.

, Some ideas of this could include:


Buy a wooden name plate and paint it orange/black/red/yellow/dark purple/dark green/ dark blue. Then, paint your name on with a golden/silver colour or use letter name stickers.
Again with the cotton buds, but hook them onto the name plate.
Attach the name plate to your locker door with either glue tack/blu(e) tack, sticky tape, or double sided tape.
If you can/are allowed to, use some wrapping paper in the theme colours and cut it to the size of your locker door but just a little bit smaller. Use double sided tape and stick it to the inside/outside/the back of your locker (door).

"

Cover your pencils in Halloween-themed washi tape!

,
Add badges and key chains to your pencil case.,
Measure the size of your binder's front pocket.,
In the corner of a page in your notebook, use liquid white-out and draw a little dot.",How to Prepare for Halloween (at School)4,", Ghosts, skeletons, zombies, skulls, vampires, pumpkins, etc. are all good choices.

, Cut out a piece of scrap booking paper in a Halloween-themed colour to that size. Then, cut out a smaller rectangle in a complementing colour to write on the subject/your name.

, Before it sets/dries, get a liquid pen/highlighter and mix in the colour.This makes your book a lot more colourful and Halloween-themed!

"
"
Using black felt/velvet, cut a rectangle double the size of your pillow.Cover the pillow and use a hot glue gun to seal the ends.,
Using normal sticky tape, press it against your skin multiple times so that it's not very sticky anymore.,
Buy a mason jar or use an old, clear-coloured coffee jar.",How to Prepare for Halloween (at School)5," Connect with safety pins while it sets/dries.

, Continue this process. On a piece of normal white printer paper, stick the sticky tape in a chevron pattern. With either spray paint or manual acrylic paint, paint over the whole page of paper, including the sticky tape. Wait for the paint to dry, then peel off the sticky tape.Here you have an adorable, cute chevron pattern! If you want to, repeat the sticky tape process but stick the tape on top of the painted area and paint the plain white area in another colour that complements your previous choice.Repeat the process until it is dry and peel it off.Done!

, Purchase a rope of twinkle lights or a fake candlelight. With this, stick it into the bottom of the jar and place lots of orange or white feathers inside of the jar.

Find a reputable business to buy from, such as FreshLook.,
Arrange your eye exam.,
Purchase your lenses, and practice good hygiene with them.,
Order your purple contacts directly off of the Internet if no prescription is required and your doctor has told you that you can wear contacts without problems.",How to Obtain Purple Contacts," Some contacts, especially the kind that are purchased before an eye exam, can cause damage to your eyes and vision. Do your homework, and don't rush into a purchase simply because the price is low. Also, be wary of prices that seem too good to be true - many internet based companies charge per lens.;
, Even stores like Walmart have areas devoted to optical care and exams. Make it clear that you would like to try out colored contact lenses that will not be used to correct vision. You will usually be given an ""in-store"" trial. You won't be able to keep the contacts, but it will give you an opportunity to test how they look and feel. If you don't like how they look, ask for a different brand. Don't make your purchase until you are completely satisfied with their look.

, If they are disposable, wear them only as long as recommended to avoid eye infections.

, There are a number of companies that sell colored contacts online and often you can purchase lenses which are less expensive than those found at your optometrists office.

Measure and cut the paper.,
Wrap the paper around the cylinder.,
Use your finger to create pleats.,
Remove or hide any blemishes.,
Finish with a bow and/or ribbon.",How to Wrap Cylindrical Gifts1," When you are wrapping a cylinder-shaped gift, you can easily measure out the amount of paper using the gift as a guide. Place the gift on the wrapping paper and make sure that the paper can go all the way around the cylinder. Cut the paper so that there is about a ½ inch of overlap. For the ends of the gift, pull up the paper on either side. The paper should be able to reach the center of the gift on both sides.It is always a good idea to give yourself a little bit of extra paper.
Use a durable wrapping paper that does not tear easily.;
, Once the paper has been cut, place the gift in the center of the paper with the good side of the wrapping paper facing downwards. Make a tiny ¼ inch fold on one of edges of the long side of paper. Place a strip of double-sided tape along this fold. Then wrap the paper around the cylinder and seal with the tape.Check to make sure the gift is in the center of the wrapping paper and adjust accordingly by sliding it into the middle.

, Begin with one end of the gift. Take the seam of the wrapping paper and fold it into the center. Hold down the piece with one finger and then with your other hand grab the edge of the paper and pull it into the centre. This should begin to fold the paper like a fan with pleats. As you move around the cylinder you can use your finger to crease the pleats. Continue this process all the way around the gift.Once finished complete the same process on the other end of the gift.

, After you have created the fan fold at both ends of the gift you can remove any excess paper by cutting it off and taping the end down using double-sided tape. Alternatively, you could cut a small circle of wrapping paper, either using the same paper or a complimentary color, and tape it at the centre of the end to cover up any blemishes., Stand the cylinder-shaped gift upright and place it on the centre of a long piece of ribbon. Pull the ribbon up the side of the gift and tie a knot in the center at the top of the gift. Cut the ribbon so that there are two long tails of ribbon on either side. Then add a bow to the center of the gift on top of the ribbon knot.


If desired, you can curl the ribbon and let it hang down the sides of the gift.
Alternatively, could put a bow on the top of the gift without adding a ribbon for a simpler look.
Choose a bow and ribbon that complement the color of the wrapping paper. For example, if you are using a red paper with gold stars, you may want to use a gold ribbon and a gold bow.

"
"
Measure and cut the paper.,
Wrap the paper around the cylinder.,
Twist the paper at both ends.,
Tie the ends with ribbon.",How to Wrap Cylindrical Gifts2," When you are wrapping a cylinder gift using the twisting method, you will need more wrapping paper. Start by placing the gift on the wrapping paper and make sure you have enough paper to circle the gift. Leave a ½ inch of extra paper for overlap. For the ends of the gift, pull up the paper on either side and make sure that the paper fully covers the gift.


The measurement for the ends does not need to be perfect, just make sure that you have an even amount on either side.
It is best to have extra paper that can later be cut off if needed.

, Place the gift in the center of the paper with the good side of the wrapping paper facing downwards. Make a tiny ¼ inch fold on one of edges of the long side of paper. Place a strip of double-sided tape along this fold. Then wrap the paper around the cylinder and seal with the tape.Make sure the the gift is situated in the center of the tube and adjust by sliding the gift with your fingers.

, Grab the excess paper at either end of the tube and gently twist. You can can do this one end at a time for a more precise twist. Place a piece of tape around the twisted part of the wrapping paper to hold it in place. Fluff out the excess paper at the end to make the gift look similar to a candy wrapper.This method works best for cylinder-shaped gifts that do not need to stand upright because the gift is meant to lay horizontally.

, In order to add some decoration and finishing touches, you can take a piece of ribbon and tie it around the twisted part of wrapping paper on either end. Tie the ribbon in a knot and leave some excess ribbon hanging loose.


Match the ribbon to the wrapping paper.
Add a gift tag or card, if desired.

"
"
Place the gift in the center of the wrapping paper.,
Pull the opposite corners together.,
Pleat the paper.,
Tie a ribbon around the paper.",How to Wrap Cylindrical Gifts3," This method works best for cylinder-shaped gifts that can be stood upright. Place the gift in the center of the paper so that it is standing. Use a thick and high quality of wrapping paper, so that it can support the weight of the gift., Grab the two opposite corners of wrapping paper and pull them together so that they meet over top of the gift. Then do the same thing with the other two corners. All four corners should meet in the center. Pinch them together with your finger and then using your other hand, squeeze the paper close to the gift., In order to create a more professional and finished look, you can pleat the paper using folds and creases. Rather than have a bunched look over top of the gift, the pleats will give your wrapping a more professional appearance., Once you have folded or bunched the paper at the top of the gift you can tie a ribbon around the paper to hold it in place. Choose a ribbon that matches with the wrapping paper.


Fluff up any excess paper.

"
"
Cover the gift with tissue paper.,
Choose a gift bag that can support the gift.,
Situate the gift inside the bag.,
Add decorative tissue paper.,
Finished.

",How to Wrap Cylindrical Gifts4," This does not need to be done in any fancy way because it will be hidden in the gift bag. Essentially, you just want to cover the gift with tissue paper so that it is not visible if someone glances into the bag.

, If you are wrapping something breakable, you should add a few pieces of tissue paper to the bottom of the gift bag to provide extra cushioning. Make sure you use a gift bag that fits the size of the gift. For example, the entire gift should be able to fit in the bag.

, Depending on the gift, you can either stand the cylinder upright or lay it down along the bottom of the bag. For example, if the gift is a jar of homemade sauce, you will want to stand the gift upright in the bag so that it does not spill.


Alternatively, if you are wrapping cloths that you have rolled into the shape of a cylinder you can lie them down horizontally in the bottom of the bag.

, Simply, take a piece of tissue paper and grab it in the center. Flick your wrist while holding the paper and then smooth the paper in a downward motion using your other hand. Turn the tissue paper upwards so that the puffed up part of the paper is facing up and then place it in the bag. The pinched end of the tissue paper should be inside the bad, with the fluffed ends sticking out the top.Repeat this with three to four pieces of tissue paper.
Choose tissue paper that matches with the color of the bag. You can use one color of tissue paper or multiple colors.

Go traditional.,
Choose a pattern.,
If the gift is for a specific holiday, consider choosing wrapping paper to match the holiday.,
Find wrapping paper you think fits a boy.,
Ask the child's parents.,
Wrap the parcel in the paper of choice.,
For a newborn, make a diaper cake.,
Fill a basket with baby products.,
Wrap the parcel as intended.",How to Wrap Gifts for a Baby Boy," Choose blue, or a variation of blue, wrapping paper. Blue is a standard color associated with a boy.


Alternatively, choose other colors. Yellows, greens and reds are also good choices for the wrapping paper.
Black and white are neutral colors if you don't want to pick an obvious color. However, while all white is fine, black needs toning down to avoid appearing somber, so always team it with plenty or white or another color.;
, There are lots of possibilities with patterns for baby boy wrapping paper. If you are either buying or designing the paper yourself, here are some patterns to consider:


Stripes, polka dots or geometric shapes
Animals or plants
Celebration motifs, such as streamers, balloons and party whistles, etc.

, For example, it might be a Christmas gift (think Santa and sleighs), a Hannukah gift (think dreidels and gelt), Diwali (think lights and lanterns), Halloween (think smiling pumpkins and happy ghouls), etc.

, Trains, planes, cars, and hot air balloon are one theme, although there are many other possibilities, such as:


Sports
Animals (cats, dogs, tigers, lions, bears, etc.)
Cartoon or animated characters
TV show characters
Candies and cakes, etc.

, If you really want to get something that will attract the baby boy as he is opening the gift, ask the parents what his favorite icons, motifs or colors are and go from there.

, Wrap ribbon of the same color as the paper around the gift in a cross formation. Then add a huge ribbon bow in a contrasting or matching color, either to cover the overlapping area of the ribbons, or to the side.

, There is no need for wrapping, as the end result is both gift and wrapping. However, you could wrap in clear cellophane for protection, if wished.

, This is great for a newborn or if you're just catching up with the parents a few months later. Cover in clear cellophane to protect the contents and stop them from falling out, and complete with a large ribbon bow tied around the top of the cellophane.

, As well as adding ribbon decoration, tie on a small trinket, such as a pacifier, a rattle or a teething ring. This makes for a nice additional feature that is both decorative and functional.

, Use clear tape to hold the wrapping in place. Keep the wrapping as neat and flat as possible.

, The doubling up is important to ensure that the tulle looks substantial. The amount needed will depend on the size of your gift; check if it will reach well over the top of the gift when pulled up.

, With the other hand, hold the tulle that has been brought up in the center of the top of the gift. Continue to pull up small sections of the tulle, bringing them to be held in the center. Continue working around the box until all of the tulle has been drawn into the center, held by your other hand.

, With your other hand, work around the box to arrange the folds and pleats neatly.

, Wrap it around the bunched topping of tulle. Wrap it around one more time to ensure it is securely holding the bunched up portion in place. Tie a generous bow.


More bows can be tied on with separate pieces of ribbon for a fuller look, as desired.

Make and use paper gift bags.,
Create and use fabric gift bags.,
Decorate a gift box.,
Make a gift basket.,
Try wrapping creatively without paper.",How to Wrap a Present in an Environmentally Responsible Way1," Gift bags or boxes that can be used again and again are a better choice than one-use items. You can either buy them, or make your own.;
, Gift bags are widely available in many styles, and can be used again and again. You could make your own gift bag by decorating an ordinary paper bag. You can use a paper grocery bag, ""lunch-sized"" bag, or any one at hand. Such a wrapping can be personalized, reuse resources, and ultimately recycled.

, A simple drawstring bag or ""tote"" style bag can be used for years.

, A simple cardboard box, decorated with paint, paper, stickers, or any number of ways, can be a wonderful presentation. A well made box can be a gift in itself, perfect for home décor, ""memory boxes"", or storage.

, A simple, elegant natural fiber basket is reusable, compost-able, and often inexpensively found.

, A little creativity can lead to interesting presentations. How about wrapping your brother's gift with a bandanna? Or ""wrap"" a gift inside a potholder?

Select a box sensibly.,
Re-use a box.,
Make an origami box.",How to Wrap a Present in an Environmentally Responsible Way2," Wrapping a present often involves a box of some sort. Sometimes the best choice is to use a store-bought box for the task. However, there are some other ways to use a box that reduces paper consumption.


Do you really need a box? Can you wrap your gift in just paper, put it in an envelope, tie a ribbon around it, or some other creative wrapping?

, Ask stores and other businesses for clean extra boxes that they no longer need. Cover it with recycled paper to encourage it being kept for another purpose.

, While more fragile than a cardboard box and best for tiny gifts, a paper origami box can be a delightful presentation that shows your extra effort and care for the recipient.

"
"
Make or buy, then use recyclable and/or recycled wrapping paper.,
Make your own!,
Creatively re-use all sorts of paper for wrapping.,
Get artistic.,
Re-use wrapping paper when possible.,
Look beyond ""wrapping paper"".",How to Wrap a Present in an Environmentally Responsible Way3," Wrapping paper is a popular way to decorate a gift. However, give a little thought to the process by selecting paper that is ecologically friendly.


Choose paper that has a percentage of recycled content stated on the label.
Select papers that can be recycled. Avoid shiny metallic wrapping paper; usually this cannot be recycled.

, All you need is a roll of paper (preferably recycled paper), some non-toxic paint or ink, some stamps, and imagination. This is a great job for children, and can be a lot of fun.

, For instance, the colorful comics section of your Sunday newspaper makes great informal wrapping paper. Photocopy or print out sheet music--ideally, on a misprint--for black and white wrapping.


Just take care that newsprint cannot smudge onto the gift––test it for smudging first by running your finger across the newsprint.

, Marbleizing your own paper, for instance, can give it a very artistic touch. Painting stripes of watercolor paint can look fabulous as wrapping paper.

, Your great-grandmother would have saved wrapping paper for another occasion. Smooth it out, stack it, and use a low iron to smooth out wrinkles when possible.


Wrapping paper can be used creatively in many ways. It can be used to cover your textbooks (since your old textbook cover likely is about to off by now and your new semester is about to begin), make new cards, origami paper, and more.

, You don't necessarily need to buy ""wrapping paper"" to do the job! You also might find yourself in a situation where you can't go to the store and simply buy it, and have to be more resourceful.

Try brown ""Kraft paper"", the material that brown paper shopping bags are made from. You can get this from the grocery store, shipping supply places, or megastores.






White newsprint paper often comes in large rolls, and its white color makes it easy to decorate and excellent for large parcels..
Scrapbook, origami, or craft paper are available at craft stores. They may be expensive compared to other types, but are higher-quality, and perfect for smaller gifts.






Construction paper can be a pretty alternative to typical wrapping paper.

"
"
Choose plastic ribbon alternatives.,
Use wrapping paper for ""ribbon"".,
Use tape sparingly.",How to Wrap a Present in an Environmentally Responsible Way4," Plastic ribbon, such as curling ribbon, is not recyclable, cannot be composted or bio-degrade. Some of the following provide much more environmentally-friendly options:

Use fabric ribbon. Natural fiber is best, as fabrics like polyester or rayon will not biodegrade. However, any fabric ribbon can be used over and over, rather than ""one and done"".






Raffia is a natural grass easy to wrap with. It can be found in most craft and floral supply stores. The effect will be a more informal and natural look than a fancy, formal look.






String, twine, and yarn work well for wrapping, and can sometimes be found around the house. They are also easy to find in hardware stores and craft stores.

, A strip of contrasting wrapping paper can be wrapped around the present and fastened in the back for a ""ribbon"". This method is quick, can use up paper scraps which otherwise would go to waste.

, If possible, use glue instead. If you must use tape, use as little as possible.

"
"
Dispose of wrappings responsibly.",How to Wrap a Present in an Environmentally Responsible Way5," Separate items that are recycle-able (paper, boxes, tissue) from items that are not (plastic tape, ribbon, cellophane wrapping). Recycle appropriate wrappings, boxes, and other paper products as per your local recycling district. If possible, compost such items as unbleached paper, boxes, and the like. Be sure to follow through on your plans to re-cover your textbooks, craft projects, and the like!

Grab everything you need.,
Roll the cellophane onto the table and place the basket in the middle.,
Center the basket so there's about one foot (30 cm)of cellophane in the front and back of the basket.,
Lift up the long sides of the cellophane and fold in the short sides.,
Fold the front edges toward the back and the back edges toward the front.,
Hold the cellophane at the top of the basket in your hand, and pull tautly.,
Twist your twist tie around the neck of the basket.,
Tie the bow around the neck of the basket.,
Tape down any awkward corners.",How to Wrap a Gift Basket," Once you have your basket assembled, you're ready to start wrapping. Items can jut out a bit, but not too much. And don't worry about your basket's shape; any shape and size basket will work. Here's what you'll need:


Arranged basket
Printed cellophane, shrink wrap, or wrapping paper (triple the amount of the size of the basket)
Clear tape
Scissors
Twist tie, pipe cleaner, anything to cinch wrap together
Bow
Packing tape (optional).;
, Spread it out on an even surface and place the basket in the middle on all sides. If the basket is absolutely huge, you may need another piece of cellophane, under the basket horizontally.


Again, on all sides. That means it needs to be centered on the right and left and top and bottom.

, You'll probably only have a few inches on the sides, and that's fine. But as for the front and back of the basket, center it on your sheet so there's 10-12"" (30 cm, or a bit under) on either side. This will cover the front and back of your basket and leave plenty of room at the top for some pretty frills.


When you've found these measurements, cut your cellophane (or shrink wrap, etc.) to size. Again, if your basket is of titanic proportions, cut another sheet of similar size to cover the sides.
Make sure all four sides are even. Line up the edges to be sure, and readjust as necessary.

, Take the front and back sections of the wrap and lift them up, pressing them against the basket, covering both ends and meeting the sides at the top. The sides of the wrap will then stick out.


Then, take the wrap touching the table (or surface) in the center and bring it up to the side of the basket. You'll then have a right and left ""flap"" jutting out. Do this on either side of the basket.
Alternatively, you can just pull down the sides. Pull it taut; there will be a slight overlap in the middle where the front and back meet, but that's it. You can then tape them down on the bottom of the basket from there.

, You know how you have two ""flaps"" on either side of your basket, from where the center sides were brought in? Crease those at their bottom edges (like you're wrapping a standard box-shaped gift) and bring them in, back flap first. Then fold the front flaps over the back flaps, creating a sort of V-shape on the sides with the creases.


Take the pieces that you folded down last (likely the front flaps) and secure them with tape. Transparent, double-sided, or packing tape all work. You'll probably want pieces that are around 2"" (5 cm) long.

, This is where you start making the frilly firework fanfare at the top. By now the cellophane is taped down on the sides and jutting into the air at the top. Right at the top of the basket, grab the cellophane and cinch it together, as tightly as can be.


With the wrap in one hand, use your other to ""fluff"" the top. Spread out the edges so it juts out symmetrically on all sides until it looks like you'd like it to.

, Place a twist tie where you're holding the neck of the frilly top. This could also be a pipe cleaner, or anything that'll hold it together. And remember, you can always take it off after the bow is placed on.


Alternatively, you can use clear packing tape on the neck, but this isn't removable.

, No gift basket is complete without a bow, and yours should go right around this neck in the wrap. Tie it around twice, forming a knot that won't slip. Make sure it's facing the front!


If you'd like, you can now remove your twist tie, pipe cleaner, or whatever you used to cinch the wrap together. The bow has that job now and will keep everything in place.

, Oval baskets especially tend to lead to awkward angles. If you have little corners toward the bottom of your basket (anything circular may lead to this), just tape them down and under if at all possible. Tape should be on the bottom of your basket more than the sides.


Then fluff and adjust as necessary. Your basket is sealed and ready. If it's shrink wrapped, it could even be ready for delivery via the post.
Need to place a tag? Around the ribbon of the bow is your best bet. The neck of the wrap works well, too.

Stick to simple invites.,
Choose a color scheme.,
Stock up on gift wrapping supplies.,
Fuel your wrapping with finger food.,
Keep guests hydrated with beverages.,
Section off a landing zone for finished presents.",How to Throw a Gift Wrapping Party1," A gift wrapping party, in essence, is about getting together with friends to have fun doing something that can be tedious and time consuming. Since this is a for-fun activity, there’s no point in stressing over fancy invites. A simple email to your friends and family should be more than enough to get the ball rolling in your party planning.If you plan on this gift wrapping party to be a more elegant affair, there’s nothing wrong with putting together formal invitations for your guests.;
, An open color scheme for your wrapping party is perfectly fine. However, without a color scheme, you’ll have to buy a wider range of wrapping paper and supplies, which could add unnecessary expense. You’re already hosting the party and maybe even providing food, there’s no reason for you to go broke providing a rainbow of wrapping supplies! Some color schemes include:Those related to the event you’re wrapping for. For example, if you’re wrapping Christmas presents, you might choose red and green. For a wedding, you might wrap presents in the wedding party’s colors.
Seasonal color schemes. In fall, you might choose fall colors or a harvest theme. Rustic twine would work well in this situation in place of bows. During winter, consider blue, white, and snowflake themes.
Color schemes that reflect the recipient of the gift. For example, if you’re wrapping presents for a space enthusiast, you might choose cosmic themed wrapping paper, or black paper decorated with stickers that look like planets and stars.

, You should be able to purchase most of your gift wrapping supplies at general retailers, like Walmart and Target. Even grocery stores are likely to carry some wrapping paper, though the supply may be limited. A broader selection can be found at craft or hobby stores. Should you be on a budget, you might ask your guests to bring some supplies, too. Some you might want to stock up on include:


Bows
Decorative tape (like washi tape or patterned duct tape)
Gift bags/boxes
Glue
Labels and tags
Pens and markers (for labeling presents)
Ribbon
Straight edge or ruler
Stickers
Tape (many rolls)
Twine
Wrapping paper (many rolls), Depending on how many gifts need to be wrapped, you and your friends might be wrapping for quite some time. Have some non-messy finger food on hand so that your gift wrapping crew can eat when they’re hungry, without getting their hands greasy or sticky. Some food ideas include:Veggies and some kind of dip or spread, like hummus. This snack is light and healthy, which means you don’t have to worry about it weighing you down.

Deviled eggs are a popular hors d'oeuvres you might serve at your wrapping party. You might want to set out napkins with these, just in case the egg filling gets on fingers.
A meat and cheese platter, served with toothpicks pre-inserted, might be just the thing to satisfy guests during marathon gift wrapping sessions.

, You don't have to feel obligated to provide everything. Many of your guests probably wouldn't mind bringing some juice, soda pop, sparkling water, wine, or other drinks. However, if you do want to provide drink, you could economize by making a large batch of:


Sherbert punch
Fruit punch
Alcoholic punch
Hot apple cider

, If you and your guests are wrapping a lot of presents, these can accumulate inconveniently on your wrapping table or the floor. When this happens, wrapped gifts can be tripped over. In some cases, gifts might be lost, misplaced, or forgotten. Choose a location where gifts can be placed when they are done.You can further organize your gift landing zone by writing your and your guests' names on index cards. Use these to separate finished presents, so none get mixed up in another person’s finished pile.

"
"
Wrap household items as themed decorations.,
Put together a wrapping party playlist.,
Play a related movie on a TV in the background.",How to Throw a Gift Wrapping Party2," This not only has a decorative appeal while setting the tone for your party, it has the added bonus of protecting the surface of whatever you wrap. This kind of decoration is perfect for the table where you’ll be doing your wrapping.Adhesive from tape, errant marks from pens or markers, and so on can cause damage to your wrapping table. Protecting the table with a decorative layer of wrapping paper will help prevent this.

, You don’t have to choose a wrapping party themed playlist, though your guests might be impressed if you do. However, your favorite band or a seasonally appropriate playlist (like Christmas music during the holidays or a spooky one at Halloween) will also provide a suitable ambiance to get your guests in the wrapping mood. Some song ideas include:


""Ain't Too Proud to Beg,"" The Temptations
""All I Want Is You,"" Barry Louis Polisar
”Her Morning Elegance,” by Oren Lavie
""I Like It, I Love It,"" Tim McGraw
""Is This It?"" The Strokes
""My List,"" The Killers
""Objects of My Affection,"" Peter Bjorn and John
""Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want,"" The Smiths
""Pretty Things,"" Rufus Wainwright
""Take It Back,"" She & Him
""This Gift,"" Sons & Daughters, A little bit of background scenery can also add a lot to the atmosphere of your wrapping party. You may want to mute the sound on your TV or turn the volume down low so you can chat with your friends while you wrap. Some ideas for this include:


Seasonally suitable movies, like ‘’It’s a Wonderful Life’’ at Christmas time, ‘’Father of the Bride’’ for bridal showers and wedding events, or ‘’Hocus Pocus’’ during Halloween.
Movies that you know you and your partygoers will enjoy. For example, if you know most of your friends enjoy Harry Potter, you might put on your favorite movie in this franchise.

"
"
Get creative with your embellishments.,
Award prizes for the best wrapped present.,
Set gift wrapping challenges.,
Disguise easy to recognize presents.,
Thank your guests for coming.",How to Throw a Gift Wrapping Party3," Wrapping all your presents the same way is a quick way to get your gifts under wraps, but a little dash of creativity will set your wrapped items apart from the rest. You may want to dress up especially important or expensive presents, or you may want to specially wrap presents for individuals who are dear to you, like your significant other, best friend, nephew/niece, and so on. For example, you might:Include dollar store toys that are a theme the recipient likes. For example, a young boy might enjoy an army theme, in which case you could attach little army men to the outside of the wrapping paper with glue.Substitute uncommon accents. Instead of using a traditional bow or ribbon, you could upcycle an old tie and use that to fasten your wrapped gift. After it’s wrapped around the present, tie a bow.
Paint a thin layer of clear glue on your presents and sprinkle a layer of glitter to give the impression of sparkly snow on wintertime presents., This is a great way to encourage your gift wrappers to step up their game and really have fun with the gift wrapping. At the end of the party, you could choose the best wrapped gift and award the prize yourself, or you could have all your guests vote to determine who gets the prize. Some prize ideas you may want to consider:


A gift certificate for two to the movies. This way the winner can bring a significant other, but if they’re not seeing anyone, they can bring a friend instead.
A major network endorsed gift card, like one from Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and so on. These are usable at most places, making it a versatile prize that anyone can enjoy.
A bottle of mid-range wine for adults. You may want to include a bottle of red and white, as some people may prefer one kind over the other., Spending all day wrapping presents, even with people that you enjoy spending time with, can sometimes get boring. Why not take a break and challenge your guests to a creative wrapping challenge? For example, you might use challenges like:Who can wrap a present the best without using any tape.
Who can wrap a present the fastest and nicest.
Who can wrap a present best blindfolded.

, Many people try to hide irregularly shaped gifts in boxes or gift bags. These work very well, but you can also disguise these objects with a little creativity. To ensure your gift remains a mystery, you might want to try such disguises like:


A potted plant for lone gold clubs. You can decorate the club head as the base of a pot, then dress up the club handle like a flower, or you could transform the club head into the center of a bloom, with the handle as a stem.
An ornament for a toy ball. Set the ball in a large piece of tissue paper, gather the paper around the top of the ball, and tie together the gathered paper with ribbon. Attach a piece of gold wire ribbon to make a “hanger.”
A piece of candy for a bottle of wine. Wrap a bottle of wine in bubble wrap so that the wrap extends to the mouth of the bottle. Make sure the opposite end tapers similarly to the neck. Once it’s wrapped, it’ll look like a wrapped piece of candy, which might throw off the recipient., This is especially important if your guests have come to help you wrap presents for a big event, like a wedding or a toy drive for the less fortunate. Your guests will surely appreciate even a verbal thank you, but you might also express your gratitude by:


Pre-writing thank you cards that you can hand out at the end of the party.
Making extra food, then sending guests home with leftovers.
Inviting your guests to visit next weekend for a thank you party.

"

It is best to do this on a flat surface such as a table or the floor.

, Arrange the sheets of tissue paper so they extend out the top.









Alternate colors of tissue paper to give your gift some flare.
You can place the different colored tissue paper in one sheet at a time, each sheet perpendicular to the last to give the look of alternating colors coming out of the top of the bag.

, Make sure you can't see them through the sides of the bag if your bag is transparent.









Be careful as you do this to prevent wrinkling or tearing the tissue paper you just put into the bag.
Make sure your gift bag is the appropriate size for the gift.

You will need several colors of tissue paper that complement the color of the gift bag. Colored tissue paper makes a gift more festive!
Make sure your gift bag is appropriate for the occasion.
If you are going to curl ribbon to add as a decoration, you will need scissors to curl ribbon. Alternatively, you can use pre-curled ribbon or a pre-made bow.

, This will keep it from being seen once it is placed in bag.









You do not need to tape the packet of tissue paper closed.
If the gift is fragile, you should use multiple layers of white tissue paper or even newspaper to cushion the gift.

, Overlap each of the them several inches, alternating colors.


Use more or less paper depending on the size of the gift and gift bag.
If the gift is small, use half sheets of paper.

, This will allow your tissue paper to look evenly distributed as it sits in the gift bag.









Make sure the gift is centered on the tissue paper a layers.
If the gift is a long shape, place it on a diagonal.

, Take the opposite corners of the tissue paper and bring them over the gift.









Lightly scrunch the paper right above the gift.
Leave the rest of the paper as wrinkle free as possible.
Do this step gently to avoid tearing the paper.

, Be careful not to tear the paper and do not lift the gift by the paper edges.









Gently arrange the tissue paper about the top of the bag to your liking.
Don't overwork the paper. It will start to look wrinkled and used.

, This can add more pop and color to your gift if you feel something is lacking.









Lay out a sheet of tissue paper and smooth it.
Place your thumb and forefinger in the center of the tissue paper and lift it.
Give a flick of your wrist and use your other hand to straighten out the tissue paper.
Place it in the bag on top of the gift. Use alternating colors to add variety.

, You can place the card in the bag with the gift and tissue paper.









Alternatively you can place the card on the outside of the bag by taping it in place.
Place your gift tab on the front of the bag or on the handle.

, You can add ribbons, pre-made bows and curling ribbon to add a little flare to your gift.









These items can really personalize a gift and make it very festive.
Don't over-do the embellishments on the gift as it will take away from the effects on your gift bag and tissue paper.

You can find beautiful and unique copper pieces online, as it’s a very popular material for jewelry.


Choose something that your partner would actually wear. If they love fun necklaces, add a copper one to their collection. If you’ve never seen them wear a bracelet in their life, it's probably not a great gift idea.

Try to find something that complements the décor you already have. Just because copper is the traditional gift doesn’t mean you need to present your love with a giant copper vase that they’ll never use!
Add a personalized touch to this gift by explaining why you bought it, or how you can enjoy it together as a couple. For example, copper cookware is the perfect gift for a couple that loves to cook dinner together every night.

, Copper pots, pans and other cookware make great gifts. These are perfect for a spouse who loves to cook, but they also work for a spouse who loves to eat! Present them with a set of cookware along with a yummy recipe that you two can make together for a date night.

You can incorporate copper a lot or a little, in any way, shape, or form.

, Look online or in person at your spouse’s favorite clothing shops for something like a sweater, a vest, or a scarf.If you aren’t too sure if they’d wear wool clothing, or if you live someplace that isn’t that cold, consider getting them a fun or cozy pair of wool socks just as a part of their gift.

If that isn’t practical, buy your spouse a set of wool roses. You can find these online at Etsy or various other gift stores.It’s a small, sweet token that you can give them to commemorate your seventh year. Unlike regular roses, they can treasure them forever.

, Wool is not considered vegan or cruelty-free, so remember this if your love is passionate about either of these lifestyles.Luckily, however, there are some great wool alternatives for your vegan spouse! Bamboo fabric, linen, and SeaCell are all materials that are comparable to wool, but don't involve any inhumane practices.Give these to your spouse instead, and explain why you chose them instead of wool.

You can find countless websites online that will customize things like planners, book covers, pen holders, pens, etc. The more thought that goes into an anniversary gift, the better.


While your love might not be thrilled with an anniversary gift of pens, they'd probably love a customized pen set engraved with your initials and anniversary date.
You can also get things customized with meaningful words, like lyrics from the song you had your first dance to or a quote that means a lot to them.

, This is perfect if they work from home, or if they have a lot of freedom in their office at work. Something like a framed family photo or a throwback wedding photo is a thoughtful way to add a little bit of love to their workspace.

;
, Check the tin for any signs of damage such as loose hinges, dents or stains that might need special attention when cleaning. Try to pop out small dents and fix hinges. If there are stains, try to remove them gently so as not to spoil any picture or design. Give the tin a wash in warm water and a gentle detergent, using a soft sponge to remove cobwebs, dirt, and any other debris in and on the tin. Allow to dry completely before proceeding.


A few drops of bleach will both clean and disinfect an old tin. Be sure to wash, then rinse out thoroughly and allow to dry before using.
If you're not sure what any stain is and the food is likely to come into contact with it, it's recommended that you don't use the tin.
If the tin has rust on the base or under the lid, try sanding this off. If the rust is too far gone, the tin cannot be used.

, If it's looking a bit shabby inside, you might like to spray the interior with chrome-colored spray paint first. Follow the directions on the paint can and be sure to allow it to dry thoroughly.

In your letter, you can write about the most interesting thing you’ve learned from your teacher or you can write about a good memory of when you really enjoyed yourself in their classroom.

, Making a gift yourself automatically adds a personal touch. Because they take time, thought, and effort, this kind of gift can be very touching for a teacher. Use your creativity and create something unique.


Homemade ornaments or a personalized set of classroom bookmarks are both examples of presents that you can make for your teacher.

, Instead of having your parents pick up something generic at the store, put personal thought into what your teacher would want. If you pick out the gift for a specific reason, it shows that you truly care.

For example, if you notice several times a week that your teacher has a certain soda on their desk, you could buy them a six pack of that soda.

, This is a nice way to capture the memories of the school year for your teacher to enjoy forever.

One option is to print one big class photo and have all of the students sign it to add a personal touch.
If you’re able to take photos in the classroom over an extended period of time, you could print several photos of the students and your teacher throughout the school year and put them together in an album for your teacher.You can use your creativity to use both photos and craft supplies to make a scrapbook.

Give a practical gift card.,
Give a leisure gift card.,
Collaborate on a group gift.,
Stay away from a cash gift.",How to Buy a Present for a Teacher3," Teachers are often relieved to have help purchasing books or school supplies for the classroom. A gift card to a bookstore, office supply, or teacher supply could help your teacher replace old materials for the start of the next semester or school year.

, Teachers also appreciate gift cards that help them to enjoy their free time. Keep in mind that either a smaller amount of money or a larger amount of money on the card is fine, but at least be sure that the gift card would be enough to purchase at least one meal or one item.

If you know your teacher’s favorite restaurant, you could get them a gift card for a meal there.
Most people enjoy going to the movies, so that’s another good type of gift card to purchase for your teacher.

, You can ask everyone in your class to contribute a little bit of money in order to buy one very nice gift for your teacher. Often, this is a high value gift card., While gift cards are technically a form of money, avoid giving cash to your teacher. This is considered inappropriate and often leaves the teacher feeling awkward or bribed."

Give a prepackaged treat.,
Give a themed gift basket.,
Avoid making homemade goodies.,
Check your teacher’s dietary restrictions.",How to Buy a Present for a Teacher4," Purchasing fudge, cookies, popcorn, or any other gourmet treat from a local candy shop or grocery store is widely accepted and appreciated by teachers. It is usually best if this item is non-perishable, and is only big enough for one to enjoy., Gift baskets typically have several treats and knick knacks that your teacher may enjoy, especially if you’re careful about what kind of theme you choose for your basket.

If you’re giving your teacher a holiday basket before winter break, you might consider giving a wellness basket with tea and other goodies to keep your teacher warm and healthy during the cold winter.
If you notice that your teacher drinks coffee in the mornings, you might consider giving a breakfast basket complete with coffee beans and breakfast cookies.

, While your efforts would be appreciated, many teachers will not eat homemade baked goods for sanitary reasons. It’s usually best to stick to a pre-packaged treat., There are many people who are allergic to one or many different types of food. To avoid causing harm to your teacher, make sure that they do not have any allergies. If your teacher does have food allergies, make sure to read the label of the treat that you buy to be certain that none of those ingredients are in it."

Be prepared for the worst.,
Determine how awful your gift actually is.,
Have an arsenal of facial reactions at your disposal.,
Know who you’re dealing with and act appropriately.,
If you’re going to fake it, do it well.,
Gift first, card second.,
When in doubt, cover up.,
State the obvious.,
Deal with the aftermath: post-present depression.,
Weigh all your options.",How to Accept (and Make the Best of) a Terrible Gift," By a certain age you’ve probably figured out which of your friends and family have a knack for getting you gifts that would be better suited for a dumpster. It’s best to approach each gift you are given with an air of caution in case you need to blatantly lie about your feelings towards it.;
, If it’s just a really hideous piece of clothing, calm down. Within the next year you or someone you know will undoubtedly snag an invite to an ugly sweater party where your “awful gift” will potentially get you crowned the belle of the ugly clothes ball. Horrible things always tend to be a bit trickier to deal with because they often serve a specific purpose that will not necessarily benefit you. But, just because it isn’t what you wanted doesn’t mean it’s actually a bad gift. You have mere seconds to instinctively decide where the present falls on the gift scale, and immediately act accordingly.

, Arguably, the only thing worse than getting a terrible gift is knowing that you’ve given one. Meaning, the only way to prevent the latter from happening is by faking it until you make it. This is why every gift recipient needs to have an array of expressions to appease whatever poor soul gave such a lousy present. Having go-to fake reactions like “happy” and “surprised” is absolutely essential when receiving any gift.

, It’s necessary to be ready for anything but, more importantly; it’s essential that your reaction be based on the giver, not the gift itself. There is a big difference between a horrible gift from a grandparent and a horrible gift from the guy/girl who only came to your party for the free food. Tailor your reaction based on the gift-giver and how much effort you feel they put into it. If they spent time and energy into giving you something, you should put the same amount of effort into pretending you like it.

, Unless you’re dealing with someone who can’t pick up on the most obvious of social cues, people are going to be able to tell whether or not you’re lying. You have a small fraction of time to determine whether or not your going to react genuinely or react how the giver wants you to. If you choose the latter option, you have to commit. You can’t give a quick smile with no eye contact. You have to absolutely sell your pseudo-happiness in order for it to be even remotely believable.

, Most people reason that any card accompanying a gift should be opened first. This is the biggest mistake you could make if said gift isn’t exactly appreciated on your end. Reading the card after you open the gift creates a distraction from whatever fake or unenthusiastic reaction you had. Most cards are either sentimental and genuine or humorous and lighthearted. You’re far more likely to have a positive reaction from the card, which will detract from however you reacted to the gift. An, “Oh that’s so sweet,” or courtesy laugh at a corny joke will allow for a natural segue away from the gift itself, saving you from the discomfort of having to spend more time focused on something you don’t really appreciate.

, Since your face and eyes are the, “window into your soul,” AKA the easiest way to see if you’re lying, if you don’t think you can realistically pull off fake happiness, use your hands to partially block your expression. It’s a temporary fix but doing so will give you a few extra seconds to compose yourself by preventing others from being able to completely make out your expression.

, Sometimes the best thing to do when presented with a gift you didn’t want is to describe it and its uses. “Oh wow this iron sphinx cat doorstop can hold open a door upwards of 100 pounds!” If there’s a description on the box, read it out loud. If there is no description, make something up and start discussing them with the giver. This makes it seem like you genuinely care, and talking about the gift itself means you don’t have to discuss how you actually feel about it.

, Chances are you’ll be a little bummed immediately after opening a lousy present. This is normal. It’s natural for people to feel disappointed, but it’s important to remember that it could have been much worse. Never complain about receiving a bad gift unless you want to hear about the even “worse” gifts that your friends or family have been given over the years. Complaining will get you nowhere so figuring out what to actually do with the gift is a far better use of your time.

, Unless it’s a family heirloom that’s been passed down for generations, if you don’t like a gift, there’s really no sense in keeping it. This leaves three options:


First, if the tags have been left on, attempt an exchange or return. Store credit goes a long way these days and, by “long way,” I mean it can provide you with the potential to leave a store with something you actually want.
Re-gifting is another great option. Finding someone who will genuinely appreciate, and utilize, a gift that is essentially worthless to you means that it won’t go to waste on a horribly ungrateful person. Though, if you decide on the re-gift route, make sure the person you are handing the gift off to does not know the original gift-giver.
If you cannot think of anyone you know who may appreciate the gift, a final option is to simply donate the gift to an institution like Goodwill or the Salvation Army. This way you can rest easy knowing that: A. You did something good B. Someone else will benefit from something you didn’t like and C. You don’t ever have to look at that present again.

Consider a gift card.",How to Buy a Gift for Someone Who is Hard to Buy For," You may be told they don't want anything or your gift recipient may genuinely have most of what they want, you have to be creative, even if they insist there's nothing they need and tell you, ""not to bother"", if you still want to give, a snail mail card, preferably home made would be a lovely gesture.;
, If you live near your recipient, you could provide a service for them by doing chores or errands. Alternatively, you could give a trip out such as going for high tea or to the cinema or a local tourist attraction neither of you have ever been to.

,, If your recipient has given you nice gifts in the past, a framed photograph of you enjoying that gift may go down well. If they have generously given you money, a photo of you enjoying what you spent the money on might be appreciated.

, If you are giving for a birthday, anniversary or to celebrate any other specific day, create a poster / scroll / artwork that lists things that happened ""on this day"" in history. If you want to make this more personal, you could add any family events that fall on the same day. Don't forget to add the date of your specific occasion and be sure to get the details correct.

, Is there something of yours that your recipient has complimented or admired that you can get them? Be careful here, if great Aunt Flo said she liked your new pink stilettos, doesn't mean she will appreciate a pair of her own. She may however, like a pink stiletto themed ornament or appropriate accessory.
Is there something in your recipient's past you can theme a gift on?

, If your recipient likes something seasonal, get a gift that will remind them of that thing all year round. This applies particularly to fruits and flowers.

, If they have a pet, buy something for their pet. If it's appropriate, buy something you can both use together, it's okay if it's something you like! An example of this would be a kite, Grandpa doesn't want a kite, but he might love going to the park to fly it with his grandson. Consider also a craft kit or model making kit.

, A hand made gift is almost always appreciated. Consider getting something they have which is broken or damaged fixed. If you can find out what they have that is getting worn out, buy them a new one.

, Look in shops or at online retailers you wouldn't normally go to. You can window shop anywhere for inspiration - no matter the cost. Your recipient may have a collection you cannot afford to contribute to, antiques, cars, designers handbags etc so get them something themed to their collection instead. If they collect a branded item consider some merchandise.

,,, There's a wide range of choices here. Consider generic favorites such as Amazon gift cards for something that appeals to everyone. For a more personal touch, consider a gift card to a special local restaurant or other business. Or you can choose something really unique and creative like a Zidisha person-to-person microlending gift card.

Is there some sort of challenge or theme? Make sure everyone understands the rules like whether they have to buy new things or not.

Be careful of sticking to overly stringent rules. After all, not everyone has a regiftable present laying around. Not everyone is good at picking out gifts. The focus of this game is on fun not making it a picky rules-bound affair.
Be aware that very elaborate rules or themes (such as it has to be edible, or red or green, or some such) may be fun for some but may be an annoyance and stress for another. In general, keep it simple.
Gift spending limits avoid putting people in a position to pay an uncomfortable amount for a gift. What may be comfortable for the vice president will not be the same as the junior secretary.
Price limits keep gifts more or less on the same level of value. You don't want one person to get a brand new video game console and another person to get a used pen protector.



 

;
, Get it gift wrapped or wrap the gift yourself, and bring it to the party stealthily. And feel free to have some fun with this.

Feel free to do a really silly wrapping job. Use plain brown paper, or even just stick it in a plain mailing envelope.
Do something silly. Feel free to wrap it with a different theme than expected. For a New Year's gift exchange, wrap it in birthday, baby gift, or graduation themes.
If you enjoy wrapping, feel free to do an excellent job. Go overboard, do every elaborate flourish.







, If you're having trouble coming up with a gift that is both off-the-wall and appropriate, consider these gift ideas:



Hideous or tacky jewelry
Perfume or lotion with an unpleasant scent.
Cheap, ugly statues or other decorative knick-knacks.
An obnoxious T-shirt, sweater, tie, socks, or bow-tie.
Workout videos, particularly those with obnoxious aerobic instructors
Bargain bin DVDs of Grade-B movies...the worse the better.
A framed picture of your boss, (perhaps autographed) but only if the boss has a good sense of humor.
CD of awful or weird music



, Although ""White Elephant"" or ""Yankee Swap"" gifts often aim to be wacky and goofy, there is nothing wrong with a gift that is sensible. It is OK to go with something that you are pretty sure will not get tossed in the bin. Sometimes trying to find the perfect crazy gift is just adding too much stress to holiday shopping. Some perhaps more boring but welcome exchange gifts:

Lottery tickets
Water bottle, mug, or coffee travel cup
Small gift certificate to local eatery
Winter hat, scarf, or gloves
Good quality tea or coffee gift set
Kitchen items, such as measuring cups, spoons, oven mitts

, The idea is for people to not know who the gift is coming from. Once you get to work, place the gift into a gift box along with all the other gifts.

, Make numbers for however many people are participating in the gift exchange. For example, if there are 15 people participating, write out the numbers 1 through 15 on small pieces of paper, fold them once or twice, and throw them into a small bowl or bag.

, The number will signify the order in which they choose a gift.

, The first person chooses any wrapped gift in the gift box and opens it. Their turn ends. The first player will be given the option to exchange gifts with another player at the very end.

,


A person who has his/her gift stolen from them gets to either steal a gift from someone else or choose a replacement gift from the gift box.
You cannot immediately steal back the gift that was stolen from you. You must wait at least one round before stealing back a gift that was once in your possession.
A gift cannot be stolen more than once a turn.

, The person with the next-highest number either chooses a gift from the gift box or steals a gift from someone else. People who have gifts stolen can choose a gift out of the gift box or steal items that have not yet been stolen that round.

, There are lots of variation to the white elephant gift exchange. Look through a couple and decide which ones you want to implement before the game begins.


Mark gifts as gender-appropriate, where possible. Label a gift male-appropriate, female-appropriate, or unisex.

Cards containing instructions can be wrapped up to look like presents and placed into the gift box. The instructions contain rules such as ""Recipient of this card chooses two presents, opens them both, and places one back into the gift box,"" or ""Recipient of this card chooses a gift and cannot have their gift stolen."" If you choose to work with these cards, be mindful of two things:

People who make cards with instructions have to bring both a card and a gift. There won't be enough gifts to go around if people who write cards fail to bring gifts.
Cards with instructions are tougher to implement if you choose to open the gifts at the very end. Obviously, it's impossible to ""open two gifts and choose one"" if you don't open the presents until the end.


The first player may be given the option to exchange gifts with another player at the very end. Because the first player doesn't have the option of stealing, they might be given it at the very end. This option works best when presents remain unopened until the very end; otherwise, the first player has a distinct advantage.

, There are many different variations on stealing in a white elephant gift exchange. Play around with a couple different variants.


An item that is stolen three times becomes frozen. After an item changes hands three times, it can no longer be stolen, and stays with the third person who stole it. Be sure to keep track of how many times an item is stolen on a notepad to avoid confusion.
Alternately, a limit can be placed on the number of times a person is stolen from (instead of the number of times an item is stolen). If you set the limit at three, for example, an item can be stolen however many times, so long as it's stolen from someone who hasn't reached his or her limit of three.
Place a limit on the number of steals per turn. If, for example, you limit the stealing to three gifts per turn, after the third gift is stolen, the player whose gift was just stolen must choose a gift from the gift box.

Remember timing.,
Hint when you receive a gift.",How to Graciously Hint About a Gift," We hint for the same reason we joke—to get the truth out in a way that the listener can choose to notice or ignore. This may sound a bit complicated, but it’s necessary. An important rule of gift giving is never to overtly expect a gift. If you’re not expecting a gift, how can you tell the giver what you want? You do it with a hint. When you hint, remember your goal is to help a bewildered giver, not to come out of the occasion at a net gain. So, as always, be considerate. Imagine yourself in the other person’s situation and consider what the person is likely able to afford in time and cost.;
, The best hint-givers involve you in the conversation. They may get you to answer a question or give you a little story with the hint just to cement it in your mind.

, Do you remember learning about the subjunctive mood in high school grammar? It’s a great form for a hint.


(1) Good hint giver: “If I were to start really equipping my kitchen, the first thing I would buy is this pizza cutter.” (2) Great hint giver: “If I were to start really equipping my kitchen, I know the first thing I would buy.” The listener then has to ask, What is that? “This pizza cutter. Remember when everyone came over for pizza and I had to cut it with kitchen shears? I think maybe this would work a little better.”

, Sometimes historical hints are the easiest to come up with.


(1) Good hint giver: “My friend got me a really fun book here once. I pretty much love anything that comes from this store.” (2) Great hint giver: “My friend gave me something so fun from this store once.” The listener then has to ask, What was it? “It was an art print book. I pretty much love anything that comes from this store. And they always have a sales rack in the back. I’m always so tempted because I want to take home every last thing on the rack.”
(1) Good hint giver: “I love that we went out last Valentine's Day. It just doesn’t feel like Valentine's day unless we get out of the house.” (2) Great hint giver: “Do you remember what you gave me last Valentine's day?” The listener then has to rack his memory. “Really, the best gift was us going out together. Remember our walk after dinner? It just doesn’t feel like Valentine's day to me unless we get out of the house.”

, Some items are best not given as gifts, like clothing, home decorations, or project gifts. Therefore, if you trust the giver to choose any of these forbidden items, it is your job, nay your duty, to hint that you would appreciate such an item. You too should avoid giving any of these forbidden gifts unless you’re given a specific hint. Another time to do your hinting duty is when you find yourself in a position to drop a hint on someone else’s behalf. For example, if you are about to watch your dad buy a gift for your mother that you are sure she won’t like, go ahead and drop a hint on her behalf.

, Timing is important, especially if the hopeful giver is not good at picking up hints. So drop your helpful ideas a week or so before you think the giver will be searching for your gift. Otherwise you risk your hint going unnoticed.

, You can hint right after receiving a gift if you can do it without sounding ungrateful. This requires delicacy. First mind your manners and show some delight when you open the gift. Then thank the giver. Only then can you drop your hint. It’s best to make the hint a statement of gratitude: “What a perfect way to finish off my mug collection. I don’t think I’ll ever have to worry about getting another mug.”

Buy age appropriate toys.,

Be aware of what's not considered safe this season.,

Read the warnings and safety precautions accompanying the toy.,

Read the instructions accompanying any toys.,

Avoid getting anything that has excess string or cords, such as slingshots.,

Buy for durability.,

Inspect all gifts as children open them.,

Take allergies and food or chemical sensitivities into account when purchasing gifts for any age group.,

Take time to explain how to use the toy or gift to a child or to anyone who needs instruction.,

Ask all gift recipients to be conscious of where they've placed their gifts after opening them if it's a family event, such as Christmas.",How to Observe Safe Toys and Gifts Month," Children soon let you know if you've purchased them a toy that's below their age group and most shoppers take great care to avoid such a slip-up. Yet, strangely we're prone to thinking that purchasing toys that are meant for an older age group is fine, as if somehow it's suggesting that the child in question is smarter than their age group already, or they'll ""grow into it"". The problem is that toys are age graded for safety reasons as much as for avoiding frustration and undesirability. Many toys aimed at older children contain small pieces which could be swallowed by a younger child. Toys for older children can also contain items that require responsible handling. For example, the popular Beyblade Battle Tops would be appropriate for an 11-year-old but not for a six-year-old.

Video games have age ratings for a reason. Observe them.
Read How to choose age appropriate gifts for kids and How to give ideal age related gifts for more ideas.;
, It's a really good idea to keep an eye on a consumer watchdog site to find out which toys have been recalled recently so that you can avoid buying them. Many consumer groups and government entities will send free email updates to your in-box alerting you to recalls and it only takes a few minutes to glance through them. If you're not sure, contact them for more information about specific product recalls before seeking to purchase the product., These will give you a good idea of suitability and safety issues for the child in question. This requires some contextual thinking on your behalf, given your knowledge of the child; for example, the warning may indicate to you that a child who is quiet and still will use the toy sensibly, while a child who is restless, always taking things apart and is prone to throwing things might misuse the toy. Other things to bear in mind when reading the warnings and safety precautions include:

Small pieces. Toys with small pieces are always unsuitable for children under 3. Even if you're purchasing the gift for an older child, if there is a sibling under 3, can you be certain that the younger sibling won't have access to the toy?

Fire hazards. If your home has hazards such as open fires, old and open radiator heaters, etc., think twice before purchasing flammable toys.
Adult supervision. If a safety precaution suggests that the toy requires adult supervision, are you able to ensure that supervision in your household or do you know for sure it'll happen if giving the gift to another household? For example, a toy like the ""Easy Bake Oven"" needs adult supervision and assistance with the cooking. Is that something you're willing to do every time your child wants to play with it? And are you able to ensure that your child won't try to use it when you're not about (for example, by storing it away, etc.).
Sharp edges. Not only young children can experience problems with sharp edges but so can older children if they have a marked history of hurting themselves. Avoid giving toys with sharp edges to young children under any circumstances and for older children, be alert to how they normally interact with their toys.
Fake food gifts. For children, some fake food gifts are very dangerous because the children mistake them for food and try to consume them. For example, glass candies are enticing because they're pretty but they're dangerous if a child bites one. The only fake foods that are suitable for children are those marked clearly as made for children, using non-toxic materials and sized accurately for the age group.
Toxic items. Avoid any toys that should be non-toxic but are not (check the labels). Items such as crayons, bath products, markers, paints, facepaint, etc. should be non-toxic.

, Do they make sense? Are they clear? Are you left with any questions? If you cannot understand the instructions and the retailer isn't able to help you out, put the toy back on the shelf and let the retailer know that you don't consider the instructions adequately clear to ensure the toy's safe use. You might also write the manufacturer if you think this would help ensure clearer instructions for other purchasers.

Read all tags that are attached to stuffed animals. Most stuffed toys are restricted to ages three and up because they usually contain small pieces that a child can choke on if removed (such as eyes, noses, embellishments, and so forth). If you're giving a stuffed toy to a child who is an infant or under two, please be sure that the animal is smaller in height and ""mass"" than the child and that it is specifically labeled as suitable for a small child.
Examine the pictures of toys on boxes. The pictures can help provide you with an idea of the suitability of a toy along with the age group indicator. Knowing the child in question, use the pictures to discern the appropriateness of the toy and how safe it will be when given to the recipient. For example, a plastic brick building product might contain small pieces that a kid could place in his or her mouth and you might need to ask the retailer for a similar product that is more suitable for the younger age group.

, Never consider BB guns as toys for kids – not only are these not kid's toys, they can take out an eye all too easily and leave the victim blinded. Equally, avoid buying toys that shoot off or send off pieces., With small children, durability is essential. Check that the item cannot be broken easily and ask what happens if the item is broken. You want to avoid any toy or product that breaks into shards, splinters, sharp pieces, or releases anything toxic.

If purchasing sunglasses for a small child, be sure that the lenses are approved for children and can withstand the pressure of being twisted, chewed, and sat on.

, if the gift(s) are from someone outside the family, for example a neighbor or schoolmate, it's a good idea to inspect the gift quickly to ensure that it's safe to play with. If you discover that it isn't, distract your child with another gift and try to either remedy the unsafe aspect (such as removing small pieces) or quickly replacing it with something else more suitable. If there are tears, tell your child that the toy needs repair or safekeeping for later and return to distracting him or her with the many other toys he or she has no doubt received, or go and play somewhere else together., Both children and adults can be allergic or highly sensitive to a range of food gifts, especially such food as nuts, MSG infused food, chocolate, and so forth. Ask them if you don't already know, and avoid purchasing such food items as gifts. Other gift items that can cause allergies or sensitivities include perfumes, scented products, and essential oils.

Avoid giving nuts, toffees, and other hard candies to young children as gifts. They can become choking hazards and are not good gifts for children under 5.
If in doubt, don't purchase a gift that has potential allergy or sensitivity issues.

, If your kid is aware how to use the toy properly and is aware of how easily it can be broken or ruined, then they are alerted to taking care of it in advance.

Remove all broken toys and gifts immediately. If they cannot be fixed safely, dispose of them or recycle them where appropriate.

, A lot of things happen when there is a family gathering and family members and friends might feel tempted to leave opened gifts in places that are easily accessible to a child. If you don't want to ask them, at least do a sweep of the present-opening room before leaving it to attend to other activities, and put all small and child unsafe gifts out of reach. Be sure to let guests and family members know what you've done with their goodies!

Keep this in mind also if there are pets that may have access to the gift-opening room while it is unattended. Don't leave anything laying around that could be dangerous to Fido or Fluffy in any way.

Rent a U-Haul for large or heavy items.",How to Bring Gifts with You when Traveling1," Many of today’s mid-sized sedans, SUVs, compact and subcompact models are close to their maximum load capacity when four adults and their luggage are travelling inside. If you plan to travel with numerous or very heavy gifts, find out your vehicle’s weight limit before you pack your car. Information about load capacity can be found in your vehicle’s owner’s manual.It is unsafe to travel in vehicles that are at their maximum weight capacity.
It is also extremely hard on your vehicle and could cause quite a bit of wear and tear.
For additional safety, get your vehicle serviced before taking long drives – especially if you’ll be loaded down with gifts. Your vehicle’s tire air pressure is especially important when it comes to bearing heavy loads.;
, You may be tempted to load your gifts in the backseat of your vehicle, but they will actually be safer in your truck. The items won’t be visible when tucked away in your trunk, but prying eyes may notice them if they're piled in the backseat. This could result in potential theft, especially during stops at gas stations and rest areas, when your vehicle is more readily accessible to strangers.


If your vehicle doesn’t have a trunk space, throw a light blanket over the gifts piled up in the backseat to conceal them.
Even with the gifts stowed safely out of sight in your trunk, avoid leaving your vehicle unattended for more than a few minutes at a time.

, When a vehicle’s center of gravity is thrown off, the likelihood of an accident is significantly increased. Because of this, pack the heaviest items as near to the center of the vehicle as possible. If you’re loading a trunk, push the heaviest items as far back into the space as you can. If you must use your backseat, place the heaviest items on the floor, behind the front passenger seats.Loading very heavy items at the back end of a trunk can affect steering and braking, since it shifts weight off the front tires. This is true for all vehicles, but SUVs in particular are at risk for rollover accidents. They need to be loaded carefully so that the overall center of gravity is low and in the middle.
For example, place heavier items, such as stereo equipment and televisions, near the center of the vehicle. You can pack lighter items, like clothing, paperback books and plastic toys, in the trunk.

, You’ll need to take into account the shifting that may occur during your drive, which can cause significant damage to your gifts. Even if you are driving slowly and safely during your trek, simple turns and unexpected potholes can cause shifting. Pack the gifts tightly into your vehicle. Surround them with heavy items, such as packed duffel bags, to prevent shifting. Pack smaller items in boxes to keep them secure.


You could also wedge large, thick blankets in between gift boxes to prevent shifting and overturning.
If you’re interested in something more permanent, consider investing in a cargo organizer, which is a specially made device meant to protect and secure cargo in your car., If you plan to travel with a significant number of gifts or exceedingly heavy ones, consider renting a small cargo trailer from a moving/storage company like U-Haul. These tiny, enclosed trailers attach to your vehicle’s trailer hitch. They are lightweight and can help you prevent unnecessary wear and tear on your car.Before making a long trip with a trailer attached to your car, make sure you feel comfortable driving with it. You may want to give yourself some extra travel time, since a trailer may require that you drive more slowly.

"
Consider the reason for the gift.,
Think about how you want to personalize the gift.,
Decide whether you'll make the gift or purchase it.,
Shop online or in stores for unique or interesting gifts.,
Arrange a convenient time to present your gift.,
Give the gift of your time.",How to Choose Gifts to Honor Your Local Firefighters," Clearly, there are different reasons for providing a personalized gift and these reasons will direct the choice of gift and method of personalization. Some reasons may be:


You wish to honor specific firefighters. You may be honoring one specific firefighter or you may wish to honor the entire local station.
Perhaps some of your local firefighters are heroes after a specific incident and you wish to acknowledge that specific act.
A firefighter you know has been accepted to join the fire service or has been promoted with the service.
A firefighter has reached a particular anniversary within the fire service.;
, The gift can be made specifically for use by a firefighter or firefighting team, it could be made for the whole fire station or it could be purchased and have some form of customization added to it. In the first instance, making items that the firefighters or station could actually use in their daily activities would be the best option for personalizing the gift and in the latter instance, having an existing item engraved, printed, painted, etc. to show the logo, emblem, colors or names of the firefighters service and the firefighters themselves could be another effective form of personalizing the gift. In either case, you'll want to give something meaningful and heartfelt, something memorable and something that recognizes the achievement adequately.

, This decision will depend on your skills and the time you have available to make something. If you want to bake food, be aware that many firefighting organizations won't accept home baked items unless they know you personally, out of concern for health and safety issues and in this case, it may be better to purchase commercially produced food appropriately wrapped and labeled. Some of the things you might be able to make include:


Leather or metallic goods such as a keyring or belt and design a firefighter symbol or emblem on the item;
Jewelry with the fire service's emblem or symbol forming part of it;
A plaque or a board featuring the station's emblem or motto;
A photo album with action shots, people, the station, etc. or a large photo printed onto a canvas (a group shot would work well for this). If you have excellent photographic skills, offer to take the photo and frame it for presentation. And don't forget that making a web photo album and sharing it around social networking sites could be a fun way to celebrate your local firefighters' achievements;
A stained glass design with the fire station's logo or emblem embedded in it;
A collage, decoration, memorial craft etc. that uses elements of the fire service's colors, logos, symbols, etc. (it's totally up to your imagination) and reproduced in a form that the firefighters can display at the station;
A special flower arrangement using the flowers from your own garden, with a card or message attached;

Write a poem, story or speech of appreciation. Children might like to make drawings or posters that express their appreciation;
Build a coat stand or a hat rack for the fire station. Just be aware that there may be building and safety regulations involved, so ask first;
Offer your services as a masseur, aromatherapist, stylist, hairdresser, etc., depending on what you're skilled in. Only offers services you're qualified to provide though; this type of gift should be strictly professional and beneficial for the recipients.

, If you'd rather purchase something than make a gift, look for things that can be personalized or customized. You could add a specific firefighters name or use the fire station's name, logo, colors or emblem. Perhaps even a firefighting team's names would work on some objects. Some of the gifts you can purchase that can then be customized include:


Mirrors, coat racks and clocks;
Mugs or a kitchen set with tea, coffee and cookies included;
Massage items such as squeeze balls, feet massage rollers for under desks, etc. In fact, anything that can relieve stress can be a great idea!;
Specific gifts targeted to firefighters (check the websites that specifically provide these);
A watch for a specific firefighter;
Pens and other desk items;
Monogrammed clothing;
Certificates or plaques;
As above, relaxing massage, hydrotherapy, spa, etc. services but give a certificate where you don't own such a business or have such skills yourself.

, Since it's probable that you'd like the occasion to be momentous, avoid simply turning up out of the blue. The relevant personnel might be busy out on call or not available or on duty that day. Call ahead and explain what you'd like to do and why and make a set time to present the gift and to give a brief speech of acknowledgement for the services well done.


Be prepared to be flexible. Firefighters don't sit around waiting all day – they could be called out at any moment!
Alternatively, you might simply prefer to turn up and leave your gifts without a fanfare, happy in the knowledge that they'll receive your token of appreciation and know that the community cares about their efforts.

, One personalized gift you can give to a volunteer fire fighting service is... yourself! Why not join up? Even if you don't want to be at the actual fire front, there are always things that you can do such as preparing food, stocking supplies, helping with communications, etc. Ask about the options and see if you can find a volunteer role to suit.


Another way to give the gift of your time is to help organize visits of firefighters to schools and local communities to help spread the word about fire prevention and safety. Be the helper that coordinates for a safer community.

Use suitcases with hard shells.,
Pack valuables in a small carry-on that you can keep near you.,
Pack large or less valuable gifts in your checked luggage.,
Find out about duty-free exemption before flying internationally.",How to Bring Gifts with You when Traveling2," Whether you are putting gifts in your checked luggage or your carry-on, use suitcases with hard outer shells to protect the items inside. Checked luggage is often tossed around quite a bit and will come into contact with objects and hard surfaces, so the shell can help prevent significant damage. Your carry-on is slightly safer, but it will still need to be stowed away in an overhead bin during the flight. If you encounter turbulence, your carry-on may get shifted around.


Place gifts in the center of your suitcase and surround them with soft items, like clothing, for additional protection.

, Because you have to stow larger carry-on luggage in overhead bins, you won’t be able to protect yours with complete control. Put gifts that are particularly valuable or fragile in a small bag – usually referred to by airlines as a personal item. Typically, purses, backpacks, suitcases and laptop bags fall into the “personal item” category. Most airlines will allow you to bring one personal item onboard, in addition to your larger carry-on.If the item is too large to fit into a smaller bag, go ahead and pack it in a larger carry-on bag, but try to bury it deep inside. That way, anyone bent on stealing from you would essentially have to dump the entire contents of the bag out to get to the valuables.
Buy traveler’s insurance for your high dollar items.

, This includes breakable objects that aren’t particularly valuable. If the gift isn’t fragile, wrap thick, soft clothing around it to act as a cushion. Then bury it in the piece of luggage you plan to check at the airport. If the gift is fragile – for instance, a bottle of wine of a ceramic vase – surround it in bubble wrap first, then wrap soft clothing around it. Nestle it deep in your luggage, surrounded by additional clothing.

, Whenever you fly into a different country, you will have to pass through customs at the airport. You will be asked if you have anything to declare – essentially they want to know if you are bringing anything back to your own country and/or if you’re carrying anything potentially hazardous. Depending on what the item is, you may need to pay a duty fee if you want to travel with it. Rules vary by country, but it is typical to be allowed a certain amount of duty-free exemptions.


For example, travelers are allowed to bring up to $800 worth of merchandise back to the United States without having to pay duty.You must declare the gifts to customs to be able to include them in your personal exemption.If you purchased gifts that you want to bring back to your home country, you will be asked to provide receipts for them, so keep those easily accessible. "
"
Wrap the gifts when you arrive at your destination.,
Take extra precaution with breakables.,
Consider shipping the gifts to your destination.",How to Bring Gifts with You when Traveling3," This is a good idea whether you’re flying or driving, because gift wrap can be easily damaged during transport. If you’re flying, there are additional reasons to avoid wrapping gifts before you travel, most significantly being the possibility of TSA officials unwrapping them during a security inspection. Wrapped gifts are allowed to be in in your luggage, but they will be subjected to the same scrutiny and restrictions that your luggage is held to, including random inspections.


If you can wait until you reach your destination to wrap the gifts, this may be the wisest course of action for you.You could ship the wrapping supplies with your luggage, or buy the needed wrapping materials upon your arrival.

, No matter how you plan to travel, always take the necessary precautions to protect fragile and breakable gifts. Wrap them in several layers of bubble wrap and nestle them somewhere safe, like inside a hard-shell suitcase. If you’re driving, you may want to separate the breakable items from the other gifts and put them in the backseat. If it’s breakable and also a heavy item, put the gift in the backseat area, but on the floorboard.

, To avoid incurring extra fees to fly them or possible damage to your vehicle to drive them, look into shipping your gifts ahead through a service like FedEx. You may also want to consider this option if you simply want to avoid the hassle of hauling gifts around, especially if you need to transport a lot of them and are travelling alone. Check-in lines can get long and tiresome, especially around the holidays, and shipping ahead can make your airport experience much smoother.Check with your airline about their luggage fees before you make your decision – most of them have a weight limit and will charge you a fee if you go over that. If you have heavy gifts to transport, ground shipping may be a better option.
If you ship the items, you’ll get a tracking number and have the option to purchase several different tiers of insurance, if you like.

Find a gift that means something about the other person to you.,
Let it be a surprise.,
Think beyond stuff.,
Think carefully about what the other person would not buy for themselves.,
Let the recipient know gently and without great ""hoo-ha"" that your gift can be returned to a store, re-gifted, or donated if it doesn't make them feel comfortable or happy.,
Avoid giving ""useful"" items that the whole household needs and will make use of.,
Expect nothing in return.,
Be considerate about presentation.",How to Give Gifts Unconditionally," Be proud of what you choose. Don't just buy something because it is in the bargain bin or because it was the most expensive item in the store. Put effort, care and consideration into the purchase or creation of the gift. Making the gift yourself is definitely an option too, and is even more a ""piece of you"", so feel free to do so.;
, A gift prompted by persistent requests for it is not as exciting or fulfilling as a gift that is a total surprise. This does not mean that you cannot give things sorely needed by the recipient but how you will know this is by observing their life and knowing them, rather than heeding direct requests for items.

, Stuff is all very nice and cute when wrapped up but stuff ends up drowning us. Sometimes, giving stuff is giving a burden to another person and the ""condition"" involved in such a gift is that the recipient puts up with shelving your stuff in their already over-crowded life. If you are gifting the ""person-who-has-everything"", avoid stuff. Consider alternatives that won't oblige the condition of adding to clutter on the recipient, gifts such as:


A promise to visit monthly to take an elderly recipient to art galleries or botanical gardens;
A service - nappy (diaper) washing service, house-cleaning service, car-wash etc.
Plants for the garden that will produce food, scent, colour or shade
A voucher for a massage, spa treatment, fitness class

, If you give items that a person is already very adept at getting for themselves, muzzling in on this territory can be a means of invading it and substituting their sense of style with yours. Don't even bother; if you know the person well, you will know already what they do well enough without your help. Look instead for the things they'd never consider purchasing - like the red shoes with really high heels you overheard them pondering about but muttered that they couldn't afford, a trip to a spa resort that they would never think to slow down for normally, or a new food that is something they've never tried before etc.

, You do not want to create a noose around their necks. If you ever had an experience growing up when someone in your family gave your family something hideous and it was ferreted out each time this person visited, you will know that the sense of obligation can turn gift-receiving into a burden rather than a delight.

, The toaster for mother on Mother's Day, the car-cleaning gear for dad... These things do service for everyone and are not gifts in the usual sense. An exception would be if you give something like the car-cleaning gear, include with it ""coupons"" the recipient can cash in to you to wash and wax the car for them. Otherwise, if you must produce such items as gifts, gift them to the house, the car, or the family as a whole. These sorts of items are just too impersonal to be true gifts and this makes them conditional--you are giving something provided that everyone else gets to use it.

, You are giving because you want to. If you don't want to, then you need to reassess the point of what it is that you are really doing. Do not expect gratitude, smiles or something in return. Although most respectful and well-mannered people will demonstrate gratitude, there are times where this will not be forthcoming for one reason or other but that does not necessarily mean that the person doesn't respect your gift-giving or not appreciate it. Sometimes people are embarrassed, too surprised, shy, ashamed, or self-conscious to react in a gracious manner. If you have given with good heart, their reaction or lack of one should not bother you. Look deeper and you will see truly how the gift has been received.

, Wrapping and presenting the gift will show your sense of style and also that you have taken care to present your gift nicely, a demonstration of respect for the recipient. It doesn't have to be complex, and recyclability is de rigueur.

, It's time he understood that cooking is for anyone in the household, not just your daughter.

, Let them know that always being late for nearly everything is annoying, by buying them a watch so next time they're late you can ask them what's wrong with the watch i got you?

, It doesn't have to be real knives; plastic toy ones from the dollar store still carry the message perfectly well.

, It is meant to be a light-hearted response to real challenges that you are facing in your relations with certain people in your life and you must accept that it can and will backfire with some recipients. If that is an outcome you are prepared to face, these gift ideas might be for you. If not, try more constructive means for approaching the nagging mother-in-law, the overbearing boss, the faithless lover, or the whining friend.

Get early release tickets for their favorite film.,
Attend a “con” together.,
Treat them to a night out at a nerdy hang out.,
Take them on a geek themed road trip.",How to Find a Gift for a Self Proclaimed Nerd or Geek1," One of the best gifts you can give anyone is time well spent together. For a self-proclaimed geek or nerd, the ideal experiential gift may be watching their favorite film or film series on the big screen. They may love the gift even more if they are watching an advance screening of the film, before it hits the general public. Think about the person’s favorite film or favorite book turned film and see if you can get early release tickets as a thoughtful gift.


If there are currently no films coming out that feature their favorite characters, you may look for a film that has geeky elements you think they may enjoy. Perhaps a film is being released that showcases their favorite comic book character or their favorite sci-fi setting. Or, maybe there is a special screening of an old, nerdy film that you know they love. As long as you consider the person’s nerdy tastes, you can’t really go wrong with advanced tickets to a big screen showing.;
, A “con” is short for a convention that caters to nerds and geeks of all ages. Often, there are celebrity guests, panels, themed booths, and costume contests at the “cons”. These conventions can be fun and interactive ways to hang out with other nerds for a day or the weekend.You may treat the person to a trip to a “con” that focuses on their favorite nerdy pastime, like the popular “Comic-Con International” in San Diego or “Anime Con” in Los Angeles. Or, you may choose a gaming convention that appeals to gamer nerds, such as “PAX Prime”, or a sci-fi convention that is made for science fiction geeks, such as “Dragon Con” or “GirlGeek Con”. Try to select a convention that will appeal to the person’s interests.
You may decide to go all out and buy tickets for the con as well as plane tickets to fly to the con. Many of the larger geek conventions offer packages where you can get tickets to the convention and accommodations for a flat rate. This may be a good gift idea to mark a big event, like the person’s birthday or their graduation from college.

, This could be the new barcade that opened up downtown, where you can play arcade games and drink alcohol in a bar like space. Or, the games night at your local bar or hang out where you can play the latest board games with friends. Consider the person’s tastes and cater to them by planning a night out they will enjoy.If you are not sure where the person might want to spend a night out, you may offer to take them out to whatever nerdy spot they would prefer. Present several options that you know of and let the person choose. This will ensure they still get their night out, based on their preference.

, Another fun idea is to take them on a road trip that is geek or nerd themed. This may mean planning out an itinerary where you hit all the nerdy landmarks and spots within a certain radius. Maybe you stop at the life sized Star Trek Intrepid in the small town of Vulcan, followed by a day trip to the dinosaur museum, and a stop at a popular gaming store. The road trip could be overnight or a few days, depending on your means.You may also choose nerdy hotels or accommodations for the night to add to the road trip experience. Maybe you find the hotel where Leonard Nimoy once stayed or the motel next to where some scenes of “The X-Files” were shot. Get creative and look for accommodations that will enhance the nerdiness of the trip.

Determine what amount of money you'd like to gift.,
Fold one edge of a a bill of paper money.,
Create a folding pattern.,
Repeat the folding pattern.,
Wrap a small rubber band around the center of the accordion-folded bill.,
Put the folded, secured bill onto a Kukui nut or other beaded necklace.,
Fan out the ends of the accordion-folded paper bill.,
Repeat this process with the remaining money.,
Add paper flowers in the gaps between the money flowers.,
Mix up your homemade money leis by adding other decorations.,
Personalize the gift by adding things that are special to the recipient.,
Write or print inspirational notes on slips of paper.",How to Make Money Leis," While the number of flowers will vary based on the length of the lei and personal preference, most money leis require anywhere from 40 to 60 flowers. Based on that amount, determine how many bills of what denomination you need to create the lei. If you need extra flowers, you can create more from paper and intermix them with the money.A typical money lei could, for example, consist of 30 $1 bills and 30 paper flowers, 50 $1 bills or even 20 $5 bills and 20 flowers. The variety and amount is up to you.;
, First make a 1/2-inch (1.3cm) fold across one of the short sides of the rectangular bill.

, Turn the bill over and make a 1/2-inch (1.3cm) fold in the opposite direction on the same side. Flip the bill back over and make another 1/2-inch (1.3cm) fold in the same direction of the first fold.


This begins an accordion-style folding pattern.

, Continue folding 1/2-inch strips in alternating directions until you have folded all the way across the bill. Your bill should have the appearance of an accordion.

, The rubber band will keep the bill in place so you can attach the decorative ribbon.

, Tie the rubber-banded area of the bill to the necklace with a slender, 6-inch (15.24cm) piece of colored ribbon. You can tie it in a bow or any decorative knot.


You'll find it's easiest to evenly disperse the bills if you tie them to the string in between the beads. That way you can place them a determined number of beads apart.

, When the two ends meet, the bill will form a circle. Secure the ends together with a thin piece of double-sided tape.

, Continue folding additional bills until you have the desired number of money flowers secured to the necklace. Space the money flowers evenly throughout the length of the necklace.

, If you feel the lei is too sparse. it's easy to create matching paper flowers. If you prefer, you can also make extra flowers for the lei out of pretend money instead of paper.


Cut colored paper into money-sized rectangles. You can choose a single color or a variety of colors.
Fold each paper rectangle in the same accordion style you folded the money. Wrap a rubber band around the center in the same manner, as well.
Attach the folded paper to the necklace Just as you attached the money, use a small piece of tape and ribbon to attach the paper flowers to the necklace. You can add as many paper flowers as you like in between the money.

, Try tying colorful silk flowers, candy or even jewelry intermittently throughout the necklace.

, Choose small childhood mementos, baby toys, special charms, sea shells, ticket stubs - anything that brings to mind a treasured memory.

, Then fold and tie the notes in the same fashion as the money flowers.

Know who your audience will be.,
Consider serving food.,
Try to limit the lineup to three films, no more than four.,
Try to include at least one family film literally any age group will enjoy.,
Add in a Christmas comedy film.,
Try a musical Christmas film.,
Try the traditional movies.,
Take care with the overlapping genres.,
Be a good host and set the mood.",How to Have a Christmas Movie Marathon,"  If you're reading this, odds are your marathon will consist of more than just you, so you need to give this some thought. Are there going to be two attendees or twenty? Will they be adults, kids, teenagers or a combination? Do you know these individuals as family, friends, coworkers, a mix or something else entirely? All of these must be considered when determining your lineup of movies because you want picks that are appropriate and appealing for your audience.;
, This is especially useful if the movies are long and/or your audience large, it'd be a good idea to have some food at the beginning and between films. You can go with traditional movie munchies such as popcorn and a selection of sodas or go all out with the Christmas theme by serving cookies and hot chocolate. Maybe you could do both or perhaps have coffee and mints at the very end for anyone who stays after the final movie, it's up to you. Just make sure to have things ready so you don't interrupt the movies when they're playing, and unless you want to miss a few minutes, have enough to where you won't have to make anything more until between movies.

, You're probably going to include feature-length movies and those can be pretty long, so three will be enough to keep people engaged without eating up too much time. If one film is less than 60 minutes, you may feel free to throw a fourth into the mix and if your group is planning for a longer marathon with even more movies, go ahead.

, If you've got a mix of adults and kids, you'll want to keep all the films like this unless you're saving a grown-up film for when the kids go to bed. If it's all adults, then this will keep things engaging and perhaps bring back some childhood memories. 


A Charlie Brown Christmas is foolproof for this category and short enough to where you can include three longer films. Other suggestions include Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street or The Polar Express.

, This would be a good choice to keep the energy up.  Obviously, some of these will be more appropriate for children than others––if you have children or teens, take your pick(s) based upon their ages. 


Elf is a great pick because people of all ages like it and its PG humor is nothing older children can't handle. Other suggestions are Planes, Trains and Automobiles, Christmas with the Kranks, A Christmas Story and Home Alone.

, These can come in several varieties. White Christmas, Holiday Inn, The Grinch cartoon  and The Nightmare Before Christmas are what immediately come to mind. However, other good picks would be Christmas Eve on Sesame Street, Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas or any of the Muppet Christmas films.

, For more avid movie lovers, include at least one of the older classic Christmas movies.  White Christmas, Holiday Inn, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and A Charlie Brown Christmas have already been mentioned. If you need something not so musical and a little more serious, good picks would be Christmas in Connecticut, The Bishop's Wife or the quintessential Christmas classic itself, It's a Wonderful Life.

, Some films fall into more than one category and that's okay, just avoid too much overlapping. For example, A Christmas Story is a good classic, comedy and family pick that would appeal to many audiences. To balance it out, pick something that fits one of those categories and does it differently such as Elf for a more energetic comedy or It's a Wonderful Life for a more serious classic.

, Stay interested and energized throughout the whole thing, but lighten up and calm down depending on what's happening in the film. Your guests should know you're trying to help them have a good time and if anything, they would be wise to appreciate your effort. If they're less than grateful, it's a shame on them, not you. Just don't forget to relax and have fun!

Adapt a common item to a “nerd” version.,
Create a custom nerdy t-shirt.,
Put together a tribute to their favorite nerdy character.,
Make a nerdy board game.",How to Find a Gift for a Self Proclaimed Nerd or Geek2," If you are looking for a more hands on gift, you may decide to take a common item and adapt it so it is nerdy or geeky. This could be taking a pair of dice and adapting them into fun earrings or painting a pair of shoes so they become Doctor Who inspired or Star Wars inspired. Consider what the person enjoys and try to turn an everyday item into something nerdy and fantastic.There are many DIY nerdy crafts online that you can follow and create for the person. Depending on your skills, you may decide to sew a gift for the person, like a Darth Vader hoodie, or craft an item for the person out of materials, like a Captain America shield made out of a frisbee, tape, and glue.

, If the person loves nerdy shirts and clothing, you may decide to create a custom nerdy t-shirt or clothing item for them. This could be a graphic that you create on your computer of their favorite comic book character or television show or a graphic that you find online. You may print off the graphic onto an iron on adhesive and place it on a shirt yourself or go to a custom online shop who will print the graphic onto the shirt for you.Look for a graphic that is bright, bold, and high quality. You want it to print off properly and look good on the t-shirt or clothing item.

, If the person has a favorite nerdy or geeky character, you may decide to create a bunch of small DIY items as a tribute to the character. You could create a small model of the nerdy character as well as themed items like a mug, a bath towel, a t-shirt, or a hat. Put all of these items together in a gift basket and you have the ultimate tribute gift to their favorite nerdy character, film, or show.

, If the nerd in your life loves board games and playing games in general, you may want to surprise them with a nerdy board game. This could be a nerdy version of an existing game, like Star Wars themed Monopoly or Twister, Doctor Who style. Get creative and repurpose a game you know the person enjoys by adding on a nerdy twist.You may also want to create a board game for the person from scratch. Maybe you use their favorite comic book as inspiration and create a treasure hunt game, where the players all play different characters from the comic book. Or, you use their favorite nerdy film to make a trivia game to test their geek knowledge.

Look at geek focused online retailers.,
Search for the more popular products for nerds.,
Check if the limited edition of an item is available.,
Read online reviews of the product before buying it.",How to Find a Gift for a Self Proclaimed Nerd or Geek3," You can search for online retailers who specialize in geek gifts and look for gift ideas on there. Many sites allow you to filter your search by a specific film, television show, comic book character, or book. You can also search by price range so you stay within your budget for the gift and still find something great.One of the most popular online geek retailers is ThinkGeek.com. You can also look for many other retailers online who primarily sell nerdy and geek inspired products., You may also filter your online search by looking for the more popular products for nerds or geeks. There may be highly rated gifts on a certain site or more obscure gifts that are known to make good gifts. You may also look for an obscure gift that complements the person’s preferences and tastes, such as a Doctor Who product for a friend who loves Doctor Who and is missing a few items in their collection.

, Geeks tend to love limited edition products and the newest versions of an item. You may focus your online search on a nerdy item that is one of a kind or limited edition. The person will likely appreciate a gift that was hard to get or difficult to find, as it shows you put thought and effort into the gift.

, Before you buy any item online, it’s a good idea to read reviews of the product. Check if the product is highly rated and the seller is certified, with high ratings or a starred rating. Some of the bigger online retailers will likely be reputable and fine to buy from. But if you are using a more obscure retailer, possibly in order to buy a more obscure gift for the person, you should read the reviews of the item and of the seller.


If you notice an overwhelming amount of poor reviews, you may want to avoid buying from the seller or look for the item at another store. Alternatively, you may decide to go for another item that is more highly rated, as the person will likely be much happier with a gift that is high quality and in good condition.

Celebrate Saint Mikulas Day.,
Write letters to Ježíšek (Jesus).,
Prepare for your festivities.,
Celebrate Christmas Eve (December 24).,
Go to Mass.,
Relax and have fun!

",How to Celebrate a Czech Christmas," St. Mikulas is roughly the Czech version of Santa Claus; they are based on the same historical figure, St. Nicholas. St. Mikulas has a day, December 5th, in his honor. In Prague the eve of this day, an actor dressed as St. Mikulas, accompanied by another actor dressed as an angel and another as the devil, can be seen walking the streets, asking children if they have been good, and the angel hands out sweets. In smaller towns, the actors go door to door. Then, later, after the children go to sleep, St. Mikulas hides stockings full of sweets in their rooms.


If you're in Prague and interested in seeing the actors, you can see them at the Old Town Square from roughly 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.
The devil's role in Czech Christmas tradition is stealing away the bad children, so St. Mikulas day is both fun and a little scary for children.;
, While St. Mikulas/Nicholas brings small gifts earlier in the month, Baby Jesus Himself is said to bring gifts on Christmas Eve. Czech children write the same wishlist type letters they might write to Santa in other countries. The Baby Jesus is traditionally considered more abstract than Santa Claus and lives in no particular place, so His address is unknown.

, Get a Christmas tree and set it up in your home, but don't decorate it just yet. Have the decorations on hand, though; traditionally the tree would be decorated with apples and sweets, but in the modern day many people use store-bought ornaments. You will also need a carp; in the Czech Republic they are sold live in the days before Christmas and often kept in the bathtub until the Christmas Eve feast, where they serve as the main dish.

, In the Czech Republic, Christmas Eve is the favorite holiday of many people. On Christmas Eve, the tree is decorated and a feast is eaten once the first star has appeared in the sky. The feast includes the aforementioned carp, as well as potato salad. A soup (mushroom, sauerkraut, or fish) might be eaten before the main course, and the meal can be followed by a dessert. Once the meal is finished, everyone sings Christmas songs before moving to the tree, which will, by now, have gifts underneath it.

, At midnight on Christmas Eve, most Czechs go to Mass. However, a number of them also go to Mass on Christmas Day before their noon meal.

Decide where you want to hold the party.,
Fix a date.,
Invite the guests.,
Pick the theme.,
Pick the food options.,
Decide on the beverages.,
Plan the entertainment for the evening.",How to Plan an Office Christmas Party," You will hold it either in your offices or at an external venue. Your decision will mainly be dependent on your budget and the number of people attending (don't ask how many people are coming yet, as that could get complicated. Instead, assume everyone is coming and use that number as your starting point, though this is a good time to decide whether dates are invited). Your main external options are listed below and a quick google should help you find events and venues in your area:


Hiring a space and planning all the catering/entertainment/bar organization yourself. For bigger events, this could be something grand, like a fancy hotel or an iconic building that has been renovated for such events. For smaller events, you could look to pub function rooms and village halls.
Hiring a space and a management company to create an event for you.
Signing up to an exclusive event - where the venue have decided on the theme/catering choices and you can hire the whole space for your party.
Joining one of the many shared parties held around the country - this is similar to an exclusive event, with the exception that you will be sharing the space with other organisations.
Taking the team out for a delicious Christmas meal followed by drinks. It's not a party per se, but it can certainly leave everyone feeling in the festive spirit!;
, You want to do this as early as possible. Even with a lot of notice it is really hard to pin down a small group of people to a fixed date, so imagine how hard it will be if you're doing it with only a couple of weeks to go or with a large group!


Your best bet is to pick a few dates that work for you and the venue that you have chosen and then ask people to vote on their preferred option(s).
Once you have your result, before you announce it to your team, make sure that you can book the venue. You don't want to announce the result only to find out that the venue is no longer free.

, With the venue secured, it's time to announce it to the team. Either send a 'Save the Date' email, and follow up with formal invitations a month or so before the party, when you have all the details. Or, if you've got all the information you need, there is no time like the present to get those invites out!


Don't forget to let people know if their partners are invited or not - it will save you a lot of questions later on!

, If you are joining a shared party then you can skip this step because it will have been decided on for you, the same goes exclusive parties (but don't worry, these events can still be spectacular). Think themes like ""under the sea"" or ""candy store."" If you are picking the theme yourself (or together with an event planner) then it's time to have a little fun! Your imagination is the limit but here are some ideas to get the juices flowing:


Winter Wonderland
Fire & Ice
Red & White
Colour me Bright
Masquerade Ball
Any of the decades
Movie night


Once you've picked your theme, write a list of all the decorations and props that you will need and get ready for a mammoth shopping trip!

, 2-3 months before the event, you should start thinking about catering. Now, if you are attending a shared party or exclusive party, then you won't have much to do at all (except maybe circulate menu options and collate responses). If, on the other hand, you are planning the event yourself, then you have a bit of a task ahead of you!


The first thing you should do is find out if there are any special requirements for food; are there vegetarians, vegans, allergy sufferers etc. in attendance? If so, make sure that you have options for them too!
If you decide to hire caterers, then your job will be a little easier. They can present menu choice to you, and you just have to pick what you want to go with.
If you're doing it all yourself, then you need to start writing lists of the food you want to serve (buffet-style will be the easiest option), drawing up shopping lists of what you'll need and seeing if you can rope in some helpers to prepare it all!
Once you have your list, it is probably easiest to order online and have it delivered directly to your venue. Supermarkets are great for this, and often have offers on, to help you save pennies!

, Again, if you're attending a shared or exclusive event, then this will most likely be included in your package. But if not, you need to start working out how much you need and where you're going to get it from!


A general rule of thumb is to allow 2 drinks per guest for the first hour of the party, and then one drink per hour after that.
If you're providing table wine, then it is generally considered correct to allow 2 glasses (half a bottle) per person.
Don't worry about catering for all tastes; it's ok to pick just a few different alcoholic drinks - people are generally less fussy about what they drink when it is free and it will save you a lot of headache!
Don't forget soft drinks and water - not only will there be people who don't want to or can't drink alcohol, but you also need to make sure that the guests who are drinking alcohol are doing so safely - and that means having access to non-alcoholic drinks too.

, It may be that the venue is putting it on for you, but if not then you will need to arrange it yourself. At the least you want to make sure that you have music for people to dance to (and this is sufficient entertainment for most people), but if you have time and spare change in the budget, then you could add entertainment such as:


Casino tables
Bucking broncos
Magicians
Acrobats
Group games like giant Jenga & giant Twister
Photobooth (with fun props!)

Don't make the party feel like a work event.,
Create a mingle-friendly environment.,
Get the right foods and drinks.,
Help people bond with a fun activity.,
Help people who don't know each other find common ground.,
Have employees fill out a fun questionnaire in advance.,
Have an advance rule that no one can discuss business matters at the party.,
Don't let anyone get too drunk.",How to Get Employees to Mingle at a Christmas Party," If you want people to mingle and to feel comfortable being themselves -- not their buttoned-up work selves -- then you have to make the atmosphere feel as festive as possible so people forget about their work selves. If you can throw the office party in another location, like at a person's house, an event hall, or a restaurant, then you can put people at ease this way; if you have to throw the party at the office, then make sure to make it look and feel as festive as possible by putting up tinsel, decorating a Christmas tree, or doing whatever you can to turn the usual work environment into a fun, festive place.;
, Avoid the harsh bright lights that make the party feel like a meeting. When you can, dim the lights a bit and create a soft glow that makes people feel less self-conscious and more friendly. Play music in the background that creates a fun atmosphere without distracting the guests from talking to each other. Don't make the room too cold or the guests will be bundled up and more likely to leave and less likely to feel at home among other employees.

, If you want the party to be a success, then you should spend more money on good booze than good food. That being said, you should have enough food around so that people don't get drunk really fast because there's nothing to eat. Make it clear if it's going to be a dinner/pot-luck thing or if you'll just be providing snacks or desserts. If people know what to be prepared for, then they'll adjust their appetites accordingly. The booze will get people talking, and the food will keep them occupied.


Put the food and drinks in a central area so people don't isolate themselves when they go back into the well.
Get finger foods instead of big heavy foods so people are walking and moving around to get more food instead of sitting down over a heavy dish that makes it hard to chat.
Don't bring foods that are too much of an effort to eat, like drumsticks or steak. Pick foods that you can easily bite or dip into things while having enough concentration to talk to people.

, Try a fun game like pool, darts, karaoke, or even sardines to get people together. Provide any activity which will help people start mingling and not talking about work. If you want to get even more creative, here are some other activities that can make employees have fun while opening up:


Jenga
Limbo
A dance battle
Cards Against Humanity
Contests with prizes
Charades

, Find two employees who you think would like to meet each other, and introduce them. Bring up a topic that you know they are both interested in (""Chris, isn't your son applying to colleges? Marley here has a sister who's an admissions officer at Yale. Maybe she can give you some tips!""), or relate one person's experience to the other (""Joan, did you know that Harold climbed Mount Everest last year?). Get the conversation rolling and then move on to mind your other guests.


You can also help people who do know each other find common ground. If you do a bit of digging, you may find that a lot of people at your company have more in common than they think. This can make the party more fun and can even start some friendships away from the workplace.

, In advance of the party, have each guest complete a fun questionnaire about themselves, include such topics as ""Unusual hobbies"", ""Pet peeves"", ""First job"", ""Most embarrassing moment"", ""Dream vacation""... etc. Then use the highlights of the results and create a fun fill-in party game for the guests. Once everyone guesses who's who, you can announce the correct answers, and if you'd like you can award the winner of the most correct. The main idea is to give out fun tid-bits about many of the guests and that will spark lots of conversation later.


Make sure that the questionnaire really is fun and that you don't ask -- or reveal -- about any information that is too personal. Your goal should be to make the employees feel even more comfortable, not less.

, The whole point of the party is to help employees get to know each other as people, not as employees. Falling back on discussing work matters can be a real crutch, and can keep people from getting to know each other away from the office. Talking about work can also get pretty boring for the family members or guests of the employees, who will feel excluded from the conversation.


Just remember that some people will be really shy or nervous and won't be able to find anything to talk about besides work. If they insist on doing this, then don't be too much of a pain about telling them what to talk about.

, Sure, a little bit of alcohol can make people open up and feel at ease, but too much alcohol can make people humiliate themselves by doing things like confessing their intense crush to a co-worker, or telling another co-worker that they're going to leave the company in a month. If you catch anyone who is becoming a little too loose-lipped, try to steer this person in the right direction or get him a safe ride home.


On that note, if you want people to have fun, then you can't have a party full of designated drivers. Make a plan for employees to carpool together -- which will also encourage mingling -- or arrange for taxis to take people home in advance. This way, people will feel more relaxed and ready to mingle instead of watching what they drink and worrying about the drive home.

Set an early time limit on leaving.,
Be prepared to give of yourself.,
Realize that other people will be wondering why you're not there.,
Gravitate toward the people whom you get along with best.,
Live on the sidelines.,
Put your smile on.",How to Cope With Being Forced to Attend the Office Christmas Party," While you're obliged to turn up, you're not obliged to stay for the whole party. In fact, make it absolutely clear before going that you're really excited about the party but isn't a pity that you have to attend your child's Christmas pantomime show just two hours after the office party begins. This lets people know you're keen to go but family or other personal commitments will be cutting you short, thereby making you both work and family conscious.


If the party is during work hours, you'll need to square taking off early for personal reasons with your superior. Just disappearing during work hours can cause people to worry about you.;
, This is the season for caring about others and sharing. Share a little of yourself and be prepared to chit chat more than perhaps you would normally. Using the excuse that you'd rather die than spend social time with work colleagues isn't healthy for your career prospects anyway.

, They might quickly decide that you're being a bit of a snob and giving them the old heave-ho, which won't make things good for you back in the work environment.

, You don't have to spend the whole time hanging around being superficially polite to the harasser from floor four or the trophy wife from reception; after a few polite exchanges, simply sidle off and discover those colleagues you enjoy talking to.

, If there are too many sentimental work moments being relived by the more extroverted elements of the party or the party's just too loud/crass/crazy/boring, etc., hug the side of the room or even wander into the corridor or outside now and then. Grab a drink and some nibbles, a sympathetic colleague and huddle away somewhere near enough to be seen but not drawn into the center of the party.

, Be prepared to enjoy yourself and you might be surprised to find that you actually do. Free food, free booze, free entertainment; don't look the gift horse in the mouth.

Splash red food coloring where it seems appropriate on the body of the bunny.",How to Make a Chocolate Zombie Bunny," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"". If you don't already have a chocolate bunny mold, this can be obtained from places that sell chocolate making accessories, such as craft, candy, cake and party stores, or check online.


The style of bunny mold doesn't really matter, as long as it is large enough to be able to make additions to. If you make flat bunnies, there will be less opportunity to make open brains but you can still make great open sides to reveal ""organs"".;
, Or, if it is without instructions, follow this potted version:


Break chocolate into smaller pieces if it isn't already.
Add to a double boiler (bain marie) - water should be in the bottom layer of the double boiler.
Heat the water. The steam will hit the base of the bowl holding the chocolate and the heat will melt the chocolate. Stir constantly until it is melted and smooth.
Don't heat any more than it takes to melt the chocolate.
Do not add water as the chocolate will become unusable. Take care not to accidentally introduce droplets of water to the chocolate with the stirring implement.
Be sure to temper the chocolate before using it in the mold.

, Remove any stuck melted chocolate using a rubber spatula.

, Follow any instructions provided with the mold but basically it is a case of waiting patiently, then carefully removing the chocolate from the mold for the next steps.

, You can use small blobs of melted chocolate to act as ""glue"" when adding the decorative items to the chocolate. And there are no rules. You can zombie your rabbit however you like but the following suggestions are provided to help guide you if you're stuck for ideas.

, There are likely to be any number of possible zombie eye combinations but here are a few:


Glue on a little yellow candy or M&M style chocolate where the eyes are (or should be). Place a small blob of chocolate in the center of the circle for a pupil.
Make an eyeball that hangs out from the socket. Find a red twisted or straight candy length (such as a red shoestring licorice length) and glue one end to the eye socket. At the other end, add an eyeball candy. If you can't find candy that looks like an eyeball, use a small white, round candy with a chocolate blob in the center or a dab of blue or green food coloring.

, If you have made a zombie bunny with frontal head space, turn this into an open skull with brains oozing out. Scrape away a decent area of the forehead without breaking right through the chocolate. Use red food coloring to outline the edges of this area. Use melted white chocolate across the area (if the bunny is not already white) and use a toothpick or similar implement to try to make the little curly brain look. Once the chocolate has set, draw over with red food dye to make it appear like blood. You can also add a few gory hanging out bits by gluing on red shoestring licorice lengths.

, Use white chocolate (if the bunny is not already white) to draw revealed ribs in the ribcage area of the bunny. If the bunny is already white, swap to using a dark chocolate blob glued in place, then white chocolate lines drawn onto the blob.


Use a raisin painted red with food coloring to look like an open kidney or liver.
Use squished candies to look like oozing intestines.

, Using white chocolate (if the bunny isn't already white), paint over the ear hole. Then use red food coloring to establish how much blood is oozing forth. Add some red shoestring licorice lengths coming out of the

, The only issue here is how obvious it looks; on white, green or light brown bunnies, it should be obvious. On dark bunnies, it might be difficult to see. Judge it by whatever bunny you've made.

Get into the spirit.,

Let the dancing happen.",How to Avoid Holding a Boring Work Christmas Party," Make the office look like Christmas for starters. That's a big lead in to spreading and building the cheer pre-party.;
, This will lighten up the atmosphere a lot without drowning out conversation. Try to steer clear of the dull Christmas music though; find music that rocks. There will always be one party-pooper who grumbles about whatever you choose; just ignore them.

, There is usually a lot of alcohol (some of it not so good) but the food is often neglected. For many workplaces, people are really tired by this time of the year and they've been snacking a lot rather than eating well. Consider putting out healthy and delicious food. It's not only tempting but it becomes a talking piece and livens people a lot.

, You might even need to let them in on their role as conversation facilitators. There will always be a few really quiet or restrained folks who need some nudging to join in the conversation. Chat with them first before their negative wishes that they'd rather be somewhere else take over the atmosphere.

, Think about things that are doable in the area where you are having the party, such as quoits, darts, pin the tail on the donkey, pass the parcel, croquet, whatever. Just have some fun and childish distractions around that can add to the entertainment and enthuse some parts of the party.

, Enthuse people to have a hug under it. No need for enforced kissing at work parties but a hug can go a long way to goodwill and lots of laughter.

, Don't waffle on about the organization - talk about how much you have appreciated working with everyone and say at least one good point about each person in that room. It starts everything with a wonderful, warm, glowing feeling.

, Some of the reticence to enjoy the night might stem from fear of traveling home later in the dark, or lacking transport, or being inebriated. Alleviate these concerns with a once-a-year free trip home after the party.

, This is always a fun one - a gift for a token amount for each person from someone unknown. You can even try such themes as ""recycled"", ""work-related"", ""useful"", ""frivolous"" etc.

, Have the top boss dress up as Santa and ho, ho, ho for a bit. Maybe even hand out bonuses or certificates of achievement. This will surely make everyone laugh.

, Encourage it by making a space and having decent music.

The Mess will advise members of the ball date. If you cannot attend, decline following Mess Rules. All Mess Members may take one guest or attend alone. Tickets may be available for additional guests, you'll need to check with a member of the committee. Tickets will be paid for via the member's Mess Bill. Guests cannot pay for their own tickets though you can of course give the money for your ticket to the Mess Member. Expect to pay a minimum of around £70.00 per person.
, Different categories of ball goers will need to obey different rules regarding appropriate dress.


Mess Members.
Male and Female members of the Mess must, without exception, wear full Mess Uniform. The only concessions to individuality for gentlemen being shirt studs, pocket watches and cuff links. Lady Mess Members are limited to a dash of special occasion perfume or scent and some modest jewellery in terms of being original! It is best practice to have your ""funny drinking suit"" ready well in advance and make sure you are aware of any local quirks such a a senior officer's aversion to patent leather George Boots.

Military Guests. Any active members of any armed forces may wear their dress uniform to an NCOs Mess Christmas Ball.

Civilian lady guests. Full length, reaching to the ankle at least, Ball Gowns should be worn and shoulders should be covered.
Strapless gowns are permitted but wear a shawl, stole or bolero jacket to comply with Mess etiquette. Long dresses of cotton, Jersey or lycra mix fabrics are NOT suitable. Gowns should be silk, satin, taffeta etc, or at least give the appearance of such. This is a ball, wear your very best jewellery if the fancy takes you! Diamonds, pearls, rubies, sapphires can all be used to adorn! Elegant and sophisticated costume jewellery is appropriate too as are evening gloves, vintage clutch bags, silk evening purses, tiaras and similar! Lady Guests may wish to wear an evening version of a form of national dress, for example a Sari.

Civilian Gentlemen Guests. Dinner Jackets or Tuxedos, basically a black suit, two piece or three piece, that is appropriately worn with a bow tie. Gentleman may wear a plaid kilt with a dinner jacket if desired, underwear optional obviously! Waistcoats do not have to match the suit. Cummerbunds can be worn if desired.

, Transport, usually in the form of a mini bus may be provided but it's unlikely to be door to door. You may need to walk to where you'll be picked up from and walk home from there at the end of the night. If you live close enough to the Mess or other Ball location, feel free to make your way on foot. You can take your evening shoes with you and walk in something more comfortable or appropriate for walking if you like., If you have responsibilities at the ball as a Mess Member on no account arrive late for duty. Have a plan for what your guests will do while you are busy with your duties., Change into your ball shoes if required. Put your cloak room ticket somewhere safe. Use a mirror to check everything is in place before you make your entrance if you like., You will almost certainly be served a drink at this point. It may be wine, champagne, punch or something else. Non-alcoholic alternatives will be available. In the foyer will be displayed the seating plan. Drink in hand, figure out what table you are sitting at., You may be seated with other people you are friends with if you have requested this or you may be seated at random. Say hello to the other guests and be sociable. There will probably be some bottles of wine on the table for you all to share. Open these straight away if you like or save the wine to accompany the meal later on. There will be an order of events on the table advising you what will be happening when throughout the event., There will be papers on the table possibly with popular drinks listed. Indicate how many of each beverage you require on the paper with a pen or pencil. Add in writing any drinks you want that aren't listed and fill in the Mess Member's Mess Number in the appropriate place. A member of staff who is ""waiting on"" will take your order to the bar and return with your drinks. Guests may not go to the bar and get their own drinks, especially ladies! Drink bills will be settled through Mess Bills after the event., You'll be told what to do in an emergency, for example where to evacuate to and you'll be advised where smoking is permitted. There may also be a briefing regarding what will be occurring during the evening and you may be welcomed to the event and asked to show your appreciation for the organisers with a round of applause., At this stage in the proceedings there is often some form of entertainment, frequently a cabaret act of one sort or another. By now you should of taken in your surroundings and been impressed, or not, by any themed decorations at the venue. Relax, chat to the other people, admire the uniforms and gowns and take it all in. Not everyone gets to attend balls!, The Mess will almost certainly have arranged a photographer to take photos of individuals, couples and small groups. There will be an area set aside with an appropriate background or setting for the occasion., There will be adequate washroom facilities at the ball. They may be hired, portable toilets or you may use the facilities in the main mess building. It is recommended that you don't wait too long to do anything you need to do in the restroom, bathroom or lavatory as the condition of these facilities has a tendency to deteriorate as the night goes on. A small supply of lavatory paper in one's pocket or evening bag can be a blessing., Your ticket may have automatically entered you into a raffle or you might be invited to buy raffle tickets during the evening. A Money Tree Competition is where players are invited to buy the right to be selected to be eligible to pick a sealed envelope containing an undisclosed amount of cash from many attached to a Money Tree - usually a tree branch in a pot!, It's almost certainly going to be a buffet meal. Tables will be invited to select from the buffet one by one. There will be a wide range of hot and cold dishes. Usually roast meat, poached fish and vegetarian options will be available accompanied by a potato side dish, vegetable side dishes and various salads. After everyone has selected their main courses and the majority of people have finished eating their main course, the plates will begin to be cleared away and tables will be invited to select from the dessert buffet. It's polite to only make one trip to each buffet. Remember you or your partner works with, or even for, these people so consider playing it safe and being on your best behaviour., After the meal a band may play dance music or there might be a disco or both, one after the other. It is a ball but don't worry, you won't need to waltz or tango or cha-cha-cha or any of that ballroom stuff. The Squaddie Two Step will be fine. If you do have moves, feel free to show them off. Couples may dance together, groups of friends, a bunch of girls or a load of lads. Dance how you want with who you like but keep decorum in mind. The majority of people will be married or in committed relationships so don't be causing any drama flirting or behaving inappropriately., Don't lose control of your faculties through intoxication. Your behaviour will be noted by those in authority so don't do anything that could jeopardize your career, and partners and guests, your behaviour will reflect on the Mess Member that invited you., Mingle, chat, make new friends and get to know acquaintances better. You have something in common with everyone in the room so small-talk should be easy. Balls are a safe and friendly environment where it's okay to approach people to compliment their outfit, comment on the décor or just ask if they are having fun. Don't gossip though and don't discuss work or your partner's complaints about work. The Mess Ball is not the place to air your grievances regarding the long hours your partner has been working lately with their boss, for example!, Often a full English Breakfast is served an hour or two or three before the end of the night. You have paid for your ticket so you may as well sample all the fayre! Also, if you have over indulged on the alcohol front, breakfast will help soak some of it up., Hopefully there's transport laid on to get you home. Don't forget to collect your coat and if you are a lucky lady guest, there may be a goody bag."

Regardless of how you feel about the party or the office, office parties are a crucial part of the office dynamic. Think of it like a Sunday afternoon visit to Grandma – even if you don't feel like it, you know that you probably should go.


Accept that this is part of what is expected and expect to be able to talk to the people you do get along with, at the very least. It's a good opportunity to meet your superiors in a casual environment and a chance for networking with new people. Both are great things for career escalation. It's also a good opportunity to get the wallflower into a good conversation. You might be surprised and find a terrific person there.
If work is paying, here's a chance to enjoy food and alcohol at work expense!
Consider leaving early in advance. When you're deciding whether or not to agree to going to the party, it can help to reassure yourself that you can come up with a valid early exit strategy, such as having to attend a kid's Christmas concert, or your spouse's business Christmas party, etc. At least this way, you can save face by turning up for part of the event but leaving before things become awkward or strange.;
, Go out of earshot to take the call, then return and say you must leave on an urgent matter. Some good excuses are your friend's car broke down on the highway or your roommate is locked out of the apartment.

, Find out what everyone else is wearing before the party and match the tone with your outfit:


If it's casual dress and you turn up smart, that will immediately put you on the back foot and make the rest of the evening very uncomfortable. It also opens you up as an easy target for derision. The same applies the other way round.
If you are a woman, find a compromise between 'I'm attractive and sexy' and 'Take me seriously, I'm a professional'. Revealing clothing, while fun, is not appropriate around your superiors. Think beyond the event to the image you'd like your co-workers to retain of you in months to come!
If everyone is heading straight to the party from work, you don't have to worry as there won't be time to change, so clearly work clothes are the go.

, This is an office party, not a discotheque. So turning up 'fashionably late' is not an option and could have you missing out on all the fun. Arriving on time gives you the opportunity to say hello to everyone, and still get out early without seeming rude.

, Be sure to acknowledge all your co-workers, and especially your superiors and their associates as this will put you in good stead; the Christmas party is an excellent opportunity to cement relationships and to get known in a good way.Talk to your co-workers and bosses about work issues in a positive and complimentary light, focusing on achievements for the year and fun things you remember. And don't be frightened to talk to your co-workers and management about things outside of work such as the cinema, football, hobbies, family, or dogs. And practice listening; this is as important as the small talk.


Even if there's someone you really don't like, like Steve from accounting, it's best to have a quick chat with them, and remember to use that winning smile.
While the occasion may feel really informal, take care to still defer to superiors; this isn't the time to be speaking your mind informally to management (unless doing so is the norm in your workplace)., Don't forget where you are – technically, still at work because you're with the work crowd, so treat the party as an extension to your work day.Keep in mind that everything observed has the potential to be turned into a judgment on your professionalism and work suitability. If there is one thing that can besmirch a reputation, it's getting out of control on the liquor at the work Christmas party. No matter how much management has insisted that everyone let down their hair, just don't. Wait until after the party if getting blind drunk is your plan; grab the few trusted co-workers and head off somewhere else. At the party:


Eat first before drinking. Drinking on an empty stomach is asking for trouble. Space all drinks with water and more food, and lots of conversation.
Join in the drinking so you don't look like a stiff, but judge the tone carefully. If it's a kicking party led from the top, and you're having a good time, you can let your hair down a little more than usual but do be aware of your limits and keep in mind that someone is always watching with an eye to judge in the workplace context.
Under no circumstances allow yourself to get hammered. The more drinks you have, the more likely you are to do something that you'll regret.
Avoid using alcohol as the excuse to let out a year's worth of pent-up resentment and frustration about your boss, co-workers, or the workplace in general. Telling them what you really think of them will be remembered forever more as the truth from your perspective, and this can only harm your future prospects in the company.

, It's that time of year. If you're having an office blowout and Jeanna from HR is there, you may be tempted to make your move. This can go either way. Remember, you will have to see this person at work on Monday. Think: Do I really fancy them? Do they like me? How much have I had to drink? Will I regret this in the morning? This is called a reality check. If you fail the reality check, under no circumstances should you make your move. If however, you have strong feelings for that person, this may be the opportunity you've been waiting for.


Be discreet. Your co-workers will gossip as soon as they see anything happen.
On the other hand, you may find yourself being hit on - even by your boss. If this is not to your liking, be tactful. You don't want to damage relationships with your co-workers or boss, so let them down gently.
Don't lead anyone on because you're drunk and you feel like it. This will only create problems on Monday, especially if they like you more than you like them.
Bear in mind the potential for claims of sexual harassment. Do not touch people in ways that can be misinterpreted, or say things that are considered demeaning or sexually provocative. Use your common sense.

, If you see a co-worker overdoing the drinking or making a move when they are clearly not fully mentally cognizant, step in and bail them out. Explain to them what they are doing and how it appears to other people. If this doesn't sink in, discreetly ring a cab and take them home. This is one time where your own executive decision-making can save their reputation. You can always return to the party after if liked, but don't bring up what you've just done, as it's a helping act to fix things quietly and with grace.

Organise the supplies needed.,

Decorate each egg before dyeing if you intend on adding features.,
Set the egg on the egg spoon, and lower it into the desired colour.,
Place the removed egg onto a work surface that has been covered in newspaper.,
Leave the eggs to dry in the egg carton or, better yet, a wire rack which will minimise the marred contact points.",How to Dye Eggs for Easter1," There are a few things you need to do before commencing:


Buy a half dozen to a dozen eggs at the grocery store, or collect them fresh from your hens.

Hard boil the eggs. Do this by placing the eggs into a saucepan with a pinch of salt and covering with water. Bring to the boil and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for at least ten (10) minutes and then lift the eggs out carefully with a spoon or tongs. Place them under cold running water until they are cool enough to handle, at least a minute, and cool completely on a rack in the refrigerator before using.Buy an egg decorating kit! These usually consist of several dye pellets, colour coded cups, a special egg spoon, and, of course, directions to make the dye. Or buy a set of little bottles of food colouring, which you can use for all kinds of projects such as tie-dyed cake.

, In most cases, you drop the pellets into water or vinegar (about 1 tablespoon of vinegar). (Liquid food colouring usually requires vinegar). Make sure to have both nearby. You can use a glass, cup, or a bowl to pour the water into, just make sure the container has enough space for the egg. A disposable plastic cup (suitable for hot liquids, if you're using them) would be perfect because staining it won't matter and it may cushion eggs dropped in a little.









Set the containers of dye in a row. Place the hard boiled eggs in one spot for easy access. It's also a good idea to set up the work surface by covering it with newspaper (you can then rest the eggs on this as you add more dye effects, and it will also catch dye drips.) And add an egg carton or a wire rack for drying the eggs on after they are dyed.

, If wished, you can draw on the eggs with crayon, or place rubber bands or dot stickers on the egg. Covering parts of the egg with tape, stickers, crayon wax from drawing, or rubber bands will result in the covered parts of the egg not being coated in the dye you are about to dip the egg in but will create their own cool effects.


You could dye an egg a light colour, mask off parts, and dye the rest a darker colour.
Naturally, you can add decorative effects after dyeing as well. It's really up to you and a good way to find out what you prefer is to try decorating both before and after dyeing the eggs.

, You can either lower it in partway to dye only a certain segment of the egg, or lower it in all the way. Leave the egg in for at least 3 minutes before considering removing it.








The egg will soak up more colour the longer you wait, so if the colour isn't what you want just yet, leave it a little longer.

, At this point, you can place a different drop of colouring on the egg for added colour effects and then blow through a straw to disperse the drop of dye across the egg. This will make interesting new patterns. You can also use a paintbrush to move the dye around if you like.









To make an especially beautiful egg, repeat these steps as much as desired. Continuous re-dipping of the eggs will result in colours mixing together, multiple layers of patterns (some coloured), and varicolored stripes. You can take off the bands and stickers in between rinses or not; experiment with different methods, as explained in the next sections.

, Place each egg there as done, and get on with the next egg until you've finished with them all.

"
"
Poke two holes in a raw, regular-sized egg.,
Reach through the larger hole with a needle, wire, straightened paper clip, toothpick, or small balloon pump.,
Decide how you want to blow out your eggs.,
Set up a clean wide bowl or jar to catch the insides of the egg.,
If you want to use the traditional method, hold up the thin straw to the small hole.,
If you want to use a syringe or special egg blower, hold the tool to the small hole in the egg.,
Take a glass of water and pour it over the eggshell to rinse it out.,
Dry the intact eggshells.,
Done.",How to Blow Out Eggs," Eggs usually have one end that's smaller and pointier. Pierce the smaller end first, then the other end (top and bottom). To pierce the initial hole, use a pin or buy an egg-pricker available from specialty suppliers. The holes then need to be made bigger, so you can get the egg contents out. To do this, you can either keep using a pin or similar tool, or for a very effective method, use two large round nails, one 1/12"" (2mm) thick and one 1/6"" (4mm) thick. Sharpen the ends of each nail using a file or emery board to create four sharp edges. Make the hole you are going to blow through a little larger using the nail. Then make the end hole slightly larger, about twice the size of the first hole, as this is where the egg contents will flow out.
/images/thumb/e/ed/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/e/ed/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg









One way to help prevent cracking when drilling the holes in the egg is to place ""Scotch""/""cellophane"" tape or an adhesive plaster/bandaid on the egg at the piercing point.
/images/thumb/3/37/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/3/37/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg













You can also pierce the egg with a little drill bit in a hand (not power) drill, small rotary tool such as a ""Dremel"" or twirled between the fingers. Let it scrape down gently, not punch in and snag and tear the shell with its flutes.

The bit should be a single solid piece of metal or metal-like carbide, not covered with grit which could contaminate the extracted egg.


Feel around the eggshell for any weak spots––sometimes they are slightly gray. If you can't find any, just select a spot near the center of the egg's ends for poking holes in.
Grip the egg firmly in your non-dominant hand (but don't break it!) as you stick the nail in with your dominant hand. Insert the nail slowly and apply even pressure.
To make the shell easier to poke holes in, try rubbing the egg on fine grain sandpaper to thin the shell. This makes it easier to penetrate the shell using a heavy pin or even a paperclip. The paperclip is great to break the yolk inside, which then makes it easier to blowout.;
, Pierce the yolk and break up the membranes that keep it whole. Gently push the instrument in and out of the hole repeatedly.
/images/thumb/9/9b/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/9/9b/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg








, The traditional method uses a small straw (like those thin straws you can find in any coffee shop) and air from your mouth, but you can also use a syringe to push air into the hole. If you don't want to use your mouth, choose a tool from the following:

An ear bulb syringe
An injection syringe (without a sharp needle attached)
A glue syringe
An ""egg blower"" (for example, Blas-fix).
A small air compressor, as for tire inflation or airbrushing. Attach the blunt, tapered low-pressure inflation nozzle and slowly bring it close to one hole. The egg should be disrupted and expelled without the need to break it up inside first.

Check for lubricating oil or dirt contamination in the air by directing the stream at some clean paper.
The egg may crack or even explode.
High pressure compressed air streams can be dangerous. Do not use a full-size compressor or pressurized tank, place the nozzle against the body or near the face, or allow a child to use the compressor.



, Hold the egg right above this bowl when you're blowing. If you use clean materials, you can save these partially beaten egg yolks and whites for other dishes in the future.

/images/thumb/1/15/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-4-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-4-preview-Version-2.jpg








, Blow air through the straw and into the egg, letting the insides flow out from the larger hole. Or you can put your mouth to one of the holes and blow. Do this until the egg is empty.
/images/thumb/5/54/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/5/54/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg








, Push air or water through the hole to get the egg insides out. If you use water, you may not be able to save the eggs for a future recipe. Repeat until all the egg contents are out.
/images/thumb/b/bd/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/b/bd/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg








, Then take your straw or syringe to blow out the water and any remaining egg yolk/white. Shake gently and repeat until the egg is completely clean.
/images/thumb/e/e5/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/e/e5/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg









You'll want to do this over a bowl––if you're saving the eggs for later use, set up a separate wide bowl for catching the water, or just do it over the sink.

, Optionally, put all eggshells in the microwave on high for 15-30 seconds or bake them in 300ºF/150ºC oven for 10 minutes. This may help to make them stronger.
/images/thumb/2/2d/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg

Alternatively, you can let them drain (larger hole facing downwards) for 2-3 days.

, They're now ready for decorating and placing on display.

Once the oil is in the dye, you can’t go back! Experiment by adding a bit more oil to the dyes; different amounts create different amounts of marbling.

Better yet, float droplets of a concentrated food coloring-vinegar (for colorfastness) mixture on a bed of shaving cream or float droplets of an oil-based immiscible food coloring on water, rake the color into a loose pattern, and dip the egg briefly to marble it as one would marble paper.You may need to dip one end or side of the egg at a time. A pair of tongs with loop-ended jaws would hold the egg securely and mask very little of its surface. If you use shaving cream, let the egg dry before rubbing off the excess foam.With either method, be prepared for the possibility that the colour may stick to you or what you're wearing better than the egg, even after it's dry.;
, Using a spoon or the dipper that comes with a kit, lower the egg completely into the dye and remove it quickly. Because oil and water don’t mix, you’ll get colour on some parts of the egg, and none on others, creating a marbled effect. Keep dipping to get a brighter color.








, Lightly pat the just-dipped eggs with a paper towel, or the colour may become muddy. If you want to dip them in another colour, wait until they’re completely dry first.

, Moisten a paper towel with vegetable oil and lightly wipe down the finished eggs with it to add a nice shine.

, Refrigerate the eggs until you’re ready to display them.

Limit the amount of attached lights.,
You can get around this three string ""limitation"" by using inexpensive outdoor outlet power stakes.,
Plug the mini-light strings into the outlets on the power stakes.,
There seems to be no problem daisy chaining power stakes, so you can plug additional power stakes into these six outlets to give you even more outlets.",How to Put up Christmas Mini Lights Outside Without Blowing Fuses," Do not put more than three strings of mini-lights end-to-end.;
, These are three (or more) outlets on a stake that you push into the ground. Some models have timers which can be set for a period of hours or from dawn to dusk. This is useful with Christmas lights. Assuming you have two outdoor electrical outlets, plug a power stake into each one. That gives you a total of six outlets.

, Each outlet should have a maximum of three strings plugged end to end. Six outlets accommodate a total of eighteen strings.

, The key is to never plug more than three strings of min-lights together.

Remove the strand's power cord from the main source of power.,
Remove any garland, or any obstacle that may interfere with the removal of the lights themselves from the tree.

,, They might not come off very easily, as they themselves may be wrapped up between the branches or may be stuck to some of the branches. As you pull the strand off from the tree, let these lay gently in an unused travel path that is free from the movement of any sources of other people.

,,,, If they have a wide-enough central point between the bulbs, you may even be able to keep one side of lights on one side of your hand, and the others on the other side of your hand,as the source page shows.

,,, Plug the two ends of power cord together, if they have the specialized attachment.

"
Try this if the entire string goes out.,
Open the fuse case.,
Check the fuses.,
Pry out the blown fuses.,
Find an exact replacement.,
Put in the new fuses.",How to Fix Christmas Lights1," A blown fuse will turn the entire string dark, not just part of it. This often happens when too many strings are connected end-to-end. A fuse can also blow when the wires are accidentally stapled during installation, or when the lights are plugged into a socket with too high a voltage (such as US lights in a UK socket).


If only some of the lights are dark, skip down to replacing the bulbs instead.;
, A string of Christmas lights typically has one or two tiny fuses in the plastic box attached to the prongs. Examine the plastic closely on the side of this box and in between the prongs for a cover you can slide or pry open. These often get stuck, so you may need to use some force.Do not plug the lights back in at any point during this method.

, Each fuse should be transparent, with an unbroken wire running through each one. If a fuse is black, or if the wire inside is broken, it needs to be replaced.


You may need to remove the fuse and hold it up to a bright light to inspect it.

, Gently lever the blown fuses out with a thin screwdriver.

, Many Christmas lights are sold with spare fuses for this purpose. If your spares have escaped from the holiday box, take the blown fuses to an electronics store and ask for a replacement. 100-light strings typically use 3A fuses, but it's best to confirm your fuses' rating with a store employee.Never use a fuse with a higher rating. This can cause a major fire risk.
Some LED lights only require one fuse, but keep a second one in the plastic compartment as a spare.If there's a fuse that's not attached to any wires, just transfer it over to the other slot.

, Pop the new fuses into the slots and close the plastic cover. Plug the light bulbs in to see if this has fixed the problem.


If the lights still won't come on, try a different outlet in case you blew a house fuse or circuit. If that doesn't work, keep reading for other solutions.

Boil the eggs.,
Fill a container.,
Soak the egg for 5 minutes.,
Dye the egg multiple colors.,
Remove the egg.",How to Decorate Easter Eggs1," Put the eggs in a pan of water. Turn the heat to medium. Allow the eggs to boil for about fifteen minutes. Then, remove the eggs and allow them to cool.While the eggs are boiling, use that time to cover the area where you will be dyeing the eggs with newspaper or paper towels.;
, If you’re only dyeing one egg, you can use a cup (236.6 ml). For several eggs, you should use a larger, plastic container. Fill the container with ½ cup of water, one teaspoon of white vinegar, and about twenty drops of any food color. You will know that you’ve used liquid if the egg completely submerges in the water.Fill several containers if you will be using different colors. Each color should have its own container.

, Place the egg on a spoon and dunk the egg into the liquid. Turn the egg around so that both sides get color. Allow the egg to soak for five minutes. Leave the egg longer if you’d like a darker color., You can dye the egg at least two colors by dipping only one section of the egg in at a time. This works best if you start with a fresh, boiled egg that has not been dyed yet. Hold one half of the egg so that only half of it is submerged in the dye. After about five minutes, submerge the other half of the egg in another color.

You will probably have to hold the egg as it soaks to submerge only half of it.

, You can use tongs to gently remove the egg. Put the egg(s) in an egg carton to dry. The egg is now ready to be used for decoration."

Use four hangers in total.,
Bend each hanger into a circle.,
Remove the hook part off the hanger.,
Slide the four hangers together to form the ball or sphere shape.,
Make adjustments to ensure that the circles are sitting evenly and make a clear sphere shape.,
Weave the wire or tape to keep the circles firmly in place.,
Test the strength of the sphere.,
Weave a set of Christmas lights onto the ball.,
Attach the lights firmly with the wire or tape.,
Display the Christmas lights ball.",How to Make a Christmas Light Ball from Wire Hangers," They should all be of the same size and preferably the same color.;
, Untwist the hanger shape and start pushing it into a circle. This will take some effort on your behalf, and it's a good idea to wear gloves, to avoid accidentally cutting or poking yourself with the wire.

, Cut off the hanger hook using wire cutters or tin snips. Discard this portion with care.

,


Arrange the circles within each other so that they create quarters like an orange, spaced at even placements around the ball you're now creating.
You will probably need to slightly bend some of the circles to fit inside the others; always try to keep the circular shape as true as possible.

, It can help to stand back from the project at this point.

, Weave over, under and around each of the crossover sections of the wires of the whole sphere. Be generous with the amount of wire you're using; the sphere needs to be stable and strong to hold the lights.


Tie/wind off each woven end neatly and firmly so that it won't unravel.

, Press down on it gently at various positions to ensure that none of the circles can move or slip. When you're satisfied this works, move on to the next step.

, Weave in and out, around and around, covering all of the wire divisions making up the ball.


If the Christmas light ball is to be located outside, use lights suitable for outdoors.
You may need more than one set of lights, either for fullness or even for interesting color variations.

, Make attachment points regular down each wire line of the ball.


If the ball is for outdoor use and you're using tape, ensure that it is heavy-duty outdoor tape.

, It can be used in various ways, depending on its size, indoor or outdoor use or need. Some examples include:


Place inside a plant container and put along a pathway or at your front gate entrance.
Place inside an interesting bowl and use as a centerpiece.
Place direct on the ground or snow outside.
Hook some wire or rope at the top and hang it from a rafter, a tree branch or some other high area indoors or out.


However you display it, don't forget to account for the need to place the cord somewhere and plug it into electricity or a generator.

Plan to use several strands of Christmas lights when you use them on interior areas.,
Place cuphooks at frequent intervals on your walls or around windows in the area, if planning to use them on your walls or windows.,
Test out each strand of lights, to ensure each strand works.

,
Plug the strand into the electrical outlet, as you begin to loop the strand up to the closest first cuphook.,
String a few of the lights over a few of the cuphooks.

,
Unplug the strand from the electrical source temporarily, while you hang the rest of the strand or strands.

,
Continue hanging the strands of lights on these cuphooks.

,
Use the open end of the electrical continuation area of another strand to strand up another line of Christmas lights.,
Use some packaging tape in areas that cuphooks would not be able to be able to be used for some reason, or if the area is smaller than the lights would allow, or if the cup hook forces the lights to hang in an unnatural position on the wall.

,
Tie any unneeded extra Christmas lights at the end of the strand with a twist tie or rubber band and let the remainder hang.

",How to Put Up Christmas Lights Inside,";
, Cuphooks are cheaper than those hooks meant specifically for hanging lights. Cuphooks might not look as pretty, but they can also be used in the kitchen, so it still can be a stylish item to use to keep the lights hanging. Cuphooks should be used on either side of track lighting strands and at both sides of corner areas.

,, Use packaging tape sparingly for a few minutes, if the strand will end up cutting in front of any other objects until it reaches the first cuphook.

,,,, Rubber band/tie any unneeded (and definitely unsightly extra length of empty Christmas light strand sections that commonly end up at both ends of the used Christmas light strands.

Buy a christmas light repair tool.,
Use the spark function on your repair tool.,
Trace the location of the dead bulb.",How to Fix Christmas Lights2," Most of these tools include everything you need to find and replace the bad bulb: a continuity detector, piezoelectric sparker (shunt repairer), and light bulb removal tool. It costs roughly $20 US, so this may not be worth it if you only have a couple strings of lights. If you prefer to avoid buying such a specialized device, try the following alternatives:


Get a non contact voltage detector and skip down to tracing the dead bulb. Alternatively, buy a cheaper light bulb tester without the other features.
Tackle the project hands-on with a homemade tool.

, Christmas lights are connected in series, meaning the whole string will go dark when one bulb fails. A failsafe called a shunt in each bulb is supposed to prevent this by closing the gap across the burnt-out bulb, but these often don't work properly. (In regions on 230V mains rather than 110V, the shunt usually does its job.) The sparker function on your repair tool will zap the shunt, hopefully succeeding in closing the gap:


Plug the string of lights into the socket on the repair tool.
Press the button (or pull the trigger, depending on the model) about 20 times.You should hear a click each time.
Plug the string of lights into a normal outlet. If the string is still dark, continue to the next step. If the string lights up except for one or two bulbs, skip down to replacing individual bulbs.


, If the string of lights still won't light up, move on to the detector. This detects the current running through the wires, so you can identify the point where it fails.Here's how:


Tug apart the braided wires to identify the one directly connected to the light bulbs.
Place the detector on this wire about halfway along the string, between two bulbs. (If your tool has a small hole for a detector, place a light bulb into the hole instead.)
If the tool hums or lights up (depending on model), the problem is in the half of the string farthest from the plug. If there is no hum or light, the problem is in the half closest to the plug.
Move the tool to the middle of the problem area and test again, narrowing it down to ¼ of the string.
Repeat until you find a bulb with current on one side of it and no current on the other. Mark this bulb with tape so you don't lose track, then replace this bulb as described below.

"
"
Understand the goal.,
Find a lighter operated by button.,
Empty the lighter of fuel.,
Remove the piezo igniter.,
Zap the prongs of the light string.,
Plug in your lights.",How to Fix Christmas Lights3," Each Christmas light bulb has a ""shunt"" that is supposed to close the gap when the bulb burns out. This often fails, but a small surge of current can trigger this and put your lights back on.This will not work every time, especially with this DIY approach. If you're looking for quick results, try the methods above instead.

, This type of lighter has a piezoelectric crystal which creates a spark when pressed. Do not use the type with a metal wheel, which creates the spark through friction.

, If the lighter is disposable, just burn the fuel away. If the lighter is refillable, transfer the lighter fluid to another lighter, or to a sealed, clearly labeled fire-proof container.


Never dispose of lighter fluid in a drain or in household trash.

, Pry apart the plastic cover, then lift out the igniter with a pair of needle nose pliers.The piezo igniter includes a button, and two tiny metal or plastic prongs. When the button is pressed, a spark jumps between these prongs.


The spark is not dangerous, but it will give you a mild electric shock. More importantly, it could ignite fumes and light a small flame. Work over a nonflammable surface and keep your fingers and face away from the sparker during removal.

, Position the two prongs of the sparker against the two prongs of the Christmas light plug. Push the button about 10–20 times. You should hear a click and see a spark each time.


If it's too hard to line up the prongs, connect them with insulated wires.

, If all went well, the lights should now light up. There will be one or two dead bulbs, which should be replaced as described below. Leaving the dead bulbs on will cause the other bulbs to burn out sooner.

"
"
Twist the light bulb to check the connection.,
Purchase replacement bulbs.,
Remove each of the blown-out Christmas light bulbs.,
Insert the replacement bulb into the old bulb's socket.,
Remove broken sockets.",How to Fix Christmas Lights4," This is rarely the problem, but it only takes a second to check. Twist the light bulb gently to tighten it in position. If the bulb moved noticeably, plug in the lights and see if a loose connection was causing the issue. Assuming the bulb is still out, continue to the next step.


If you have many lights, buy a string of bulbs of the same brand and type. Keep it in storage and twist off the bulbs to use as replacements when you need them.

, If you don't have any replacements, take along the burnt-out bulbs to a hardware store, pharmacy, or home improvement store. Look for bulbs that match as closely as possible. Ideally, check the packaging your lights came in to see what type of bulb is needed.


Some bulbs are flashers, and when installed, will cause lights to flash on and off. There is no need to have two flashers on the same circuit, as they may cause unusual on / off timings.

, Use your thumb and index finger to delicately put pressure on each of the broken light's plastic base, to remove the fragile bulbs. If you have a Christmas light repair tool, it may come with a small grip for this purpose.


In order to remove a broken Christmas bulb from its socket, find the two copper wires that sit on the base of the old bulb, noting their position on the base.
Push both of the copper wires down, so that they are pointing towards your floor, and the bulb is pointing towards the ceiling.
Pull upward on the bulb, and it should now be separated from the light's base.

, Make sure the two copper wires are completely aligned with the holes in the bulb's base. Once the bulb is fully seated in the base, fold the copper wires against the base in the same position as noted above. Plug in your lights and watch them glow.


If you used a continuity/voltage detector tool, and your lights still won't turn on, use the tool again. There may be a second burned-out bulb. These tools can only detect one burned out bulb at a time.

, If a new bulb still won't light up, your socket may be corroded or the wire may be damaged nearby. Removing this is not as difficult as it sounds, although each bulb you remove will cause the remaining bulbs to burn more brightly and therefore burn out sooner though removing one or two bulbs should be fine. (Note that a damaged wire or a repair using this method, unless done well, may present an electric shock or fire hazard.) Follow this method:


Unplug the lights.
Using wire cutters, cut the wire on either side of the broken socket. (Do not cut the other two wires.)
With a wire stripper, strip about ½ inch (1.25cm) of insulation from each cut end.
Twist the two strands of wire together.
Get a twist connector from an electronics store (a small conical cap). Twist this over the wire, holding it in place.

Use a plastic egg.,
Paint the egg.,
Apply Mod Podge.,
Pour glitter over the egg.,
Allow time to dry.",How to Decorate Easter Eggs2," Real eggs are difficult to use with this method because they break easily. A plastic or paper mache egg is best to use. You can use any color egg you’d like., You don’t have to paint the egg if it’s already the same color as the glitter you will be using. If it isn’t, choose a color of acrylic paint that is the same color as your glitter. Use a paint or sponge brush to coat the egg in two or three layers of paint. Wait until the egg completely dries to move on., Use a separate sponge brush to apply a thick coat of mod podge to the egg. Make sure all of the egg gets covered with the Mod Podge. This part will be messy, and your fingers will likely get covered with glue.You can use baby wipes to get the glue off of your fingers.

, Put the egg into a plastic cup. The narrowest part of the egg should be facing upward. Pour glitter over the egg. Gently shake the cup so that the glitter covers the egg. You can add more glitter if necessary., Once the egg is coated in glitter, give it thirty to sixty minutes to dry. You can leave the egg in the cup as it dries, or place it in an egg carton."
"
Boil the eggs.,
Use acrylic paint.,
Paint one half of the egg at a time.,
Create a sponged effect.,
Allow the eggs to dry.",How to Decorate Easter Eggs3," Hard boil the eggs for fifteen minutes. Allow the eggs to cool completely. Set them in the fridge if you'd like to speed up the process., Acrylic paint is ideal for eggs because it covers them well and adheres nicely. You can use any brand and color of acrylic paint that you’d like. Use a paintbrush to create fun designs. Since eggs are pretty small, get some fine-pointed paint brushes for more intricate designs.You may want to cover the area where you will be painting with newspaper.

, You can paint any design you want. You can leave it one color, paint geometrical patterns and shapes, or turn the egg into a cute animal—like a bird. Let it dry before painting the other half to avoid smearing the paint., You can use this technique if the egg has been painted one, solid color. Wait until the first layer of paint dried. Then, use a dry sponge to apply white paint on the eggs after the other paint dries. Don’t use a lot of paint. Use a thin layer of white paint and dab the sponge all over the eggs., Wait ten or fifteen minutes for the eggs to dry. Handle them carefully when you move them. Display your Easter eggs as you wish."
"
Find a silk tie.,
Cut up the seam.,
Wrap your egg.,
Secure with a tie.,
Wrap the egg with a second layer.,
Boil the egg.,
Allow them to cool.",How to Decorate Easter Eggs4," Use a tie that you won’t be wearing anymore. The tie should be 100% silk. A tie made of any other material won’t work. Choose a tie that has an interesting pattern. Dark purple, blue, and red ties work the best.It doesn't necessarily have to be a beautiful tie. “Uglier” ties sometimes make the most beautiful eggs.
If you don't have any ties laying around, silk ties can be found cheap at most thrift shops.

, This should double the size of your tie, which will give you a piece large enough to work with. Cut out a section that can easily wrap around your egg. You'll need a section of the material that wraps around the egg and can be held together. Leave about five centimeters of excess fabric., Wrap the egg in the tie. The right side of the tie material (the side you would see if you were wearing it) should directly touch the egg. Wrap the egg as tightly as possible without breaking the egg.The folds in the fabric will form a swirly pattern.

, Use a twisty tie to secure the fabric at the top of the egg. A string works, too, but a twisty tie is much easier to work with. Secure on the long side of the egg if you want the opposite end of the egg to show the pattern the best. Tie the egg horizontally if you want the wide side of the egg to show the design., Use a lightweight and lightly colored fabric. You can use a pillowcase, thin dish cloth, or sheet. Wrap the fabric tightly around the egg, and secure it with another twisty tie., Put the egg in a pot. Cover it with water. Add 1/4 cup (50 g) of vinegar. Boil for about 20 minutes. Then, take them off the heat and put them in a colander or on a towel to dry., Give them about ten minutes to cool down before you touch them. Then, remove the fabric. Be careful when handling the freshly dyed eggs."

Buy Christmas lights.,
Examine your electrical outlets.,
Evaluate your front yard and house to determine where you will put your lights.,
Pick your lights.,
Put up your lights.,
Consider programming your lights to flash to music.,
Don't be shy.,
Have fun and let the lights complement your personality.",How to Decorate Your Front Yard for Christmas," You can find these on sale in November or early December. Department stores are generally good places to buy lights; some even have breakdowns of the unit price per foot.


If you want to be strategic, go shopping on the day after Christmas or after New Years. Stores put lights on massive markdowns, well, because the Christmas season is over. Store these lights for next year's extravaganza.
The internet is increasingly a one-stop shop for items like Christmas lights. Online retailers often compete for lowest prices and sometimes even offer free shipping.;
, Don't overload your power source. Do you have any outside outlets, or a porch light? These will be your source of power for your lights.


Think about adding outdoor outlets if you don't have any — it's relatively easy and inexpensive, especially if you get hubby to do it!
If you need to, you can string an extension chord from an outside outlet along the house and to your lights.
If you need to power your outside lights from an outlet that is indoors, you might be able to string an inside extension chord under a door and outside, where it will feed the lights.

, If you have a tree in your yard, you can put lights around the trunk, in a spiral pattern, or wind lights through the branches. You can use ice lights on your roof, or you can spiral lights around railings and banisters. Use whatever you have to make your house unique.


Use the trim of your door or the edge of your house for lights. Illuminating contours that are usually unseen because of darkness is a nice way to make your house even bigger.
Fences are also fair game. If you plan on putting lights up on the top of your fence, check with your neighbor first. Remember that Robert Frost quip, ""Good fences make good neighbors?""

, There are tons of different kinds of lights on the market, owing to the popularity of the holiday season and people's ever-growing fascination with light shows. Do a little bit of research on the types of different lights you may want in your front yard:


Mini lights or net lights are a standard kind of light and go on houses or landscaping.
Icicle lights or c-series lights drape down and usually go on the roof.
Mini Trees are two- to three-foot-tall trees, often made of tomato cages wrapped in lights of one or multiple colors. Arranged in a line or a triangle, they are very useful in an animated display.
A Mega Tree usually consists of a large pole with lights extending from the top to a large ring around the base. This too is very useful in animation.
Blow molds are plastic lighted sculptures of deer, Santas, etc. They are usually placed throughout the yard.
C9 Lights are bulbous, colorful lights that usually go on the house or on the yard perimeter.

, If your goal is to have the best lights on your street, take into account what your neighbors are doing or have done. Be creative and have fun with your lights. If you have a small space, make the most of it. Three strands of lights can make a small space impressive if you arrange them the right way. If you have a large space, spread your lights all across your yard.


Purchase and place blow molds throughout your front yard. Have a whole community of elves, reindeer, and Santa's. Position your blow molds in expressive ways, so it looks like the figures are interacting with one another, or telling a story.
Color-coat like a pro. Arrange your lights so that the colors work well with one another, in contrasting and complementing fashion. For example, if you have three hedged you want illuminated, drape one set of green, one set of blue, and one set red over each hedge. A yard full of color looks better than a yard lit by a single color.
Share the nativity scene in your front yard. Don't lose sight of the real meaning of Christmas. If you're game, stage a nativity scene in your front yard, reminding passersby of the gift of Christmas.

, Alternately, program them to flash on their own, in a loop. Be careful, though: Flashing lights can be a burden on the eyes, and flashing lights with music can positively irk your neighbors. But maybe that's what you want to do, eh?


You'll need to buy a control system and software, which vary in cost and complexity, in order to do this. If you are unfamiliar with electrical systems, opt for the simple and pre-programmed over complex. Here's some software that you might consider using:

Light-O-Ramais the vendor for most residential lights displays. It is, however, pretty complex, and can take as much as four hours per minute of song to program 32-48 channels.
Animated Lightingis more expensive, but easier to program. Some residential light displays and most commercial ones choose Animated Lighting.
D-Lights is the least expensive of the bunch, but you need to have some passing familiarity with and knowledge of control systems and electrical engineering.


Find what kind of music you want to showcase with your lights, if at all. Do you want traditional Christmas music accompanying your lights, or would you prefer something a little more modern?
Give yourself at least a couple of months to set your lights and program them with the software.

, Experiment with your options. A wreath or garland on the door gives your house a nice feel. If you aren't satisfied the first time, take down your lights and rearrange them. No one's stopping you from doing exactly what you want.

, Whatever you do, have fun. Lighting up your yard in the spirit of Christmas can be energizing and fulfilling. Let your personality shine through in your lights.

Avoid purchasing a hula hoop with beads or sand inside (some hula hoops are designed to make a little noise). Unless you are looking for a somewhat noisy chandelier test the hula hoop before you purchase.;
, You want to transform the hula hoop from a toy to a sturdy chandelier frame.

, You want the duct tape color to match the color of the paint you will be using to cover the hula hoop. Also, always go for new lights as lights from holidays past may have burned out or could be on their last leg.

, You want three poles of the same length that can be joined together at the top.


As an option you can use a ball of twine to hold your chandelier.

",How to Make Your Christmas Lights Flash to Music," You can decide to have your lights draped across your whole home, either inside or outside, or choose specific spots on your house and in your front garden. Keep the following in mind while you're planning your lights show:


A channel is a unit of lights that can be controlled individually. For example, a single bush in your yard may be a channel if you drape one set of lights over it.
All the lights in a channel work as a single unit. Unfortunately, you can't flash an individual light bulb.
32 to 64 channels is a good size to start with if you're never programmed lights to music before. Any bigger than that, and you'll probably curse the day you ever decided to take on the project (or the day your spouse made you take it on).;
, The best time to buy lights is the day after Christmas. Often, you'll find lights that were normally priced around $2 a strand fall to $0.50. Check out Walmart, Target, Lowe's, Home Depot, K-Mart, and other department stores for the best deal. Use the internet to price-hunt.

, You will need hardware that hooks up to your computer. You can buy a system completely built, a kit, or a full do-it-yourself system.


A fully built system will work right out of the box. It will cost you about $20 - $25 per channel. A fully built system can be purchased from online vendors. Choose this option if you do not want to do any electrical work (especially soldering), or don't have the slightest clue about where to start.
A kit is a little more hands-on. It will cost from $15 or so per channel, but it's pretty much the same thing as a fully built product without the enclosure. Because it is very simple to place an electronics board in an enclosure, this may be a great option if you're looking to save money. Some vendors sell everything you need to build a control system, including the bare circuit board and the parts. If you are willing to solder a little bit, try this
A DIY system costs roughly $5 per channel and up. The price depends on how much you actually do yourself. A system consists of a controller, which communicates with your computer, and solid state relays (SSRs), which actually switch the lights. SSRs can be bought or made yourself. With a DIY option, you will spend lots of time making your hardware, but the cost savings should make up for it. You'll also have the ability to totally customize your hardware, and will be able to fix problems easily.

, This can be a very big and complicated project, and often can seem overwhelming if you're just getting started. Have interested friends or family members help you, or sign up for help at some of the forums listed below.


Depending on the degree of difficulty, give yourself anywhere from 2-6 months of prep time before you can expect your lights show to be fully operational. It may sound like a lot of time, but you'll need it.

, For the low-tech layman, you'll be able to buy software that will help you program your lights. There is also free software available for Do-It-Yourself systems (see the links section). If you're ambitious and more of a tech-wizard, you may wish to hand-code a program in almost any major programming language. Note, however, that you won't be able to use this option for pre-built products, as most of their protocols are closed-source.


The software that you choose will basically break the song you're syncing your lights to into very short segments (.10 second), letting you program each channel of lights to turn on, turn off, fade, twinkle or shimmer. There are essentially three commercial options for software.


Light-O-Rama is the vendor for most residential lights displays. It is, however, pretty complex, and can take as much as four hours per minute of the song to program 32-48 channels.

Animated Lighting is more expensive but easier to program. Some residential light displays and most commercial ones choose Animated Lighting.

D-Lights is the second from the least expensive of the bunch, but you need to have some passing familiarity with and knowledge of control systems and electrical engineering.

Hinkle's Lighting Sequencer is actually a free software that is simple yet powerful on incandescent light bulbs, LEDs, and RGB LEDs.



, Design the actual outside portion of your display. Common elements to include are:


Mini lights or net lights go on landscaping.
Icicle lights or c-series lights usually go on the roof.
Mini Trees are two- to three-foot-tall trees, often made of tomato cages wrapped in lights of one or multiple colors. Arranged in a line or a triangle, they are very useful in an animated display.
A Mega Tree usually consists of a large pole with lights extending from the top to a large ring around the base. Again, it is very useful in animation.
Wireframes are metal frames with lights attached.
Blow molds are plastic lighted sculptures of deer, Santas, etc. They are usually placed throughout the yard.
C9 Lights are bulbous, colorful lights that usually go on the yard perimeter.

, Here comes the time consuming part! Decide on music that you will synchronize to, then start programming on your time grid. Don't do everything at once. This will probably take a couple of months, depending on the length of your show and how many channels you have. How program your show varies, depending on the software program you choose.

, Use a way that will create a spectacular sound yet keep everybody at peace. Speakers playing the same music over and over again would drive the neighbors crazy, so in most cases you will need to broadcast over an FM frequency. Please see the warnings section at the bottom of this page.


Respectfully inform your neighbors of your plan to create an animated display; having the neighbors on your side is important if you want your display to last long enough for other people to see it.
Stick to a single showing at the top of the hour, once or twice a night. If the neighbors know that the display will only last three minutes, and will show nightly at 8 and 9 PM, they'll probably be more understanding than if you blasted it regularly from 6-9.

, Make sure your home has enough outside power to run your lights. A typical mini light strand, for example, draws about 1/3 amp. Speaking of power, computerizing your display will have a lower electric bill than a static display since not all the lights are on at once. Please see the warnings section at the end.

, Put a sign in your yard. Make a website. List on a display listing site. Tell your friends. Doing all this work will not be worth it if no one comes to see your display. Don't go to extremes, but make sure people know about you.


Again, inform your neighbors that you are publicizing your display. They'll be much more accommodating if they know your plan to attract attention from around the neighborhood.

, Go outside every morning and check your display. Repair or replace broken lights or damage caused by weather or vandals. Make sure things are ready to run that night.

Align the Christmas lighting display with the style of your home.,
Get some inspiration.,
Walk around your neighborhood.,
Check out home furnishing stores.,
Go crazy!,
Examine the lights before you get started.,
Locate the power sources nearest the roof line.,
Use the right tools.,
Install fasteners.,
Hang the lights.,
Check out your work.,
After completing the roof line, decorate the other elements of your home.,Sit back and enjoy the holidays!",How to Put up Christmas Lights Outside," Is your home a modern house, a Tudor, or a Victorian? Is a basic tract house or multi-storey? A lighting display should complement both the style of the house and the style of the neighborhood without spoiling it or looking garish. Some considerations to bear in mind:

For a Victorian style house, there may well be no such thing as “over the top"". But elegance is a key factor. Strings, strings and more strings of lights around every architectural feature of the house will enhance its stature, making your home the neighborhood beacon of holiday cheer.



 


A ranch-style or single story home calls for lights around the roof line, the fence and along your entrance walkway.






Multi-storey homes call for the same basic theory as a Victorian, with less “fluff"". String lights along the roof line, around columns, along the porch railing.





;
, If you're short on ideas, do a search on Google, or browse through a few magazines for ideas that may be suitable for your own use.

, Borrow ideas that catch your fancy, but avoid copying another house exactly. That won't look good for either house. If you're new to the neighborhood, visit with your neighbors and find out what people generally do for holiday lighting. You may discover that your street is the street to visit during Christmas, and that everybody goes overboard on lighting.

, Especially the high-end ones. You’ll find excellent ideas for dressing up your windows inside. This treatment becomes part of the view from the outside.

, If you're really after an eye-grabbing lighting display, consider hooking up a control system to make your Christmas lights flash to music.

, Make certain that they all work and that there are no frayed areas in the cords before you take them up the ladder. Avoid repairing frayed cords. Dispose of the entire string if you find damaged cords—it is not worth the risk of fire.

, It will probably be on the porch, as most houses do not have a power outlet near the roof. You’re going to need at least one good extension cord. Select an exterior cord which is compatible with your lights, and with the weather it will endure.


If you have a porch light that's shielded from the elements, you may be able to insert a socket adapter that places a power socket between the fixture and the lamp.
If you have an exterior outlet somewhere on the house, install your extension cord from the outlet to the roof line keeping the cord as close to the building as possible. Be sure the outlet is protected from rain, snow and sprinklers.







, Use a reliable, sturdy ladder, and get a helper if you can. Outdoor lighting requires a lot of lifting, careful placement and aligning, which is much easier to do with a helper (or two).


If you work alone, use a basket or bucket with a handle to haul your materials up and down. Put a nail or an S hook on the ladder so you can hang your tote bucket.






Limit the number of times you go up and down the ladder, but do not lean to reach anything. When you can’t reach the next position, move the ladder.






Do one step of the project to its completion before you begin the next phase.






You can run an extension cord through a window. You will probably not be able to close the window all the way, but you can block up any air gaps with a towel.







, Pre-installed hooks or holders over which to drape the extension cord(s) and the light strings will make it much easier to hang your lights. Space the fasteners uniformly with the distance of area between the bulbs on the light strings. (Finish this step completely before you start hanging the lights.)


Note! While nails, screws and other metallic fasteners seem an easy answer, they are conductors of electricity, they rust, and they put holes into your structure. There are many products on the market made of rubber or heavy duty plastic designed for hanging electrical cords. Consult the sales staff at a reputable hardware store. Tell them what you will be doing with them. They’re fairly inexpensive and easy to install. Look for fasteners with a moisture resistant, peel-and-stick backing that will hold up to ten pounds.

, Start at the power source and follow the fasteners to the end of the project. Hang one string, then plug in the next string, end-to-end. Don’t cut corners by plugging all the strings together. Don't connect more than three sets together, or you risk overloads and chances for fire.


Be certain that the light string cords are secure in or on the fastener. You don’t want wind, birds, small animals, or Santa to knock them off!

, Get down to the ground, turn on the lights and stand back away from the house. Check for uniformity. Get a second pair of eyes from a family member or a neighbor. Good job!

,


Columns: Combining the light strings with holiday garland (natural or artificial) will enable you to wrap a column (barber pole style) with ease. The additional bulk of a garland will help avoid slippage of the light strings and add a little pizazz, too!






If you need a little adhesion, space and hide small pieces of removable tacky clay behind the string garland. Removable tacky clay is available at reputable craft or hardware stores.







Porch Railing: Open baluster style: Using the same barber pole technique with garland, loop the light strings over and under the railing. Secure it as needed with removable tacky clay.







Porch Railing: Along the top of the porch enclosure (one that is like a ½ wall) use the rubber or plastic, peel and stick fasteners that were used along the roof line. Note: these fasteners may be ineffective on concrete or stucco.







Windows: Place around, over and under windows in such a way as to frame the windows.







Fences: Use the same techniques as on the porch railings.







Trees: There are a variety of solutions for trees. Either use the traditional wrap as you do with indoor trees, or use a net of lights that drape over the top of the tree. You can also use single strands connected to a heavy-duty extension cord with multiple taps, and trace the branches of your trees with white or colored lights. Use plastic-coated twist ties to secure the lighting to the limbs.

Place a large Christmas arrangement in the middle of your table.,
Insert your Christmas cards randomly throughout this Christmas arrangement.",How to Display Christmas Cards1," It could be a fresh arrangement or an artificial one. You may already have a Christmas arrangement in your home that you use every year that would work for this purpose.


Consider an arrangement of pine branches or cedar branches. You could even try an arrangement of wooden branches with red berries.;
, The branches of the arrangement will hold the cards in place.

Hang a wreath inside your house for displaying your Christmas cards.,
Attach Christmas cards to the wreath as you receive them.",How to Display Christmas Cards2," The wreath would need to be plain, so that the cards would be the main attraction.

,


If the wreath is Styrofoam, you can attach the cards with a pin that is inserted into the card and the Styrofoam. If the wreath is covered in material, you can attach the cards with a pin.
If pins will not work for the type of wreath you have, consider attaching the cards with clips or miniature clothespins.

Purchase a long strip of wide decorative ribbon.,
Make a decorative bow at the top of this ribbon or simply notch the ribbon at the top.

,
Place a hanger on the back of the ribbon.,
Pin the cards to the ribbon as you receive them.",How to Display Christmas Cards3," Consider the colors of your home decorations when choosing the ribbon for this project. The length could be as short as 2 feet (60cm) or as long as you would like.

,, Hang anywhere in your home that you would like for your Christmas cards to be on display.

,

A good way to attach the cards to the ribbon is with small miniature clothespins. You can also use binder clips that can be purchased in decorative colors.






For a little more decoration, you can make a loop in the ribbon every few inches (cm). The cards would be attached under this loop. If you choose this looping method, it will take more ribbon.

String a garland across your window, fireplace or entertainment center.,
Attach your Christmas cards to the garland.",How to Display Christmas Cards4," The garland could be made from a ribbon, string, yarn or plastic chain. You might even use an evergreen garland for this purpose.

, Use pins or clips for attaching the cards.


You could also hot glue a small ribbon loop to the back of each card. You could then use the loop to attach the card to your garland. The card will hang down below the garland.






Some people dispense with the clothespins and simply hang cards sideways across the garland; this can still look very effective.

,, Assemble it so that the back ends of the tape end up sticking together forming a circle.

, To ensure a snug fit on the glass later, ensure that the strip isn't too big, and that the tape won't overlap onto the glass later. (make sure it shows only on the back). A strip about a half-inch long works best.

, Do nothing to the inside of the card (let the inside hang freely open).

, Most people start off in one corner and work toward the other. Let it terminate at or close to the other end of the window.

,, Prepare rows of them from one side of the glass to the other, with a small bit of space between each one.

, Look for the areas that have some empty space big enough for a card. These spaces are the spots you'll need to hang your next row of cards in. Don't allow the cards to be stacked one on top of the other.

,, Continue with placing cards on other windows in the house/apartment.

, Remember that every other row will have a card at the edge line on the one side, while the other rows won't have any cards touching either of the sides.

",How to Make Christmas Cards If You're Not Crafty," The paper possibilities are endless! You can choose something easy you already have around the house, or something that might help cover your lack of craftiness. Consider these options:


Copy paper: Not ideal, but you probably have some on-hand. Plus, it's easy to work with.
Cardstock: A little heavier than copy paper, this has a more weighty feel like commercially-produced cards. You can buy white Cardstock, or choose colored or metallic sheets.
Scrapbook paper: You can peruse a wide selection of scrapbook paper at most craft stores. If you're really not crafty, choose a style that incorporates a festive border or background, and most of the work is done for you!;
, Do you want to send a traditional folded card? Or maybe you've had your eye on a trendy postcard-style missive? Here's what you need to know:


Cardstock is the most versatile option here — it can be folded into a traditional card, or cut into whatever shape you want for a postcard. Just be sure to make a sharp, clean crease if you fold it.
Copy paper will make a pretty flimsy postcard. Easy right. If that's what you're using, stick to folding.
Scrapbook paper comes in several weights. If you chose one that's similar to Cardstock, you're free to do whatever you'd like. If it's a little thin like copy paper, though, consider folding it or — if you have your heart set on a postcard — backing it with a piece of plain Cardstock.

, Now that you've got your paper picked out, decide what to put on your card aside from ""Merry Christmas."" Don't worry, though! — you still don't need to be crafty to pull off this step. Here are some choices:


Print a stylized phrase or saying for the front of your card. Yes, you could scratch out ""Warm Winter Wishes"" on the front of the card yourself, but you want this to be easy. Cruise around Pinterest or Google Image Search for cute holiday phrases that someone else has done up with the pretty handwriting and flourishes. Save or download it, and print! If it's black on white and will easily print onto your chosen paper, all the better.
Or, use a pretty word processor font to say Merry Christmas. Just steer clear of Curlz, Comic Sans and Papyrus, the antithesis of crafty.
Add a family photo. Split the space on your card between text and the latest photo of your family. Choose one you like, and set it aside for the next step. Or, if you want to get extra fancy, choose three photos — two portrait and one landscape (or vice versa). Play with cropping and sizes until you have one dominant photo and two smaller ones.
Print it out. Open a word processor (Open Office will do if you're in a pinch), go to the page settings, and punch in the dimensions of the paper you're using. Throw your text and images onto the page, make sure it all fits, and print your masterpiece!

, Now that your basic card is done, add some extra flourishes to give the impression that you're a crafty genius. Try these hacks:


Put a ribbon on it. Grab a hole puncher, aim toward the top-center of your card, and punch two holes about an inch apart. Cut a a small length of ribbon and put it through the holes so that the two ends hang over the front of the card, then tie them up into a cute bow.
Cut a border on the card. If you have pinking shears or, better yet, specialty border shears, use them to cut around the edges of your card. If you have plain scissors but still hanker for a beautiful border, use a pencil to trace out some graceful, swooping curves, and trim the border by hand. (Be sure to erase any leftover pencil marks!)
Add some festive stickers. You could buy some festive stickers, and put one or two on the front of each card. Or, if you want to look truly resourceful and restrained, get some of those gold and silver star stickers your teacher used to put on tests. Group them in odd numbers (1s, 3s or in extreme cases, 5s) on your card.
Avoid glitter. It's tempting — glitter is festive, after all. But no one wants to open your well-meant Christmas card only to endure a tornado of glitter on their sweater.

, Make sure the year is somewhere on the card, and handwrite your personalized Christmas wishes. Put a signature at the bottom, and you're done!

Spend time with him.,
Fulfill his dreams.,
Bring someone into his life who he hasn't seen for ages.,
Give a gift that keeps arriving.,
Write him a letter of thanks and appreciation.,
Do something he has been asking you to do but you haven't yet done.,
Consider a corny gift.",How to Find the Perfect Gift For Your Father," Time is definitely the greatest gift of all and something we each have the power to bestow. Spend time with him doing things you know he'll appreciate, such as going for a walk, climb, or hike together; going fishing, cycling, or sailing together; watching a movie together; visiting an art gallery or museum; attending a sports match. Choose whatever you're sure he'll enjoy and make sure there is time to just chill and talk together.;
, If you're able to afford an expensive gift, try an experience gift. This sort of gift involves purchasing an experience that is not your ordinary activity. Think racing a car on a racetrack, skydiving from a plane, going for a balloon ride, taking a fighter pilot flight, doing a bungee jump, etc. You know your Dad best, so you'll know what experience he would find simply awesome and breathtaking. While it's costly, it will be a gift he's never going to forget!


Other more hands-on experience gifts include cooking classes, ice climbing, wilderness/outdoors first aid classes, learning to make things classes, etc.
Ask the rest of the family to pitch in on this sort of gift; that will reduce the costs and save your siblings having to find a gift (and Mom might even help too).

, Arrange for an old army buddy, a long lost school friend, a cherished and admired mentor, or someone else he cares about to turn up for the day. Organize the travel, the accommodation, and the day's activities so that it all proceeds according to plan. Be sure to call this person another name when talking to family about them, so that your Dad is thrown off the scent!


You can use sites like Facebook and friend reunion services to look for people and get in touch with them quickly.

, Month clubs can bring many surprises to Dad's door, with monthly shipments of all sorts of goodies such as chocolate, books, wine, cookies, pies, barbecue sauces, gourmet delicacies, and other delights. It's not something he's likely to arrange for himself, so indulge him.


Another great once-a-month gift is an arrangement to send him to a new restaurant every month for a set time. Draw up an itinerary of suggested restaurants and let him know he can choose one a month for the next ""X"" months, all costs covered. You can either call the chosen restaurants ahead with your credit card or have him forward the bill to you.
A monthly gift can be for as many months as you can afford; it doesn't have to be for the whole year. Or, you could be the source of the monthly gift by sending him a batch of homemade cookies or a new cake every month!

, While this isn't something that costs money, it is priceless and he'll love it. Thank him for the things he has done for you and be sure to specify precise things that have happened in the past year in which you felt he has supported you, cared for you, and made you feel special. Tell him that you're proud of him and that you're incredibly happy to have him as your Dad. This is the sort of gift that will make his day.


Enclose this letter inside a homemade card. For more details on making the card, see How to choose a design theme for a Father's Day card (this is also applicable to a birthday card).

, Clean out the pool or gutters, sweep the yard, put away your junk, bring him the quotes or information he's been asking for, show him your trip photos, etc. Whatever it is that you've been putting off doing at his request, do it!

, Once in a while, a gift that's a little saccharin sweet but fun can go down well, especially in tandem with a decent gift. Such gifts can be mugs, t-shirts, badges, and other trinkets that have messages about great dads, and similarly worded Dad pride. Have fun with this one and give it in the spirit of having a laugh together.

Give the winners a free gift, such as a major discount on your hottest-selling product or a gift card to a local home improvement store.;
, When someone buys something from your site, send them a gift card to a restaurant in their city. Treat them to a Father's Day dinner on you. You can even let them pick the restaurant of their choice at the time of their order.   To make the offer financially viable, limit it to orders that exceed a certain dollar amount. For example, you might send customers a $50 gift card if they spend $250 or more. Tip: you can buy gift cards at a discount from auction sites, card-swapping sites, and club stores, such as Costco.

, Allow visitors to your site on June 15th to get a discount if they type in a special Father's Day code.

, This promotion idea is meant to be fun and playful. If people have a fun time shopping at your site, they'll be left with a positive impression of you and your company. Here's how it works: When someone orders a product from your site on Father's Day, let them choose a fun giveaway item they can give to their fathers and husbands. For example, offer to send a pair of stress balls with a note that says, ""Because being an awesome dad is a stressful job!"" Or send a special Father's Day first-aid kit that has the words ""Be careful dad!"" emblazoned on the top. Dads can keep it handy when they tackle those pesky do-it-yourself jobs around the house. The point is to give your customers a fun way to celebrate the holiday.

, Along with every order that meets a certain dollar amount, send a t-shirt that lists the reasons we love our dads. For example, print the words ""27 Reasons I Love My Dad"" on the front of the shirt at the top and cover the front and back. Include a few humour lines too. Make sure the t-shirt is made of quality material so it doesn't fall apart after a few wash cycles. Some examples of lines are:


He's honest
He's hardworking
He's devoted
He's dependable
He's patient
He laughs at my jokes
He can fix anything
He's a great cook
He loves his family
He still has some hair on his head
He doesn't snore too loudly

Start by familiarizing yourself with the dogwood blossom.,

See how the shape, markings and colors of the dogwood blossom fit into the legend.





,
Look up photographs of the dogwood blossom on the tree's branches.,
Notice how the white blossom is often accentuated by dark backgrounds.

,
Begin your own painting of the dogwood.,
Sketch a number of circles and ovals on your paper for the blossoms.,

Indicate the centers as a cluster of small dots.,

Paint the small amount of color that shows on the petals.,
Do edits and refinements.,
Let the piece air dry overnight.,
Sign your work any way that appeals to you.",How to Celebrate Easter Painting Dogwood in Watercolor,"  Seeing it in passing is fine, but to paint it, taking a really hard and close look is helpful and necessary.;
,  Add another dimension to your study of the dogwood by browsing this topic on the internet.  There are many stories and poems about the part the dogwood tree played in the crucifixion of Jesus.

,, Check out pictures of the whole tree.


For inspiration, look at how artists have painted the dogwood.  The varieties are endless and lovely.

,,  Assemble your supplies;  a piece of 11"" X 14"" watercolor paper torn from a pad and water colors in a range of hues, either dry pans or tube paints squeezed onto a white palette.  You will need a selection of watercolor or all purpose brushes, a support board for your paper, a water bucket and tissues for mopping up runs and mistakes.,  They can be larger than life, approximately 1 1/2 inches in diameter to clearly show detail and for greater impact., In legend the symmetry represents the cross. Mark within each circle, a smaller circle for the center.  It can fall off center to show various angles of the flower.  Divide the circle into four equal sections, on for each petal. Round off the tops of the petals and give them a small dip or indentation at the middle point.





, Later, in painting the centers, you can have the shape appear to rise above the petals by having it cast a small shadow.,  Give each blossom a small stem connecting it to the branch.  Do leaves the same way.,  Make the center growth line slightly curved to show the curvature of the leaf.,  Start with gray shadows and markings on the petals.  Take a close look at a photo of a dogwood flower to see how the shadows are arranged on each one and attempt to copy those shapes.  You can draw them in pencil or paint directly.  Think of the gray shapes as places where the petal curls, is caught in a cast shadow or as growth lines.  A few delicate grays on each flower will bring it to life, you can add more later if needed.,  They do come in that color. If you want to, this is the time to do it. Remember to keep the rosy wash pale, and sheer.





,  Hold the brush half way up the handle for less control.  This ""shaky hand"" will give you a natural looking, gnarly branch.  Immediately, follow with a line of darker brown, almost black, along the bottom of the branch to indicate roundness.  Pull small lines from the wet branch with a small, pointed brush or a liner brush to make little stems where the blossoms and leaves are attached to the branch.

,  On a clean palette, one at a time, pull the three or four colors you want for the background.  Make good size puddles of the colors by adding enough clear water to make it apply smoothly and have lots of oomph, but not be watered down too much.  Keep a brush for each color so you can work fast.

,  Vary the strokes' direction and weight.  Pick up a second brush loaded with another color and paint some more, touching the first, wet area, allowing the colors to mingle and blend. Repeat the process, alternating colors, until the entire background is painted. Go loosely around the leaves, the branches and blossoms, adding fresh color as needed. Try not to work back into what you have already done. Allow the painting to dry thoroughly. Use a hairdryer if necessary., At the center top, around the indentation, paint a tiny rust colored area to represent Christ's blood. Use gold, yellow, or a dark color to paint dots in the center to represent the crown of thorns., Add tiny curly tendrils coming off the branches, growth lines on the leaves and flowers and a small gray shadow under the center area of the flower to show that it is raised., Then, if it needs punching up in any area, do it, but judiciously. Over painting and overworking dulls the freshness of the initial strokes and color masses. The painting will have luminosity after it dries overnight, a glow. The wet paper will return to pure white and surprise you with how it brings the color to the top and accentuates your intentions.

, Give this signature some thought and keep it consistent through your paintings. Usually it happens in the lower right corner. Some like it bold, it can be like handwriting, others prefer to semi-conceal it within the painting. Hang your work and know that you have honored the long tradition of the dogwood as an Easter symbol."

Throughout the day, reflect on the death of Jesus.",How to Celebrate Good Friday1,"


For Roman Catholics: There is no mass on Good Friday; however, there is usually a service with Holy Communion. Pray before the Lord in the Blessed Sacrament. The Holy Rosary is especially good prayer for Good Friday.
In addition to Holy Mass, many Churches may also have the Stations of the Cross, which may like to attend.

,


If in the event you are hosting guests, you may offer them afternoon tea, with some 'hot cross buns.' These are sticky fruit buns, with some dough at the top, in the shape of a cross. You may have it toasted, or plain.

, Some people refrain from eating at all, and some people eat very lightly. If you are still growing, it might be a good idea to eat lightly. See the section for Byzantine Christians below.

, Traditionally, Jesus died on the cross at this time.

, It is the whole idea of Good Friday.

Plan the Easter party.,
Read through the games in the following sections before selecting them.",How to Plan Easter Games for a Children's Easter Party1," The games for a party are usually one of the last things to decide upon after you've worked out the time allotment, the catering, and the guests, etc. For an Easter party for children, it's a good idea to mix up games with an Easter egg hunt, some food at a sit-down area, and a bit of rest time as well.


If you can get hold of a good performer who is willing to dress up as Easter bunny, you can also get this person to perform a few tricks or some face-painting to stretch out the party activities, or to take care of those kids who don't want to participate in the games.

, When choosing a game, keep the following considerations in mind:


Is this game going to be age suitable for the children attending?
Is this game going to fit in with the time available?
Is this game going to give all the participants a chance to be a part of it?
Is this game going to fit in with the party theme overall?

Make it a family event.,

Get or make your dad a card.,
Think of a creative gift.,
Tell him that you appreciate him.,
Do his daily chores for him.,
Make him a meal.,
Don’t put pressure on your dad.",How to Celebrate Father's Day," The worst thing you could do is forget or make a bunch of plans for father’s day only to realize that you got the wrong date. The date of Father’s day depends on what country you live in. However, in the USA and the UK, Father’s day is always on the third Sunday in June, so the exact date will not be the same every year.If you’re not sure what day Father’s day is a quick internet search using the terms “Father’s day” + the year + the country you live in should get you the answer pretty quickly.;
, How you celebrate Father’s Day will largely come down to knowing what your dad likes and what will make the day most enjoyable. That can mean planning a grand adventure, or simply taking care of all the chores around the house so dad can relax.Plan at least one activity to do with your dad that he will enjoy. Maybe he likes fishing or playing catch. Or maybe your dad likes to play board games with the whole family, choose something you know he’ll love.
Dads do a lot, from taking care of the house, picking the kids up from school or practice, to just being there to listen to your problems. Think about a time when your dad did something for you, and see how you can pay him back. It could be as simple as mowing the lawn.

, If you have siblings, you could get them involved in planning something nice for your dad. Having all of his kid’s celebrate father’s day with him will make it even more special. If you don’t have any siblings, you could also ask your mom or grandparents to help you.


For example, you guys could get together and write a song that you can sing to your dad on Father’s day, or you can make a card together.
Additionally, you could assign a part of father’s day that each sibling is responsible for. For example, you can be responsible for making him his favorite breakfast, one of your siblings can be responsible for setting up the TV with his favorite sport and preparing his favorite snacks, and another sibling could be responsible for giving him a foot rub.

, If your dad isn’t the gift type but enjoys nothing more than spending time together with family, then plan some type of activity where your dad gets to do something he loves.


For example, if your dad loves grilling, you could get all the things needed for a backyard barbecue and invite some of his friends over to hang out on Father’s day together.
If your dad likes fishing, you could plan an all-day fishing trip together just you and him (or you whole family, if you prefer).
Be sure to run the idea by your dad before you make any big plans though! You don’t want to plan a whole party only to find out he doesn’t want to have one.

, If your dad enjoys sleeping in, but normally doesn’t get to because of work and kids, let him do it today. Don’t walk around making a bunch of noise that will wake him up. Let him sleep as long as he wants, and start the celebration whenever he’s ready.If you’re planning to bring him breakfast in bed, you can still let him sleep in for a few hours longer than usual.

, This may seem obvious, but don’t forget to acknowledge that it is his day. When you see him in the morning give him yell, “Happy Father’s Day, Dad!” in a loud, happy voice. Don’t forget to give him a hug.


It’s good to do this first thing in the morning, that way your dad will know you haven’t forgotten and will see that you are excited to celebrate with him.

, You may have a lot of ideas about how to celebrate Father’s day, but it isn’t about you. On Father’s day ask him how he is feeling, and what he feels like doing for the day.Try to be respectful of your dad’s wishes. If you had a whole list of ideas for the day, but your dad says all he wants to do is relax on the couch, then let him do it.
Your dad may want to do something all on his own or with your mom on Father’s day. For example, he might want to work on his car alone in the garage, or he might want a weekend get-a-way. If so, don’t make him feel bad for wanting that.

, One of the most important aspect of Father’s Day is that you are present and attentive. Gifts are great, but showing your love, and reassuring your dad that you're proud of him and all he's done for you can be the most important factor in celebrating a fantastic Father’s Day.


For many dads, the most rewarding part of being a father feels that your children and partner love and appreciate you.
By simply having a good attitude, or giving dad a hug and telling him how much you love him, you can show him that he is appreciated.

, This is a straightforward one, but it should not be overlooked. In our daily lives, it can be effortless to miss out on spending quality time together. On Father’s day, make it a point to spend time just talking about things. Tell him about some things going on in school you haven’t told him, tell him about things that are going on in your life.Don’t make it all about you! Ask your dad about how he is doing, or ask him to tell you about his life growing up.
Try to avoid subjects that might cause an argument though. You don’t want Father’s day to end in a fight.

, Father's Day can be a great day for the whole family. Plan a family event, getting everyone in the family together for a fun day.


Keep in mind your dad’s personality, though. Is your dad the type that enjoys big family gatherings? For some people, large gatherings are very tiring, and anything but relaxing.
Think about including all the dads in your family, not just your own father or partner. Maybe you want to gather the uncles, brothers, grandpas, and even step-dads for part of the day, like a big dinner.

, Make a slideshow with lots of photos of your dad. It can be photos from when he was young; it can include photos of the whole family, photos of just you and him, and even funny photos. Looking at photos together with your dad can be a great way to talk about fun memories together.


If your photos are in photo albums; you can look at the albums together.
This could be particularly useful if you don’t have a close relationship with your dad. Looking at photos together can help spark conversations.

, A card goes a long way, and can sometimes mean more than a gift.


If you’re buying your dad a Father’s Day card, make sure that you don’t wait until the last minute to get one. If you wait too long, you won’t have as many options to choose from. Get him a card that fits his personality; a funny card if he likes jokes or a sentimental one to show your dad how much he means to you.
You can also make him a card. By making him a card, you can make it truly yours and tailor it completely to your dad. In the card, you could list the things that you really love about your dad, or you could draw him a picture of the two of you together.

, Father’s day doesn’t have to be about gifts, but if you are planning to make or buy him a gift, try to get creative. Don’t just pick out a tie or a pair of socks. If you are buying him a gift, try to think of something he keeps mentioning or something you know he wants, but won’t buy for himself.


Handmade gifts are also great. For example, you could think about and list many different things your dad has taught you to do (e.g. swing a baseball bat, ride a bike, how to treat other people, etc.). Turn these things into a book. You can have the book made online or you can simply make it yourself. You can glue photos of you and your dad together in the book too.

, Being a father is a tough job. If you’re having a party, you can give a toast in front of everyone that expresses your love and appreciation. If you’re not having a party, you can just tell him one-on-one.


Try to be thoughtful with your words. Though you could just say, “Thanks for being a good Dad,” you could also take the time to think of something thoughtful to say. For example, you could think of a few things your dad has done in the past year that really meant a lot to you, and say something like, “Over the last year you’ve done a lot of things to keep me healthy and happy. I know I don’t say it often enough, but I don’t take it for granted, and I love you very much. I especially appreciated it when you took me to the mall on your day off so I could get that new game I’d wanted so badly.”

, If your dad has a list of things that he does every day (e.g. taking out the trash, making the bed, doing the laundry, washing the dishes, etc.) then tell him that on Father’s day, you want to do all of those things so he can relax.If there is a chore that you know he particularly doesn’t like (e.g. mowing the lawn) you could tell him that you are going to take care of it for him on Father’s day.

, If you know his favorite meal, plan to cook it for him on father’s day. You could also make him his favorite dessert. For example, if he loves chocolate chip cookies, you could make some that are just for him.


If your dad really enjoys cooking, you could make this activity that you do together.
You could also surprise him with breakfast in bed, if you think he would enjoy it.

, On Father’s day, you might have a million things planned for your dad. If your dad knows this, he may go along with everything just to make you happy. However, remember that it is his day, so try to remain aware of your dad’s mood. If you notice that he seems tired or not really into what you’re doing, ask him what he feels like doing.


Don’t get mad or frustrated because things aren’t going the way you wanted. The last thing he wants is a fight, so remember to keep things light, happy, and pressure free.
Remember that you don’t have to celebrate every minute of the day with your dad. Remember to give him some time to do whatever he feels like doing without you chasing him around.

Assemble the items needed.,
Hand out a piece of paper and a pencil to each of the participants.

,
Ask them to write down their name and their guess as to how many chocolates the jar holds.

,
Declare the winner.",How to Plan Easter Games for a Children's Easter Party2," You will need a glass jar or basket, a handful of small or varied size chocolate eggs (dyed hard boiled eggs can work too), paper pieces, a pencil and an Easter Basket.;
,,, The one who comes closest or gives the exact count wins the jar!

"
"
Assemble the supplies needed.,
As the guests arrive at the door, pin a stuffed small animal on their back without the guest seeing the animal.,
Through the course of the party, guests have to ask each other questions about the identity of their animal.,
Nearing the end of the party, ask each child what they think they are.",How to Plan Easter Games for a Children's Easter Party3," All you need are some good, small stuffed toys. If possible, it would be good if you can get some related to the Easter tradition, such as rabbits and chicks, etc.

, Be sure to use safety pins and make sure it is on securely. Ask the child to stand very still while this is happening!

, They must be yes-or-no questions.


For example, they can ask ""Do I eat carrots?"" ""Do I say quack?"" etc.

, Those who guess it right get a prize, perhaps even the animal that is attached to them. Allow children to keep guessing until they get it right (you may need to end the game earlier for those who guess early and don't want the toy dangling off their back).

"
"
Arrange a few chairs in a circle.,
Start by saying something like ""I am grateful for those with brown eyes."",
Continue until everyone's had enough.",How to Plan Easter Games for a Children's Easter Party4," Have one less chair than you have guests. Have each guest sit in a chair except for one. Once everyone is settled you can begin the game!

, Everybody then stands up and runs for a different chair. It cannot be a chair directly beside theirs. Once everyone is settled, the person left standing continues with another comment such as ""I am grateful for those who have a dog."" If you want to relate it to Easter, tell the children to say what they are grateful for about Easter, such as ""I am grateful for Easter eggs"", or ""I am grateful that Jesus has risen"", etc.

, This goes on until everyone is tired of a game but be warned – it's addicting, so it may last for a while!


Note that this can be played competitively: while everyone is running for a chair, remove one chair. The one left without a seat is out, and the last one to remain wins a prize. This can be slightly injury-prone, since someone will no doubt be running for the chair you're removing!

Place candy, Easter eggs, or other treats inside plastic eggs.,
Hide the candy or Easter eggs around your yard, garden or house.,
Send your guests out to hunt for the eggs.",How to Plan Easter Games for a Children's Easter Party5,"


For garden or yard hunts, if your garden or yard is not wet, slushy, muddy, or snowy, then you can forgo the plastic cover and put the treats out as they are, in their own packaging.

, Make sure you know how many you hid, and ensure that you have enough for each guest.

, Set a limit for how many they can have each, so that nobody is left out. Once you're sure all of the eggs or other treats have been collected, allow the kids to play with or eat their prizes!

, It's best to have this race on grass or some other soft surface, to give dropped eggs a chance!

, It's no fun dropping your egg, thinking you've won, only to realize that the finish line is in fact several inches or centimeters away.

, Everyone then begins to race towards the finish line. The contestants have to keep their egg balanced in their spoon, without using their other hand for support. If the egg drops, but is not broken, the contestant can pick up the egg and resume the race.

, The first contestant to make it to the finish line wins. Have second and third prizes, too.

Draw an Easter bunny shape.,
Stretch the sheet of cloth or paper on the wall and tack it firmly in place.

,
Cut eggs out of different colored cloth to represent Easter eggs.,
Blindfold the players in turn and give each an egg.",How to Plan Easter Games for a Children's Easter Party7," On a cloth sheet or paper, draw a rough sketch of a good-sized rabbit, modeling it on the regular Easter bunny. Draw the rabbit standing on its hind legs, and holding its paws as if it were carrying an egg.

,, The eggs should be as large as the space between the rabbit's paws. In each egg stick a pin.

, Each egg is to be pinned on the sheet, and right in the Easter bunny's arms, if possible. As the players take their turns, no matter how straight on the way they were started, the Easter bunny will be surrounded with eggs, until a player pins the egg in the Easter bunny's arms. The player who is closest to the arms, or spot on, wins a prize.

"
Find an interesting glass container, such as a bowl or a candy container.",How to Make an Easter Centerpiece2," Insert a small nest into the center and place some cute eggs into the nest. Tie a ribbon in the same color as the eggs around the glass container. Place in the center of the table.


Dinner or side plates of dyed eggs also look lovely as a simple centerpiece.







"
"
Turn a carton or basket of eggs into a centerpiece.",How to Make an Easter Centerpiece3," This can be a cute and simple addition to the table if you have a nice egg carton or basket.


For the basket, simply arrange the eggs neatly. They can be plain or dyed, as preferred. Place in the center of the table.
Fill each hole of the egg carton with dyed Easter eggs. You can sit them on Easter grass in each hole if wished. Place the open egg carton onto a display plate or tray and add a few fluffy chicks around the tray. Place in the center of the table.







"
"
Pile items into a glass bowl.",How to Make an Easter Centerpiece4," This is a simple but very effective way to create a centerpiece. To ease the hard base of the glass bowl, it's a good idea to place Easter grass first, then add such items as dyed eggs, yarn balls dyed in Easter colors, candies, shells, cookies, chocolate eggs, etc.

"
"
Use Mason jars or other large, pretty jars.",How to Make an Easter Centerpiece5," As with glass bowls, clear glass jars can serve as a wonderful inspiration for centerpieces. Either fill with spring flowers and sprinkle eggs around of try one of the following suggestions:


Try adding a full chocolate bunny sitting on Easter grass in the middle of a large Mason jar. This can look stunning on its own.
Make alternating layers of Easter candies that fill to the top of the Mason jar.
Make a bed of candies, then some Easter grass, and then an Easter figurine or chocolate animal seated on top.

"
"
Place flowers as the centerpiece.",How to Make an Easter Centerpiece6," Flowers are always appreciated as a table decoration and spring is an ideal time to indulge in a few favorites, like tulips and daffodils. While you could simply stick them into a vase, arranging the flowers in an interesting way can improve their impact. Some ideas include:

Find a glass vase. Place glass pebbles in an Easter color (use clear if you don't like the colors) at the base. Then arrange a row of peeps facing outward around the jar. Insert a bunch of flowers at the top. Since adding water is not a great idea with the peeps in the jar, this arrangement should be made just before placing on the table and then the flowers can be returned to water after the meal. (Note: candies in Easter colors can be substituted for the glass pebbles.)
Arrange flowers around a cake stand (see above).
Find a nest basket and fill it with flowers. Use a low, round vase to place the flowers in, or simply cut the flowers down low and place in just prior to adding to the table.
Use artificial flowers in an arrangement if you can't get real flowers.

"
"
Find an heirloom Easter piece and put it in pride of place at the center of the table.",How to Make an Easter Centerpiece7," In some families, pieces associated with holidays are passed down, such as a ceramic animal figurine or a decorated ceramic egg. If it is a large enough piece, it might be enough on its own, or easily spruced up with ribbon or flowers. If it's small, work it into a display using other Easter items.

"
"
Use a cake stand.",How to Make an Easter Centerpiece8," A cake stand can be turned into various different centerpiece styles, depending on whether you use one or more cake stands.


For a simple cake stand display, use one cake stand. Place Easter grass on the base and a bunny or chick figurine in the center. Add a few dyed eggs here and there around the outer edge of the stand.
For a more elaborate cake stand display, do the previous suggestion but rest the cake stand inside an egg wreath, with the eggs coming up to the base of the cake stand.
Make a cascading cake stand display. Place another cake stand on top of the base cake stand. Insert blooms into egg cups and place these at even intervals around the lower cake stand. Either repeat this formation for the upper cake stand, or add one larger arrangement in a low vase or bowl.
Place eggs in a glass bowl or small glass pitcher on the cake stand.
Place as many tall glasses as will fit on the cake stand onto it. Fill with water, then add a single long-stemmed flower into each glass. Be sure to make this one right on the spot of where you intend it to be, as it will be heavy. A variation on this is to place a glass vase in the middle with a larger bunch of flowers, then surround this vase with a series of glasses with single flowers.

"
"
Use an Easter tree for the centerpiece.",How to Make an Easter Centerpiece9," Make an Easter tree. When making it, choose to either leave it natural (the original wood) or to paint it white or a pastel color that fits with the table setting theme. Attach Easter themed decorations to the tree and place in a sturdy container that will hold up the Easter tree easily. Place in the middle of the table.


Make a deluxe Easter tree centerpiece. Decorate this tree to the nth degree, with bunnies, chicks and eggs. Tie these decorations with ribbon so that they dangle down toward the table, as with a Christmas tree.
Make a minimalist Easter tree centerpiece. Use small branches and keep them natural. Add only a few key decorative objects to the tree.
Long strands of blossom can make a decorative Easter tree centerpiece. Snip long lengths from the tree, add Easter decorations and place in the container.

Decide whether a special prize egg is a good idea.,
Have the kids decorate the Easter eggs.,
Turn the Easter egg hunt into a treasure hunt.,
Roll the Easter eggs.,
Have the kids compete in an Easter egg spoon race.",How to Do an Easter Egg Hunt Indoors," You can use real, hard-boiled eggs dyed or decorated for the Easter holiday, or plastic, hollow Easter eggs you can fill with goodies. Chalk eggs are also available, but this may not be a good idea when hosting indoors, as the children may draw on your furniture.


Make sure an adult boils the egg. Keep in mind that real eggs may be smashed by young children, and will rot if they are not found. Consider plastic eggs if you would like to keep the indoor area clean.;
, Plastic Easter eggs can be filled with goodies such as chocolate, candy, jelly beans, fruit, money, toys, or other small prizes that children will enjoy. Some families and groups choose to hide empty eggs, then distribute treats equally among the children after the hunt is over.


Ask the parents of visiting children whether there are any treats you should avoid. Some children are allergic to nuts, and toddlers may not be able to eat chocolate or hard candies.

, Before you hide the eggs, you should determine which rooms or places children are safely allowed to search. For example, choose safe, open rooms such as the living room or den, instead of the utility closet where dangerous tools and chemicals are stored.


Lock off-limits rooms if possible, or hang signs that read ""Do not enter"" on cabinets and the doors of rooms you don't want searched. Hang the signs at the eye level of the children, and tell kids who cannot read where they are supposed to search.
Store important documents, fragile items, and private objects in an off-limits area where children will not be searching.

, While most parents will not expect you to fully child proof your house, there are some easy and temporary safety adjustments you could make. Think about taping cardboard or foam over sharp corners of coffee tables. Move medicines and cleaning chemicals to higher shelves or locked cupboards. These precautions are especially important for toddlers and young children.

, If children with a wide range of ages or abilities will be hunting for Easter eggs, it might be more fun for everyone if different children search for different eggs. For instance, you could tell the older children that they should only look for the hard-to-find red eggs, while the purple eggs are left in easier places for the younger kids to find.


If there are many children visiting, you could even write the name of each child on one or more eggs and instruct the children only to find eggs with their own name written on it. To avoid arguments, make sure each child has an equal amount of eggs, and that you know where every egg is hidden so you can help out.
If a relatively older child gets upset that they aren't allowed to pick up certain eggs, encourage him or her to help out a younger kid by pointing to the easy to find eggs.

, Write down each egg's location so you don't forget where it is. This list will help you give clues and hints to the children that are having trouble finding eggs. Additionally, a list of locations will let you check for leftover eggs after the party. If you forget where you hide an egg and no one finds it, the egg may rot, or if plastic, the treats inside may go stale or attract pests.

, To help ensure that the Easter egg hunt is fun for the children, you should hide the eggs when the children are asleep, or absent from the location. For example, hide the Easter eggs on the night before Easter.


If you would like help hiding the eggs or other adults and older children would like to join in, you may hide the eggs on Easter while the young children are being supervised in another room.
If you are hiding eggs while children are awake, distract them first with a big homemade breakfast, a board game, or coloring books.

, Toddlers and young children will probably have the most fun if you hide eggs in easy to see places low enough for them to reach. Place them in plain sight in the corner of the floor, in Easter baskets on top of short tables, or on top of flower pots low to the ground without much leaf cover.


You might want to wait until the egg hunt begins to place eggs directly on the floor, or someone might step on them. Children under three probably won't notice even if you ""hide"" the eggs while they are in the room.

, Many children six and older enjoy looking for eggs in harder to find places, such as underneath or inside objects. The enthusiasm, height, and egg-finding abilities of children this age can vary widely, so hide some of these eggs in easier places than others.


Place eggs on cupboard shelves or in drawers. You may hide them more behind a book or underneath a magazine for children on the older side of this range.
Hide eggs in piles of other objects. Children this age will probably be more enthusiastic about looking through a pile of stuffed animals or in a basket of mail.Hide the eggs inside other objects. Hide an egg in a kitchen pot, pillowcase, or an upside down bowl.

, Even if you don't have any older children joining in the egg hunt, some of the younger kids might get enthusiastic and want to search for some difficult treasure. Remember that many adults enjoy helping the children find eggs, and coming up with clever locations might entertain them as well.


Tape eggs to the underside of chairs and tables.This one goes from difficult to easy if the children are short enough to see them!
Unplug a lamp, then unscrew the light bulb and rest an egg on top of the socket, hidden by the lampshade.You can use a similar trick with wide candlesticks.
Use a toothbrush holder as an eggcup, hiding the egg behind brightly colored toothbrushes.

, To make eggs harder to find, use the following tricks to hide an egg in plain sight, or in a location almost no one thought to look. This can also make the hunt more entertaining for the adults watching the children search or trying to guess the location of the last remaining eggs.


Camouflage the eggs. A red egg might be harder to find in a flowerpot full of red flowers, while a blue egg could sit on top of a blue cushion while young children walk right past it.
Hide the egg in plain sight by putting it in with undecorated eggs in an egg carton in the fridge.
Keep an egg under your hat or in your pocket.

, Consider hiding a special prize egg with a unique color and awarding a special treat to the finder. This can make the Easter egg hunt more fun, but the competition may upset children who are younger or worse at finding eggs.


Choose a treat that the children will get excited about, such as an extra large candy or chocolate rabbit.

, There are plenty of safe, easy ways to decorate eggs. Hard boil the eggs in advance, then have the children use crayons, food coloring and sponges, or paint to decorate the eggs.


Children might want to keep their eggs once they've decorated them, so you might want to hide a separate group of decorated eggs for the egg hunt.

, Instead of letting the kids loose to find all the eggs at once, give them clues to each egg in turn. For a real ""treasure hunt"" feel, write the next clue inside each egg, and have the last egg hold gold chocolate coins as ""pirate treasure.""


The clue could be a riddle, a hidden reference to an object in another room, or a reference to something the kids did once. For instance, an egg hidden in ""the jungle"" could be in the center of some houseplants, while an egg hidden ""in the land of birthday cakes"" could be on a cake stand in the fridge.

, Make a ramp out of a wooden plank leaning on a stack of books. Cover the ramp and floor with a blanket in case of broken eggs, then have each person release their egg from the top of the ramp. The person whose egg makes it farthest wins a prize.

, Have the kids line up in two or more rows. Each of them holds a spoon. Place an egg in the spoon of each kid first in line. When you say ""Go!"" each line has to move its egg to the end of the line without the egg touching anything but the spoons.If an egg falls, you can either put it back on the first spoon or let the kids try to pick it up with only the spoons.
While the kids can literally race their Easter eggs by pushing them with their noses, hopping while holding them, or another method, this race is more suited to an indoor location.

Mark the vernal equinox.,
Find the date of the first full moon.,
Skip ahead to the following Sunday.,
Note whether or not the full moon falls on Sunday.,
Back up one week to find Palm Sunday.,
Pay special attention to the week in between Palm Sunday and Easter.,
Count back to the Wednesday six weeks before Easter.,
Count 40 days ahead.,
Understand the history.,
Note the difference between Gregorian and Julian calendars.,
Remember the time frame.,
Watch for possible reforms to the date.",How to Determine when Easter Is," The date Easter falls on is based on the ecclesiastical approximation of the vernal (spring) equinox. This approximation falls on the same date each year: March 21.Note that this calculation relies on the ecclesiastical estimation of the vernal equinox, not the actual vernal equinox identified by the astronomical system of measurement. The actual moment of equinox can shift within 24 hours and may arrive a day before March 21. This is not taken into consideration when the date of Easter is determined, however.
This is the vernal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere only. For those in the Southern Hemisphere, it is the autumnal equinox. The same date (March 21) is used in both hemispheres, though.;
, Identify the date of the first full moon that comes after the vernal equinox. This date will land no later than a month after the vernal equinox.


You can find out this information by checking a lunar calendar. These calendars track and illustrate the day-by-day phases of the moon. You can buy a lunar wall or desk calendar, or you can search for a free one online.

, The Sunday after the first moon following the vernal equinox is the date that Easter falls on.For example, the first full moon after the vernal equinox in 2014 came on Tuesday, April 15.This means that in 2014, Easter fell on the following Sunday, April 20.

, If the first full moon after the vernal equinox lands on a Sunday, the date of Easter is delayed by one week and lands on the following Sunday.


This delay is put into place to decrease the risk of Easter Sunday landing on the same day as the Jewish Passover.
For instance, the first full moon after the vernal equinox in 1994 fell on Sunday, March 27.Instead of Easter also falling on March 27, it fell a week later on Sunday, April 3.

, Palm Sunday is exactly one week before Easter.


Palm Sunday celebrates Christ's entry into Jerusalem. It also marks the beginning of Holy Week.

, The entire week is often referred to as “Holy Week,” but the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday immediately before Easter in particular are recognized as dates of significance in the Christian calendar.


Maundy Thursday celebrates the Last Supper of Christ. It also recognizes the ""washing of feet,"" a biblical event during which Jesus washed the feet of his Apostles. Many Christian denominations celebrate the maundy (washing of feet) as a church ordinance.
Good Friday recognizes the day that Christ was crucified.
Holy Saturday commemorates the time during which Christ's body lay in the tomb. It is typically viewed as a day of preparation for Easter Sunday.

, Trace back to the Sunday that came six calendar weeks earlier. The Wednesday immediately before that date is Ash Wednesday.


In other words, Ash Wednesday is 46 days before Easter each year.
Ash Wednesday is a formal day of repentance in many Christian churches.
It also marks the first day of Lent, a period of 40 days over which Christians are to spiritually prepare for Easter.

, Ascension Day is a Christian holiday that falls exactly 39 days after Easter Sunday.Ascension Day celebrates Christ's ascension into heaven. In some Christian denominations, it is also considered the “fortieth day of Easter,” meaning that all the days in between Easter Sunday and Ascension Day are part of the broader Easter season.

, Easter has always been celebrated near the date of the Jewish Passover, but the exact method of determining the date on which to celebrate Easter has changed slightly over the centuries.


Easter is a celebration of Christ's return from the dead after His crucifixion.
In the Bible, Jesus rose from the dead on the first Sunday following the Jewish Passover. Passover begins on the fifteenth day of the month of Nisan in the Hebrew calendar. This roughly corresponds to the first full moon after the March equinox, but the Hebrew calendar is not based on the cycles of the moon, so the timing is not exact.
Since the date of Passover needed to be announced each year by Jewish officials, early Christian leaders simplified the date of Easter by scheduling it consistently for the Sunday after the full moon. This happened in 325 CE and was an official declaration of the Council of Nicaea.The practice of using the moon and equinox as a dating system actually has ties to pagan practices, though. Religious dates were never previously established using astronomical events in the Jewish tradition from which most of Christian tradition arose. The practice of doing so was pagan in nature, but early Christians adopted it for the sake of simplifying their own dating system.

, Most Western churches (Roman Catholics and most Protestants) follow the standard calendar, also known as the Gregorian calendar. Some Orthodox Christian churches still use the Julian calendar to determine the date of Easter.


The Gregorian calendar was created when scientists discovered that the Julian calendar was too long. The dates of both calendars are similar, but slightly different.
The Gregorian calendar is more accurately aligned to the equinox.

, According to either calendar, Easter will always fall between March 22 and April 25.


This time frame does not occur over the same set of days for both calendars, though. If you are observing the Gregorian calendar like most do, the Easter time frame in the Julian calendar would actually run from April 3 to May 10.

, Several churches and nations have proposed various reforms to the manner in which the date of Easter is determined, but so far, none of these reforms have been put into practice.


In 1997, the World Council of Churches discussed the possibility of replacing the current system of calculation with an equation-based method of calculation that depended more directly on astronomical events. This reform was scheduled for 2001 but was never actually adopted.
In 1928, the United Kingdom actually fixed the date of Easter as the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April, but the act putting it into law was never actually implemented and the reform was never followed.

Be inspired.",How to Make an Easter Centerpiece10," The above ideas scratch the surface of what is possible by way of a centerpiece. The best things to keep in mind include:


Aim to keep it inexpensive. Reuse or upcycle whatever you already have around the home.
Try to use items from your own garden and cooking where possible, to give it an authentic feel.
Avoid overdoing the centerpiece. It's great to make it the talk of the table but not to have people banging their heads on it or knocking it over every time they go to eat or pass the salt!

Recognize the pagan background of Easter.",How to Celebrate a Traditional Easter Sunday1," Easter Sunday is the day when Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Easter marks the completion of Lent, which is a 40-day period of prayer, penance and fasting. The last week of Lent, which is the week before Easter, is often referred to as Holy Week. During this week, Christians observe Palm Sunday, which marks Jesus' return to Jerusalem; Holy Thursday, which is when Jesus held his last supper with his disciples; and Good Friday, which is when Jesus was crucified.

, The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the foundation of the Christian faith. Therefore, Easter Sunday is a holy day for Christians. Many Christians view Easter Sunday as a day of new birth.

, The word Easter has its roots in ""Eastre,"" which was the name of the Teutonic goddess of spring. Easter was originally a pagan festival that celebrated the beginning of Spring. The festival focused on fertility, and utilized the egg and the rabbit as symbols of the celebration. Early Christians adopted the pagan festival of Easter as a time to celebrate the risen Christ, rather than the goddess of Spring. Today, the vernal equinox still determines the date for Easter. In most Western countries, Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday following the vernal equinox, which is typically between March 22 and April 25.

Pay attention to the significance of different days of Easter weekend.,
Attend Easter services at your church.,
Read the Easter story in your bible.,
Discuss Jesus's sacrifice with your family.,
Focus on the personal meaning this holiday has for you.,
Practice some non-religious celebrations.",How to Celebrate Easter3," Easter is not one holiday. There is a Holy Week which leads up to the celebration of the resurrection of Christ. Starting the Sunday before Easter, known as Palm Sunday, pause to reflect on the Biblical significance of such events. If your church holds special services on these days, attend if possible.From Palm Sunday to Holy Tuesday, there are Biblical stories surrounding Christ entering Jerusalem and entering the temples there. On Holy Wednesday, Judas decided to betray Jesus and the story of his persecution begins.
Maundy Thursday commemorates the Last Supper, which took place between Jesus and his disciples. Good Friday is the day of Jesus's death on the cross.
Holy Saturday and Sunday, or Easter, are the last two days of the holy week. During these days, Christ's resurrection is remembered and celebrated.

, Almost every Christian church will offer an Easter service on Easter Sunday. Exactly what the service will consist of will vary depending on your church. However, attending any Easter church service can be a good way to focus on the Christian messages that accompany the holiday. Make sure to attend church on Easter morning.If you have young children, see if there are special Sunday School classes offered on Easter Sunday. It can sometimes be difficult for children to understand the story of Christ's death due to the scary subject material. A qualified Sunday School teacher can help your child understand the meaning of Easter.

, Take some time over Easter weekend to read over the Easter story. This can be a good way to focus on the meaning behind the holiday. Reminding yourself why the holiday is celebrated can help you to engage more fully with your faith and its traditions. Much of the Easter story is found in the New Testament, covered in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.If you have young children, see if you can find a children's Bible that details the story of Easter. This may explain Jesus's death and resurrection in terms they can easily understand.

, Easter is primarily a celebration of God sacrificing His only son for your sins. This is something to talk over with your family. On Easter morning, or Holy Saturday, have a talk about what God's sacrifice means to you. Why are you grateful for Jesus's sacrifices, death, and resurrection?One activity to help with this can be writing down times you've sinned on a piece of paper. Have everyone in the family do this on Holy Saturday and then gather the papers together.
On Easter Day, do something to destroy the papers. You can, for example, burn them in a fire place or feed them through a paper shredder. This represents Jesus saving you by erasing your sins. You can then express gratitude at Christ's sacrifice.

, Attending a church service or reading over the Easter story can both be great ways to focus on the meaning of the holiday. However, taking some time on your Easter Sunday to reflect on the personal meaning of the holiday can help you discover what it means to you.Think about your religion. How has it benefited your life? What have you learned from Christianity? How have Jesus's lessons affected your actions?
You may want to have your family answer these types of questions. For example, you could have everyone go around the table and share a time they acted in a certain way because of Christ's teachings.

, If you are religious, not everything you do on Easter has to be specifically related to your religion. Try doing things like having an Easter brunch or doing something fun with your family, like going on a hike. This can be particularly helpful if you have non-religious relatives who want to celebrate with you.

Decorate trees with eggs.,
Place durable baskets around your yard.,
Set up Easter lawn ornaments.,
Add carrot cutouts to your walls.",How to Decorate Outdoors for Easter1," Use a tool, like a knife or awl, to poke a small hole in the ends of plastic eggs. Feed fishing line through the holes in these eggs to string the eggs up and create hanging tree ornaments. Tie the end of the fishing line to a branch to hang the ornament.Tie a simple knot at the bottom end of your hanging tree ornaments to prevent the eggs from falling off the line. Be sure the knot is thick enough to prevent eggs from falling.
Hang several of these ornaments from trees throughout your yard. Avoid areas thick with branches; when the wind blows, your ornaments might get tangled.
If you live in a windy area, you might want to keep your hanging tree ornaments roughly the length of your forearm. Otherwise, the wind might whip the ornaments around dangerously.;

The reasons behind celebrating Diwali differ and are outlined under ""Tips"". Diwali consists of three to five days of celebrations (the duration depends on where you come from or derive the celebratory traditions from):


The thirteenth day from Poornima (Full Moon) (Dhantrayodashi or Dhanteras). This is the first day of Diwali. ""Dhan"" means ""wealth"" and teras means thirteenth day. This is the day for celebrating the goddess Lakshmi, the Goddess of Wealth. For some places in India, the lamps are kept burning for Lord Yamaraj, the God of Death.
The fourteenth day (Chhoti Diwali or Narak chaturdashi). Hindus believe that this is the day that Lord Krishna destroyed the demon Narakasur, freeing the world from fear. Firecrackers are often let off from this day.
The new moon day (Diwali / Lakshmi puja / Lakshmipujan) of the dark fortnight of Ashwin. This is the actual day of Diwali, and the most significant day. If the house has not already been cleaned, it must be done early this day to welcome the Goddess Lakshmi. Gifts and sweets are exchanged on this day to strengthen bonds of love between family and friends. Firecrackers are let off after dinner.
The first day of the bright fortnight of Kartik (Balipratipada / Padiwa / Govardhan puja / Varshapratipada). This is the day that Lord Krishna lifted the Govardhan Parvat to protect the Gokul people from Indra's wrath and King Vikramaditya was crowned.
The fifth and final day of the Diwali Festival (Bhai Dooj / Bhaiya Dooj). On the final day of Diwali, brothers and sisters renew sibling love, with sisters applying the sacred red tilak on the forehead of their brothers and praying for their long life, while brothers bless their sisters and provide gifts of love.
Not everyone includes the thirteenth day, and the separate holy festivals of Vasubaras and Bhaubij precede Diwali, and follow the Diwali Festival respectively.;
, It is customary to buy utensils and ornaments on the first day of Diwali.

, It's like a spring cleaning of sorts, a ""cleansing"" ritual to rid yourself of any unnecessary elements in your environment.

, There are also ready-made wooden Rangolis available. These are beautifully hand crafted and painted on light pieces of wood. There are innumerable ways to arrange them. So, just go wild with your creativity and create your own design (or you can be inspired by the one provided here).

, In the evening, light small oil lamps (called ""diyas"") and place them around the home. Turn all the lights on and light some candles. The lamps symbolize knowledge or one's inner light, which brings about inner peace and fights off any traces of darkness and ignorance.

, These are a common part of Diwali, used to symbolize warding off evil from your surroundings. They are usually set off in greatest numbers on the actual day of Diwali (the third day).


If you're setting off your own firecrackers, be careful and follow all safety precautions associated with using firecrackers.
Be careful of noisy crackers.
Take care to keep pets and small children indoors and away from the excitement and frightening noises. See this article for more information.

, This is a ritual performed on Diwali day (the third day) in order to seek divine blessings from the Goddess of Wealth, Lakshmi, who helps those who strive to achieve wealth. It consists of an elaborate ritual using grains, leaves, coins, and idols to prepare a ceremony. During this ritual, you can invoke the Goddess by reciting the Vedic mantras or by thinking of her being showered with gold coins with two elephants standing one each side of her as you chant her name. Offerings are made and at the end, the aarti is performed quietly and a peaceful atmosphere should accompany the entire ritual., Games are a part of the Diwali Festival, including card games, Rummy, charades, pass the parcel, musical chairs, scavenger hunt, hide and seek, etc. It's not just for kids but for everyone!It's okay to play for money in card games but don't wager too much.

, Brothers and sisters affirm sibling love and look after one another on the final day of Diwali.Cook for your sibling, give your sister presents, and tell your brother you love him and wish him a long life.

Mark each of the full-length bamboo sticks with pencil, one to two inches from each end.,
Glue one full-length bamboo stick, positioned perpendicular to and touching the interior of one corner in one square at the mark.,
Glue each of the three remaining full-length bamboo sticks to one inner corners of the original square.,
Glue each of the four table ""legs"" to inner corners of second square.,

Light it up!",How to Make a Diwali Paper Lantern," You will need a total of sixteen bamboo sticks: four full-length bamboo sticks and twelve full-length bamboo sticks cut in half at the middle.









You can make this with any length bamboo sticks, as long as the electric bulb and socket you plan to use will fit comfortably inside without touching the sides of the lantern.
Trim off any jagged or pointy edges at the break.;
, Decorating your tissue paper is a great way to make your Diwali lantern unique and reflective of your taste and interests.









For more manageable sizes, cut tissue paper into 5 inch, 7 inch and 9 inch squares and rectangles.
For stronger tissue paper, layer two sheets of the same color and glue their edges together.
Color blocking, stripes, or diamond shapes will bring out the natural design of the lantern. Use a very thin layer of glue to glue edges together.
Kids might enjoy drawing stories or scenes of their home and family on their tissue paper.
Crafty types might be interested in developing their designs even more, by using a penknife to cut out designs and layering two or more colors together.

, You'll be using ribbon to decorate the top and bottom of your Diwali lantern, and there will also be a long ribbon fringe at the bottom.








, Affix a nail or hook and feed electric cord with bulb through it, and note the distance between the bulb and nail/hook.

, Gather full- and half-length bamboo sticks, tape measure/ruler, heavy duty thread, exacto-knife or sharp blade, and glue.


Lay everything out on old newspapers so you don't damage the table you are working on.

, To do this, place two half-length bamboo sticks at 90 degree angle (a right angle) to one another, so that their ends overlap by ¼ of an inch.


Repeat twelve times.

, This little dot of glue will keep the bamboo sticks positioned correctly in a 90 degree angle for assembly.









Repeat twelve times.
Be patient and let the glue dry completely before beginning the next step.

, Cut about twelve inches of thread, and with thread taut, secure each corner by wrapping thread around the arms of the angle close to the join in a figure eight motion.









Tie off in a couple of slip knots.
Dot thread with glue.
Let glue dry completely.

, By the end of this step you should have two squares of equal size.


Let glue dry completely.

, To do this, repeat ONLY step 4 (omit the gluing step) to secure joins. By the end of this step, you have four squares of equal size with one pair of threaded, glued corners diagonal from each other, and one pair of thread-only corners with no glue.









The flexible, thread-only corners allow the square to bend, slightly, along this axis, which is an important feature for the final Diwali lantern design.

, These sticks will form the central frame for the Diwali lantern.









Marking ensures consistency, and will help you line up the corners of the squares and angles that you have already made.
If you line up all four sticks together, you can mark them at one time.

,









Support the new angle you have made while it's drying, using a drinking glass or two, or other handy support.

,


Be sure to line them up at the marks, and support them in perpendicular shape while they are drying.
Let glue dry completely.
By the end of this step it should look like you have an upside down bamboo stick table with bamboo stick ""legs.""

, By the end of this step, you should have a rectangular box frame with four, one to two inch legs sticking out at each end.









Let glue dry completely.

, This creates a series of flexible diamonds that add dimension and prismatic depth to your Diwali lantern.









Positioning the thread-only corners against the full-length bamboo sticks at the mark and upper bamboo edge already in place, use a length of heavy duty thread to attach the thread-only corner to the frame.
It's perfectly fine for this to require a little squeezing and stretching of the angles.
You actually do not want them to lay completely flat, or to stick out straight.
Tie off thread and dot with glue.
Let glue dry completely.
Affix one flexible square at a time. Repeat with three remaining flexible squares.

, By the end of this step, your frame will be complete.


Let glue dry completely.

, Starting with the central areas is easiest, and you can use your larger sheets of decorated paper here.









Beginning with frames of the central squares (the ones made by the flexible squares) apply a very thin layer of glue to bamboo sticks.
Lay decorated paper over it. Gently tap down.
Repeat for remaining central squares.
Let glue dry completely.
Trim edges of paper with sharp scissors or sharp blade.

, Tap down.









Let glue dry completely.
Trim edges of paper with sharp blade.

, Tap down.


Let glue dry completely.
Trim edges of paper with sharp blade.

, Wrapping the ribbon will give the lantern a finished look.









Secure with a knot and trim ends.

, Wrapping the ribbon here also finishes the look and provides a horizontal support to attach a fringe of ribbons.








, Using a cow-hitch knot,attach ribbons to lower strands of ribbon wrap.

, This is the same nail or hook you are using to hang the electric cord and light socket.


Adjust length so that the light hangs in the center of the lantern.

, Now you can enjoy the fruits of your labor, and think about the triumph of light over darkness symbolized by your lantern!

Decorate the cutout. Cover it in bright Easter colors with markers or paint. Add glitter, sequins, and faux gems. These accents look especially nice on egg cutouts.
Use a hole punch or a pair of scissors to create a hole in the top of the cutout. Tie a loop onto this hole with ribbon. The loop should be large enough for a doorknob.
Hang your Easter door hangers on the handles of doors into your home. To protect them from the being ruined by weather, you may want to laminate them.

The shredded paper will break down when exposed to moisture., Gather a 12 x 36 in (30 x 91 cm) piece of Styrofoam, a wooden dowel, Peep colored spray paint (like bright yellow or pink), spray glitter, brown paint, a paint brush, a utility knife, a drop cloth, and a pencil. Draw the outline of a Peep on the Styrofoam, then:


Use your utility knife to cut away the pieces of Styrofoam that aren’t part of the design. When you finish cutting, soften the outer edges of the Peep by rubbing a piece of excess foam against the Peep’s edges, wearing away the foam until it’s more Peep shaped.
Lay down a drop cloth in a well ventilated area and set the Peep cutout on the cloth. Spray paint the Peep entirely. Allow this to dry according to the label instructions.
Use a paintbrush to apply two dots of brown paint for the eyes of the Peep and a dot of brown paint for the nose as well. Spray on glitter afterwards.
Stick a dowel into the bottom of the Peep. You can insert the dowel in the ground for a lawn ornament, add the Peep to a vase, basket, or pot, and so on."

Feed a small length of fishing line through the hole. Tie off the end of the line on the inside of the egg so it doesn’t pull through.
Tie the other end of the line to your wreath. Add as many eggs as you please in this fashion. Include other Easter accents, like pastel colored ribbons tied in bows.
Hang your new Easter wreath outside your house and enjoy., Decorative baskets often come with gift items and certain products. You may have some in storage, but if you don’t, you can buy baskets from a thrift store or a craft store. To transform these into festive Easter baskets:

Moreover, these negative emotions are not ideal ones to bring to a veneration.;
, Try dairy cream, buttercream or cream of tartar. To look and feel fresh and bright, use any natural remedies. Here are some suggestions:


Using lemon juice on your face as a face pack for five minutes helps. However, for the best results, you must be patient, which means that you'll need to use lemon juice as a face pack for at least a week or so before the veneration.
Use besan powder mixed with yoghurt and turmeric powder. Apply this facial pack on your face. Leave to harden, then wash it off after. You might feel cool and fresh without even having to take a shower using this method.

, As an Indian, or if you are of another nationality, you have different choices or options to choose on what you are going to wear, since you are attending a Diwali veneration. The following dresses are mostly preferred for wearing during any Indian veneration:


Salwar kameez
Saree
Ghagra.

, Your choice on what you are going to wear must follow some rules:


The dress must suit your skin color. If you are light in complexion, then try using light colors such as a pink, sky blue, light green, yellow, thistle, turquoise, tomato, salmon, saffron, etc. If you are a bit dark, then you can use any color. If you are dark, then some people believe only dark colors will suit you, such as red, brown, olive green, deep red, firebrick, pine green, Prussian, and so forth.
The outfit shouldn't cause you to feel outside of your comfort zone. Wear clothes that you feel comfortable in. Some people prefer cotton to silk, while others prefer silk to cotton. Wear what you feel that you look good and comfortable in; even if you are attending a luxurious veneration, you do not want to feel uncomfortable wearing designer clothes made up of net or silk.

, This goes the same way as with the clothes. If you are wearing designer clothes made of silk, or any modern material, diamonds are mostly used. If not, gold also goes well with designer outfits but they must look fashionable and expensive.


If you are wearing a cotton or a 'not very fashionable' material, gold is the best accessory that goes well with it. The jewellery shouldn't look too expensive or too cheap, just matching the way that the clothes are.

, Usually, Indians don't use too much make-up. Since you are attending to an Indian veneration, wear just a little make up.

,, Widely looking eyes is crucial in the opinion of some for an appropriate appearance at a Diwali Veneration.


Black for the mascara, kajal or eyeliner suits any complexion.

, Use a little lightly colored lipstick if you are fair and a little darkly colored lipstick if you are dark in complexion. Apply a little lip gloss to make your lips look more fresh and not dry.

, Don't overdo it or else it won't look too good.

, Use an Indian style, such as a braid or plait (single), french braid, or bun. Or, you can use a clutch to clip your hair together up high. You can also leave it open if you like. Open hair can look very lovely.

, A typical Indian always use a bindi to adorn their forehead and flowers to adorn their hair. Since you are attending an Indian ceremony, try adding the bindi and flowers. The flowers should look fresh and be pleasant smelling.

It shouldn't have any lumps, so stir and press until it forms a powder. A mortar and pestle can be helpful for this but don't use a porous one as it'll stain.

, Mix it in the same bowl as the eyeshadow or chalk powder.

, This will give the lipstick a nice flavor.

, Use a cotton bud or similar to apply the homemade lip color to your lips. After wearing, wash it off and/or use makeup remover if it stains your lips and won't come off.

Obtain cardboard.,
Cut out the wings.,
Measure shoulder width.,
Punch holes in the wings.,
Run ribbon through the holes.,
Decorate the wings.",How to Make Costume Wings1," Wings can be made from simple cardboard you have around the house or from the container of something you ordered from a store. The cardboard can be decorated later, so it doesn’t matter what color it is, but white foam board or poster board are also good choices., Feel free to trace the shape of the wings before you begin cutting. The shape of the wings is up to you, but one way to do it is to make them almost comma-shaped. Start at one end and begin cutting a rounded shape. Cut further into the cardboard, making the top ridge of the wing curve downwards to where it meets the bottom cut. Use scissors or an exacto knife.

The length of the wings depends on who will wear them. Make them long enough to stick out a few inches beyond the shoulders or make them longer and set them against the wearer’s back so they point downwards instead of out.
You can fold the cardboard in half in order to cut both wings out at the same time, but if you do them one at a time, don’t worry if they’re not identical.
You can trace the shapes of wings using a writing utensil before you cut, but the wings don’t have to be perfectly symmetrical. Your decorations later will cover the imperfections.

, If you’re designing the wings for someone else, hold them up against the person’s shoulders or else try to judge your own shoulder width. You’ll need to make a couple of holes where the wings will stay secure against the shoulders without feeling tight., You can use scissors, a screwdriver, a pen, or another household implement to make the holes. Put one hole on the top portion of the shoulder part of the wing. Place a second hole farther down. Do the same with the other wing., The string will form loops for your arms. White ribbon is a choice that matches the color of the wings. The amount of ribbon you need is determined by how much shoulder space the wearer will need. Wrap the ribbon around that person’s shoulder before you cut, providing some extra ribbon to be knotted. Place each end of the ribbon through the holes from the back side of the wings. On the front side of the wings, tie the ribbon together.

Less fragile string can be used and is especially good for children who will move a lot while wearing the wings. Use shoe laces or elastic cords.

, The way you make the wings look more angelic is up to you. Feathers are an obvious choice for angel wings, but coffee filters and toilet paper also work. Use tape or glue to stick the material to the backs of the wings.You can paint the cardboard white before you add the fluff. This may help prevent brown spots from showing through, but often you can cover the entire back side of the wings with enough white decorations.
Glue or tape the feathers at their bases as they point downwards to create an even, orderly appearance.
Squeeze squares of toilet paper from their center so that they form a points, then glue them onto the cardboard.
Try folding coffee filters in half and filling in the wings from the outside-in, keeping the folds of the first filters on the edges of the wings.

Shape hangers.,
Cover the hangers with felt.,
Cover the wings with trash bags.,
Cut patterns out of orange felt.,
Decorate the wings.,
Attach with Velcro.",How to Make Costume Wings2," Take four metal clothes hangers and stretch and bend them to make the outlines of wings. The top two wing sections will be thinner and bigger on top while the bottom two will be shorter but wider.Posterboard is a good substitute material and can be cut into wing shapes, covered with felt, and decorated later.

, Black adhesive felt or tape sticks to the metal. Take pieces one at a time and wrap them closely around the exposed parts of the hangers. This also softens any metal edges sticking out so they don’t puncture decoration material later., Take one or two trash bags per wing. Pull them as tight as you can over the wings. If the material bunches up at the end or hangs loosely, you can trim the open end until they cover more securely. Tape the bags together around the front side of the hangers., If the wings are for a child, they can enjoy decorating too. Using scissors, cut shapes out of colored felt and then glue them onto the backs of the wings. Vary your shapes and lay them next to each other to create patterns like those on a monarch butterfly., Finish decorating by adding spots to the black edges of the wings. This hides the trash bags and adds variety. One way to do this is to add gold and white office stickers of varying sizes, but you can also use an alternative such as paint., Two strips of Velcro are enough to secure the wings. The sticky sides of the Velcro attach to the inner side of the wings and to the back of your clothes. To put the wings on, push the Velcro sides together and you’re done.Arm or thumb loops can be sewn onto felt-covered cardboard. Wrap the material around the wearer’s shoulder or thumb to measure the material needed. Hold the material in loops on the wings, then use pins or a sewing needle to bind them together and to the wings."
"
Bend wire hangers.,
Join the hanger hooks.,
Cover the metal twist.,
Cover with tights.,
Cut a pair of tights for arm holders.,
Decorate.",How to Make Costume Wings3," Two to four hangers are enough to make wings, depending on how many you want. Bend two hangers in the shapes of wings, then lay them on top of each other to see if they are even. Adjust as necessary. These wings should appear rounded, but you can create two additional square wings to attach to the bottom like Tinkerbell from the Disney movie Peter Pan., Place the wings on a table, facing the hooks towards one another. These ends can be cut off so you can twist the resulting four ends together, but you can combine the hooks together by using a little strength to twist them around each other.

Make sure the twists are secure with no sharp ends sticking out.

, To avoid the twisted part of the hangers from jabbing into the wearer, pad the center of the wings. To do this, you can apply any sort of felt or fabric you have laying around the house. Wrap the fabric around the metal and then tape it secure., Cut the legs off a pair of tights. Take one of the legs and put a wing inside of it. Do the same with the other leg of the tights and repeat the process if you have additional wings. The loose fabric should be in the center of the wings. Wrap the excess fabric around the center of the wings. Tie it into a knot, then trim it so it looks neat.

If you can, match the tights to the base color you want the wings to be. You can also spray paint the tights when the wings are finished to achieve flashier colors.

, Cut the legs off a second pair of tights. Take one of the legs and wrap it around one end of the center part where the wings meet. Tie the ends of the fabric into a loop for your arms. Repeat this process with the other leg on the other side., The wings can be customized as you please. One way to do this is to add a flower or puff from a craft store by sewing it or attaching it with a hot glue gun onto the knot where the wings meet. The knot may also look good in spray painted duct tape. Children can help with decorating by adding material such as plastic jewels or glitter."

Measure fabric length.,
Buy fabric.,
Fold the fabric.,
Cut out the edge.,
Fold over the sleeve.,
Cut half-circles on the bottom of the fabric.,
Sew the sleeves.",How to Make Costume Wings4," The amount of fabric you need depends on the length and width of the person’s back. Measure the width wrist to wrist of the person who will wear the wings. Measure their length from their neck to their waist. Also measure their arm circumference and add this measurement to the length of fabric you need., Using your measurements, get enough fabric that you’ll be able to cover the back and arms of the person who will wear the wings. A good fabric is black and stretchy, such as spandex. You can cut this material without leaving frayed ends.

For non-sewn bat wings, cut out the upper and lower sections of an umbrella, then clip off the metal pieces using wire cutters., From the right or left end, fold the fabric in half. Your fabric should be half the width of your original measurement. Now take the top end of the fabric and fold it downwards enough so that you can see the appropriate amount of fabric you need to create arm holes. Don’t cut this folded fabric, but mark the lower end of the arm holder before you unfold it., Where you marked the fabric, take scissors and trim the corner in a semicircle. The bottom of the circle will be towards the middle of your remaining fabric while the ends of the cut should be an even distance along the edges of the fabric., Fold the remaining top part of the fabric next to the cut you made. Bring it down enough so that it once again creates the arm sleeve., Opposite from where you cut the first semicircle, begin cutting. Start at the corner below where you cut the first semicircle. Leave this corner intact but cut up and down next to it to create another semicircle. Keep going along the bottom side of the fabric, cutting further in to give the wings a slope., Unfold the fabric. Take the top, uncut fabric and fold it over to create the sleeves. Sew the bottom parts of the sleeves onto the cape. Now the bat wings are ready to wear."

You should be able to find everything you need for a pretty good price. To make your Wolverine costume, you'll need the following supplies:A white tank-top
An old pair of jeans
A sturdy pair of work boots;
, If you end up buying everything new, try to find ways to break in the clothes. Wolverine is a tough-guy character. Do some yard work in the boots to break them in. Add a few tears to the tank-top to give the impression that you just got out of a fight.

, Accessories can make or break your Wolverine costume. Small details like dog-tags or an Indian head belt buckle, can do a lot to tie your costume together.You can purchase custom dog-tags online or at army surplus stores. Some pet stores and hardware stores may also have a way to make dog-tags.
Wolverine's dog-tags read: ""WOLVERINE 45825243-T78-A.""You can get dog-tags made at many pet shops as well.
You can buy a replica of the Indian head belt buckle worn by Hugh Jackman in the X-Men films if you want, but it isn't a requirement. Any large belt buckle should be just fine.Wolverine is sometimes depicted in a flannel shirt or a brown jacket. If you don't want to walk around in a tank-top, cover up with one of these two options.

, All you need to make some claws is a large piece of cardboard, some paint, and a hot glue gun. While cardboard claws aren't the most realistic looking claws, they are the most affordable.


Use a thick cardboard to make the claws. You want your claws to be stable, so avoid using anything thin, such as cereal boxes.

, Make sure the claw is about 30 centimetres (11.8 in) long. You can also find claw templates online if you have trouble drawing one yourself.


Cut a notch at the back end of the claw to give the impression that the claws are coming out of your knuckles.

, Leave enough space between each claw to make cutting them out easier. Cut the claws out using a box cutter or sharp knife.


It may help to cut the claws out in sections and then go back and cut the outline.

, Paint the claws a light gray color before painting them silver. Be sure to get all the edges when spraying. It's best to use several thin coats rather than one heavy coat. Let the paint dry overnight before handling them.

, Cut out two rectangles of cardboard about 6 centimetres (2.4 in) long. Then cut out two rectangles of cardboard about 3.5 centimetres (1.4 in) long. Make sure you can comfortably hold the pieces in your hand. You will need one piece of each size per hand to make a base for the claws.


Hold three claws in your hands witch each claw running between your fingers. Place the larger piece of cardboard in your palm and mark where the base of the claw falls. Using a hot glue gun, glue the claws in place.
Take the smaller piece of cardboard and glue it on top of the claws to stabilize them.

, A big part of Wolverine's look is his hairstyle. If you have medium length hair, it shouldn't be too difficult to style your hair like Wolverine. You could also find a Wolverine wig online.


Use a blow dryer and a brush to blow the hair upwards on each side of your head. Curl the tips of the hair over, following the shape of your head.Hold the hair in place using hairspray or styling gel.Grow out your sideburns if you can. You could also look online for costume facial hair.

, Wolverine is a muscular character. You don't need the body of a superhero to dress as one, but muscles are a defining element of the character. If you have a few months to plan your costume, try lifting some weights and bulking up for your event.

, When you go out in your Wolverine costume, adopt a surly attitude. Read some of the comics to get a feel for how Wolverine speaks. Remember some phrases he uses often, and refer to people as ""Bub.""

Create a mask using tin foil and tape.,
Make a papier mâché mask.",How to Make a Superhero Costume3," As a superhero, it is extremely important that you hide your identity from potential enemies. Make a mask of some sort to disguise your face and prevent being discovered. There are several methods for making a mask at home.

, Hold up a piece of sturdy cardstock to your face and have a friend mark two dots where the outside edges of your eyes are, and one dot where the tip of your nose is (you can also use a paper plate).


Draw the mask out on the piece of paper, using the dots as reference points for how big your mask needs to be.
Cut out the shape of your mask and poke two holes in each side near where your ears will be.
Attach a ribbon or string to each hole so that you can tie the mask behind your head.
Decorate the outline with colored markers, paint, sequins, feathers, glitter, or any other embellishments that suit your superpower.

, Stack three sheets of aluminum foil together and press the stack on your face to create an impression in the tin foil.


Outline where your eyes and any other openings will be with a marker. Use scissors to cut around the edges of the mask, the eyes, the mouth, and any other openings you outlined.
Poke a hole in each side of the mask near where your ears will be and attach a string or ribbon to hold the mask on your face.
Making sure to keep the mold firm, cover the mask in strong clear tape such as packing tape.
Decorate with acrylic paint and any other embellishments such as feathers or sequins.

, Blow up a balloon to about the size of your head. Lay newspaper flat on a table or the floor to use as a working surface.


Tear strips of newspaper or cut strips of thin cloth into long strips.
Combine 2 cups flour and 1 cup water in a mixing bowl. You can use 2 cups of white glue in place of flour if you don't have any flour handy.
Dip the strips of paper or cloth into the mixture completely and begin to lay them on the balloon until the entire balloon is covered. Be sure to place the strips at random, intersecting angles.
Allow it to dry completely and then take a needle and pop the balloon. Cut the globe in half using strong scissors starting at the base of the balloon where it was tied and cutting up over the peak of the globe.
Shape the mask to fit your face, cut out any openings for your eyes or mouth, and finally, decorate it with paint and any other decorations you choose!

Attach the cape to yourself.",How to Make a Superhero Costume4," Most superheroes wouldn't be caught without this most dashing of accessories. Make a cape from any rectangular piece of old fabric you have lying around, such as an old sheet, that you can cut up. Felt also works well as cape material and is inexpensive at most arts and crafts stores.

, Make sure that the cape is not so long that you will trip on it when you walk.

, Use a ruler to connect the four corners of the dots and carefully cut out the rectangle shape.

, Attach a symbol or letter that represents your superpower in the center of the cape.


Felt works well for a cape embellishment because it is easily manipulable and won't fold as you fly around.
You can either glue this embellishment on using a hot glue gun or use leftover velcro strips to attach your symbol.

, You can either tie the fabric in a knot where it hits your sternum, use a safety pin to hold it in place, or attach velcro strips to your base outfit and the cape so that the two meet around the top of your shoulders.

, If you aren't going to be walking around outside, you can simply wear a pair of high-topped soccer socks in the color of your choice.

, If you'll be roaming the neighborhood or dancing it up until dawn, duct tape boots are a fast and inexpensive alternative to buying colored boots.


Put on a pair of old sneakers and wrap a few layers of plastic wrap around the shoe and up around your calf as high as you want your boots to be.
Purchase duct tape in the color that you want your boots to be. Begin to tape on top of the plastic in small pieces, trying to keep the tape as flat as possible. Be careful not to tape too tightly around your leg.
Once you've covered the entire surface of your boot, you are ready to start trick-or-treating!
If you are making the boots in advance, however, you can use scissors to carefully cut a line down the back of the boot so that you can slip your foot out. When you want to wear the boots, slip them on over your sneakers and re-tape the back slit with duct tape.
For a more polished look, add a few inches of duct tape to the top of the boot to make them flare out slightly., Step on a piece of paper and trace your left and right feet with a marker, allowing about 1/4-inch of extra space between the outline and your foot.


Use a tape measure to measure from the tip of the toes to the tip of the boot on your calf and the circumference of your calf at the highest point on the boot. Add about 2 inches (5.1 cm) to the circumference measurement to allow the boot to flare out.
Transfer an outline of these two measurements to a separate piece of paper and connect them to make a rough upside-down T shape. Repeat for your other foot.
Cut out the two sole pieces and the four body pieces and lay them on your felt. Lightly trace the shape of each paper template onto the felt with a pen or pencil and cut out the four felt pieces.
Pin two of the body pieces in an L-shape on top of your foot and sew the pieces together along the top seam that runs across the top of your foot, and the back seam that runs up the back of your leg. Turn the boot inside-out to hide the seam.
Pin the sole piece to the L-shaped tube and sew around the edges at least twice for a strong seam. Repeat this process for the second boot, and you're finished!

Roam the streets as Wolverine.",How to Make a Superhero Costume6," Carry a fake weapon or decorate your outfit in a way that shows the neighborhood kids just what you're capable of in superhero mode.


For example, if you have the ability to transform into an animal of some sort, cut out a design using paper or felt and attach it to the front of your shirt or the back of your cape.
If you are planning to be an existing superhero character, make sure your accessory matches theirs.

, Superman's superpowers are a part of his being. Re-create this superhero's look by simply embellishing the front of your shirt with an epic superman ""S."" You can make it out of felt glued together using a hot glue gun, or even out of stiff paper. Attach it to your shirt with hot glue or velcro.

, Like Superman, Spidey doesn't need any fancy tools to fight crime. To create a Spiderman outfit, draw spider webs all over your outfit, making the front center of your shirt the center of the web.


You can accomplish a web-like look by drawing with silver glitter glue or by drawing the web with white glue and covering it in silver glitter while it is still wet. Allow the glue to dry and then shake off any excess glitter.
You may also want to make a spider out of paper or felt and attach it to the center of your web.

, Batman sports a black belt with square pockets on the sides that hold all of his nifty gadgets. You can make a belt out of felt and sew on pockets if you like, or repurpose an old belt and attach eyeglass cases to the sides to hold your gadgets.


Don't forget to fill your belt pockets with super accessories such as Batman's Bat-monitor (use a black walkie talkie), Bat-cuffs (paint plastic handcuffs black), and Bat-lasso (use a black rope).
If you don't have a walkie talkie or play handcuffs lying around, you can always make these gadgets out of cardboard and draw on the details.

, A gold lasso, a gold belt, gold arm bands, and a shining tiara are this Superhero's most recognizable assets.


Spray paint any rope you have gold for the lasso and tie it to your belt. You can make Wonder Woman's signature gold belt out of thick paper or felt, or spray paint an existing belt gold.
Wear thick, gold bangle bracelets to represent arm bands, or cut out strips of shiny fabric, gold paper, or tin foil painted gold. Place your arm bands around your wrists.
Lastly, create the crowning tiara by covering a headband with a gold material or simply cut a tiara shape out of paper and staple it together behind your head. Attach a red star to the front of the tiara.

, In addition to his impressive mask, Captain America sports a super shield. Make a shield out of cardboard by cutting a large circular shape and painting on the appropriate colors. You can also use a round plastic sled, a large stockpot lid, or round garbage can lid.Attach a piece of felt or ribbon to the back of the shield with hot glue or a stapler to create a handle for the shield.
Cut out a white star from paper or felt and attach it to the center of the shield.

, Wolverine's sharp claws are easy to create using tin foil and cardboard.

, If the chosen cap or helmet is not already black then paint it over.


Get a can of black spray paint.
Use a breathing protection mask while you apply it, and let it dry for a few hours before proceeding with further use.

, If you use the helmet then you might want to think about adding a chin strap to the bottom.


Cut off a piece of black cloth long enough to stretch from ear to ear along the bottom of the helmet and your chin.
Tape to both ends of the strip to the bottom of the helmet from approximately the point just ahead of where your ears would go. Adjust the length if it’s too loose or too tight.

, You can use sunglasses, goggles, or a visor for this part of the SWAT costume. See the later step for goggles and visor ideas if you prefer them instead.Get black frame-style sunglasses at home or from a shop rather than making them on your own.
Avoid prescription or designer brands.

, If they’re not totally black you can paint or marker over the non-black areas with spray paint or black markers.


Take care to avoid getting paint or marker on the lenses or you risk making them unusable. Try cover them with masking tape while you do the painting on the non-black surfaces.

, Goggles and visors (such as those a welder or mechanic might use) might be available in your home or garage.


If you don’t own goggles or a visor then you may be able to borrow them from someone handy with tools. You can ask something such as, “I’d like to borrow your welding visor for a Halloween costume, but I will return it the next day.”
Make sure you return any borrowed equipment in the same condition you received it.
Goggles and visors are also relatively inexpensive in local shops or online.
Don’t paint these over especially if you intend to wear them at any point.

, This part of the SWAT costume should be able to rest on top of your hat or helmet without falling, but also swing down with relative ease when you move them.


If the glasses, goggles, or visor don’t already come with some kind of fastener you can tape some string to their ear pieces.
Cut a piece of strong yarn or preferably nylon string long enough to stretch between the back of the earpieces of your chosen eye wear. It must be long enough to wrap around the back of your head and hat/helmet.
Make sure there is enough excess string so you can tie both ends to the earpieces and leave enough slack to freely move the eye wear up and down. Ideally, you should be able to rest the eye wear on your hat/helmet and move your head freely without the eye wear slipping down.
If the eye wear slips then you might need to use a shorter length of string on the eye wear. If it is too hard to move up and down then you need a longer piece of string.

, You may want to add an ear piece to simulate a radio contact.


A pair of thin-style headphones or earbuds that are black can work under your hat or helmet.
Coil some black string or black wire from the ear piece to the back of your vest you’ll set up in a later step.
Twist the string or wire around so it looks like a cork screw or spiral.
Use black electrical tape to bind both ends of the wire between the back of the vest and the plastic backing of the ear piece respectively.

, This step is optional, but this can enhance the covert and field operative look.This coloring can simulate glare protection.
You can get the eye black at a sporting goods store.
Apply it using your fingers in streaks just below both eyes.

, This also can add to the covert and field operative look, but is also optional.Mix green and black around your face for camouflage.
You might look at a sporting goods store or department store for this paint.
Ask the seller for suggestions if you are unsure how the paint will work with your skin complexion.
Apply the paint generously around your cheeks, forehead, and chin using a makeup applicator or your hands.

, This should be something comfortable.This can be a short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirt.
The shirt should be cotton or a cotton-polyester blend.
Try to pick something you will be comfortable sweating into for a long period.

, You can sometimes get away with a white shirt for a contrast appearance instead of a blended look.Wear this shirt under any other gear on your torso.
You want a shirt color that will either blend with the vest or let the vest stand out.
You don’t want the undershirt to be what draws attention.
Do not pick a shirt with a logo.

, This can be a zip-up or pull-over variety of vest.Select a vest made of polypropylene and polyester. This will ensure it’s sturdy and comfortable.
Pick a vest with plenty of pockets for accessories.

, The vest may have an extra way to fasten with hooks around your back.The vest hooks should snap or slide into place and loop around your back for a comfortably snug fit.
This back strap should be adjustable. Maneuver the strap so the vest is not shifting around loosely, but is also not digging into your skin.
This is when you should also see about taping the other end of the ear piece from the earlier section onto the top-back portion of the vest with black electrical tape. You can fasten it to an area on the shoulder or similar portion that will be out of sight—leaving only the ear bud and coiled black cord visible.

, Depending on your sleeve situation and pants you have several options here.None of these coverings are a must, but they do add to the image of the costume.
For your elbows and knees you may want hardened plastic or rubber pads.
You can improvise these out of black bicycle or skateboard pads as long as they are uniform in color. #* If they’re not all black pads then you can go over different colored areas in black marker or black electrical tape.
Make sure the knee pads are easily adjustable for comfort by testing their straps.

, The coverings around your wrists and ankles should be cotton or a cotton/polyester mix.These should be uniformly black as with the rest of your gear.
Make sure you can flex your wrists and walk easily with these coverings on.

, These should be made of black polyester.You can try standard or fingerless types of gloves.
Biker gloves are an option if you can find them without logos and all black.
You can cover any non-black areas in black electrical tape, but this may restrict movement too much in the case of gloves.

, You can go with long pants or shorts but either version needs to keep with the black motif.Compare the pants color to the vest to be sure you are wearing the same shade of black top and bottom.
Select a pair with a decent number of pockets. While your vest should already have many pockets you can benefit from additional ones.
Pick pants with heavy duty stitching. Stronger stitching will be more comfortable and help your pants hold extra accessories.

, Some of your accessories will hang off your belt in addition to the belt holding your pants.Pick a leather belt with a color that fits the theme.
Select a brown or black colored belt.
Use a belt with a metal buckle, but without other logos.
Plastic buckles may break, and you don’t want another logo to intrude on the theme.

, These should be black and handle long periods of use.You can opt for combat-style boots instead of shoes, but these can be more costly and less comfortable.
Standard black sneakers are a more inexpensive way to handle this part of the costume comfortably. #* Make sure whatever choice you make is entirely black with no logos on them.
You can use black tape over logos temporarily if necessary.

, This will help to keep the color scheme going and stay comfortable.You want socks that are well-cushioned for a lot of walking, but not so thick that your feet sweat excessively.
Make sure the socks ride high enough to tuck into the legs of your pants.

, This may include toy guns, handcuffs, SWAT shield, and baton for example.If you don’t already have these toys around then a toy store, department store, or costume shop may have these individually sold for relatively low cost.
Make sure you buy toy versions of all of these items and never bring the real thing to a costume party.
Costume guns, like the toy AK-47 for example, are designated as such by the bright orange tip on the barrel.

, You can use a stencil and white marker or spray paint for this. Or buy the logos.You can copy the SWAT logo onto a stencil such as construction paper or cardboard. Draw it on with a pen or black marker that makes it easy to see for cutting later.
Cut out the marked logo from the paper or cardboard. Make sure only the letters are cut out.
Use masking tape to tape the stencil onto the area you want to put the logo. This should be the front right pocket of the vest for a smaller stencil, and across the top-back of the vest for a larger one.
Use white marker or spray paint to fill in the stencil and apply the logo to the target area.
Some costume shops may sell decal logos you can stick on, or sell pre-made stencils.

, You should have at least half a dozen pockets between your vest and pants.


You’ll need some pockets for your regular items like wallet, identification, keys, and so forth.
You can use the other pockets for accessories like a flashlight, toy radio, notepad, pen, toy knife, and so on.
Don’t overload any one pocket when you can make use of many others.

Read the card first.,
When seeing the present, try to express how much you love the gift.,
Offer an enormous thank you to the giver of the present.",How to Open Presents Politely," There is no rush to open your gifts, and it seems like you just want what's inside of them if you rush through them.


Decide which present you'd like to open first, and open the wrapping paper slowly. This will build up suspense, and seem as if it really is a great present once you finally see it.
If it's in a bag, pull the tissue paper out slowly and place it beside of you. Don't rip it out and throw it behind you. Again, rushing through the bag to get your present seems as if you are rushing to get the present inside.;
, Reading the card first seems appreciative towards the person who gave you the present.


If the card is homemade, compliment the person on their artwork, saying how much you love the designs.

, Explain how the gift was ""Just what you wanted"" or ""Perfect"".


Try to be specific. It sounds as if you really like the gift if you explain why the present is good. It sounds more thankful to express yourself.

Gather your supplies.,
Plan your design.,
Let your creativity flow.",How to Make Your Own Wrapping Paper2," In order to make the best wrapping paper, you will need good quality supplies. Here are some useful items to amass in your craft cupboard:


Base paper: The most important item is the base paper for the gift wrap; choose white, which can be found in rolls at many dollar stores and stores that sell wrapping paper. Solid colored paper is another possibility, depending on how you're going to decorate the paper.
Pencils and eraser: Use pencils and an eraser if you plan to create your own design. A ruler might also be useful.
Decorative items: Gather together colored markers, Sharpies, glitter, stickers, paints, stampers, and anything else you want.

, To make your wrapping paper look more professional, decide on a theme. Color schemes also help and add to your main theme. If you're making a structured design, then it is best that you sketch it out first with your pencil. Don't worry about making mistakes - you have an eraser!

, It's part of the fun to enjoy the design process when creating your wrapping paper!

Slide a few small flowers beneath the string or twine.",How to Make Your Own Wrapping Paper3," Consider using real instead of fake flowers for this project if at all possible and recycle old books for making the wrapping paper.

, Regardless of the book and gift size, you can piece together sheets from the book to encompass many gift sizes. Simply tear the sheets from the book and then use a ruler and scissors to create an even cut later.

, Consider piecing together the book sheets first and then using it as wrapping paper. Use clear tape that will be on the inside of the wrapping paper for a more seamless look.

, You want a bookish, old-school look, so don’t worry about the fancy flourish.

, Although the string is meant to hold the flowers in place, you may want to add a small piece of tape behind the flower, to ensure it doesn’t fall from the gift in transit.

Add a ribbon or string.",How to Make Your Own Wrapping Paper4," Select a special photo to grace the top of the gift. Consider a photo that will take up a good portion of the gift top without distorting the image.


In lieu of using the actual photo, have it copied and/or increased to accommodate the project.
Use a black and white photo for the photo wrapping for an added old timey touch.

, The photo that you will be affixing to the top of the gift is the star of the wrapping, so you don’t want it to compete with a wild pattern.

, Use double-sided clear tape (or a small tape loop) to hold it in place.

, Tie the ribbon or string completely around the package to hold the photo in place and add a decorative touch.

, Consider using a plain colored paper instead of something with a pattern, as your flourish will have enough design.

, You could cut out a few triangles and squares or all circles; be creative and go with what your artistic side brings forth.

, Keep in mind of the size and shape of your gift when using this method. You’ll want to keep the shapes small enough to fit on the gift, but large enough to draw attention.

, You could either tape shapes to string and then tie the string around the gift or you could attach the shapes directly to the gift.

Create or find an Error 404 image.,
Flip the image horizontally.,
Print your image on iron-on transfer paper.,
Preheat your iron.,
Place a pillowcase on top of your ironing surface and smooth out the wrinkles.,
Place your shirt over the pillowcase and position your transfer on the shirt.,
Press your hot iron down hard on the back of the transfer.,
Allow your transfer to cool for five minutes and peel away the transfer.",How to Make an Error 404 Costume1," Find a stock ""Error 404 Costume Not Found"" image online or use a word processor to type it out. If you're typing it out then use big, bold, and blocky letters so people can read it easily. If you are using an online image, make sure that it fits on the size of paper that you're using.;
, When you apply your iron on transfer to your shirt, the image is going to be flipped horizontally, as if you were looking at it in a mirror. To make your costume readable, you'll need to flip your image.To flip an image in Photoshop horizontally, go to Image>Rotate>Flip Horizontal.
To flip an image in Microsoft Paint, go to your toolbar at the top of the page or right click and click Rotate>Flip Horizontally.

, Purchase iron-on transfer paper from office supply, department stores, or online. Depending on what printer you have, you'll have to make sure that it can take gloss or iron-on paper. Go to print settings and select your paper type. Look for options that say “Special Paper,” or “Iron-On Transfer” and select it.When it's done printing, make sure that you double check that the image has been printed on the right side.

, Heat your iron to the highest temperature possible because you'll need a lot of heat for the image to transfer to your t-shirt properly. Pre-cleaning your shirt may also make the process smoother because the shirt can shrink around the heat transfer material., Because your iron will be on one of the hottest possible settings, you'll need to put something under your t-shirt to protect your flat surface. If you don't want to use a pillowcase, you can also use a cutting board or a flat piece of discarded wood.

, You should position your transfer on the area where you want it to read ""Error 404: Costume Not Found."" The best position is probably on the front center of your chest.

, You must press down hard with your iron for the image to successfully transfer onto your shirt. Do not iron over your shirt, instead press down firmly for 45 – 60 seconds in one spot, then move to another portion of the iron on image.Optimal pressure for a good transfer is 23 kilograms (50 pounds).

, There should be a slight bubbling of your iron-on. If there is not, then, chances are your iron is not hot enough. If the plastic is noticeably shrinking, or you've burnt your t-shirt, then your iron is too hot. Use a knife or fingernail to peel away the transfer to reveal your cynical Halloween costume. If you're having trouble peeling the transfer, try running your iron over it briefly to soften the plastic again."

Custom shirts online typically cost anywhere from $8 to $17.
Shirts made by a custom screen printing shop will be of a much higher quality than iron-on transfers.
Some websites that allow you to create a shirt include Design A Shirt, Vistaprint, and Cafe Press."

, These holes should be one inch (2.5 cm) apart, and big enough to put a shoelace through. This way, the cuff can act as a casing for the shoelace in the next step.

, Cut an old brown or white shoelace in half. Push the shoelace through the holes in the cuff, in and out of the sleeves. Tie the ends in a knot on the inside of your wrist, and pull to give yourself puffy sleeves.

, Punch holes in line with the top buttons of the shirt (or down the center of the blouse), about two inches (5 cm) apart. Stop at the second or third button hole, depending on how much chest you want exposed.

You can wear this on its own, but it works best if you wear it over the laced up shirt described above.

, Be careful not to cut off any parts of the sleeves – you're just aiming for one to three rips or tears on each sleeve. Try to balance the rips at different levels on each arm so that it's more interesting to look at.

, Cut a few tears here and there to expand on the ragged effect. Optionally, cut off about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to remove the machined hem and make the vest look more worn.

, Cut through the base of the collar and make a slit down the upper chest. Continue cutting all the way to the bottom of the vest, so that it hangs open.

, For extra flair, sew or iron on a patch showing a skull, King Neptune, or another nautical image. If you're feeling ambitious, you can embroider your own design.

Paint the costume.",How to Make a Tin Man Costume," You should cut it so that it can open flat. You will want a box that can fit your frame, so it should be large enough to cover your torso from the top of your shoulders to hip level.
Cut the box open with a box cutter, and remove the top and bottom panels.
Cut down one of the side creases so that the cardboard opens flat in one large piece.
Be careful when cutting the box as this tool can be very sharp.
Don't worry if the edges are jagged. You will tape these later to make them smooth.;
, You will need to roll up the cardboard tightly to make it more flexible.Remember, the torso part of the Tin Man's costume was rounded so you won't want the box to have its creases that make it square.
Start at one end of the cardboard piece and start rolling it up tightly.
Go slowly, making sure that the edges of the box are straight as you roll it.

, You will want the box to fit comfortably around your torso with some room for movement.To fit the box, hold your arms down at your sides.
Have a friend or helper wrap the box around your body.
Make sure the top of the box is level with the top of your shoulders.
Tape the box into place. There will be an area where there are flaps from the box that overlap. Don't worry about this as it will be covered in tape.
Use packing tape or duct tape to tape over the vertical edge where the sides of the boxes overlap.
This will now look like a large cardboard tube.

, This is the part that will sit over the shoulders and have a hole for your head to go through.Start this section by setting the large cardboard tube you just constructed over a large sheet of plain cardboard.
Trace the circumference of the tube onto the sheet of cardboard.
Use a box cutter to cut out this circle of cardboard.
Next, measure the circumference of your head and add 1-2 inches. Cut out a circle out of the center of the cardboard circle to match this measurement.
Try sliding the cardboard circle over your head.
If the head hole is too small, you can trim a little extra off of the inner cardboard circle to make it bigger.
Once fitted, tape this circle over the top of one end of the tube. Use duct tape all the way around to ensure a good seal and to secure the costume.
Tape it on the inside and outside of the tube to insure that it will stay in place.

, You will need to slide the tube over your head to see where your arms fall to determine the location of these.Put your arms at your sides and have a friend or helper slide the box tube over your head.
Mark the position where your arms start from your shoulder on the tube.
Take the tube off and cut holes large enough for your arms to fit through and move comfortably.
You may have to adjust the size of these several times before you get them big enough. Make sure you can get your arms in and out of the costume through these holes comfortably.
Cover the edges of the arm holes with duct tape to smooth them out.
The structure of your torso portion of the Tin Man costume is now constructed!

, These are corrugated metal tubes that you will use to make the arms of your costume.You can find these at your local home improvement store.
They come in several sizes. If you are making a child's costume, you will need a smaller size.
Try sliding the tubing over your arms at the store to see which size is the best fit for your body.

, This will require help from a friend since the tubing is stiff and hard to maneuver in.Slide the aluminum duct tubing over your arm to size it. Measure out where your fingers are and have your helper mark the tubing at this point with a pen.
Use a razor blade to cut the tubing at your mark, all the way around.
Cover the end of your arm tubing with duct tape to prevent cuts and splinters.
For the shoulder portion, bend the top of your trimmed arm piece to conform to the curve of your upper arm and shoulder.
Cover this top part in duct tape to hold this in place.

, You will need a wire hanger for this step.Put the cardboard torso piece onto your body, and slide your arms through the arm holes.
Put on the arm pieces you just made, sliding the tops of the arm pieces through the arm holes on the torso part slightly.
Have your helper make two holes in the top of each arm piece and two corresponding holes in the top of each side of the top of the torso piece just above the shoulders on each side.
Thread an unbent wire hanger through these holes and attach the arm pieces to the cardboard torso.
You should have a good deal of maneuverability at the shoulders of this costume.

, You will need a long sleeved shirt, an old pair of jeans, an old pair of sneakers, and a pair of gloves.Spread these out on a cardboard surface.
Use metallic spray paint to paint these a shiny silver color. Rustoleum brand is recommended by costumers since it is a high quality spray paint.
The pants may be the most challenging part of this step as they don't take paint as well as other fabrics.
You may need two coats of paint. If the fabric from the clothing is showing through or the color isn't as shiny as you want, do a second coat after the first coat dries.

, You can do this with the same type silver spray paint as you used for the clothing.Even though the aluminum tubing you used to make the arms is already silver, you will want to paint this as well to cover up any areas that are duct taped. You will want the arms to be the same shade of silver as the rest of the costume, too.
Apply a generous coat to the cardboard torso, and then let these parts dry.
After the arms and torso of the costume are fully dry, you will want to apply a second coat to ensure the color is even throughout.

, These will be the axe and hat part of the costume.Lay the funnel you bought on a cardboard surface and paint it generously with metallic spray paint.
Do the same for the axe of the costume.
Apply a second coat of paint if needed.

, You will need the following: Vinyl fabric (in silver if available).
1/4 inch PEX Pipe Tubing
1/4 inch threaded rods
Silver Metallic Spraypaint (Rustoleum brand works the best)
Aluminum vent tubing (try it on your subject to see what size will fit the arms)
Large bolts (to use as buttons for the front of the costume)
Sweat pants or leggings (these will be painted so be sure they aren't ones you will miss)
1 inch wide heavy duty velcro for the back of the barrel part of the costume
1/2 inch wide velcro for the front of the costume
3/8 inch grosgrain ribbon
Epoxy glue for attaching the bowtie and buttons down the front of the costume
A pair of cotton gloves
A funnel and prop axe.
A small watering can

, This will require you to measure the shoulders of your subject from the edge of one shoulder to the edge of the other. Cut a circle from your vinyl fabric that has the diameter of your shoulder measurement, adding an extra 1/4 inch for seam allowance.
Cut a circle out of the center of this piece that is the same width as your subject's neck, plus a little extra room for comfort.
Cut in a straight line from the center circle to the edge of the outer circle. This will allow your subject to get their neck into the costume.

, These will be crescent moon shaped.Measure how high your subject's neck is to see how high you want the collar to go.
Use this measurement to determine how wide the crescent shaped vinyl pieces should be.
Cut out two identical half moon shaped pieces out of vinyl.
Place one of these collar pieces face down (shiny side down) on the cut circle piece from the last step.
Line up the front tip of the crescent with the front part of the inner circle. The front tip of the crescent should be directly opposite the cut straight line that will allow you to put the costume on your subject's neck.
Sew the collar piece to the circle piece along the inner circle. Leave a 1/4 inch seam.
Repeat the process for the other collar piece, sewing it on the other side of the circle.
Trim any excess fabric from the back of the collar.

, These will be used to close the neck and shoulder piece of the costume after it is put on.Cut out two small rectangles of vinyl fabric.
Sew one end of one of the rectangles to the left side of the collar on the back of the costume.
Attach a small piece of velcro to one end of the rectangle.
Attach the other side of the velcro to the right collar piece. This should now form a flap that you can velcro together to hold the costume closed.
Repeat this process, but this time attach the flap and velcro to the circular shoulder piece across the cut you will use to get the costume onto your subject.

, Do this along the larger outside edge. These will be use to hold in the tubing.Space the pieces of ribbon out every 2 inches.
Stitch them along the edge, the leave a gap and sew the other end of each ribbon piece. These will look like small loops on the underside of the shoulder piece.
Make sure you sew the ribbon on 1/4 inch from the edge of the shoulder piece.

, This will go over the torso.To do this, place the circular shoulder piece (that you just sewed the collar and ribbons onto) and place it on your subject.
Measure from the edge of the circular shoulder piece down the front of your subject to where you want the torso part of the costume to end.
Add 1/4 inch to this measurement. This will be how long your piece of vinyl fabric will need to be.
Measure the circumference of the circular shoulder piece then add a few inches to this measurement for overlap; this is how wide your next piece of vinyl fabric will be.
Cut out your vinyl fabric for the torso part of the costume according to these measurements.

, Start by lining up the right side of the shoulder piece (at the cut out gap you use to get the costume on).Sew the top edge of the large rectangular torso piece along the outer edge of the shoulder piece, leaving a 1/4 inch seam.
Make sure you are sewing on the underside of shoulder piece and the backside of the torso fabric.
Leave a tail of excess fabric from the rectangle torso piece once you have completed sewing around the circle. This is where you will attach velcro to hold the costume closed.

,
Trim the tubing down to size so the costume can close in the back without a large gap.
Trim down a piece of threaded rod by about 2 inches.
Stick this in one end of your tubing, leaving some hanging out the end. Secure it with glue.
Stick the other end of the rod into the tubing on the other side of the gap on the shoulder piece to close the tubing so it looks like one solid piece. This serves to hold the costume closed as well as to support the circular shoulder piece of the costume.
Remove the tubing from the ribbon loops.

, This will be in the back of the costume.Make sure the velcro extends the entire length of the torso piece from top to bottom.
Attach the opposite side of the velcro strip on the opposite flap of the back of the costume.
You can now thread the tubing back through the ribbon loops.

, Start this part by cutting out a small rectangle out of your vinyl fabric.Make this rectangle as wide as you want the bowtie to be.
Cut a smaller strip of vinyl out as well to tie the center of the bowtie.
Pinch your rectangle of vinyl in the center. Wrap the smaller strip of vinyl around this to tie it.
Secure the center of the bowtie with epoxy glue.
Attach the bowtie to the collar on the front of the costume with epoxy glue.

, Start by cutting out arm holes in the side of the torso part of the costume.Make the arm holes slightly larger than the size of the arms of your subject so he or she can move freely.
Measure the length of your subjects arms and their circumference. Add a couple of inches to the circumference measurement as you will want the sleeves of the costume to be slightly loose.
Cut a rectangle of vinyl fabric as long as the arm measurement and as wide as your circumference measurement (plus a few inches for movement room).
Sew the rectangle into a tube, using a 1/4 inch seam.
Cut your aluminum duct tubing. You will want two small pieces per arm: one for the shoulder area and one for the elbow.
Pinch the duct tubing for the elbow piece on one side and secure it with thread.
Slide the shoulder piece of duct tubing over the vinyl tube you just sewed. Sew this on with a strong needle and thread in several places. This will form the top part of the sleeve.
Slide on the elbow piece of duct tubing over the vinyl tube and secure it on with thread.
Attach the shoulder duct of the sleeve to the armhole on the torso piece of the costume with thread. It is okay if there are a few gaps as this is just to hold the costume together.
Repeat this process for the other sleeve of the costume.

, You will attach these using epoxy glue.Remember, the deadbolts are going to serve as buttons.
Space these out evenly just off center, running down the front of the costume.
Glue them onto the torso piece with epoxy glue.
Allow these to dry completely before doing anything else with this part of the costume.

, This is a relatively simple process:Measure how long the pants or leggings are you are using as a base from crotch to ankle and the circumference, adding 1/4 inch to each of these measurements.
Cut out two rectangles of vinyl fabric. Each should be as long as the pant length measurement and as wide as the circumference measurement of the under-leggings.
Sew these rectangles into tubes, leaving a 1/4 inch seam.
Secure the tubes on to the leggings, sewing all the way around the top and bottom using 1/4 inch seams.
Make the knee portion out of aluminum duct tubing. Cut a short piece big enough to cover the knees of your subject.
Cut the tubing open at the back so you can fit it over the legs of the costume. Hot glue this to the knee area of the pants of the costume.

, You will need to use several coats of Rustoleum metallic silver spray paint.Paint the torso/shoulder portion and the pants.
You should also paint the costume accessories at this time, including the gloves.
The funnel will serve as the tin man's hat, and the watering can will be the oil can.
If you have an axe prop, paint it as well.
Allow the costume to dry completely before allowing a child to wear it.

Take the copy paper out of the packaging.,
Turn the packaging into a bag.,
Fold the flap on the remaining open end of the packaging inward.,
Decide on the handle length.,
Punch holes into the bag.,
Make the handle for the first side.,
Repeat for the holes on the other side of the bag.

,
Decide whether or not you'd like to decorate the bag.,
Consider ahead of making this bag whether you'd prefer a plain white bag.",How to Make Gift Bags from Reused Copy Paper Packages," Do so without making any tears in the packaging, taking a little extra care to open the packaging at its glued spots. Try to keep one end of the packaging firmly secured by the original glue.;
, Glue the side of the bag back together. If both ends of the packaging were opened, glue one back in place, using the folds originally made by the manufacturer (hopefully, this won't need to be done).

, Secure each side of this end with glue, tape or staples.

, Measure out and cut the ribbon pieces to exactly the same length for both sides of the bag.

, Punch four holes on the top of the bag, two on each side, using a hole puncher. Be sure to align them exactly opposite each other, in a position that will allow for tying the handles in place.

, Insert a piece of ribbon or any other material that can go through the hole in one hole. Tie a firm knot on the inside of the bag to secure it. Repeat for the other hole on the same side, ensuring that there is plenty of handle for holding, then knot on the inside to secure as well.

,, The bag can be covered with decoupage from magazine cut-outs, copy paper with a design you've hand drawn on, or any other easy-to-find (and preferably scrap) pieces of paper. Glue in place.


If adding a design, draw this on before gluing in place, as it's easier that way.

, If so, you can undo the whole copy paper packaging and reverse the above process to only show the white insides as the outer part of the bag. This requires finessing the folds, however, as you'll need to reverse fold the base of the bag following the lines already made by the manufacturer. When folding these in the reverse way, do so firmly and cleanly, to ensure that they stay in the new direction you're folding them in. Be sure to glue and tape the base in place firmly, so that the contents won't fall out.


Once done, this can be decorated by gluing on pretty things such as artificial flowers, sticker rhinestones (form a name or word), stickers, pompoms, scrap fabric, and any other craft or decorative items you'd think would work well.

Draw a series of vertical lines, ¾ to 1 inch (1.91 to 2.54 centimeters) across the bottom of the shirt.The lines need to go from the hem of the shirt, all the way up to the horizontal line you drew.,
Cut the vertical lines to make the fringe.,
Turn the shirt right side out, then tie the top fringes to the corresponding bottom fringes.,
Tie the adjacent fringes together to hide the gaps.,
Consider cutting the shoulders of the shirt and then sewing them together to make front any back handles.",How to Make a Simple Cloth Bag1," To make your bag more interesting, consider using a shirt with an interesting print or graphic on the front. If the shirt is white, consider tie dyeing it first. This will make your bag more colorful and fun., To make the cut more even, fold the shirt in half first. This way, you will be cutting both sleeves off at the same time. To make longer handles, consider cutting a little bit below the sleeves.








, Try to leave 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of space between the neckline and the sleeves. This will make your handles more durable.








To make your neckline more even, trace the curve using a marker and a bowl or plate first.

, Use a ruler or some other straight edge to make the line as even as possible. Remember that your shirt will stretch a little when you put things into your bag.







, These vertical lines will be your cutting lines to make a fringe. You will be knotting the fringe together to make the bottom of the bag.








, Be sure to cut through both layers of the shirt at the same time, so that your fringe is even. Do not cut past the horizontal line, however.









Be sure to cut the side seams going from the hem of your shirt up to the line you drew. This will create the first and last fringes., Tie the first top fringe to the first bottom fringe. Tie the second top fringe to the second bottom fringe. Keep doing this until you have knots all along the bottom of the bag.








The knots and fringe will be part of your bag's final design. If you don't want the knots and fringe to be visible, then don't turn your shirt right side out. This will keep the knots and fringe on the inside.

, Your bag will likely have tiny gaps between the knots. You will need to hide them, or your bag won't be able to hold small items. To do this, you will need to tie the first and second fringes together, the third and forth fringes together, and so forth, on both sides (front and back) of the bag.








If you are keeping the fringes on the inside of your bag, consider trimming them down, so that they don't get tangled.

, Turn your bag inside out. Cut the shoulders apart. Sew the front left shoulder to the front right shoulder. Sew the back left shoulder to the back right shoulder. Use ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowances. When you are done, turn the bag right side out.

If the paper is not the right size, cut it down. Make sure that it's a rectangle.
For an extra-fancy gift bag, consider using fancy wrapping paper with either glittered or flocked designs.;
, If you are working with plain, solid-colored paper, such as brown kraft paper, it would be a good idea to decorate it. This will make it look more like a gift bag and less like a paper sack. Get out some paint and stencils, and add some pretty designs onto it. Alternatively, you can add a simple pattern using rubber stamps and an ink pad or acrylic paint.


For a fancier touch, draw your designs with glue, then sprinkle extra-fine glitter onto them before the glue dries.
Be sure to let the paper dry before moving on.

, Orient the paper landscape style, with the designed or decorated part facing up. Fold the top, long edge down by 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Run your fingernail along the crease to sharpen it.


For a fancier touch, trim the edge with a pair of pinking shears first, before folding it., The folded part should now be flat against your work surface. Make sure that it is still along the top edge of the paper.


If you are using plain paper, with neither a front or back, skip this step. The folded edge will be on the inside.

, Overlap them by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). If you'd like, you can run your fingernail along the side edges to make creases. If you'd like a more ""oval"" shaped bag, however, don't crease the sides.

, Unfold the top flap. Run a glue stick or lay down a strip of double-sided tape along the side edge of the bottom flap. Press the top flap back down. Run your finger along the seam to seal it.


If you used a glue stick, make sure that you don't get any glue on the inside of the bag.

, The more you fold it up by, the wider the base of your bag will be.Aim for about 3 to 5 inches (7.62 to 12.7 centimeters).

, When you folded the bottom part of the bag up, you will have created a pocket. Fold the top part of the pocket down and flatten it. Run your fingernail along the angled sides to create creases.

Press the top flap back down and run your finger across the seams to seal them.

, The holes should be about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) from the top edge. They should be closer to each other than the sides of the bag.


If your paper is thin enough, you can punch the holes through both layers of paper at the same time.
Consider inserting eyelets into the holes.This makes them sturdier as well as adds an element of design.

, Measure and cut two equal lengths of ribbon. For a more rustic touch, you can use strong, cording, yarn, or twine instead.


Choose colors that go well with your bag.
Avoid skinny ribbons. The knots won't be big enough to hold it inside the bag.

, If you were to open your bag now, it will be shaped more like an oval sack. If you want to make it a rectangle, like a traditional bag, do the following:Fold left and right side edges down until the base of the bag is the same width as the top.
Run your fingernail along the edges to make creases.
Unfold the edges and flip the bag over.
Fold the sides again, and run your fingernail along the edges to make creases.

, Your bag is now ready to use! Insert some coordinating tissue paper and tuck your gift inside. Add more tissue paper, if needed, and fluff it out.

, Choose some blank wrapping paper, such as white or brown craft paper, or butcher paper. Spread the paper down on your work surface, then tape or weight down the corners.

, Acrylic paint or tempera paint will work best for this. If you are using acrylic paint, make sure that you are using the watered-down kind that comes in a bottle. The kind that comes in a tube (like toothpaste) is much too thick for this kind of project.


You can only use one color for these stamps. If you want to use more colors, make more stamps, and put the paint on a separate plate.

, Spread it around until the stamp is coated with a thin layer of paint. Use the edge of a spoon to scrape off any excess paint. If you use too much paint, your design may turn out smudged., Keep pressing your stamp against the paper at various points until your design is complete. Every so often, dip your stamp into the paint to re-ink it. If you want to use a new color, it would be best to make a new stamp.


Create layers and multicolored designs by allowing the paint to dry, then stamping more colors on top.

, These will make supports for the handles. They need to be a little narrower than your bag and about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) wide. Set these aside as well after you cut them.These will be inside the top hem of your bag. The color for these does not matter.

, It needs to be a rectangle and large enough to wrap around your box, like a present. This includes wrapping around the side of the box as well.

, Fold the top, long edge by 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Run your fingernail along the folded edge to make a crease. This will add a nice finish to the top of your bag.The hem needs to be the same width as your cardboard strips.
If your paper has a pattern on it, make sure that the pattern is facing down and the blank side is facing you.

, Trim off any excess paper and overlap the two narrow ends by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Try to place the seam at one of the box's edges inside of the front, back, or side face.Secure the edges with double-sided tape or a glue stick.

, Fold the side edges of the paper down first, right against the box. Run your fingernail along the angles on the top and bottom flaps to make creases. Fold the top and bottom flaps against the bottom of the box, and secure them with a glue stick or double-sided tape.

, If you'd like, you can pinch the corners of the bag first before you remove the box. At this point, you can put the box away. You won't be using it again for the remainder of this tutorial.

, Flatten the bag and tuck the sides inside, just like a real paper gift bag. Run your fingernail along the edges to make crisp seams. You only have to make the seams about half-way down.This is not completely necessary, but it will add a professional touch to your bag.

, Run a glue stick or lay down a strip of double-sided tape along one of your thin cardboard strips. Open up the hem on the front of your bag. Slide the strip inside, and press the hem flat. Repeat for the back of the bag with the other strip., Draw a cross on the cardboard rectangle with a glue stick or double-sided tape. Place the cardboard glue-side or tape-side down into the bag, and press it against the bottom., The holes should be about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) from the top edge of the bag. They should be closer to each other than to the sides of the bag.


For a fancier touch, add eyelets into the holes.

, Measure and cut two equal lengths of ribbon. Choose a color that goes well with your bag. For a rustic touch, you can use cording, string, twine, or even yarn. Avoid anything that is too skinny, however; the knots won't be big enough to hold.

, Thread the ends of your first ribbon through both holes on the front of your bag. Tie the ends into knots on the inside of your bag. Repeat with the other ribbon for the back.

, Open the bag up and tuck in some tissue paper. Insert your gift and add more tissue paper, if needed. Fluff the tissue paper out.

Next, write down a few items that you'd use for that hobby. Choose the ones you really like from that list, and add them to your wish list. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If you like to paint or draw, you might need some new graphite pencils, paintbrushes, or paints. If you do oil painting, you might also need some linseed oil or turpentine. Be creative!
If you like to show support for your favorite sports team, don't limit yourself to just jerseys, sweatshirts, and hats with your favorite team's logo. A sports game is a great way of showing support. It can also be a great experience.
If you like music, why not think about your favorite bands? Are there any new albums that came out or that you don't have? What about posters or shirts?
If you are interested in manga or comic books, see if any new volumes have been added to your favorite series. If you like anime, see what new action figures you might have missed out on.

, Did you recently see a musical that you really liked? The musical might not be playing anymore by the time your birthday rolls around, but there could be another one that you might enjoy. Visit the theater company's website and see what is coming up that interests you. Tickets to performances, such as operas, plays, and musicals, make great, memorable gifts.


If you don't like theater, think about other things you have enjoyed. This could be a sports game, a concert, or even a theme park. Click here for more gift ideas based on experiences.

, Sometimes, figuring out what you need is easier than deciding what you want. Think about the past few months. Ask yourself if there was something you really needed at one point but didn't have. Here are some things to get you started:


If you cook a lot, you might find that some of your pots, pans, and other utensils need replacing or updating. You could ask for a new set or blender. If all your cooking gear is in top condition, consider some exotic spices instead. If you have a green thumb, you might like a grow-your-own herb kit. You'll get some pots, soil, and a few popular cooking herbs, such as basil, thyme, and mint.
If you play a sport or music, see if your gear needs updating or replacing. Equipment can be expensive, and a birthday is a great chance to get an upgrade.
If your birthday is close to winter, it might be a good idea to check and see if your winter clothes still fit. If they don't, you could ask for a new jacket or scarf.

, Do you have a favorite store that you like to shop in? Visit their website and see if there is anything new that came out since the last time you visited. Sometimes, walking through a store, thumbing through a catalog, or surfing the web may give you some ideas.


If you have a free weekend, try visiting your local mall. Be sure to take note of anything that interests you.

, Chances are, you might be interested in more than one thing, such as drawing, painting, and knitting. You might also find yourself wanting anything and everything related to your craft. This could easily get overwhelming. To keep this from happening, you could always ask for a set or kit. They usually contain everything you need to complete a project or two. This would also make it easier on your friends and family when they go gift-shopping; they won't have to worry about getting the right supplies or missing an important one. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If you like beading, you might like a beading set. Most will have everything you need to create a necklace, a pair of earrings, and a bracelet. They will come with beading wire, clasps and crimps, and beads. You might also be interested in getting some polymer clay so that you can make your own beads.
If you are into DIY, you might like a soap or candle-making kit. You could also ask for supplies for a basic DIY project, such as chalkboard paint, mason jars, burlap, twine, and paint brushes.
If you like to draw, you could ask for a set of graphite or charcoal pencils, a sketchbook, and a how-to-draw book. These books come on just about every subject, from people to plants and trees to animals. Some even focus on specific animals, such as birds, cats, dogs, or horses. If you like fantasy creatures, then there are books on how to draw mermaids, fairies, elves, and dragons. There are even books on how to draw anime.
If you like to paint, consider an art set. Many arts and crafts stores sell sets that come in wooden or metal cases. You can get them with artist-grade acrylic, oil, or watercolor paints. Some sets may also including a how-to-paint book, some art paper, or a canvas.
If you like knitting or crochet, you don't have to limit yourself to just plain old yarn. You would treat yourself to some fancier, more expensive yarn with different fibers and textures. There are also many pattern books available that you might like as well.

, Things like computers, phones, and tablets are always updating, and what is new one year will be old and outdated the next. Accessories, such as cases and earphones, however, won't get old as fast and could last you much longer. Here are some ideas:


If you have a phone or tablet, ask for a protective case. They can often be personalized with your name, a design, or an image.
Headphones, speakers and other smaller items can enhance a device you already have.
You might also like something nostalgic, such as a new turntable to play your record collection.

, Jewelry can be expensive, but it doesn't have to be. You can get many beautiful, handmade pieces on artist websites, such as Etsy, and at craft fairs. Look through your jewelry collection and see if there anything you wish you to complete an outfit, such as a brooch, bracelet, or necklace. If jewelry isn't your thing, you could always ask for a special hat or bag. Here's a few more ideas for you:


When asking for jewelry, consider getting a full set: a necklace and matching earrings.
If you already have a lot of jewelry but nothing to keep it in, you could ask for a jewelry box instead.
If you are a man, you can always ask for a tie pin, cuff-links, or even a new watch.
Belts and wallets can make great gifts. If you get them in leather, you might be able to get them customized; some leather can be stamped with a design or letters.

, Just be sure to list your favorite colors, shades, and scents as these can be personal. Like jewelry, makeup does not take up a lot of space, and it can be used almost very day. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Many makeup companies offer gift sets that include a makeup bag, eye shadow, lipstick, and blush.
Bath and beauty stores often offer gift baskets that include lotion and soap. Some even include things like bath bombs, salts, and bubbles.
If you like to use expensive moisturizers or perfumes, your birthday is a great chance to ask for these.

, Most sports teams have online gift shops. They are a great place to start looking. If your favorite team is playing near your town around your birthday, see if you can get a ticket to their game. Here are some more ideas:


Ask for jersey, hat, or sweatshirt that you can wear to games to show your support.
If you want to show your support in the workplace, try searching for business-appropriate attire instead, such as: a necktie, socks, cuff-links, or a scarf.
If you like to host parties to watch, ask for things like a themed bowl. They could add a personal touch to your party.
You could also ask for items that would allow you to play a sport, such as athletic apparel, specialized shoes, rackets, or balls.

, If you have a favorite author or genre, ask for the latest book in a series. The New York Times bestseller list can help you find the most popular books in a variety of genres. Let the giver know what your tastes. Maybe he or she has read something you would enjoy. Here are some more ideas:


Ask for an e-reader; this will allow you to carry all your favorite books, wherever you go.
If you already own an e-reader, ask for a special cover for your reader. You can also ask for a gift certificate so that you can buy more e-books.
If you have a favorite book, see if you can find a canvas book bag or a poster that features the cover. You might even find a print of the book cover on a shirt, mug, or even mouse pad.
If you have a favorite quote about reading or from a favorite author, look online to see if it is available on a poster, mug or other object.

, If you already own a few figures from a certain set, ask for more figures so that you can finish your collection. If you like playing games, you might like board games or card games like Uno, Clue, or Apples to Apples.


Older players may enjoy strategy games like Ticket to Ride, or parlor games like Cards Against Humanity.
You might also be interested in model kits. Some are simple, and only require you to snap together the parts. There is no glue or painting involved. Some kits are more advanced; you have to glue the parts together and paint them. You can buy models kits of cars, airplanes, ships, helicopters, and motorcycles. You could even buy space ships from popular science fiction films, such as Star Wars and Star Trek.


, If you like a show, book series, or video game, you could ask for merchandise from that. For example, you could ask for a wand from Harry Potter, a figure or model from Lord of the Rings or a t-shirt from your favorite video game. You might also want to add to your collection of DVDs or books. Here are a few more ideas:


Fans of video games may enjoy a Minecraft backpack or pajamas with the Crest of Hyrule from the Legend of Zelda.

If you like to cosplay, you could ask for a wig or accessories to finish your latest work. You can also ask for a gift card to your favorite fabric or arts and crafts store so that you can buy materials to make your cosplay.
Ask for posters or action figures of your favorite character, comic book, movie, or video game.
If you like to read manga, ask for the newest books in the series. If you like anime, ask for the latest episodes on a DVD; some studios also make movies based on the series.
Consider getting a book featuring the artwork and concept art from your favorite video game, comic book, manga, or anime.

, These gifts are often more personal and special than store-bought gifts. The person might even be flattered that you think their talents are gift-worthy. Handmade gifts are both unique and special, and sure to stand out. Here are some things you could ask for:


If you know someone who likes to knit, see if they are willing to make you a scarf or hat.
If you know someone who sews, see if they might be willing to make you a new bag.
If one of your friends likes to make soaps or candles, see if they could make you a set.

, Sometimes, your favorite store may not be carrying something that you like at the moment. A gift card will allow you to set money aside to spend at that store when you do find something that you like.


Some people do not like giving gift cards. If this happens, ask them if they could go with you to the store to buy that special gift when the time comes.

, If the budget is large, you might ask to go on a trip to a place you’ve never been to. If the budget is more limited, ask to spend a day with the giver. It can be as simple as going out to a meal or to a museum in your town. Here's some more ideas:


Visit another country or state you have always wanted to go to. If you don't know where to go, you could always close your eyes and point to a spot on a map. Open your eyes, and visit wherever your finger is pointing to.
Go on a cruise. Oftentimes, cruises also allow you to go on land and tour; you are not always stuck on a boat.
Go to the park. It can be as simple as your local neighborhood park. It can also be a state or national park.
Go camping. Keep in mind that it is not a good idea to go camping alone, so you might want to bring a buddy or two.

, Much like traveling, these sorts of experiences need some planning. In many cases, they will also need some equipment as well. They can, however, be combined with traveling. For example, if you go to a tropical island, you might also want to try scuba diving. If you decide to go camping, you might also want to try visiting some caves or go hiking. Here's some more ideas for you to consider:


Bungee jumping
Caving
Hiking or backpacking
Horseback riding
Kayaking
Rock climbing
Scuba diving

, Many spas offer extra-special treatments, such as fancy pedicures complete with salts, oils, and an extra long massage. If you don't like pedicures, you might like a massage or a facial with a mud mask. Be sure to schedule your appointment in advance, as some of the more popular spa centers get their spots filled up fast.

, Many businesses offer gift certificates to learn a new skill, such as dancing, martial arts, painting, or woodworking. You can also see if you can spend the day learning a special skill from a family member. Your grandmother may be delighted to teach you how to bake a cake or cook a favorite dish. And the best part is that you can eat what you cook after you are done. Here are some more ideas:


If you like beading, cake decorating, crochet, knitting, or painting, visit an arts and crafts store. Many of them offer classes in these areas.
Some community centers also offer classes in areas such as pottery, weaving, and music.

, They are great gifts for those who enjoy art or history. Many museums are themed, and focus on a certain type of history (such as ancient Egyptian or Medieval) or a certain type of art (such as Asian or French Impressionist). Think about what interests you, and see if there is a museum that features your interests.


If history or art aren't your think, you might be interested in a sports or music hall of fame. You might also enjoy visiting a wax museum or a museum that focuses on technology and innovation.

, Most of the time, you only have to pay an entrance fee, and can spend as much time as you want. Some zoos and aquariums may allow you to get up close and personal with some of the animals for an additional fee. If you are interested in this, visit your local zoo or aquarium's website, and see if this is an option.

, Sometimes, the memories of an event can outlast any physical gift. Many theaters and concert halls may also have gift shops that sell posters, CDs, and shirts that you can buy to help you remember the experience even more.


See if your favorite band is playing close to you, and ask for a ticket to their concert. You can make the experience even more special by asking for a VIP pass, so that you can meet your favorite band members and have them sign items for you.
If you like classical music, you might be interested in attending a concert with a live orchestra.
If you like singing and dancing, you might enjoy watching a musical. If you like performing arts, but without the singing or dancing, try a play instead.

, Keep in mind, however, that if this convention is out of town, and if you will be staying there overnight, you may need a place to stay there. Many hotels that host the conventions offer special prices on rooms.


If anime or comic books aren't your think, you might be interested in a Renaissance Faire instead. They are usually open only on weekends, so you do not need to stay there overnight. They are a great way to immerse yourself in history and fantasy.
If you have a favorite author or illustrator, see if he or she is holding a reading or signing in your area. Not only will you be able to meet someone you adore, but you may also walk away with an autograph.

, An experience doesn't always have to be active. It can also be as simple as enjoying good food with friends and family. Choose a restaurant that you love, or that you have always wanted to go to.

, Sometimes, the gift of giving may feel more rewarding than the gift of receiving. Think about some things that you are passionate about, and try to find an organization that supports that. Here are some ideas:


Animals and nature
The homeless
Disaster relief
Education

, If you can't decide between a few items, make a pro and con list. Write down the good things and the bad things about each item on your list. Choose the item that has the most advantages and the fewest disadvantages. For example, a jacket may not be very exciting, but you could wear it with many different outfits; it may also keep you warm in the wintertime.

, It might be school, a job, sports, or something else entirely. If playing sports are the most important thing for you, new equipment might be more useful than that new video game—which you may not have the time to play between practices.

, Sometimes, what you want right now may not be what you will want (or use) later on down the road. If you can't decide between a few items, try to imagine your life without each of those items a few months later. Choose the item that you will continue to use, or still be interested in, over those whose novelty will fade.


You can also try imagining what it would be like not to get one of these gifts. Choose the one you'd be most upset over not getting.

, Not everyone might be able to spend a lot of money on a gift. If you want something very expensive, try asking the person for a budget before posting your wish list. If you ask for something that the person is unable to afford, he or she might feel embarrassed. Here are some other options:


If you are too shy to ask for a budget, put a few expensive and inexpensive things on your wish list. This will let people buy what is within their budget.
Ask for a group gift. This will allow everyone in your family or circle of friends to chip in when the time comes to buy that expensive gift.
Ask for a gift that doubles up for another occasion. For example, if your birthday is in the winter, you could ask for a gift that is both a birthday and Christmas present
Offer to pay for part of it yourself. The combination of your money and theirs may allow you to get something expensive that you really want.

, If you cannot decide between two or three things, ask someone else to choose for you. Give that person the list, and tell him or her to choose one item from that list. Some people may even prefer being able to choose a gift for you.

, If you try to meet other people's expectations, you will end up getting stressed. You may also end up not getting something that you really wanted.If the trip to the beach is what would really make you happy, let your family know. You do not have to choose an expensive gift for your birthday, just because all your friends do on theirs.

Pick the image you want (ideally themed to match the gift or card).,Change size and resolution - approximately 1” square at 300 dpi works OK to fill an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet

,
If using Photoshop, make sure that Constrain Proportions and Resample Image are both checked, otherwise you might squeeze your image or end up with an image way too big or too small (basically what we are trying to do at this step is to make an image just the right size to fill a sheet of paper when repeated as a pattern).

,Just for good housekeeping, and in case you want to use it again later, save this smaller version as a new file (rename it and save it where you can find it easily)

,Select All (Control+A) and Copy to clipboard ( \Edit\Copy )

,
Now to make this into a pattern that you can repeat, in Adobe Photoshop(TM) this is done by selecting \Edit\Define Pattern


(GIMP, Imageforge and other free image editing software have similar features)

,
Now create a new blank file of the the required size and resolution, e.g.,
Now comes the clever part, in the new file Select All (Control+A) and we are simply going to fill the entire sheet with a repeating pattern of the image copied above.,Click on the drop down box for Custom pattern thumb

,All available patterns should then appear, and the item you just added should now be the last one in the list:thumb,Click OK and your blank sheet should magically fill with repeating images:thumb

,
Then just print on regular paper.",How to Create Custom Gift Wrap Using Photo Editing Software," Make sure you own the rights to use the image. This example uses a little cartoon of a baby:thumb;
,,,,,, 8 1/2 x 11 @ 300 dpi. Make it either portrait or landscape orientation as desired.

, In Photoshop(TM) select Edit\FillPatternthumb

,,,, It's a good idea to ""Print Preview"" just to check that it is going to come out the way you expect. Check for Landscape/Portrait, paper size/quality, etc.


""Draft"" or ""High Speed"" print quality works for a faint 'watermark' effect (uses less ink too) You can also adjust Brightness and Contrast in your image editing program to get a similar effect.

Cut a length of burlap ribbon.,
Crisscross the ends over the center.,
Pinch and tie the center.,
Cut a smaller length of burlap ribbon.,
Cover the center using the second piece.,
Snip the ribbon ends.,
Use as desired.",How to Make a Burlap Bow1," Use scissors to cut 2 to 3 feet (61 to 91 cm) of wired or free-form burlap ribbon.


This can be done with nearly any width, but 2 to 4 inch (5 to 10 cm) wide ribbon will work well for many decorative applications. If you use a much thicker ribbon, you may need to cut a longer piece.
It's better to start with too much length than too little since you can trim off any excess toward the end of the project.;
, Lay the burlap ribbon flat an identify the center. Fold the ends so that they crisscross over this center point.


The top edge of each folded end should intersect at the exact center point of the ribbon, but the rest of the end will angle downward below this point.
Fold the ribbon so that the folds are about as large as you want the final ribbon loops to be. Make sure that both sides are even.

, Pinch the ribbon at the center point of intersection, then tie it in place with a small wire tie or piece of twine.


Pinch from top to bottom and adjust the inner pleats that form as needed. You should also make any necessary adjustments to the size and shape of the loops before tying off the center.
Trim the wire tie or ribbon after tying it on. Keep it as short as possible so it will be easier to cover.

, Use scissors to cut 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) of wired or free-form burlap ribbon.


This piece of ribbon should be one-half to two-thirds the width of the main ribbon. Make sure that it is wide enough to hide the center but not wide enough to distort the shape of the bow.

, Wrap the new length of burlap around the center of the bow and tack it into place using hot glue.


Make sure that this piece of burlap completely hides the wire or ribbon holding the bow's shape.
Also note that the end of this center piece should be positioned to the back of the bow.

, Trim the ends of the burlap as desired, and try to keep both ends the same approximate length.


You can trim the ends at a simple slant, but cutting a ""v"" shape into both ends can give the bow a decorative appearance. Doing so also makes the burlap less likely to unravel.

, The burlap ribbon is now finished. You can use it to decorate frames, wreaths, and more.

Cut a length of burlap ribbon.,
Fold the burlap.,
Make a mirror fold.,
Stack progressively smaller loop sets on top.,
Tie off the center.,
Hide the wire tie with additional burlap.,
Fan out the loops.,
Cut the ribbon tails.,
Use as desired.",How to Make a Burlap Bow2," Cut 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) of wired or free-form burlap ribbon.


For this length range, burlap ribbon measuring 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) wide should work well.
You can, however, use larger widths. Wider ribbon can actually create a fluffier bow. Just make sure to increase the length of the ribbon when selecting a wider type.

, Determine how wide you want the final bow to be, then fold one end over to create a loop half that long.


Note that this should not be half the length of your ribbon. At most, this first loop should only take up no more than one-quarter the total ribbon length.
This loop should also lie flat and parallel to the rest of the ribbon.

, Fold the opposite end back over the front of the bow and over the first loop. The resulting loop should be just as large as the first.


Keep the ribbon parallel and flat as you make this second loop.
After completing this step, the maximum bow width should be set to your desired final width.

, Continue folding the loose end of burlap back and forth on top of the initial loop set. Work in equal pairs, and make each pair a little smaller than the one beneath it.


Each set of folds should lie flat and parallel on top of the rest of the bow, and each individual loop in a set should match the other loop with which it's paired.
The exact number of pairs will vary based on the width of the ribbon and on your personal aesthetic taste. Larger widths may only need two to three loop sets total, but smaller widths may need twice that amount to achieve a similarly fluffy bow.

, Carefully wrap a wire tie or piece of florist wire around the exact center of the bow to secure it.


Tie the wire as tightly as possible to maintain a fixed shape, then trim any excess wire using wire cutters.
You should also trim any excess burlap after tying off the center of the bow.

, Cut another length of burlap, then wrap it around the center to hide the wire.


The burlap used during this step will need to be narrower than the burlap used for the main body of the bow. You can use a different ribbon, or use the same type of ribbon and simply fold it before wrapping it.
Make sure that the center ribbon overlaps and ties at the back of the bow instead of the front.
Leave enough ribbon hanging down from the center to create ""tails"" beneath the bow.

, Twist and fluff the separate loops as needed to create the precise look you want.


Since burlap is such a thick material, it will usually retain its shape regardless of whether you use wired or free-form ribbon.

, Trim the ribbon tails to the desired length, keeping both tails equally long.


If desired, you can also cut ""v"" shaped notches into the ends to help prevent the burlap from unraveling over time.

, The burlap bow should now be finished. You can use it as its own decoration or use it to accent wreaths, vases, pillows, and more.

Cut seven strips of burlap.,
Loop both ends and staple them in the center.,
Repeat with most of the remaining strips.,
Crisscross two loops.,
Stack the remaining loops in pairs.,
Loop the final strip into a circle.,
Adhere the final loop to the center.,
Use as desired.",How to Make a Burlap Bow3," Select 1/2 to 3/4 inch (1.25 to 1.9 cm) wide burlap ribbon. Cut seven pieces of ribbon, creating three pairs of ribbon in progressively smaller lengths.


Two pieces should be 10 inches (25 cm) long, two should be 9 inches (23 cm) long, and two should be 8 inches (20 cm) long. The final piece should be 4 inches (10 cm) long and should not have its own match.

, Starting with one piece of burlap, fold the end of the strip so that it sits on top of the center of the piece. Fold the other end so that it overlaps the first at this center point.


With each fold, the top side of the end should meet the top side of the center, creating a pointed loop. The finished appearance should look like a figure-8.
Staple the center of the figure-8 to hold it together as you continue working.

, Repeat the folding and stapling process with the other 10 inch (25 cm) strip, both 9 inch (23 cm) strips, and both 8 inch (20 cm) strips.


Do not, however, loop the final 4 inch (10 cm) strip yet.

, Create and ""x"" shape from the two largest loops by laying one on top of the other, angling them in perpendicular directions.


Note that the narrow, pointed part of the loops should point downward when you stack them.
Hold the two pieces together by placing a small dab of hot glue in between them.

, Stack the remaining four loop pairs on top of the bottom set, working with one size at a time.


The loops of each evenly sized pair should form a perpendicular ""x"" shape with one another.
As you stack the loops on top of one another, try to fill in the gaps left by the previous set. Once you determine the best placement for a loop, hold it in place using hot glue.

, Bring the ends of the 4 inch (10 cm) strip together, forming a single circular loop.


Hold the ends together with a staple or a bead of hot glue.

, Place a bead of hot glue in the open center of your ribbon stack. Press the seam side of the final loop into the glue.


Once the glue dries, fluff and readjust the secure loops as needed. Some of the outer loops should slightly overlap the center loop.

, The burlap bow should be complete. You can use it to decorate gifts and other packages.

Have a theme in mind.,
Keep the person who is receiving the gift in mind.,
Keep the season and/or holiday in mind.,
Keep the occasion in mind.",How to Decorate a Gift Box1," Most parties and events will have a certain theme to them. If the party or even does not have a theme, you might want to come up with a theme for your gift. This can help you come up with ideas for decorating materials. For example:

If the party has a nautical theme, you might want to use shells, ropes, and sand.
If you want to go with a shabby-chic or vintage theme, you might want to use softer, faded colors (such as rose and ivory), velvet, and lace. Your designs might have lots of scrolls and roses in them.

, Is it a child? And adult? What are his or her interests? If the gift is for a young child, you might want to use lots of bright colors to appeal to his or her senses. If the gift is for a cat lover, you could always make the gift box cat themed., Is the gift for Valentines Day? Halloween? Is the occasion taking place during Spring or Fall? Sometimes, knowing the season or holiday can help you decide on what colors to use. For example:

If this is for a Valentine's Day gift, consider using pinks, reds, and whites.
If this is for a Halloween gift, consider using lots of black and orange.
If you are giving the gift during the spring time, consider using lighter colors, such as: pink, yellow, light blue, light green, or light purple. White is also a great spring color.
If you are giving the gift during fall, try to use earth tones, such as: gold, orange, red, or brown.

, Is the gift for a wedding, baby shower, or graduation party? The event itself may help you decide how to decorate the box. For example:

If the gift is for a wedding, take the wedding colors into consideration. Try to use those colors when decorating your gift box. For example, if the colors are red and gold, you could paint the box red and stencil designs onto it using gold paint.
If the gift is for a graduation party, you could use the school's colors in your gift box. You could also use common graduation party colors: black, silver/gold.
If the gift is for a baby shower, consider using blue for a baby boy and pink for a baby girl. If you know the theme of the baby shower, try to use that in your design.

, Use either clear tape or pretty seals to seal the folded paper edges and paper meeting line.

, Choose a lace that is large and has a well defined pattern.
Cut two lengths of thinner, less flamboyant lace. This will be aligned next to the larger lace lengths.

, This should be done in two stages:


Wrap the outer edge wider lace lengths first. Keep the lace edge still within the confines of the wrapping, don't overlap the package––leave space to undo it at the edges. Wrap right around the package and glue in place at the end. Trim off any excess.
Wrap the thinner lace lengths right next to the larger length. It is probable that the lace will look best if you let some of its edge sit slightly over the larger lengths already wrapped on, but you'll need to judge that as you add it. Wrap in place right around the package and glue at the end. Trim off any excess.

, The center will be covered by the fabric of your choice. Choose a pretty piece of scrap fabric that matches the lace well.


Cut the fabric piece wide enough to cover the remaining middle piece of the package.
Wrap around the package. Glue with single blobs at the wrap join only (it needs to be easy to remove if needed).

Add some simple designs onto the box using stamps, markers, or wrapping paper.,
Use a permanent marker or a paint pen to add writing or designs onto your box.,
Stamp designs onto the box using rubber stamps and an ink pad.,
Decorate the box with some stickers to mimic gift wrap.,
Consider painting your gift box.,
Apply some glitter or confetti to give your box a blast of glitter.,
Add a stripe of color with wrapping paper.",How to Decorate a Gift Box2," This section will give you a few, simple ideas on how to decorate your box. You don't have to use all of them. You can choose one or two that appeal to you the most or none at all.
, Permanent markers are cheaper and easier to sue, but paint pens are more opaque and will show up against patterns and dark colors. You can write simple messages, such as ""Happy Birthday"" or ""Love."" You can also draw random designs, such as hearts, spirals, and swirls. Here are some ideas:


If the gift box is for a birthday present, use bright colors (or the receiver's favorite colors). Write ""Happy Birthday"" all over the box. Consider drawing some balloons, tiny stars or confetti, and spirals.
If the box is for a holiday, use colors and symbols that match the holiday. For example, if the gift box is for Halloween, use orange and black for the colors. Draw some pumpkins, black cats, or bats.

, You can use regular rubber stamps and an ink pad. You can also cut your own stamps out of thin sponges and use tempera paint for the ink.

Try using different sized stamps. For example, use the larger stamps (such as trees) towards the bottom, and smaller stamps (such as stars) towards the top.
Consider using different colors of ink or paint.

, Most gift wrap has a set, repeating pattern. Your gift box doesn't have to have that; the stickers can be all random. If you want to mimic the look of gift wrap, however, arrange your stickers in a grid or checkered pattern (as opposed to randomly). Also, try to use only one or two shapes; this will make your gift box look interesting, but also refined. For example:

For a winter themed gift box, you can alternate large blue snowflakes with small silver snowflakes.
For a fall themed gift box, you could alternate red or gold leaves with orange pumpkins.
For a summer or spring themed gift box, you could alternate butterflies and flowers.

, Take the lid off first, and then paint each piece separately. You can use acrylic paint and apply it with a foam brush or a paint brush. You can also use spray paint. If you want to add more designs, wait for the paint to dry first, then paint on smaller designs using a thin paint brush. Here are some ideas:

For a winter themed box, paint the box a light blue first. Then, paint delicate snowflakes and snow swirls using white and silver paint.
For a birthday themed box, choose a cheerful color, such as yellow, for the base. Then, paint some birthday-related symbols, such as confetti, balloons, and cakes. Try to use bold colors, such as blue, red, and green.

, Spread a thin layer of Mod Podge over the side you want glittered. Then, sprinkle some glitter or sparkly confetti onto the box. You can use as much or as little as you want. If you want the entire box to be glittered, let the side you are working on first dry completely before moving onto the next.

To seal your work and make it last longer, wait for the glue to dry, then spray the entire box with a clear, glossy, acrylic spray. The spray must be glossy or your glitter will lose its sparkle.
You can also use spray adhesive instead of Mod Podge.

, Place your gift inside the box, and put the lid on. Cut a long strip of wrapping paper that is one third the width of your box; it needs to be long enough to wrap around your box. Place the strip on top of your box, and wrap it over the sides. Secure the ends of the wrapping paper strip to the bottom of the box with a piece of clear tape.Consider wrapping a piece of thin ribbon or twine around the box, and tying it in a bow on top. Make sure that the ribbon or twine is centered over the paper strip.
For a layered look, repeat the process, but with a slightly narrower piece of wrapping paper. Try to use a contrasting color or pattern.

Consider decorating the lid.,
Keep the occasion in mind.,
Glue colored ribbon around the sides of the lid.,
Add some embellishments to the ribbon.,
Consider layering paper cutouts if you are into scrapbooking.,
Glue down some scrapbooking embellishments onto the lid.,
Paint the lid with chalkboard paint, and write the person's name on the lid in chalk.,
Give the lid some texture.,
Keep kids and doodlers happy by taping some crayons to the lid of a blank box.",How to Decorate a Gift Box3," This section will give you a few ideas on how to decorate the lid of your box. You don't have to use all of these ideas. Instead, choose one or two that you like the best., Even if the rest of the box is plain, you can easily make it suitable for any occasion depending on what you put on top of it., Choose a ribbon that matches the height of your lid. Most list will be about an inch (2.54 centimeters) tall. You can also use rickrack or flat (non-ruffled) lace. Place some fabric glue around all four sides of the lid. Do not put any glue on top of the lid. Then, press the ribbon down onto the glue. Let the glue dry before doing anything else, such as placing a gift inside the box or tying a ribbon around the box.

If you want a layered look, glue a thinner ribbon right over the wider one. Just make sure that the thinner ribbon is centered over the wider ribbon.
Washi tape, scrapbook tape, or any other colored/patterned tape will work as well. Skip the glue, and just run the tape around all four sides of the lid.
This will also work great on round or hexagonal lids as well.

, After you have placed the gift inside the box and tied a ribbon, tuck some embellishments just behind the ribbon. Try to match the embellishments to the theme of the event. If necessary, secure the embellishment with hot glue or clear tape. For example, if the box is for a Christmas gift, you could do any of the following:

If the box has a blue or winter theme, loop a silver or white glittery snowflake around the ribbon.
If the box has a more rustic feel to it, snip a small branch off of your Christmas tree and tuck it behind the bow. You can also use a cinnamon stick instead.
If the box has a more traditional feel to it, you could tuck a small pine branch behind the bow, and add a tiny glass ornament; the ornament shouldn't be larger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) or so in diameter.
For a sweet tooth, you might want to stick a candy cane behind the bow. If you want to add a more festive touch, look a jingle bell ornament over the top of the candy cane.

, You will need several pieces of patterned and plain cardstock. They should be of a similar shape, but in different sizes. Use small, double-sided foam tape to attach the largest piece to the center of the lid. Then, use the tape to attach a slightly smaller piece on top of the large one. Keep stacking pieces until you get the look you want. Try not to use too many, however. Three or four should be plenty.

You can complete the look by outlining the shapes with some glitter glue, and stamping pretty designs into the corner of the box.
Try to use ornate paper cutouts with scalloped edges.

, You can find them in the sticker or scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. Find some colorful paper flowers, butterflies, and leaves in different sizes and glue them down in a small patch on the lid. Try to the largest shapes in the center of the patch, and the smaller designs on the sides. Give the patch an asymmetric shape to make it more interesting.

You don't need a lot of shapes to make this look beautiful, but you might want to use fewer large shapes and more of the smaller ones.
Consider working in odd numbers, instead of even. For example, you could have three large shapes, and five to seven smaller ones.

, This way, you won't have to mess around with labels. You can apply the paint on using a foam brush, or you can use chalkboard spray paint. Apply two to three coats, allowing each coat to dry before applying the next one. Let the paint to dry and cure according to the instructions on the can, then prime the chalkboard. You can do this by covering it allover with chalk, then wiping the chalk off., Find a large, paper doily that is the same width as your box lid. Glue the doily down onto the lid using some spray adhesive or Mod Podge. Let the glue dry, then wrap a pretty ribbon around your box., A blank box may be someone else's canvas. Take five or six crayons in basic colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple), and tape them side by side in a neat row in the corner of the lid. Write the words ""Color Me"" next to the crayons.You can also cut down some coloring book pages so that the fit each side of the box, and glue them to the box. Tape the crayons to the top corner of the box. This will give your little artist something to color once the event is over.

Use ribbons to your advantage.,
Layer the ribbons.,
Make a garland out of paper and string, and use that instead of ribbon.,
Make a garland out of twine and colorful buttons.,
Wrap a ribbon around the box and lid separately.,
Consider using other things instead of ribbon.,
Consider skipping the bow, and using something else instead.",How to Decorate a Gift Box4," This section will give you a few ideas on how to use ribbons to decorate your box. You don't have to use all of these ideas. Choose one or two that you like the best., Wrap a wide, ribbon around the gift box first, from bottom to top. Next, wrap a narrower ribbon around the wider one. Try to center the narrow ribbon as much as possible. You can tie the two together into a bow at the top of the box, or you can add a third, really narrow piece of ribbon.

If the ribbons slip around too much, secure them with short pieces of clear, double-sided tape. Do not use the thick, white, foam mounting tape you'd put on your wall. That is too thick and will create lumps in your ribbon.
Consider using contrasting colors for your ribbons that match your box. For example, if your box is white, you can use teal for the wide ribbon, and white for the narrower ribbon.
Consider mixing and matching patterns. You can use solid-colored ribbons, or you can use patterned ones. You can also use a solid-colored ribbon and a patterned one on top of it.
Consider mixing and matching textures. If you want a more vintage or shabby-chic look, consider using burlap for the bottom ribbon, and flat (non-ruffled) lace for the narrower ribbon. You can finish the layering off with a piece of twine or hemp cord.

, Get out a piece of yarn or cotton string that is long enough to wrap around your gift box a few times. Use a 1 inch (2.54 centimeter) or larger shaped hole punch (such as a heart of star) to punch shapes out of colorful paper. Super glue the shapes down onto the string. They can be as close together or as far apart as you want. Wait for the glue to dry, then wrap it around your gift box.You can buy large hole punches in interesting shapes (such as snowflakes, hearts, stars, and flowers) from arts and crafts shops. Look in the scrapbook supply section.

, Find some buttons that have two or four holes in them; the cheap, craft buttons that come in a bucket at great for this. Then, cut a piece of twine long enough to wrap around your box a few times. Weave the twine through the holes in the buttons until you have as many buttons as you want on your twine. Tie a knot at each of the twine, then tie the twine around your box like you would with a ribbon. This is great for a rustic gift of a baby shower. Here are some color ideas:

For a rustic gift, choose a brown piece of twine. Use buttons in random colors and sizes.
For a gift for a baby girl, use a pink piece of twine. You can use all pink buttons, or alternate pink and white buttons.
For a baby boy, use a light blue piece of twine. You can use all light blue buttons, or alternate them with white buttons.

, This will allow the receiver to pull the lid off without untying and ruining a beautifully-crafted bow. Create a cross shape with two pieces of ribbon, and set your box down onto the middle of it. Wrap each side of ribbon up over each side of the box, and tuck the excess ribbon inside the box. Secure the ribbon with a drop of glue. Repeat the process for the lid. Make the bow separately, and glue it on top of the box lid.

Hot glue or fabric glue will be the best for this. They dry the fastest.

, You can use twine, raffia, lace ribbon, or colorful yarn. You can even use 1 to 2 inch wide (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) pieces of calico fabric or fabric. Each will give your box a different unique look. You don't always have to tie a box up with ribbon., Wrap some ribbon or twine around your gift, but instead of tying it into a bow, tie it into a tight knot and snip the ends off. Glue a flat ornament, such as snowflake, a large paper flower, a large sea shell, or even a giant pompom over the knot."

",How to Decorate a Gift Box5," If you have a plain cardboard box with a lid, you can cover each piece with colorful paper. This way, the person just has to untie the ribbon and open the gift. Here's a list of what you'll need:

Gift box with a lid
Wrapping paper
Pencil and ruler
Scissors
Clear, double-sided tape
Clear, regular tape

, You can wrap both the lid and the box separately. You can also wrap just the lid or just the box. This will create an interesting contrast. These instructions will work for both the lid and the box.

, You need enough wrapping paper to wrap over the box. Make sure that the blank side of the wrapping paper is facing you., You can make a large X-shape going from corner to corner. You can also place a piece of tape along each, bottom edge of the box. Now the box won't slip while you are wrapping it.

The tape must be thin and clear. Do not use the thick, mounting tape you'd put on your wall. That is too thick and will create bumps.

, The wrapping paper should be wide enough so that you can fold each side up over the sides of the box, plus an additional inch or two. You will need that extra paper to tuck inside the box., Use a ruler to help you make the lines straight. These will be your cutting guidelines., Start at the corner of the paper and stop when you get to a box corner., There should be about an inch or two of wrapping paper inside the box on each side. These are your hems. Secure these hems with some regular, clear tape. The cut/angled sides of the wrapping paper will be touching the left and right sides of your box. This is fine.


Consider gluing the paper to the sides of the box with a glue stick. This will make it last even longer.

, Secure the hems with more clear tape as before. The cut/angled sides of the paper will be touching the top and bottom sides of your box. This is fine too; it will give the box a ""wrapped"" look., You can use the same color and pattern of wrapping paper, or a completely different one., If you want, you can tuck some matching tissue paper inside the box. This will help keep the gift inside safe. It may also make the box more fun to unwrap.,"

Gather your supplies.,
Place the stencil down onto the side of box.,
Pour the paint out onto a paint palette or a paper plate.,
Dip your brush into the paint and tap off the excess paint.,
Tap the brush onto the stencil.,
Let the paint dry before you remove the stencil and work on another side of the box.,
Let the paint dry completely before you put anything into the box.",How to Decorate a Gift Box6," Stenciling a gift box is a great way to add your personal, unique touch. Here's a list of what you will need:

Plain gift box
Stencils
Painter's tape or masking tape (optional)
Acrylic or tempera paint
Foam brush or stencil brush
Paint palette or paper plate
Paper weights, cups, stones, etc

, You will be stenciling one side of the box at a time. Some stencils are sticky on the back and will stick to the box on their own. If your stencil does not have a sticky back, you will need to put a piece of painter's tape or masking tape along each edge to hold it down.

If your box has a lid, then take the lid off, and stencil it separately.

, You can use acrylic paint or tempera paint. Acrylic paint will give you a nice, glossy finish. Tempera paint will give you a somewhat chalky or dusty finish, which can also be very nice.

You can also use glitter and glue instead if you want your design to be super glittery.
If you want your design to be only somewhat glittery, you glitter paint instead of regular paint., This will keep you from picking up too much paint. If you apply too much paint at once, the paint may slip under the stencil and cause smears and drips., Keep taping until the entire area is covered with paint. If the paint is too thin, apply a second, thin coat. It is better to layer many thin coats than slap on one thick coat., At this point, you can flip or rotate the box to make it easier to paint. Most paints should be dry to the touch within 5 to 20 minutes., Just because something looks dry does not mean that it is dry underneath. If you move your box too soon, you may risk smearing the paint. Most paints will be completely dry in 20 minutes to 2 hours, but you might want to check the label on the paint bottle just in case.

If you added glitter to your design, you might want to spray the box with a clear, acrylic sealer. Make sure that the spray is glossy, or your glitter will lose its sparkle.

Plain gift box
Solid colored or patterned paper
Scissors
Mod Podge or decoupage glue
Foam brush

, If your paper has designs on it, such as butterflies, flowers, or birds, then cut around the designs. If your paper is solid colored, you can cut your own shapes, such as hearts and stars., This will allow you to fix any mistakes. It will also allow you to experiment with different shapes and layering until you get the look you want. Once you put the paper down onto the Mod Podge, it will be difficult to move it without ruining it., You will be working on one side of the box at a time so that your work surface does not get all sticky.

If your box comes with a lid, take the lid off and work on it separately.

, You will be working in small areas at a time so that the Mod Podge does not dry out before you get to it.

If you can't find any Mod Podge or decoupage glue, you can make your own by mixing one part white school glue with one part water.

, You can place the shapes down individually, or overlap them to create new designs. For example, you can paste a flower shape down onto some leaf shapes. If you are overlapping shapes, be sure to coat the bottom shape with Mod Podge so that the top shape will stick.

, Once the glue dries, flip or rotate the box and continue decoupaging pieces of paper onto it., This will help seal in your work. You can use the same finish that you were using before (such as gloss, matte, or satin). You can also try using a glittery one for some extra sparkle., If you put the lid on too soon, it will get stuck to the box, and the receiver will have a hard time opening it."

Carry a thermos flask with hot chocolate or warm apple cider inside.,
Carry hand warmers.,
Bring along a blanket.,
Keep moving.,
Take the car.,
Stay indoors.,
Choose a costume that's both fun and warm.",How to Stay Warm During Halloween Night," Think ahead to what the weather is usually like where you live. If it's likely to be cold, always choose warmer costumes, such as furry animals, full-length sleeves and pants or layered effects. Some ideas for warmer costumes are listed in a section below.


If possible, choose a costume that allows for boots. That way, you can keep a good portion of your legs nice and snug.
Costumes with a hood are a good choice, as the hood will keep neck, head and face warm all at once.;
, Wear layers underneath and it will both fit and keep you nice and warm.


With a larger costume, you can even wear your normal clothes underneath, such as jeans and a sweater, then add the costume.

, Consider what you might be able to add to the costume without detracting from it. What would the character wear in cold weather? For example, an elf or a superhero might don a cloak, a fairy might wear longer sleeves or an animal might have grown a thicker fur coat for the colder season.


Add a cloak or cape in place of a jacket for a more elegant addition to the costume. If the costume's own cape is only thin, swap it out for a wool or polar fleece version.
Add tights, leggings or pantyhose for warm legs. These are often a very easy way to increase leg warmth without ruining a costume. Match the colors either to your legs (skin-colored) or to the costume.
Wear a skin-colored unitard. If your costume is skimpy and requires showing some skin, a unitard can keep you warm while still giving the appearance of skin. Check for it at dance supply stores. Simply wear it under your costume.
Wear a turtleneck sweater under the costume. This will add warmth to all of your upper body region, which helps best for keeping you warm.
Wear gloves or mittens. Match the color of the costume or choose skin-colored gloves or mittens.
Wear socks in a color that matches the costume, or simply ones that fit inside your shoes, enough to keep your feet warm.

, A wig can both improve the look of the costume and keep your head and ears warm.

, A mask will help to keep your face warm and you won't have to bother with adding makeup either.

, Slimline merino tops and pants or thermals can be placed underneath a costume to keep you warm. Choose the lengths of the sleeves and legs according to the costume; there are thermal shorts as well as short- or long-sleeved thermals.

, Regardless of what it looks like when you wear it, having it ready for when you really start to feel cold will allow you to stay out for longer and keep warm.


You could even wear the jacket between houses, then take it off when trick and treating, and pop it back on again when off to the next house.

, Have a hot sip now and then.


Be sure it is at a temperature suitable for safe sipping.

, You can purchase hand warmers at drugstore. They are usually snapped or bent to make them work; just follow the instructions. Keep them tucked in the pockets of your jacket or carry them in a bag and use them now and then to warm up your hands again.

, Wrap it around you whenever you feel coldest, for a quick warm up. By the end of the evening, you will probably find wearing it like a cape is preferable to freezing anyway.

, Walk briskly and do exercise. Keep up a cracking pace as you trick and treat, to increase your warmth. Try a few jumping jacks, lunges or other on-the-spot exercises to help you warm up. Constant movement should help to keep you warmer.


Your costume might not be suitable for jumping or doing strenuous exercise in; be cautious in case you rip or spoil it.

, Ask your parents to drive you around the different streets. Hop back in the car now and then to get a blast from the heater before you head off for a few more house visits.

, Have a fun indoor party for Halloween rather than going outside door-to-door.

, Here are some ideas for costumes that may be warmer to wear:


Mummy
Medieval clothes
Full length dress - queen, princess, bride, etc.
Ghost - one white bed sheet with eye holes and all your normal clothes on underneath
Clown
An object such as a cell phone, a Rubik's cube or a Lego block - one box with sweater and jumper
Any furry animal
Fruit or vegetable - food item for your body, with sweater and tights of the same color underneath
Care bears
Zombies in everyday clothes - just toss fake blood all over some warm thrift store clothes and add zombie makeup to your face
Santa or the Easter bunny
Ethnic costumes - many of these are modest, so they're ideal for keeping warm too
Gnome, dwarf or any other fantasy creature that always wears long sleeves and pants and a beard to go with it
The Michelin man
Any character that has ever worn a puffy jacket or vest (Marty McFly), a big warm coat (Dr. Who), or other really warm gear (check out your favorite snow and ice movies).

Have all your guests dress up as specific Saints, which they have a particular devotion, or even admiration for.
,Encourage your guests to write about his/her Saint, in advance, so that others may guess or try to figure out who they are.,For dinner, perhaps you can serve something really simple, such as soup.,For drinks offer cider, or fruit punch.,For dessert, offer soul cakes, donuts, or even apples.,
Later on, for a party snack, offer popcorn or nuts.",How to Prepare an All Saints Day Feast,",,,,, Soda drinks will be good too."
"
Make sure that costumes are health and visual approved.,
Use the buddy system at all times.,
Have rules for candy.,
Stay on sidewalks as much as possible.,
Be home at a certain time.",How to Observe Halloween Safety Month," Cut the eye holes big enough so that vision is fully clear and is not blocked. Makeup should be non-toxic or hypo-allergic. Be sure that the costume is not dragging or is past/longer than the ankles; tripping onto concrete or the road can turn the night around.;
, Kids should never go out trick or treating without an adult. Have an adult walk the kid to the door or wait in the driveway. Travel around other groups and walk to doors at the same time as other people. Insist teenagers to go with friends if they refuse to go out with family.

, Don't let kids eat their candy until they get home and you have inspected their gatherings. Ask them what they got and observe what kinds and brands of candy and items they have received.

, Cross the street with caution and when there's no cars present. Avoid jaywalking and find the nearest cross-path; this is the legal way to cross a major street and to avoid a vehicle accident.

, Use the house as the meeting grounds and not the park or shopping center. Have the adults set the guidelines and curfews.

Cook or eat.,
Start some crazy ones.,
Avoid doing specific things.,
Honor your traditions.,
Do what you do every Halloween.",How to Make Halloween Traditions," Do you eat anything special or cook anything creepy on Halloween? It's an easy tradition to keep, and can turn out delicious. Here are some ideas to get you started.


Attempt a Halloween Dinner poem. On each bite at dinner on Halloween, whisper, ""Halloween night is full of fright,"" and you will have good luck all Halloween.
Do some pumpkin seed baking! After carving the pumpkin, save as many seeds as possible and keep them in the refrigerator. On Halloween, cook them and salt them on cookie sheets.
Do a Lemon Morning. Every Halloween morning, before anything else is done, eat one single lemon with no water, keeping your Halloween both sour and sweet.;
, Crazy traditions can be wacky and fun to follow on each Halloween. Invent some, or use some of these:


Keep the orange devil out. Put an orange by the window and the devil will not come in, knowing Halloween is celebrated there and he is not wanted.
Know that your Aunt will know who to spare. Keep a key from one of your Aunt's houses and put it under the mat. Each trick-or-treater must step on it if they deserve any candy. If they do not, give no candy to them.
Don't say, ""red,"" ""rabbit,"" or ""calendar"" before 8:35 on Halloween.

, Sometimes, instead of doing specific things, don't do something. The five-year-old will love correcting you dramatically if you do something you shouldn't. It's a great and easy way to keep a simple tradition. Try this one, for example.


Never be selfish. Don't ever take more than ten pieces of candy, or the sugar will join and take over the household.

, It's part of having the traditions in the first place! Make sure to follow your rules and traditions every Halloween, but remember that if you slip, it's not the end of the world.


Have a list of rules you should follow on Halloween that your family or friends need to follow.

, Do you go trick-or-treating? Do you have a Halloween party? Consider those your own traditions. Keep doing this, and consider putting a little twist on them.


Try the candy corn ritual. Many kids trick-or-treat. This time, on every different place you go, whether it's each floor of the building you trick-or-treat in or the block you trick-or-treat on as well as live on, leave one candy corn on each stop along the way, leaving all the bad luck behind in each corn and leaving the rest of the candy delicious!
Get the candy and leave the bad luck behind. When the house gives you the candy, cross your fingers while they're handing it to you.

Measure the length around your head and add an inch to that measurement.,
If the foam is not long enough to reach the desired length, then cut more 4 inch (10.2 cm) high strips of foam and connect them together with tape or a needle and thread until you reach the desired length.

,
Put the foam strip around your head overlapping the ends so that it is comfortable for you.,
Cut the bottom from the shopping bag, also cut off any handles from the bag as well, leaving just a hollow tube.,
Stand the bag upward on end and place it inside the headband.,
Tape or stitch the bag to the headband along the top and bottom of the headband's rim.

,
To enclose the top of the hat.- Place the sheet of typing paper under the hat band and trace the outline of it.,
Insert the typing paper circle into the top of the hat and secure with either tape, staples or by stitching it.

,
Have fun trick or treating.

",How to Make a Halloween Chef's Hat," Cut a strip of fun foam to this length and 4 inches (10.2 cm) in height.;
,, Mark this spot and then either tape or stitch the strip together to form the headband of the hat.

, Begin making random accordion pleats that run from the top opening to the bottom opening approximately 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) apart around the entire circumference of the bag.

, Spread the bag out until it fills the inner rim of the headband.

,, Mark another line a half inch out from the your first traced line. Cut along this newly marked line. Fold the outer edges of the paper upward along the first traced line so that the edges of the circle are sticking straight up. Don't worry if the folded edge pleats.

Grab a big mixing bowl and a mixing spoon.,
Get as much cornflour/flour as you want to make your fake blood.,
Add enough water to make the mixture dribble- but not watery-consistency.

,
Add red food coloring or orange and pink.,
Mix everything together.,
Use as required.",How to Make Fake Blood With Cornflour,";
, (Cornflour and flour will both shrink in size when you add water, so use more than you think you need.)

,, Add only a drop at a time until you're happy with the final color.

, Mix until it is very smooth, without lumps. If the blood doesn't look realistic then add in some bicarbonate of soda (baking soda); it'll froth but let it settle and it will work!

, This will stain, so only wear with clothes you don't mind getting permanent red stains on. Done!

Inflate a balloon.,
Gather and create the materials needed for your papier mâché.,
Cover the balloon with papier mâché.,
Pop the balloon with a needle.,
Use scissors to cut the newspaper ball in half.,
Start cutting holes.,
Paint the mask.",How to Make a Papier Mâché Mask (for Kids)1," Avoid blowing it up too much or else it may pop. The size of the balloon will be the size of your mask. For smaller children, a smaller balloon will be easier to work with.


;
, It's fine if you just have newspaper, but it's even better if you have newspaper and a solid paper, like printer paper. Grab a whole bunch of sheets and some flour and water for your paste.





Rip the papers into strips or squares, depending on the size of your balloon. You'll need enough for at least three layers and whatever molding you may want to do.
Create a paste with 2 cups (220 g) flour and 1 cup (200 ml) water. If you don't have flour, you can use two parts white glue and 1 part water. Mix it well. The paste will be easiest to use if it's in a shallow tray or wide brimmed bowl.

, Dip a piece of paper into the paste and let the paper soak in the paste. Get the excess off the paper by scraping it along the side, if necessary. You may want to lay down extra newspaper to clean up the mess easily later.





The first layer should be placed vertically, the second horizontally, and so forth. Use the blank paper in between newspaper layers to make it easy to see where you've already gone.
If you'd like to mold on features, do so now. The beauty of papier mâché is that the strips can mold into virtually any shape. You can form eyebrows, cheekbones, or lips rather easily.
Leave it on the side to dry. Make sure that the paper is secured on the balloon or else your mask may come apart. This may take several hours.

, For safety reasons, be sure to pop it away from your face. You've now got the base of your mask!




, Depending on how much of the balloon you covered, you may end up with two separate masks, one large mask, or a mask that you want to shave down to size.





If you want a slightly different shape, by all means! Cut off a lower forehead, cut off the chin to be able to speak, or make any style choices you see fit.

, You'll want two for eyes, at least one for the nose, and possibly one for the mouth. If you're going to wear it, make sure the holes line up! In addition, poke two holes on the side to hold the band that will keep the mask on your face.





Push a rubber band (cut in half) through the holes and make a knot on each side. If you don't have a rubber band, you may use string, ribbon or a long piece of elastic.

, This is where your (or your child's) creativity really gets to shine. It's all up to you. And if paint isn't enough, add hair, googly eyes, glitter, or any other embellishment you have handy.





Let dry overnight. The last thing you want is a perfect mask that is ruined by touch. Come back to it the next day and marvel at your work.

Make the instant pudding as directed on the box.,
Refrigerate the mixture.,
Take the bowl out of the refrigerator.,
Serve in individual dessert dishes and garnish with black and red sprinkles.

",How to Make Vampire Blood Pudding," Place saran wrap on top of the bowl.;
, This will help it make it more creamy and ""pudding-like"" faster. This is also a great way to serve your finished product cold rather than at a room temperature.

, Before serving the pudding, stir in a few drops of red food coloring into the pudding. Mix thoroughly so the entire mixture turns red.

Start early.,
Make sure your camera is ready.,
Make up some 'business' cards.,
Consider using an online method for people to get their photos.,
Consider ahead of time if you will want to hand over the rights to each image completely to the people that the photographs are for, or if you might want to use them in some way.",How to Hand Out Photographs for Halloween," You don't want to decide to do this on October 31st or the day before. Plan on just how involved it is going to be and get ready. Some things that you could do early are:


Get some bales of hay (for using for the photographs). You might try looking online or at a feed store.
Check out second hand stores for linen and things that you can use as backdrops and backgrounds.
Make sure you have a good tripod. You might have to move around a bit and you don't want to have a clunky tripod that is going to break down on you.;
,


Make sure that the batteries are all charged up and handy.
Format your camera so that all of the pictures will be where you expect them to be. They should be numbered as they come out and you want them to be in order. That will make them easier to find for any individual if you only save them on your hard drive.
If you are shooting digital, rehearse the night before and/or shoot RAW. Have the correct white balance, or know what white balance to use (dusk vs porch lights vs flash, etc).

, Even though you might not be doing a 'business thing', the business card will give people a way to contact you and find out how to obtain the pictures from you.

, Most people today are online and this will allow them to do a lot of things that you can't do very easily with the photos. This also should allow you to be able to set up a password protected account for people to access. This is very important because you will be taking photographs of children mostly. Some places that you can use are:


Mpix
Snapfish

Photobucket

Services like these are good to use because a lot of them provide a way for the person to use the image in any way they want. To make Christmas cards, gifts, and many other things.



, If you do, be sure to get their permission first. Unless you are a professional photographer, you probably don't need to worry about the image rights.

If you are at home giving out candy, give just a piece or two to each kid.",How to Have an Old Fashioned Halloween," Find out how people celebrated it during the olden days and see if you can implement those thoughts into your Halloween.;
, Though demons, monsters, and intricate designs out of pumpkins are popular in the modern world, a simple carved face is traditional. Save the seeds of the pumpkin.

, If you don't use too much fat or salt, they're not only good for you but also very tasty!

, Send out invitations on pumpkins cut from construction paper. Let everyone know they're invited to an old fashioned Halloween party! Keep the decorations simple, paper cut outs on the walls of things like witches and black cats would be preferable to all out thrashing mannequins. Play games like bobbing for apples and offer your guests the treats you made in the last step. You could carve jack-o-lantern, but only if everyone there is old enough to use knives.

, Not extremely graphic stories, just simply, traditional, stories. Be sure to read the story behind the Jack-o-Lantern too!

, Popcorn balls, Candy Apples, and pumpkin baked goods are good, traditional, choices. Drink plenty of hot apple cider with whatever you make!

, Think witches and wizards, vampires and angels, not movie characters and politicians.

, Do this with old clothes you don't want anymore, cardboard boxes, garbage bags, duct tape, and whatever other spare material you have around. If you absolutely must, visit a thrift store and pick up a piece or two to help you along. But don't buy the costume, even at a thrift store! Use a pillowcase or brown paper bag for trick or treating.

, Though these days it's common to see people trick or treating well into adult hood, for a traditional Halloween it's no one over 13.

, People didn't used to drive their children to fifteen different neighbourhoods to get them enough candy to last three years. It was done on foot, only in the immediate neighbourhood.

,, Many people give each kid a huge handful of candy, but not for an old fashioned Halloween. Don't feel bad about it. You aren't obligated to give them anything, they should appreciate what you do give.

Clean out a gallon jug.,
Prepare your papier mâché materials.,
Start covering your jug.,
Start decorating.",How to Make a Papier Mâché Mask (for Kids)2," It must have a handle as this will be used for the nose. Make sure it's clean! You don't want any old milk stench wafting around.





Cut it in half, keeping the handle in tact. That means you'll be cutting it in half the long way.
Cut out holes for the eyes and mouth, as big or as small as you'd like. Also cut holes near the ears to be used to attach the headband later on.

, You'll need enough strips (about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide and 6 inches (15 cm) long) of newspaper and printer paper to cover at least three layers. Grab some flour and water and you're set.





You'll need two layers of newspaper and one of printer paper -- the printer paper is best for the top layer. The pieces don't have to be perfect, so just rip them yourself.
Whisk two cups (220 g) of flour and 1 cup (200 ml) of water in a bowl to make your paste. Add a bit more of either if it's too runny or too thick. Lay down newspapers now before the mess accumulates!

You can use white glue thinned out with water, if that's more accessible.



, One by one, grab a strip of newspaper, dip it in the mixture, shake off any excess, and lay it on your jug. Start horizontally for the first layer -- then switch to vertically for your second. Don't cover the holes!





Let the first layer dry completely before you start your second. Do this with each layer.
Once you're done with all your newspaper layers, start molding features (also with newspaper). You can make ears, cheekbones, eyebrows, mustaches -- anything you can imagine.
When you're done with the features, papier mâché the last layer (vertically) from your torn computer paper. The white paper gives you a blank canvas to start creating. Allow it to completely dry before you go any further.

, This is the fun part! The sky is the limit here. Use whatever you have in the craft closet or the kitchen to complete your mask's look.





Use ribbon, feathers, faux hair, pipe cleaners, or even macaroni if it floats your boat. Let it dry and then your children can go off and start their adventure.
Attach a ribbon, string or rubber band through the holes near the ears to create a headband, if the mask is to be worn.

Locate allergy-friendly homes.,
Insist that your child takes an emergency treatment for allergies everywhere.,
Remind your child not to eat candy while trick-or-treating.,
Trade your child an allergen-free candy as you go.,
Give homeowners allergen-free candies ahead of time.,
Communicate with treat givers.",How to Help Kids with Food Allergies Enjoy Halloween1," The Teal Pumpkin Project (TPP) has an online map of homes that offer alternative Halloween treats. These treats will be free of common allergens, and your child is more likely to find something they enjoy when visiting these homes.You can visit the TPP database at http://www.foodallergy.org/teal-pumpkin-project/fever-map#.WBZfAfkrKUl.
Some homes might also place a teal pumpkin or teal jack-o-lantern outside their home to indicate they offer treats that are amenable to kids with common food allergies.;
, If your child has severe food allergies, he/she should always have two auto-injectors filled with epinephrine (such as EpiPen). If your child accidentally consumes a treat to which they are allergic, and has an anaphylactic reaction, you’ll be able to treat them immediately.Younger children, especially, might not understand how their food allergy works and how serious the effects of their allergy can be. This is why it is so important for an adult who knows how to use an EpiPen to be with your child at all times. You can also use the opportunity of Halloween to get them in the habit of taking their food allergies more seriously.
Watch your child carefully while they are trick-or-treating and ensure they do not consume foods to which they are allergic.

, If your child waits until they are home, you will be better able to sort through the candy with them and determine what is and is not appropriate. Offer reminders to wait until consuming the candy throughout the night. Preface your reminder with a friendly question like, “What did you get from that house?” After your child replies, say, “Oh, you will enjoy eating that later” if the treat is edible or “Oh, we can trade something good for that later” if the treat is inedible.These reminders will keep your child aware of the fact that they need to refrain from snacking on the candy until they get home.

, The easiest way to ensure your child still gets a boatload of sweet treats after Halloween is to trade them a “safe” treat for an “unsafe” one after they complete their Halloween rounds. But if your child is especially impatient or fussy, you might want to make a trade on the spot.Pack a large variety bag of allergen-free treats and accompany your child on their trick-or-treating.
After your child receives candy from a given house, help them check the ingredients list. (Make sure to bring a flashlight so you can see!) If it contains an allergen that they cannot consume, swap it out for one from the bag you packed.
Remind your child that they should still not consume their candy while trick-or-treating. Not only will this cut into trick-or-treating time, but it’s important to double check the candy after coming home to ensure candies with allergens didn’t accidentally end up in your child’s loot.

, With younger children who you are accompanying on their trick-or-treating, you could give the treat distributors an allergen-free candy or treat and ask them to them to pass it to your child. With slightly older kids, or kids who you are not personally accompanying on their Halloween rounds, you could connect with treat distributors in advance of the holiday and provide a handful of treats specifically meant for your child.Be sure neighbors know your child and their costume if you intend to leave a special allergen-free snack or treat with them.

, If you’re going trick-or-treating with your child, you should tell the people distributing treats that your child has a food allergy. They might be able to locate a treat free of the allergens which affect your child. If you are not accompanying your child, hang a small label around your child’s neck reading, “Hello, I have an allergy to . Please provide me with treats free of this ingredient.” That way, treat distributors will know not to give your child foods that they are allergic to.You can make a simple label by punching a hole in either end of a notecard and tying a string through either end.
Keep in mind that because so many candy products are manufactured in facilities that are not free of common food allergens, many people won't have candy available that is allergen-free (and they may not even know how to check), so it is still very important to check every piece of candy your child receives after trick-or-treating.

Focus on fiber.,
Pick a whole grain base.,
Include plenty of veggies.,
Supplement your meal with a healthy protein.",How to Plan a Pre‐Candy Halloween Meal1," Fiber is one of the most important aspects of a healthy meal. Not only does it fill your family up, it will keep everyone feeling full for longer. Perhaps most importantly on Halloween night: fiber slows the absorption of other nutrients, including sugar. In turn, fiber will help prevent the unhealthy spikes in blood sugar and insulin that are likely to follow an active night of trick-or-treating.Plan the meal so that each portion contains at least 5 grams of fiber.
The best way to do this is design a meal based on whole grains and vegetables. Fruits are a good source too, but also contain lots of sugar - which nobody needs on Halloween.;
, Basing the meal on whole grains is ideal. The fiber to calorie and sugar ratios are especially good, and your options are still wide open. Simply prominently feature whole grains on their own, whole grain bread, or whole grain noodles.An especially easy option is sandwiches on whole grain bread. Put out hummus, lettuce, tomato, and avocado and let everyone make their own. If you’re making the sandwiches ahead of time, add some skeleton eyes and teeth with toothpicks and black olive pieces.
If unable to work whole grains into the entree, put some whole grain rolls or crackers on the table to supplement the meal.

, Another vital component of a healthy, low-sugar meal is lots of vegetables. In fact, you can make an almost all-veggie meal by making veggie kabobs. Mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, zucchini, pea pods, and even broccoli are all great raw or grilled.Skewers over a fire pit just before trick-treating is sure to lead to some happy Halloween memories before the sugar even hits. The kids will likely even build their own meals.
A veggie snack is another good way to refuel kids too, if there’s a lag between eating dinner and going out to hunt for candy. Cut up the most colorful veggies you can find - bell peppers and purple carrots are great - with hummus or guacamole to dip them in.

, Lean meat, such as chicken, or a vegetable protein such as tofu can be added to most meals to help everyone feel full for even longer.Another particularly good addition or base for meal is quinoa, which is the whole grain with the highest amount of protein. Use it in almost any dish instead of rice.

Make the paper maché paste.,
Tear some newspaper strips.,
Obtain a Venetian mask template.,
Cut holes in the corners of the mask.,
Cover your mask template in paper maché strips.,
Cut out the eye and string holes.,
Apply two more layers of newspaper strips.,
Let the mask dry.,
Cover the mask in gesso.,
Paint the mask with acrylic paint.,
Garnish with feathers and sequins.,
Attach string or elastic to your mask.",How to Make a Venetian Mask," The process is incredibly simple and requires items you probably have laying around your house already.Put two tablespoons of white flour into a bowl and add about lukewarm water slowly.
Begin with just under one cup of water, stirring with a fork, whisk, or kitchen mixer to get the lumps out and ensure an even texture.
Keep adding water little by little until you reach the consistency you desire.
It should have a smooth texture: not runny, but not thick like dough.;
, You will cover the mask form with newspaper strips to give yourself a nice surface to decorate. Keep in mind that glossy paper from magazines and coupon mailers won’t work very well, so find actual newspaper.


Cut the newspaper into long strips about 1 inch in width.
You’ll need to layer the mask about three times, so make a lot of newspaper strips.
The length of the strips doesn’t matter as much as the width, but extremely long strips the length of an actual newspaper page will be unwieldy and messy when soaked in paper maché paste.

, You can purchase Venetian mask molds inexpensively at craft stores or online. If you have access to a printer, you can simply find a template for Venetian masks online and transfer it to cardboard using iron-on transfer film.


Load your inkjet printer with the transfer film.
Print the template image onto the transfer film.
Peel off the plastic cover and press the template image against a piece of cardboard.
Use an iron to apply heat to the back of the transfer film for 20 seconds or so (follow the instructions that come with your specific brand of transfer film.)
Slowly peel back the film to reveal the transferred image on the cardboard
Use an exacto knife to carefully cut along the borders of the template to create a cardboard mold of the mask.
Make sure to cut out the eye holes as well.

, You need holes in the corners of the mask so you can insert string or elastic to hold the mask onto your face. Use a hole puncher or a sharp object like an exacto knife or scissor blade to create the holes.

, This process can be very messy, so you may want to do this outdoors, weather permitting. If you’re working indoors, spread newspaper over the surface you’re using to protect it from the paper maché paste, which will drip everywhere.


Dip a strip of newspaper into the paper maché paste so it’s completely soaked from end to end.
Run your fingers along the length of the strip to remove excess paste.
Layer it over the Venetian mask template, making sure to smooth out bumps and wrinkles.
Repeat this process with your newspaper strips until you have completely covered the template.

, While the newspaper strips are still fairly wet, use your exacto knife to locate and cut out the two eye holes from the template and two string holes you created. If you wait until you’ve completed the entire paper maché process to do this, you may have trouble locating the holes, so you want to do this step for each layer of newspaper strip you apply.

, Layer the strips in different directions — horizontal, vertical, and diagonal — in order to achieve an even, natural effect.


Remember to cut out the eye and string holes from time to time, so you don’t lose track of where they are.

, When you’ve created at least three layers of paper maché over your mask template, you’re ready to let the project harden.


Put the mask somewhere it won’t be disturbed and let it air dry for about a day.
You can put it in the refrigerator to speed up the hardening process.
When it’s completely hard and dry, you’re ready to decorate your mask.

, Gesso is a paint primer that will prepare your newspaper surface for the smooth application of acrylic paint. Use a clean paint brush to coat the mask entirely in gesso, then set the mask aside to dry.


Gesso can be purchased in any craft or art supply store.

, If you want to use a single color on your mask, go ahead and paint the entire surface. However, if you plan to have a design with multiple colors, draw your design onto the mask using a pencil first. Painting in the lines will result in a more professional finish than trying to free-paint.


You may need to apply multiple layers to create an opaque surface of paint. Let the paint dry in between layer applications.
Let the paint dry completely before moving on to the next step.

, Once your paint is completely dry, use a hot glue gun to attach sequins and feathers to your mask, if you wish. You can make the entire mask sparkle, or you can create a pattern of sequins that leaves a lot of painted surface revealed. Attaching a single large feather to one corner of the mask is a common decoration for Venetian masks.


Be careful when using a hot glue gun, as the glue will burn your skin if you touch it before it’s cooled down.

, When you’ve finished decorating your mask, insert either string or elastic through the two holes you created in the corners to keep it on your face. Elastic will work much better than regular string.


Insert the string or elastic through one hole and tie it into place using a sturdy knot.
Place the other end of the string through the other hole, but don’t tie a knot yet.
Place the mask on your face, with the string going around the back of your head.
Pull the loose end of the string tight to see how tight the string should be to hole the mask up against your face.
Mark where on the string it should be tied to the other string hole, and tie the second knot there after removing the mask from your face.

Read all the labels.,
Separate the candy.,
Give your child the snacks they are not allergic to.,
Trade the rest of your kid’s candy for an alternative.",How to Help Kids with Food Allergies Enjoy Halloween2," Depending on the severity of the allergy, your child could become sick or even die if they eat a food they are allergic to. Therefore, it is important to monitor what they eat. You can best do this by examining their collection of Halloween treats at the end of the night. Look at the back of each snack for a small printed section that lists all the ingredients. Identify snacks that they can and cannot eat.If there is no ingredients label on the food, consider it unsafe for your child.Be wary of cross-contamination as well. Check the labels for information about the facility that the treat was produced in to determine if it is safe for your child to eat.

, As you’re reading the labels, separate the candy into two large bowls or baskets. One bowl can hold candies and snacks your child cannot eat. The other bowl or basket should hold the remaining snacks and treats (the ones that are safe for your child to consume), With your child’s Halloween snacks divided into two bowls, hold onto the bowl with snacks your child is allergic to. Do not allow your child to consume these treats. Return the other treats to your child and encourage them to consume a few in moderate amounts.Too many sweet goods can give your child a stomach ache and contribute to poor dental health. Limit their candy intake.

, Depending on your child’s food allergy, it’s possible that most of the candy your child receives will be inedible due to their condition. To prevent your child from being disappointed about being unable to enjoy their candy collection, obtain candies that your child is not allergic to and trade them to your child in exchange for the candies and treats they are allergic to. Alternatively, offer your child the opportunity to trade their candy in for several small toys (or one big toy).You could also invite your child’s peers to the candy trade to allow your child access to other allergen-free treats and sweets. Even kids who don’t have food allergies might enjoy the opportunity to trade candies they dislike for others they prefer.
The size and cost of the toy you provide your child in exchange for the candy is up to you. Negotiate with your child about what they want and find a toy that is both affordable for you, appropriate in relation to the amount of trick-or-treating your child did, and of interest to your child.
Distribute the candy you received from your child to other children who do not have food allergies, or snack on it yourself. Whatever you choose to do, keep it out of your child’s reach.

Offer toys.,
Pass out alternative treats.,
Place a teal pumpkin on your porch.",How to Help Kids with Food Allergies Enjoy Halloween3," Halloween treats aren’t limited to candies and snacks. Kids also enjoy getting small toys and trinkets. For instance, you could offer spider rings, vampire rings, stickers, bouncy balls, or whistles.Many kids appreciate getting neat school supplies, too. Have some mini notepads, pencils, crayons, or markers available for trick-or-treaters with food allergies.

, If you offer just one candy for Halloween, or several treats that all have an ingredient (or ingredients) that are commonly associated with allergies, a child with food allergies will be unable to enjoy the snacks you provide. Try to have at least one treat that is free of the most common allergens (nuts, soy, wheat, eggs, fish, shellfish, and dairy).Kids love apple slices, bananas, and other fruits.
Other sweets and candies that you might consider offering include bubble gum, licorice, and gum drops.
Check the Safe Snack Guide at http://snacksafely.com/snacklist-20161030.pdf for a list of snacks free of various allergens.
Post a sign in your window to explain that if a child has allergies, they can ask you for a special alternative.

, The teal pumpkin is a universal symbol of an allergy-friendly trick-or-treat opportunity. You should also register your house on the Teal Pumpkin Project’s online map of homes that offer alternative Halloween treats. Visit the TPP database at http://www.foodallergy.org/teal-pumpkin-project/fever-map#.WBZfAfkrKUl.If you don’t have a porch, place your teal pumpkin on the stairs leading to your home, or in a window where it will be visible to trick-or-treaters.
Decorative teal pumpkins are available from many arts and crafts stores, or you could paint a regular pumpkin teal.

Visit a corn maze.,
Take your child to a haunted house.,
Host a Halloween party.,
Look for Halloween activities in your area.",How to Help Kids with Food Allergies Enjoy Halloween4," A corn maze is a path carved through tall fields of corn. The corn reaches a height above which most people, and certainly most children, cannot see. Escaping the corn maze is a fun challenge and a non-traditional Halloween adventure. Your food-allergic child and their friends will have a great time navigating the corn maze., Kid-friendly haunted houses are a great way to spend Halloween. Instruct your child to invite a friend, or group of friends. They can still dress up and admire each other’s costumes, but instead of going trick-or-treating, they will get to visit the haunted house for some spooky chills and thrills., A Halloween party gives your kid the chance to enjoy Halloween in the comfort of their own home. With you (and, if you choose, other parents) controlling the food, your child will definitely avoid foods to which they are allergic. Your party could feature any number of fun activities for your child and their friends, including:Reading a scary story.
Watching a scary or Halloween-themed movie.
Knocking about a piñata filled with allergen-free treats.
Coloring pictures of ghosts, witches, and monsters.

, Many municipalities offer special Halloween activities that have nothing to do with trick-or-treating or eating food which may or may not cause an allergic reaction in your child. Check your community calendar for Halloween-themed events including:Zoo tours.
Artistic events.
Haunted museums.
Plays or dramatic performances.

Make a veggie-centric pasta.,
Make a bean-based chili.,
Cook pot pies with the kids.",How to Plan a Pre‐Candy Halloween Meal2," Whole grain pasta with a vegetable tomato sauce can be an easy, healthy, and especially filling Halloween meal. Look for a low-sugar, low-sodium tomato sauce, and add plenty of onions, mushrooms, and peppers.Grilling the peppers skin-side down, then peeling the skin off and slicing the pepper’s flesh into thin, finger-like strips can make for some worm-like surprises.
There’s even white whole grain pasta if anyone in the family needs to be fooled.
Fennel, garlic, and chilies are great seasoning options. As you mix these and the vegetables into the tomato sauce and begin to heat it, remove a few spoonfuls to add back in once the sauce has thickened, along with some fresh basil.

, Soups and chili with lots of beans and veggies are another great source of fiber. Black or kidney beans are especially filling and nutritious. Peas, green beans, sliced carrots, and fresh tomatoes are great veggie add-ins.You can get away with a bit of extra lean ground chuck to add protein and flavor. This will not only fill everyone up, it’ll keep them energized for trick-or-treating as well.Cut a small hole into some miniature onions and squeeze individual peas into them. Float a few of these edible eyeballs on the chili’s surface.

, Chicken pot pies can be a warm, filling, and fun Halloween meal. Get a rotisserie chicken, remove the skin, and shred the meat. Gather the veggies you’ll use as well - carrots and peas will go especially well.Specifics are up to you, especially in terms of the crust. You could always purchase a pre-made crust, or bake your own. An especially easy option is baking individual crusts in a muffin tin, and topping the biscuit-like crusts with a chicken and veggie gravy.
Use a bunch of turmeric to turn gravy or filling into a spooky orange goo.
Remember to use whole grain flour if baking anything yourself, and low-sodium chicken broth for gravy or filling.

Always pick dark chocolate.,
Savor those sweet and sour hard candies.,
Count the candy pieces.",How to Plan a Pre‐Candy Halloween Meal3," Fortunately, not all candy will wreck a healthy-eating plan or lead to a sugar crash. Dark chocolate, for instance, actually has health benefits, when eaten in moderation.Whenever you’ve got the option, go dark. Since it’s often more flavorful, it can do a better job of satisfying that candy craving, too.
In particular, dark chocolate covered fruit can both satisfy your sweet tooth, as well as the parts of your brain that tell you you’re sated.

, Another way to nip a candy craving right in the bud is by having a Jolly Rancher, or another hard candy. The main benefit here is that you’ll be consuming less calories and sugars than other candies, and since they take longer to melt in your mouth, you’ll likely wind up eating less candy., Chances are, you’ll find yourself (and your kiddos) chewing a few different candies before the night is through. This is totally fine, if you can keep it under control. One of the best ways to do so is share in your child’s excitement with them. Lay down on the floor and help them sort their candy when you get.


This will also help you ensure that only safe items got into their stash.
Tell them beforehand that they’re allowed to have a certain number of pieces tonight by saying something like, “Nice haul Timmy! I know you’re probably pretty excited. As you sort, think about which three pieces you want to eat tonight and which you want to save for other days.”
Set a limit for yourself too, by deciding early in the evening and reminding yourself throughout the night with thoughts like, “Alright, I’m only eating three pieces tonight. Is this one of them?”
If anybody protests, ask them how many pieces they’ve already eaten. Chances are, they got a head start.

Paint and add details.",How to Make Halloween Masks," You will need several types of supplies to make your own mask, but you can always use these supplies to make additional masks. These are available online or at large crafting stores.


You will need an oil based clay to sculpt the mask.You will also need a form to sculpt your mask on top of such as a Styrofoam mannequin head.You will need a material called industrial gypsum in order to make a mold of the sculpture.You will need some burlap to make your mold 3-D.
Select a good quality brand of liquid latex for your mask. You will need a casting latex specifically formulated for mask making, called RD-407.You can also purchase paints or decorations such as fake fur, sequins, or feathers to put on the mask. This will depend on what final look you are hoping to achieve.;
, Your clay will become more pliable for sculpting if you warm it a bit first. Place a few blocks of plasticine clay in the oven at a low temperature (150°-200° F) for 15 to 20 minutes.


The clay should be very pliable and warm, but not hot to the touch.
Do not allow the clay to liquify.

, To sculpt the mask, you will need the form to stay immobile. You can secure the styrofoam mannequin head to a solid wooden base such as a 12' x 12' piece of plywood.


Attach the head with duct tape until it is secure.

, You should use a thick enough layer of clay that you don't have to worry about it thinning as you sculpt.


You can use your hands, sculpting tools, or tools from around the house (like a butter knife or putty knife) to sculpt details including skin textures and exaggerated features.
Smooth the surface of the clay with lighter fluid and a small flat paint brush. When you are satisfied with your creation, move on to the next step.
It may take you several hours or even days to create the look you are going for.

, In order to transfer the clay sculpture to a latex mask, you need a two-piece mold made out of industrial gypsum, which is porous so that the latex can soak into it as you make the mask in the next step.


Your mold will be a reversed 3-D copy of the sculpture you made in the previous step.

, First, cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) square pieces of burlap. Set burlap aside and build a clay wall around sculpture starting at bottom below right ear, and working over the head to the left ear.


This wall will create a separation for a two piece mold.
Mix the plaster in a plastic bucket, and spread an even coat of plaster over clay sculpture, making sure to get plaster into all the recesses of the sculpture.

, After the first coat of plaster is set, mix a new batch, and apply the burlap and plaster mixture to strengthen the mold.


After the plaster is set, remove the clay wall.

, Use a bright colored acrylic paint, which will help you separate the pieces later.


After the paint dries, create the second half of the mold in the same way as the first.
When the second half of the mold is set, slowly pry the two halves apart. Use a butter knife, working very carefully along the visible seam made by the acrylic paint so you do not crack your mold. Once the two halves are separated, remove the clay and the Styrofoam head.

, Using a good amount of latex, pour it into the mold making sure to rotate the mold in your hands to get the liquid latex into all the recesses and work out air bubbles.


A small brush may help you work the latex into deeper parts of your mold.

, Catch this latex in a clean bucket and put it back in the container to save it for the additional coats.


Rotate the mold 90 degrees every 5 minutes, so that the latex is evenly distributed to the back, front, and sides of the mold.
This will help prevent the latex from pooling up, and becoming too thick in one spot.
A hair dryer on the lowest heat setting aimed inside of the mold will speed up the drying process. With a hair dryer, it should only take an hour or so for the layer to dry.
Repeat this process until you have built up at least six layers.
If you live in a dry climate, allow a day for the latex to air-cure. In a more humid climate, allow 48 hours.

, After the latex is cured, and before removal, dust the inside of the mask with talcum powder. Then, carefully peel the neck away from the mold and add talcum powder between the latex and the plaster mold.


The talcum will fall into place as you peel the mold from the plaster keeping it from sticking to itself. After you have removed your mask, trim away excess latex to clean up the edges. Be sure to use a knife to cut away holes for the mask wearer's eyes.

, Mix small amounts of acrylic paint with latex in small containers (cap these when not in use). The colors will appear much lighter when wet (for example, when dry a light pink will become a blood red).


Experiment with these latex-acrylic paints until you get the look that you want.
After the mask is painted, attach hair cut from an old wig, feathers, sequins, or other elements. You can glue these in place with tinted latex. Be creative, and have fun!

Preserve the colors.",How to Make a Paper Mask," Cardstock is going to be the best material to use for your paper mask, but you can also use heavy cardboard or even a sturdy paper plate.Choose any color you’d like and decide what shape you want.;
, Decide what shape best fits the occasion and draw it on the cardstock.To make your mask symmetrical, fold your paper in half and draw half of the mask. Place it up to the window and trace the shape on the other half of your paper. You can also cut out the half-shape while your mask is still folded, just be sure that the center is along the fold or you'll end up with two separate halves.

, To make sure the eye holes are in the right place, first hold the mask in front of your face, then use a pencil to make a small mark on the area in front of your eyes. You can then draw the eyes around the mark. Do the same for the mouth if making a full-face mask.

, Use an X-Acto knife or a razor blade to cut out two holes for the eyes. If you’ve decided to make a full-face mask, cut out the mouth hole as well.If you don't have an X-Acto knife or a razor blade - or if there isn't an adult present - you can cut them out with scissors. Just fold the mask across where you want to cut the eye and cut a small hole. You can then insert your scissors through the hole to cut out the remaining shape of the eye.
Don’t cut out your full mask yet. Leave the extra paper around the shape in case you find that you want a larger one while you’re decorating.

, Now that you have the shape of your mask, design its base color. You can use any medium that you wish to make your design, but paint, markers and crayons work best. You can make it a solid color or add designs such as stripes, stars, polka dots or even scars.Chalk and pastels can rub off and get into your eyes, while markers with heavy scents or fumes can irritate your eyes and nose.

, Once you’ve finished your base layer of color, put your additions onto your paper mask. Use white craft glue to attach them to your mask because it is water based and less likely to aggravate your skin or eyes. Craft glue is also flexible when dry, so your mask will still be able to form around your face.Be careful that your chosen decorations are not too heavy or too numerous. Too many additions will weigh down the paper and make it difficult for the mask to maintain its form. Too much added weight will also make it difficult for the mask to stay in place over your face.

, Before doing anything else with your mask, let it dry completely. If possible, leave it overnight. If you continue before letting the glue or paint dry, you will likely ruin your mask before you ever get to wear it., Now that you’ve decorated your mask, use scissors, an X-Acto knife or a razor blade to cut out the shape. Be careful not to cut off any of the feathers or additions that you’ve attached. Bend the paper if you need to make it easier for cutting with scissors.

, Get two pieces of ribbon, each about a foot long. If you don’t like ribbon, use some heavy-duty string to create the tie for to wear your mask.


Glue the ends of your ribbon to the inside of your mask. Start the ribbon just outside the eyes and glue it from here to the edge of your mask.
If you have a hole punch, you can also punch holes in the area between the eyes and the edge of your mask. Then slip the ribbon through the hole and tie it in snug loop.
Stapling your ribbon is not a safe choice. It could come loose and scratch your eye.
Once you've attached the ribbon or string, pull it around your head and tie it in the back to wear your mask.

, If you wish to hold your mask to your face rather than tying it around your head, you can use a chopstick or a dowel to make a handle. Glue the handle onto the back of the mask. White glue will hold well, as long as it is applied generously.You can keep your handle plain or you can decorate it with paint or markers before you attach it to your mask.

, If you want your mask to last through many wears, it is very important that you keep it dry. Because it is made of paper, if you get it wet, it will easily tear.


If you’re going to be wearing your mask in a very hot and humid environment, and you’re afraid you might sweat on your mask, glue plastic wrap or line the inside of your mask with scotch tape to prevent the sweat from being soaked up by your mask.

, When you take your mask off, try not to put it somewhere that will make it easy for it to be squished. Place it on a shelf rather than in a drawer.

, Dust can easily ruin your mask, especially if you have glitter or feathers glued onto it. If you plan to keep your mask around for an extended amount of time, make sure it is covered. If you want to use it as a decoration, a shadow box frame is a great way to keep it clean while on display., To prevent your design from wiping or wearing off, just spray your mask with aerosol hairspray and let it dry."

string
scissors
wire
duct tape
ribbon
trim material such as feathers or faux fur
embellishments such as plastic spiders, buttons, or bows;
, Take your string and hold the end at the corner of your craft foam. Then, extend the string several inches with your pencil in hand. Use the string and your pencil to trace the bottom of the cone. You can make the cone as tall as you would like it to be.








When you have finished tracing the curved line for your cone bottom, use your scissors to cut along this line. When you are done, you should have a triangular piece of craft foam with a circular bottom.
You can also use an Exacto knife to get more precise edges as you cut out your craft foam, but it is not necessary., Next, cut a piece of wire that is slightly shorter than the tallest part of your cone. You can measure the cone from the base to the tip to see how long to make your wire piece or just hold the wire against the cone and make the cut.







, Lay your piece of wire onto the center part of the cone shape, as if you are dividing the cone in half with the wire. One end of the wire should be at the pointy end of the cone and the other end should be at the base. Then, take a piece of duct tape that is longer than the wire and apply it over the wire lengthwise.








Make sure that there is a little space between the end of the wire and the edge of the cone when you tape it down. Otherwise, the wire may poke through the top of the hat or poke you in the head when you are wearing it.
Trim off any excess duct tape after you have secured the wire to the cone. There should not be any duct tape going over the edge of the craft foam.

, You will need to apply a couple of pieces of duct tape to the edge of the hat to secure the edges and form your cone. Take a piece of duct tape and secure it to the flat edge of the cone and then apply another piece over that one so that it overlaps a bit.








Then, fold over the other edge of the cone and press the duct tape in place to secure the edges.
Make sure that the wire and the duct tape are on the inside of the cone when you secure the edges.

, To create the hat brim, you will need to lay out another piece of craft foam and hold a piece of string in the center. Then, holding your pencil and the other end of the string in the other hand, draw a circle. This circle will be the brim for the cone shape, so make sure that it is large enough.








After you have measured the brim, cut along the edges of the circle you have traced. Try to cut along the line as evenly as possible because any jagged edges will show.

, When you have finished cutting out your brim, lay it out on the table again and use a heat gum or blow dryer to flatten out any curved edges.If your brim is already pretty flat, then you do not need to worry about flattening it more.








You can also lay a couple of heavy books on the craft foam and leave them on for a few hours or overnight to flatten out the brim piece.

, Next, fold the brim piece in half so that the edges are even. Make a cut in the center of the brim piece and then move outwards. Keep cutting until you have created a small circle in the center of the brim piece. Then, cut four slits in the inner edges of the brim piece to add some more flexibility.








Keep in mind that the inner circle will need to be large enough to fit over your head, but not larger than your head or it may be too loose.

, Try the brim on your head before you move on to make sure that it is a good fit. If it feels to snug, then you can adjust it. If it is too loose, then you will need to create a new brim with a new piece of craft foam.







, Before you attached the cone to the brim, you can cover up the cone seam with a piece of black ribbon. Use your hot glue to secure the ribbon to the cone.








Make sure that your glue gun is completely heated before you begin gluing ribbon to the cone.Hold the glue gun close to the foam as you apply the hot glue. Otherwise, the glue may dry partially before you have secured the ribbon to the cone., You will also need to use hot glue to attach the cone to the hat brim. To glue the brim to the cone, apply hot glue to the base of the cone and press the cone into the hat brim.








Make sure that the cone is centered over the hat brim as you secure it with hot glue.
If you want to embellish your hat, you can also apply some feathers or faux fur to the area where the cone meets the brim. Just use your hot glue gun to secure your embellishments to the base of the cone., After you have completed your hat and the glue is dry, you can shape the cone how you would like it to look by bending it slightly. The wire inside of the cone will allow you to create a bent or crushed shape to the cone of your hat.








Try bending the cone in two or three places to give it a worn look.

, You can also enhance your witch’s hat with other types of items, such as plastic spiders, a bow, or some buttons. Choose items that will compliment your costume.








Apply any embellishments to your witch’s hat with a dab of hot glue.

Buy a dark blue or gray jumpsuit.,
Drape yourself in loose, dark clothes.,
Lace up a pair of black boots.,
Strap on a movie-accurate hockey mask.,
Wield a fake machete.",How to Dress up As Jason Voorhees1," Jason’s hulking frame is usually clad in a dingy, soiled jumpsuit. Find a one-piece jumpsuit or pair of coveralls like mechanics wear. Go with a darker hue, like charcoal gray or navy blue, and buy about one size too big to get the right disheveled look. This is the easiest way to take care of the body portion of the costume.Jumpsuits and coveralls can typically be bought cheap in the work clothing sections at superstores like Walmart.;
, In some of the later films, Jason’s look evolved to include tattered black clothing and an oversized brown jacket. Snag a black button-down work shirt a basic pair of black trousers and rough them up yourself at home. Look for a loose-fitting brown coat to wear over the shirt. You won’t win any style points, but you’ll have the cheerleaders fleeing for their lives.Be on the lookout for cheap secondhand clothing to use for your costume.
Try to find a jacket made from a softer material like cotton so that it will better show the wear-and-tear you inflict on it.

, Jason needs sturdy set of footwear for stomping after terrified campers. Find yourself a pair of chunky black work boots made of leather, canvas or some other heavy material. If you desire, slather them with mud or fake blood to make them look old and used. These will complete the effect of your costume from top to bottom.Visit a thrift store to get an appropriate pair of old boots that won’t run you too much money.
If you can’t find the right pair, some black rubberized rain boots will do the trick, since they’ll mostly be hidden by your pant legs anyway.

, This is the feature Jason Voorhees is universally known for. The hockey mask you choose should be yellowed or slightly off-white and have red triangles on the forehead or under the eyeholes. Smear some black and brown makeup on the mask or dirty it up outside to make it look like it’s followed you to the grave and back.Since the hockey mask is one of the most important elements of the costume, you should be willing to devote a little more time, money and attention to making sure it’s just right.
Most Halloween costume stores sell masks that are designed to resemble the ones worn in the Friday the 13th series.

, Without his trusty machete, Jason would just be a lumbering mouth-breather with questionable fashion sense. Do the costume justice by purchasing a plastic costume machete and using it to terrorize your friends. A little dab of fake blood will make it look ominously like it’s been recently used.Never carry around a real machete or any other dangerous weapon or tool. You or someone around you could easily get hurt.

Buy fake nails and dental wax.,
Cut the nails into a triangle shape.,
File the nails to a sharp edge.,
Put a dab of denture glue onto the back of the tooth.",How to Make Vampire Fangs1," Choose a fake nail color as close to your own teeth color as possible. Fake nails and dental wax are both sold at some drug stores. Denture wax or dental grip will also work.;
, Use a pair of scissors to cut a nail into a triangle shape. Hold the nail over your teeth to get a rough idea of how large the triangle should be.

, Using a nail file, file each fake nail into a sharp tooth shape. File over newspaper to catch all of the debris that falls as you file.

, Gently apply it direct to your tooth. Hold the fake nail in place on top of the glue for about 5 minutes to allow it to set. Repeat for the other fang.


Not all drug stores stock this. Try ordering it online, or asking your dentist.

Gather a small group of trustworthy friends.,
Edit the rules for your liking.,
Get a list with all the players on it stating if they are a zombie or human.,
The game ends when... 1.,
Most people will want to kill zombies than be one, so find a system where a group of players (first dead or last dead) are the next zombies.

",How to Play a City Wide Zombie Game," You (If you want to) and your friends are the game 'mods' or the game runners- you manage all the people that play.;
, The main rules for the game are:


The game starts with a number of zombies. (1 zombie for every 5 humans is good).
Each player is given a way of showing when they are playing, and what are they. (bandannas on the head for humans and on the arm for zombies).
humans are given (or they get themselves) weapons. These may be Nerf guns, paper guns, or prop guns (make sure it can't hurt somebody, like airsoft guns).
An infection time from getting tagged (It could be instant)
when zombies get hit (with a prop gun just say 'boom') they 'die' for a certain amount of time, then keep playing.
'Defense' battles have a group of people that must survive by killing an entire hoard (a group of zombies). Zombies don't revive until the end of the battle.

, Once a human turns into a zombie, somebody needs to tell the 'mods' somehow.

, There is only one human left 2. When the nuke hits or the army comes (a time limit)

Get a cheap pair of denim overalls.,
Wear a plaid shirt underneath.,
Slip your feet into a pair of brown work boots.,
Hide your face with a pillow case.,
Carry a prop axe or pickaxe.",How to Dress up As Jason Voorhees2," In Jason’s first appearance as an adult in Friday the 13th Part 2, his clothing style hadn’t quite developed beyond “hillbilly chic” yet. Capture the backwoods brutality of his original costume with pair of dark blue overalls. This will you the creepy overgrown child aesthetic you’re looking for and take care of the biggest part of the costume, leaving you to only have to worry about a few other pieces.Overalls are another no-frills item of clothing that are inexpensive and can be found in many places.

, To complement the country theme started by the overalls, deck yourself out in a plaid button-down shirt underneath. The shirt Jason wore in the movie was a faded blue-brown pattern, so find something as close to this color combination as you can. Try on the shirt and overalls alone and you’ll already be guaranteed to scare yourself a little.Don’t worry if you can’t find a shirt exactly like the one used in the movie. Just about any rustic-looking pattern will work when the rest of the costume is assembled.
Dirty the shirt up a little before you wear it to go out.

, Earth tones are the theme of Jason’s costume in Friday the 13th Part 2, and his boots are no exception. Dig up a used pair of heavy-duty brown work boots in your size, the older and more rugged the better. If you can’t find the right pair of brown boots, it’s okay to use black, gray or another dark neutral color. Just make sure they look like they’ve seen their share of moonlit treks through the woods., It’s nothing personal—Jason is just a little shy when it comes to showing his face. Before he stumbled upon the hockey mask that would come to define his image, he kept his features concealed with a dingy old pillow case with one eye hole cut out. Fortunately, this part of the costume is extremely easy to replicate. For best results, use a different pillowcase than the one you plan to lug your Halloween candy around in later.To make an eye hole for visibility, put the pillowcase on over your head, mark where your left eye is with a pencil and then use scissors to carefully cut out the eye hole.
If you want to be especially accurate, keep the pillow case secured around your neck using a little rope or butcher’s twine.

, For his first foray into bloodshed, Jason used various farming tools for hacking, slashing and poking, having not yet discovered the versatility and ease of transport of the hardware store machete. See if you can find a prop version of a wood cutting axe or miner-style pickaxe to reflect this. Once you’ve got your hands on one of Jason’s signature improvised weapons, you’ll feel ready to make make-believe mincemeat out of some rude teenagers.Do not carry actual weapons or farming implements for your costume. You might accidentally put an eye out!

Distress your costume for a more authentic look.,
Suit up with some of Jason’s other accessories.,
Wear a grotesque mask underneath the hockey mask or pillow case.,
Wrap yourself in fake chains.",How to Dress up As Jason Voorhees3," There are no laundry facilities in the woods surrounding Camp Crystal Lake. If you want to really sell the costume, distress them artificially until they look more like Jason’s from the movies. Wash the garments multiple times to soften them up, then bury them in the ground, drag them behind a car or cut them up strategically with scissors to achieve a convincing appearance. The more ragged your clothes are, the more fright you’ll inspire!Buy used clothing at thrift stores or consignment shops for a bargain so that you can tear them up without feeling like you’re throwing money away.
Go over different sections of the clothing with a steel brush or coarse-grained sandpaper to make it look naturally frayed., Jason was ready for anything, and you should be too. Though his look changed subtly from film to film, certain accessories could almost always be found. A pair of thick yellow work gloves, for instance, a utility belt with pouches or a sheath for a hunting knife can make the difference between a generic Jason costume and a more detailed one.These accessories will look best when paired with a basic jumpsuit, echoing Jason’s formative look in Friday the 13th Parts 4-6., At the end of every Friday the 13th flick comes the big reveal when Jason’s mask comes off and the hideous face that lies beneath is exposed. Mimic these shocking scenes by wearing a mask underneath your hockey mask or pillowcase that gives you a stomach-turning, disfigured appearance. You can even find deluxe compound Halloween masks that layer detachable hockey masks over Jason’s ugly mug.Try to find a thin rubber mask that wears comfortably and will allow the hockey mask or pillowcase to fit over it easily.
If you don’t want to bother with wearing two separate masks, just slip on a bald cap under the hockey mask so that your own hair isn’t visible., Jason’s one true fear is water, and he once nearly met his fate while chained to a boulder at the bottom of Crystal Lake. For a little bonus detail, try winding a length of fake chains around your body and let the world know that it can’t keep you down. You can find plastic chain props at most Halloween costume suppliers, or you may be able to find some cheap chains made from real metal for a more realistic clink while you lurch about threatening hippies.Small touches like this are a great way to win favor with horror movie aficionados.

Find a white plastic straw.,
Cut off a small portion.,
Fold the piece and trim it into fangs.,
Cut the fangs in half and wear them.",How to Make Vampire Fangs2," Ideally, the color should match your teeth, but whitening toothpaste or other methods can blend most teeth in with a bright white, plastic straw.


This method is quick and easy, and the fangs are easily removed and reattached.

, If your straw is a bendy straw, cut off the top portion, right above the accordion bend. Otherwise, cut off about 2 inches (5 centimeters) with a pair of scissors. Or, stick the end of the straw over your tooth and look in a mirror to measure twice as long a piece as you need., Fold the cut-off piece of straw in half. Use the pair of scissors to trim to the two sides into fang shapes. Leave them attached while you trim them, so you can compare the shapes and keep them symmetrical.


Don't cut too close to the fold. That area of the straw will go over your tooth, and needs to be kept intact or the fang could fall apart.

, Cut the piece of straw in half along the fold, separating it into two fangs. Slip these onto your canines, or onto the incisors directly to either side of your large front teeth.

Gather supplies.,
Create a mouth-guard from a paper cup.,
Mix alginate molding material and move it into the mouth guard.,
Press your upper teeth into the alginate.,
Mix two-part plastic or other casting material.,
Pour the plastic into your negative mold.,
Sculpt the fangs onto the model.,
Soak the model in soapy water.,
Make a second alginate impression.,
Remove the clay fangs and wipe the model with petroleum jelly.,
Mix together nail acrylic.,
Pour the acrylic into the fang holes of the alginate mold.,
Press your tooth cast into the mold and let the acrylic harden.,
Remove the acrylic fangs and slip them on.",How to Make Vampire Fangs3," This method gives you realistic vampire fangs that fit your teeth, but it requires much more time and money. Here's a list of the materials you'll need to track down:


Alginate, available from dental supply stores and some art supply stores. (Online vendors are your best bet.)
A paper cup or mouth guard.
Plastic casting resin, or another casting material. This is available at hobby shops, or some art supply stores.
Sculpting clay and a small tool to shape it, from an art supply store.
Nail acrylic (in two-part powder and liquid form), from stores that sell beauty supplies (also available as dental acrylic)Petroleum jelly (Vaseline), from a drugstore

, Trim off the top portion of a paper cup using clean scissors. The remaining base should be only slightly taller than the height of your upper jaw. Cut off one side of the cup to make an opening that can slip into your mouth.


Skip this step if you have a real mouth-guard on hand or decide to buy a real mouth-guard.

, Read the instructions on your alginate product for more specific instructions, since the exact time and method can vary by brand. In most cases, you'll combine one part alginate and one part water in a small dish, mixing the two materials together with any utensil. Transfer the alginate mixture to your mouth-guard when done.


You will need to work fairly quickly when using the alginate portion of this method. An alginate mold will begin to crack and break apart within hours.

, Gently press the alginate-filled mouth-guard into your upper teeth. Remove it by pulling straight down after 3 minutes. You should be left with an alginate negative of your teeth when done. This will be used as a mold for the next portion of the procedure. If there are bubbles or broken pieces interfering with the outline of the teeth you want to turn into fangs, repeat this step.Do not push the mouth-guard so far up that your teeth go through the bottom.
Wait until the alginate becomes solid before removing it.
If you want a more accurate way of determining when the alginate is ready to remove, place a small dot of it on your finger and watch for it to turn solid.

, You can use any sturdy casting material for this method, but this method will give instructions for two-part plastic resin. Combine 3 oz (90 ml) of one liquid with 3 oz (90 ml) of the other liquid in a glass or plastic dish. Stir it together using a heavy-duty stirring rod or kitchen utensil.


Choose a two-part cast plastic that dries hard and comes together quickly. Make sure that the plastic will be non-toxic when dried.

, Immediately after the two liquids are combined, carefully pour the plastic solution into your alginate mold. Pour slowly to avoid trapping air bubbles in the cast. Let dry before attempting to remove it.


Within several minutes of being combined, the plastic should become very hot and turn white. Do not touch it with your bare skin.
After the plastic is dry and cool to the touch, wait an additional 10 minutes before removing it from the mold. This gives the inside plenty of time to dry, ensuring that your plastic teeth will be solid once removed.

, Remove the plastic model of your teeth once you are sure it's dry. Add a blob of casting clay over the model where you want to create fangs, and use a small, sharp tool to shape it into the desired shape.


Optionally, add a small ""cap"" of clay over the teeth directly behind the fangs, to make them more stable., Add dish soap to a bowl of water, and soak the model and its clay fangs under the water level for ten minutes. This will prevent the alginate in the next step from sticking to the clay., Use the alginate as before to make a negative mold. But this time, use the plastic resin model with attached fangs instead of your real teeth. Press softly to avoid dislodging the fangs, and lift it slowly out once the alginate mold is ready. Inspect the alginate to make sure there are no bubbles or broken pieces.

, Pull off the clay fangs. Use a cotton swab to wipe petroleum jelly (Vaseline) along the plastic model in a thin smear, avoiding leaving lumps of jelly anywhere on the model. The jelly will make it easy to remove the acrylic fangs once they've set., Combine the nail acrylic powder with the accompanying liquid and mix thoroughly using a disposable utensil and mixing cup, not anything you want to reuse. Continue mixing for several minutes until the turns into a paste. When you lift the utensil, it should drag up a string of acrylic. Add more powder if it is too runny, or more liquid if it is too hard.The acrylic becomes hot as it mixes. Avoid direct contact with your skin.
Mix the acrylic in a well-ventilated area.

, Slowly pour the acrylic paste into the holes left by the clay fangs, on your new alginate mold. Pour it slowly in to avoid leaving air bubbles, and stop pouring once the fangs are filled, or mostly filled.

, Gently push your ordinary tooth cast, without the clay fangs, into the alginate mold. The teeth of the mold should push into the acrylic, and the acrylic will harden around them, adopting the shape of your tooth. You can watch the leftover acrylic in your mixing bowl to gauge how much the acrylic has hardened. Gently remove the cast when the acrylic is mostly hard, but still a little rubbery. It should keep its shape, but still be relatively easy to slip off the cast.

, Theoretically, each fang should be so custom-fit to the tooth it slips over that you should be able to gently press them into place by applying pressure with your index finger while sucking each fang in using your mouth.


If the fangs do not stay in place on their own, however, you can hold them in place using denture glue, braces wax, or a small dot of gum.

Make vampire fangs from cotton balls.,
Create vampire fangs using cotton swabs.,
Form vampire fangs from non-toxic clay.,
Work around your braces by using braces wax.,
Cut fangs from a white plastic bottle.",How to Make Vampire Fangs4," Wet cotton balls can be trimmed to size, shaped, and stuck to your upper teeth in order to form quick fangs.

, Trim the cotton portion off the swabs and attach the remaining sticks to your teeth using nail glue.

, Form the clay into a pointed cone or ""fang"" shape and fit it to your tooth for a custom fit. Let the clay harden before using the fangs as part of a costume.

, If you have braces but still want to make vampire fangs, you can so so easily be forming braces wax into the shape of a fang and lodging it in between your canine teeth and the braces wire.



Combine the wax with clay for a more realistic look.

, As long as the plastic has not touched anything toxic, you can cut out a pair of fangs from the bottle and attach them to your teeth.

Break off the two middle tines of the fork.,
Cut off the handle.,
Stick dental wax along the bridge of the fangs.,
Attach the fangs to your upper front teeth.",How to Make Vampire Fangs5," Use your fingers to gently bend the two middle tines or “teeth” of a white plastic fork forward until they snap at the base.


If the tines do not break off at the base, use a clean pair of sharp scissors or a clean utility knife to shave off any remaining plastic.
Instead of snapping the tines off by hand, you could also remove them by directly cutting off the entire tine with a pair of scissors or utility knife.

, Use scissors or a clean utility knife to cut away the handle of the fork in a straight horizontal line.


You will actually end up cutting away more than just the handle. Trim the fork roughly halfway in between the handle and the base of the tines, right at the spot where the fork begins to curve.
The remaining piece should be fairly boxy rather than being rounded.
Make sure that the scissors or utility knife you use is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before using it since the plastic will need to go in your mouth after coming into contact with your cutting tool.

, Stick a small dot of braces wax or denture wax to the horizontal bridge of the remaining piece. You can buy dental wax from some drug stores, or from dentist supply stores online.


Apply the wax to the portion that curves “in.” This part was originally the front of the fork.

, Stick the makeshift fangs onto your front teeth with the wax pointed in. Press gently to secure the wax and the plastic teeth.


Make sure that the fangs are centered at the front of your mouth. You should be able to see an even amount of your two front teeth in between the fangs when done.

Gather your supplies.,
Find the right size nails for your fangs.,
Use a scissor or nail clipper to cut the nails into fang shapes.,
File down any rough edges.,
Place a small amount of denture adhesive on the back of the nail.,
Press the fangs onto your tooth.,
Wait a few minutes to make sure the glue holds.",How to Make Easy Vampire Fangs1," This method involves a few cheap items you should be able to find in any drugstore or department store. You will need the following:


A box of fake white fingernails. Make sure the box has several different sizes of nails, so when you make your fangs you can find a good fit for your teeth.
Denture adhesive. This should be available at any drugstore in the oral care aisle. Common denture glues are Polygrip and Fixodent. Make sure the denture glue is clear or white. A colored glue will show through the fangs when they are on your teeth, and you could end up with green or red vampire fangs.Nail clippers or a pair of scissors. You'll need these to cut the nails, so either will work. Whichever you use, make sure it is sharp, otherwise you won't be able to get a clean cut through the nails.
Nail file. You will need this after cutting the nails to take care of any jagged edges left behind, so you don't cut your mouth.;
, The nail should be roughly the size of your canine teeth, which are the most common place for vampire fangs. To find the canines, look for the two pointy teeth, third from the front. Don't worry if you can't find a nail that perfectly fits. You can cut it to size later when you make the fangs.

, The particular style here is up to you. Some prefer long, slender fangs, while others prefer a more curved fang. If you're stumped, it helps for you to model your fangs on a particular character you like.


This is also where you can cut the nails down to size if they were too big for your teeth.

, After you cut, inspect the fangs for jagged edges left behind. Smooth them out with the nail file so you don't cut your mouth while wearing your fangs., Just a drop should do- if you use too much the glue will spill out from behind the fang when you press it onto your tooth.

, Hold your finger there for about a minute to give the glue a chance to stick. Then repeat this for your other fang.

, Try talking and moving your lips around. The fangs may wiggle a bit but shouldn't fall off. If they come lose, don't worry. Just try again with a little more glue."

Purchase a set of white fake nails.,
Pick out the nails that fit your canine teeth.,
File them to a point.,
Stick them on with a bit of denture adhesive.",How to Make Quick Vampire Fangs1," The more they match the natural color of your teeth, the better. You could paint them, but it'll taste funny and might come off with your saliva. If you can't find white, aim for something that's a light flesh color.


A standard set from the drugstore will suffice -- no need to get fancy here! You're only using two of them anyway.





;
, Your pack will come with nails that are all different sizes, so pick out the nails that naturally fit your canine teeth -- those are the ones that are already kind of pointy. Certain people will even be able to snap on the fake nails over their teeth. Can you get them to stick without holding?


If you'd like, you can also put them on over your lateral incisors (those are the teeth to the right and left of your two front teeth). For some people, this is more visible and still looks okay.







, You can use nail clippers if you're running out of time or feeling impatient, but a file is best. You can make them as pointy as you like, as long or short as you like, just make sure that the two match!

, You don't need very much at all -- just a drop. Any color works, but you'll obviously be better off with adhesive that's white or clear.



Do not use nail glue. Or super glue. Or any other kind of glue, for that matter. Not only is it toxic, but you'll be left with fake nails glued to your teeth that you can't get off.






This work just fine for talking and careful drinking, but try to avoid eating too much with them in. You don't want to end up swallowing your nails!

Sew the symbol to the front of your mask.,
Wear the mask.",How to Make a Zelo Mask1," Start with a rectangle that reaches from your nose to the back of your jaw, and from the bridge of your nose down to your chin.You are only making one side for right now. You'll be cutting two identical shapes, then sewing them together.;
, Cut the left side edge an outward curve. Next, cut from the top-left corner at a downward angle towards the right for about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters), then cut straight across towards the right side edge., Trace the template twice first, then cut the shapes out with sharp scissors. Use stiff felt, if possible, about 3 millimeters thick.You can also use light blue vinyl instead.You can also use light blue jersey fabric, but be aware that it won't hold its shape as well.

, Place the two pieces together so that the right sides are facing in. Sew along the left side edge (the one with the bigger curve) from top to bottom. You can do this by hand or on a sewing machine. Use a matching thread color and a 1/4-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.

Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.

, Turn the mask so that the front is facing you. Load an embroidery needle with black embroider thread, then sew a series of X's down the front seam, from top to bottom. This will give your mask a rustic, hand-sewn feel.Even though you are going for a rustic feel, try to be as neat as possible.

, Cut the ribbon down so that it is the same length as the entire top edge. Fold it over the top edge, sandwiching it inside, then sew the sides of the ribbon down. It's best if you do this by hand; this way, you can be sure that you sew through both sides of the ribbon.Repeat this for the bottom edge.
Alternatively, you can topstitch the top and bottom edges instead. Use black thread and a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance., Turn the mask so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both the left and right side edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Secure them with sewing pins.

If you made your mask from vinyl, do not use sewing pins, or they will leave marks. Use clips instead.

, Try to use the same color of thread as your felt. Sew about ⅛ inch (0.32 centimeters) from the inside folded edge, and remember to backstitch at the stat and end of your sewing. This will create the channels for your elastic., They need to be about three times the height of your folded edge. Make sure that the elastic is thin enough to fit through the channels you made., Take your first piece of elastic, and thread it through the left channel. Tie the ends of the elastic into a knot, then slide the knot into the channel, out of sight.Repeat this step for the other elastic and the right side of the mask.
The elastics need to be long enough to hook over your ears.

, It looks like black circle with a line going through it, sort of like the non-smoking sign. The symbol needs to be almost the same height as your mask; the top and bottom edges need to be just inside your ribbon border or topstitching.

If you are using vinyl, then use black vinyl instead., Start by sewing around the outside edge of the circle, then sew around the two inside edges. You can also glue the symbol on using hot glue, tacky glue, or fabric glue.

If you used vinyl, hot glue or fabric glue will work the best.

, Hold the mask over your face. Slip the left elastic over you left ear, and the right elastic over your right."

Scissors
Denture glue
A plastic fork. This should be white unless you want to experiment with different colors.

, Measure about halfway between where the handle ends and the tines begin. Using the scissors, cut straight across the fork along this halfway line. You should be left with a roughly rectangular piece.

, Position your scissor between the middle two points of the fork and cut. You should be left with two sections, each with two tines.

, You should now have two pieces, both with a long point and a rectangular base.

, You'll want your fangs to curve in, not out. To do this, make sure you apply the glue to what was originally the front of the fork.

, Hold it there for about a minute to make sure the glue sticks. Repeat this for the other fang.


Since the fork tines will stick out of your mouth, you may not be able to put them on your canines. If they don't fit there, you can stick them to your incisors. These are directly next to your front teeth.

, Try talking and moving your lips around. With the fork method, your fangs will stick out of your mouth, so talking may be more difficult. If they fall off, just try again with a little more glue."

Place your new fangs on your teeth.",How to Make Easy Vampire Fangs3," With the straw method, you'll just need a pair of scissors and a white plastic straw.

, Measure how long the piece should be by fitting the straw over your canine or incisor. Then look in the mirror and see how much straw you'll need for a fang. Then cut off double that amount so you have enough for two fangs., The folding helps ensure that you get a symmetrical pair of fangs.

, This will separate the straw into two symmetrical fangs.

, If your canines are too big for the fangs to fit, you can also place them on your incisors. "

, Mold the wax to look like a fang. How big and outrageous are you going for? Make sure to keep it manageable so you can still talk!

, You want to make sure it is situated in your mouth correctly. If you don't, it'll feel unstable and you'll be unable to close your mouth without jostling it. You want to be able to talk!

, This allows the wax to have a stronger hold on your tooth. The last thing you want is it moving around, falling out, or keeping you from talking without a lisp.


Becauthe vampireth that talk like thith are not scary. You want to be thcary!

, Then start freaking everyone out, eyeing their necks and all. Just try to avoid eating too much around them -- the façade might break if you're chomping on popcorn and your fangs pop off.

Cut off the tip of a straw right before the part that bends.,
Fold it in half and cut the open ends to a point.,
Pull them apart and cut off one side.,
Put them over your canines.",How to Make Quick Vampire Fangs3," You could use a non-bendy straw, but the bendy kinds top portion is just the right size. Don't have one of those? Cut off a portion of your straw that's about 2 inches (5 cm) in length.


Obviously, you want a white straw. Red stripes could be blood, but only the dimmest of bulbs will be fooled.







, Force it to fold in half, forming a crease, and then cut each end to a point. You can make it super pointy and long or you can make it more subtle. How steep of an angle do you want to go for?


Do this for both halves of the straw on both the top and bottom.







, They should be weakened enough that the two come apart with just a bit of tugging. You now have two fang-like caps for your teeth. Instead of leaving the front and back, cut off one fang on each, leaving a band to wrap around your teeth.


If you left both sides, you'd be able to see two different fangs on each tooth. This way, the fang will stay on with the band of straw that wraps behind and the fang will only stick out the front.







, Those are the teeth that already come to a point almost naturally. You could put them over other teeth if you really felt like it, but that might not get the vampire point across.


These aren't super sturdy. You'll be able to talk and drink (ideally with a straw), and if you eat, try to eat at the back of your mouth. The benefit of these, however, is that they're super easy to take out and put right back in!

, Fold the mask in half lengthwise, and make a mark along edge side edge where the fold is. Unfold the mask, then fold it in half widthwise. Make another mark along the top of the folded edge. Unfold the mask when you are done.

You will have three marks: a mark along the top-center of the mask, and a mark on each side edge.
Make sure that you are making the marks on the same side of the felt.

, Cut straight down from the top-center mark to the side-left mark. Repeat this step for the right side. You will have something that looks like a house., Fold the mask in half so that the narrow side edges match up again. Cut a > shaped notch into the side edge. Start at the bottom corner and finish at the top, right before it goes into the diagonal angle. Unfold the mask when you are done., Totomato's symbol is a large circle with a diagonal line going through it, like a non-smoking sign. The symbol should be almost the same height as the mask, with a 1/4 to 1/2-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border at the top and bottom., Cut a piece of thin elastic so that it is long enough to loop over your ear. Thread it onto a needle with a large opening, such as a yarn needle or tapestry needle. Tie a knot onto the end of the elastic.

Try to use black elastic, if you can.
You can use ribbon or string, if you want, but the measurements have to be exact.

, Turn the mask so that the back is facing you. Push the needle through the top corner of the notch. Pull it until the knot is against the fabric, then bring it through the bottom corner of the notch., The elastic needs to be long enough so that it can loop around your left ear. Once you are happy with the length, tie a knot into the end, then trim off the excess., When you are done, you will have two loops: one on the left side of your mask, and one on the right., Place the mask over your face, so that it covers your mouth and nose. Slip the left loop over your left ear, and the right loop over your right ear."

You must get a dress with full-length sleeves. ;
, If you don't have access to this, use a thick poster board. 

, It should be big enough for your head to fit through, but not so big that the cardboard sags. Cut it in about 3/4 of the way up.

, Lay the paper down horizontally, then secure the short ends together. This is the top of your ""body.""

, The bottom should reach down slightly past your armpits. They should be perpendicular to the hole for your head.

, If not, cut the shoulder holes to the correct size. If they are too large, consider staring again.

, Choose a strong piece of cloth, as it will be supporting pieces of newspaper/cloth and even a papier mâché neck. You can also hot glue gun it to the cardboard directly, though it will ruin your cloth.

, Make sure the shoulders fit on the cardboard.

, You can either use cloth, bubble wrap, plastic bags or newspaper. This will also help keep the dress in the same space.

, An easy way to do this is to get a jar (pickle or something similar), then put newspaper next to it. Put paper dipped in glue over it, then wait until it dries. Paint a severed neck.

, It doesn't have to be an entire hole, you could even cut a slit. Make it smaller than you think; that way, if it is too small, you can just cut it open a little more, instead of having to sew the fabric back in place.

, You can use a glue gun, tape, or even staples, though a glue gun is recommended. You can also get white gloves and stuff them, then attach them to the arms.


White gloves can often be found secondhand in thrift stores or through online auctions or clothing sellers.

, This will give the impression your head has recently been severed off.

, Make yourself very pale, with bags under your eyes and red/black lipstick. You could also add wounds.

Wear pants that come up to your armpits. Secure with a belt, or hot glue to a t-shirt (or any other shirt).
Put on a long button-down shirt, as well as a blazer. Keep one button on the bottom unbuttoned, to see through.

Unbutton two or more buttons so that you can stick your head through.
Stick your head into a pretzel jar. Be sure to leave the top open so you can breathe easily!

, Almost the same as the head in a jar, you:

Secure a platter to the hands.
Rest your head on the platter. You can add any plates, forks, etc. you want!

Refer to Things You'll Need.,
Stack 2 sheets of silver paper.,
Cut four 7 inch (17.8 cm) long blades out of the stack.,
Take a pair of blades and put 1 on each side of a popsicle stick.,
Duct tape the pair of blades to the first finger.",How to Make a Freddy Krueger Glove1," Gather all of the supplies together that you will need to make your glove. You can find the list of things you will need near the end of the page.


It doesn't matter if the glove is a righty or lefty. Freddy wore his glove on the right, but you can wear it on the left if it will be more comfortable for you.
Choose whatever color glove you like. Brown is a good choice, if you want it to look more authentic.;
, Make sure you can only see the silver side. In other words, put the bland, pale sides to each other so you don't see them.


Glue or tape the sheets of silver paper together securely so the paper won't slide around while you are trying to cut it.

, Create four pairs of two pieces of silver paper each. Then cut a 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap at the beginning of each blade in every pair so there are little ""arms"". You will need to do this or you will not be able to attach your blades to the fingers of the glove.


The blades should be long, thin, and slightly curved. Cut them out into a banana-like shape, with one that is very pointy.
The arms will allow you to glue each arm to each side of the gloves finger.
If you want, you can stroke the end of the blades with a red permanent marker and add dots for a splattered blood effect.

, Make sure they are even. Then tape the blades together so they cover the stick.

, Then duct tape the sides of the blade to the fingers to sturdy them. Only make the side strip 2 inches (5.1 cm). Then repeat until all four fingers have blades.


Consider painting the duct tape to match the color of the glove.

Draw the blades.,
Paint the blades.,
Glue the blades to the glove.",How to Make a Freddy Krueger Glove2," Before beginning gather everything you will need to make your glove. You will find a list of things needed for this method near the bottom of the page. Once you have begun, it may be frustrating if you have to stop to find something you need.


Make sure you have the glove you want. Brown will be more authentic, but you can choose any color you like.
You will need you glove, scissors, some strong glue, thin cardboard (such as that you might find for a cereal box), and if you want to paint the pieces then silver paint. You could also use shiny silver paper. If you want to rough up the appearance of the glove, you can use a piece of sandpaper.

, In the movie, Freddy’s glove does not look new. If you wish to, you can use a piece of sandpaper on the glove to make it look a bit more used.

, You will need to trace out a total of 8 different pieces for the fingers, plus a “cover” for the hand piece. Remember, the thumb is left completely free, with no pieces covering it, except the glove.


First, draw out a piece for the hand. You want the cardboard to be large enough to cover the back of the hand. The shape should be roughly the size and shape of the back of your hand, so a somewhat rounded square shape.
Then, draw out a piece for each of the lower halves of your finger. This piece of cardboard will need to cover your finger between your knuckles and the middle of your finger. Draw the pieces so that they will be wider than each of your fingers and can be folded in half over the glove (you will glue them on later).
For the bottom part of your finger, you can measure the cardboard out so that it is the length of your finger from your knuckle to the middle of your finger, where the joint is.
Draw out finger pieces for the top of the fingers. These will be slightly smaller than the pieces for the bottom half of your fingers, but should still be wide enough so that they can wrap around the glove, and be attached with glue. The pieces will be shaped in a rounded rectangular shape so that the will be long enough to cover each half of your finger, and wide enough to wrap around your knuckle. They don’t have to wrap all the way around, but you want the sides of the fingers to be covered.
For the top finger piece, you should measure the cardboard so that it will extend from the middle joint of your finger to the top of your finger, where you will attach the blade.

, Once you have finished drawing the pieces, cut them all out carefully with scissors.Before gluing them, put the glove on the hand you plan to wear it, and make sure that each piece lines up on the glove properly, and that it is wide enough to wrap around the finger of the glove. If one is too small, or shaped incorrectly, simply draw another one, and try again.

, This may be easiest if you put the glove on while you work. Consider wearing a rubber glove underneath to create a barrier between your skin and the glove in case any glue seeps through.


Begin by gluing the hand piece to the back of your hand.
Then glue each of the bottom finger pieces on, make sure that they are folded over your finger, and are glued securely.
Finish by gluing each of the top finger pieces. If you like, you can let the top finger pieces overlap on the bottom pieces where the joint is to make it appear as though they are connected with rivets.
Allow the glue to dry completely.

, In the movies, Freddy’s glove is usually an old copper color. You can paint the pieces of cardboard to make it appear more authentic.Mix together some gold paint with a bit of red or orange paint to make a coppery color.
You can also paint small black dots onto each of the pieces, which will look like rivets.Paint each piece of cardboard, and allow to dry. Before continuing with the project, the paint must be completely dry.

, If you like, you can use cardboard that is a bit thicker for this step, or you can simply use the same cardboard as you did for the finger pieces.


You will need four blades for each of your fingers (minus the thumb). These blades should be about 7 inches long (17.8 cm) and shaped sort of like a banana. That is, each one should be slightly curved.
Make them pointy on the edge, but not too pointy! You don’t want to injure yourself or someone else with the blade.

, You can either paint each blade with silver paint, or you can cover each piece of cardboard in shiny silver paper.You might also consider using a bit of red paint or a red marker on the edge of the blade to make it appear as though there is blood on it.
If you choose to paint each blade, make sure the paint is completely dry before moving on.

, Lay the glove flat on your workspace, and then glue the back edge of one blade to the side of one finger. Repeat this with each blade until all four finger have one.


If you want to reinforce the blades, you can put the glove on, and carefully wrap a strip of duct tape or electrical tape to the glove, and then paint the tape with the copper paint you used on the finger pieces to disguise it.

If you do this, be careful not to wrap the tape to tight around your fingers! Otherwise, you may cut off the circulation in your fingers.

You want to go to a neighbourhood with densely packed homes, so you can ring doorbells a mile a minute. Print off a map from an online mapping service such as Google Maps. The day before Halloween night, walk through your neighborhood and mark (on your map) which houses have Halloween decorations out. This is an indication they are handing out candy.;
,

Zigzag across the road as necessary. This may not be safe on a busy road, but it is the most efficient method since you don't need to spend extra time walking down a road twice.

, Don't take a bucket; use a large treat bag or old pillowcase. Use a light costume that won't make that bag heavier, and possibly double back, stash your treat bags and head back out to a different place. The tried-and-true car bag trick gets you more candy in the long run, so you can crash in the morning. Prepare!


In addition to this bag, consider wearing a large hiking knapsack (not a small backpack that one would use for school) to empty the bag into when it is full.

, If you're hungry, you'll end up eating candy, which slows you down. Eat a good dinner, or plan for one, and pack snacks if you're going to get hungry., A gang of three or four people is big enough, so get two or three friends and cover the ground together., Everybody hands out big handfuls of candy, thinking they have more than they do., You're racing against the clock!, There are usually signs directing you around to these areas, but some people still miss them.

Follow street safety rules.",How to Trick or Treat Safely," If your child is out trick-or-treating alone this year, have them hold a flashlight just in case. If you are going out with your child, you can carry it for them. There are also light-up shoes which flash different colours as your child is walking. You can also find glow rods or bracelets. They are sure to be seen on even the darkest of Halloween nights.;
, If your child is old enough to go on their own, but young enough to get lost, make a trick or treat route for them the day before. Check the area for dangers, such as broken sidewalks, large cracks, potholes, construction work, etc. Even though your child may want to go trick or treating in a less crowded area of town, keep in mind that these areas are sometimes deserted for a reason. There could be a crime watch, homes without sweets, or even just bad candy. Although, sometimes these places are perfectly fine. There are ups and downs for every section of a neighbourhood, and it's the discretion of the parent or trick or treater where to go., This step is extremely important if the child doesn't have a cellphone. A group of three to ten is generally okay. Make sure that the group will stay on task, meaning they won't drop the candy bags and get into mischief as soon as they are out of your sight (see warnings).

, Sneakers are preferred. Flip flops may seem fashionable at first, but after two hours of the shoe cutting into your big toe, it won't be as fun as it sounds. The same goes for Heelys, and other rollerblades. These are dangerous shoes, and could result in a serious injury. Make sure that the shoe fits, and that the laces are tied correctly. It's a common misfortune when a kid loses their shoe for a second, and it disappears into the Halloween night.


Just in case, if your you or your child has special shoes for their Halloween costume, bring a back up pair, that you know will be comfortable. This way, your trick or treating won't have to end earlier than you expected because you or your child cannot walk anymore in their shoes.

, Many masks (i.e., Spiderman, Grim Reaper, Ninja Turtle, etc.) do not provide air holes large enough for breathing, or may not have air holes at all. Before buying it, make sure that it has holes for eyes, nose, and mouth. If the child thinks it's not big enough, carefully cut them larger. It may be a hassle, but you'll be thankful in the long run when you can breathe easily after an hour of trick or treating.

, A short-cut cheerleader costume may not be such a good idea in forty degree weather, and vice versa for warmer areas. Bring along a jacket just in case, and be aware of the weather for that night.

, Although there have been reports of tampered candy, they are mostly false or lies. Even though it's highly unlikely, you should still probably check any candy with torn wrappers, as this may involve tampering.Before eating any of your food, lay it out once you get home to make sure you are only eating unopened candy. If your child is under ten, go through this activity with them. They should also be aware to never eat food they collect as they are trick or treating for this reason.

, If a house doesn't have any lights on, isn't attracting much attention, or is overall uninviting, the owners may not want to participate in Halloween. Respect their wishes, and don't ring the doorbell! Some children will insist on 'making sure they're not home' by ringing the doorbell, or rapping on the door obnoxiously. Not only could this annoy the people inside the house, but it could wake them up, or interrupt them during important work. Remember, there's always other houses.

, This includes;


Cross at crosswalks or streets without any traffic.
Stay on sidewalks.
If there is no sidewalk, walk near the curb, facing traffic.
Never assume a car will see you.

Keep it simple.Compare the difference in appearance between vampires from Twilight and other sources.,
Avoid tanning.,
Add sparkles.",How to Look Like a Twilight Vampire1," Note that the vampires in Twilight don’t appear monstrous (like Nosferatu) or drastically transform when they attack (as they do in Buffy the Vampire Slayer or From Dusk Til Dawn) or even have fangs.Aim for subtle touches that will set you slightly apart from humans.;
, Stay as pale as possible. If your skin is already tanned or dark in tone (or if you want to appear even paler then you already are), use makeup to cover it up. Apply a very light foundation (a shade or two lighter than your own skin tone) over your exposed skin.Wet a cotton pad with cleansing water to get rid of any existing makeup as well as any dirt, sweat, or grime. Then rub some moisturizer in your hands and pat it into your skin to keep it hydrated.With a foundation brush, begin brushing the foundation on, starting in the center of the area that you are covering (such as the center of your cheek or forehead). Work your way outward from the center, blending as you go for an even application.
Once you are finished, wet a makeup sponge to further blend any uneven areas. Roll the sponge over your skin, rather than wipe in a straight line.
Apply a small amount of concealer to your fingertip and lightly pat it over any dark marks that still show through the foundation.

, Sparkly skin sets Twilight’s characters apart from other vampires. So make the distinction apparent by applying a shimmering face powder over your skin.Use a makeup brush to sweep your skin with it after applying your foundation..


Start small. Pick one area to begin and apply slight amounts of powder at a time. Work your way up toward a desired amount, rather than overdo it right from the start.Less is more. Be selective about where you apply it. Start with your forehead, then add some to your cheeks if desired.
Avoid areas with deep lines in your skin, since powder here will attract attention.
Powder may cling to your brush even after rinsing, so designate one brush as your special sparkly brush to avoid transferring powder to other products by mistake.

”Bruise” your eyes.,
Stain your lips.,
Wear contacts.,
Style your hair.",How to Look Like a Twilight Vampire2," Give yourself the appearance of being desperately underfed. Apply makeup between the bottoms of your eyes and your cheekbones to simulate the “bruising” effect that comes with undernourishment and a lack of sleep.Using a makeup brush:


Brush one or more shades of a matte purple eyeshadow over the skin.If using more than one, start with the lighter as your base, followed by progressively darker ones.
Blend as you go, but don’t be afraid to make it appear blotchy.
Add touches of black eyeshadow and then blue if desired.

, Make them look like you finally found a blood bag or victim to satisfy that hunger. Use red lip stain, rather than lipstick or lipgloss.If your lips are chapped or otherwise cracked or course, exfoliate with a lip scrub beforehand so they are smooth.Then:


Apply a light coat of chapstick over your lips to keep them moisturized. Wipe any excess off with a tissue, paper towel, or clean cloth.Brush the head of the lip stain over your lips. For more color, add multiple layers.
Since this is simulating blood (as opposed to lip stain’s intended use, which is to enhance your lips’ color), feel free to do it unevenly to suggest a messy feeding.

, Since Twilight’s vampires have very sharp but otherwise regular teeth, forget wearing fake fangs. Instead, use contact lenses to further distinguish yourself. First, visit your eye doctor to get a prescription, even if you have perfect eyesight, since theatrical contacts still need to be fitted to the exact shape of your eyes. Then search locally or online for retailers selling Twilight-themed lenses and provide them with your prescription and contact info for your eye doctor.A Twilight vampire’s eye color reflects their diet. Red eyes indicate a diet of human blood. Gold eyes reflect animal blood.In both cases, a lack of food turns their eyes black.

, Emulate Twilight's vampires even further rocking a smashing do. Watch online tutorials to learn how to fashion your hair the same way as specific characters. Or, follow your own instincts and create something original. Either way, use your hair to show a different side of you than your normal daytime haircut suggests.Youtube.com is a great resource for learning how to do specific hairstyles. For example, here are links for Edward Cullen (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laf5unfrT6c) and Victoria (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGMazEGNkyA).
Regardless of which hairstyle you choose, one important rule to follow is to eliminate frizz. The Pacific Northwest is a very damp climate, which makes the local vamps' lack of frizz appear that much more unworldly."

Dress “normally.” Remember that most vampires in Twilight are trying to blend in with regular humans.,
Wear dark, neutral colors.,
Decide on how much to match.",How to Look Like a Twilight Vampire3," Forget Dracula’s cape or similar extravagant wear. Stick to what would look commonplace in modern-day Washington state, like jeans, t-shirts, button-downs, jackets, sneakers, and boots.Since the movies were filmed on a low budget, many clothes featured are from affordable outlets like American Apparel, Loehmann’s, and Nordstrom.
The website https://thetake.com/movie/211/twilight identifies specific articles of clothing featured in the films.

, Draw more attention to your paler skin. Avoid clothes in light shades or shockingly bold colors. Stick to darker shades of neutral colors instead. To further suggest your vampire status, stick to cooler colors, such as blues and grays., Since vampires have lived for a considerably long time, expect most of them to have developed a refined, elegant look over the years. Mirror this aesthetic by matching colors and styles of clothing to avoid clashing. However, if you are specifically emulating the nomads in the series, feel free to mix and mismatch your clothes, since the nomads are portrayed in the movies as stealing random clothes from victims as needed."

Count up your change.",How to Earn Money for a Charity While Trick or Treating on Halloween," It should have a little handle on it you can hold it with, a rectangle box for the change, and a slit in the top for change to go through. You could also cover it in cute stickers or slogans to advertise a charity.;
, You should know what your charity stands for and what its mission is. You might want to know the address of your charity's headquarters, or the name of your charity's website. For these types of charities, even receiving a quarter could feed a person for a week, or every fifty cents could vaccine a child in Africa. You should learn some basic facts about the amount that it takes to help someone, so that they will give you more.

, If you look absolutely adorable or your costume is very well-made or thought of, you'll be more appealing to donate to. Ask for change for your charity in a charming voice, and thank them gladly when you leave (don't forget to smile). If you have children, offer them to join you as people will be more generous to cute kids knocking on their door.

, When going from house to house, if they seem to have a change jar available, ask them if they would donate a little change, and hopefully, you'll get a little more than twenty-five cents. Say that this is from your school/community center/on your own, that every penny counts, and information about where it is going to, and you'll be more likely to collect change. Take a minute to tell them about your charity and its mission

Turn your porch lights off.,
Post signs in your yard informing that you do not have candy.,
Leave a large, cheap, plastic bowl with candy outside.,
Go out for the evening.,
Cope with the doorbell ringing but ignore it.",How to Deter Unwanted Trick or Treaters," Porch lights are the unofficial ""signal"" to trick or treaters that you have candy or not. Parents whom walk with their kids would acknowledge homes that aren't lit in front, while older kids might not get the hint if they see house lights on through the windows. You can also bring in any Halloween decorations around your yard to avoid any additional misunderstandings.;
, If you have a baby whom you are trying to get down to sleep or an alert dog, you might want to put the signs closer to the sidewalk rather than the porch. Make sure that they are well lit and big enough to read clearly, so that eager children don't miss it.

, Be sure to leave a large note with light stating specifically that it is the candy bowl for the entire night and trick or treaters should take one piece of candy per person. This option has a pro and con to it, as you won't feel obligated to get up from your couch every time the doorbell rings, but the candy might be all grabbed up by an unknown amount of kids in a short amount of time.

, Make sure that every light is off and windows/doors locked. Majority of the kids accompanied by their parents usually start in the mid-afternoon, while there's still daylight outside. Teens whom circle around neighborhoods typically end around 9 to 10 pm.

, Halloween candy is not a requirement to purchase and you have every right to turn anyone away if you aren't giving things out.

You could also find a map of your city online or at your local library and highlight the places you're allowed to go to.",How to Get Lots of Candy on Halloween," Which houses had the best candy to give out, and which had the worst or ""so-so"" candies? The aim is to bypass houses only interested in giving out toothbrushes, apples, and granola bars, or houses where candy is handed out in small amounts. Of course you are not going to waste your time in getting the old boring everyday candies, you want a lot of quality free candy from your unsuspecting neighbors, so, think back and remember who gave you unique candy last year, and who gave a great amount. Plan out your route and take your time with it.


A neighborhood with small yards and sidewalks allows you to hit more houses in the allotted time. And apartment complexes with many doors can cut down on walking time.
When assessing who gives out lots of candies, ask friends if they can also provide relevant information to allow you to compare notes and target the houses that give the biggest selections. If you're planning with friends, you can also trade later to help even out the candy selection you ultimately receive.;
, The quality and fanciness of your costume can affect how many candies you're given. The more interesting, cute, scary, etc., your costume is, the more likely that the candy giver will ""reward"" you for your effort by giving you more candy. Make sure your costume is recognizable, If you dress up as a traditional sailor that may get you more than a traditional ghost though. Be sure to act in character too, to help complete the effect and totally win over the candy givers. Prepare your costume and focus on trying to get something that is less expensive and easy to make but is totally unique and different from those of others. Get or make something that will get eyes set on you.

, Use a backpack, a large bag with a drawstring, or a pillowcase to hold all of your trick or treat loot. The bag needs to be easy to carry, able to hold a lot comfortably and strong. In these cases a heavy bucket or heavy type of bag is not actually a choice since you want to get more candy so choose a bag with which you are comfortable.


If using a pillowcase and you're concerned it might break or you see it is frayed or even has a hole or two, double it up with another pillowcase.
If possible, also have a smaller basket or container. This will enable you to keep your larger treat bag stashed somewhere safe to return to and refill regularly. Or, if you're in your own street, run home and dump the loot and head out again. If you are going with your friend and you will explore farther than your own street, it is a good idea to have another storage bag within your original.
It's recommended that you add a light or reflective tape to your candy bag to help make you more visible after dark. You are not just going to return home before dark, that is when the real scares begins!

, It can be street specific or just a general idea of where to go and where to avoid. This map may help you to keep on track when the foot traffic and parties increase during the night but it can also serve as a reminder of which houses usually have the best candies. Use the map as a reminder of where you went as well, so that you don't back track and waste time or look greedy! Also have a sibling or a friend by your side, it does help after dark when its spooky!


If you're turning up in another suburb known for its amazing candies on Halloween, a map and plan is an absolute must so that you don't get lost.

, It's best to start early, when the treats are still in plentiful supply in the houses of your neighborhood. Some houses run out early because they're too generous to begin with; you might as well be the first to take advantage of this generosity!


The majority of parents take their young children out at the beginning of sunset, to let the kids have a sufficient time before dark. If you want to start this early, be aware you'll be turning up with the little ones. If you have younger siblings, this can be a good excuse to turn up too, or just offer to take the neighbor's kids with you.
Note that some cities or neighborhoods start to turn off their lights between 8 pm and 10 pm; don't be out trick or treating too late or you'll miss the treats or get the dregs.
Watch the houses that turn off their lights; this is the standard indication that Halloween is over for that household, or that they've run out of goodies.

, Grown-ups like manners, it's just the way they're built; accept that being polite will win you more candies than being evasive, gruff, or rude. Compliment the householder on their Halloween decorations. And always say ""Trick or Treat?"" with a big smile. The evening is about having fun with others; be thoughtful enough to make it seem that each house is worth more than just being a loot filling station!

, Even though they all look or sound cool, every minute counts while going from house to house in one night. Any obstacle will deter you from your candy goal. Unless you're certain that there is candy to be had at any of these places, consider not even venturing into them. You can always go back and check them out later (mark them on your map).


Don't eat your candies as you're going. The time spent eating them and the sugar high will slow you down!

, If you're really keen for more candies, change your costume or mask and return to the same houses for more. If you do this though, make sure you're not recognizable or the people might refuse to give you anything, or worse, demand that you give back the second lot of candy. Fool them into thinking you are another child, of course don't you want to show off once you are home!


Another tip is to empty your container as often as possible so that it looks as if you've just started treating or as if other people have been stingy; this may encourage people to offer you more candies than if your bucket is full.

, This way more of you can cover greater distances and then share your spoils together. Gather back together at a certain time and place to share or trade candies. Use a trading method on two small candies for a big one or qualities per candy. The trading method works when someone does not like something they got and would like another candy or when they've hit the jackpot and have been given too many of one sort.


When you do go trick or treating as a group, keep the numbers small. It's less overwhelming for the householder to have a few kids on the doorstep, and easier to give out the candies. It's also less likely to result in trading arguments at the end.

, Write down the directions on a piece of notebook paper and keep the map and the directions together while you're trick-or-treating. Go over them with your parents to make sure you're allowed to go there.

",How to Be Little Dead Riding Hood for Halloween," The most important part of any costume is your clothes. Going on the basis of the traditional Red Riding Hood, find a black skirt and white top (or any vintage-like clothing), or a white/black or a vintage dress. These should be cheaply bought or secondhand, because they won't be wearable again. You should also find a red cape, or you can easily make one from a blanket or sheet. Find some red or black shoes, too; maybe high heels.;
, To make the costume look like Red Riding Hood was mauled by old Wolf, you'll need to rip and tear your skirt/dress, shirt, and cape. Try rubbing a few handfuls of dirt on, creasing and generally ruining the costume! Instead of using real dirt, use coffee to make crisp whites look old and worn.

, Either wear fishnet tights or ripped black tights. Dirty up the knees, too.

, An important part of the look will be your hair and make up. Deep condition your hair, roughly blow dry and tease your hair madly in all directions. Cover in a good quality hair spray. Poke a few twigs in to look like you were in a scuffle - a bit of dirt smeared in the ends would add to the effect. (but don't ruin your hair!)

, Your face should be deathly pale, with dark, smudged lipstick and heavily lined eyes. Try patting talcum powder on, and smudging your eye make up before it's dried. Liquid eyeliner will really make your eyes stand out.

Decide how the ballerina died.,

Find an inexpensive pair of ballet shoes (you can use your old ones).,
Sew on a thick black satin ribbon around the waist of the tutu, tied into a drooping bow on the side.,
Make the ballerina look injured.,
Add some fabric mesh around the skirt, along with some black satin roses.,
If you have any black makeup powder, you can dab it on areas of your tights to make them look dirty.,
For your hair, make a bun on the back of your head.,
For makeup, use white powder (not face paint) and powder your face.,
Use lots of eyeliner and mascara for a dead effect.",How to Make a Dead Ballerina Costume," It can be anything. If the ballerina was murdered, you might need a few more items to show injuries.


For extra scare points, say that the ballerina was killed by a vampire (which would make her a vampire, adding to the scary effect).;
, Black will get the ""dead"" point across) with thin straps (spaghetti straps). These you can find at a Dance/Costume Boutique. You will also need a black tutu, the kind that ballerinas wear (as in the ones that stick straight out with lots of layering mesh, not the actual skirts that hang down). If you cannot find black, get the darkest gray you can find. You will also need black tights, but if you don't have them then you can use tan or pink. But if you do have Black then try to rip them up or cut holes in the tights.

, If you want to look the best, you will need to dye these black. You can also use fabric or spray paint to color them. If the paint fades a little in certain areas, or has scratches, do not repaint them. This damage will make them look old and worn.

, You can also sew on thinner black satin ribbons to your ballet shoes, and then tie them crossed around your ankle with a bow on the side also. (do not use black ribbons for your ballet shoes if they are not black. Try using ribbons the same color as the shoes.)

, Add bandages (not band-aids, but actual bandages) around the ankles and feet. You can die areas of the bandage red if you'd like.

, You can also play around with more black satin ribbons if you'd like. Add black lace.

, You can also use black palette face paint (not the liquid tube kind), dab a makeup sponge into the container and smudge your tights with it. Try to make it look as similar to dirt as possible, rather than paint.

, Make sure it is tight and will not fall out. You can use nets, pins, or whatever you need to keep it tight. Use a lot of bobby pins in your hair and pull it out of your face. You can also tie a black ribbon around your bun.

, You want to look pale, but not completely white. Make sure to blend onto your neck and chest, otherwise it will look odd to have just a pale face. Powder anywhere else you feel is needed.

, Use fake eyelashes if you want. Use plenty of eyeliner (thickly applied) around the eye line, then use a small eye shadow applicator (the kind with the small round sponge on the end) and blend outwards. You can use eye shadow also, preferred smokey black, charcoal, or dark gray, it can have shimmer if you want.

, The person going as Jamie Madrox should have black hair with some shaved spots, with the non shaved sticking up, as shown in the above picture. Monoxide on the other hand has the same style, but with blond hair in place of black. I suggest using rubber bands or scrunchies to keep your hair up like that.

, You can both wear white dress shirts (covered in fake blood), a bulletproof vest over a grey t-shirt over a black long sleeve, or any type of Twiztid merchandise. The latter of these outfits can be bought at www.hatchetgear.com.

Put it all together.,
Do your hair.,
Apply your makeup.,
Have the right attitude.",How to Make a Dead Barbie Costume for Halloween," You can try a fancy gown, a pretty puff sleeved dress or an entirely different creation. Some good additions to your outfit design would include:


Puff sleeves - this always pulls off the princess/pretty girl look, and teamed up with Halloween, it will definitely give you the dead doll look.






Ripped skirts or dresses - what was once a beautifully elegant piece of clothing is now a Halloween princess's dream. Ripped skirts give off the haunted, deathly appearance, which is exactly what you're looking for.






A corset or a corset lookalike. If you've got a pink base or very girly dress design, a black corset or bodice will make sure that Barbie won't come back to life.






Wings - make your own black, ripped bat wings or buy some and paint over them. Good colours for wings would be black, silver or pink if you're going with a pink and black/other dark colour theme.






A tiara - buy a cheap diamante tiara and rip out a few of the stones, or splatter it with paint.





;
, The perfect dead Barbie costume can be ruined by a pair of trainers. Put just as much care into your shoes as the rest of your outfit. Boots, dark or paint splattered ballet flats, or in some cases, Converse, will all look good with this costume. Be sure to remember the following tips:


Boots will look good with shorter dresses. Long gowns should not be worn with boots, as people will have trouble seeing them anyway.






Black or silver ballet flats will work well and are a comfy and easy choice. You can also by a pink pair and splatter them with black paint, sew on black patches, or even tear the fabric a little.






Converse works very well with short, ripped skirts. It makes you like an innocent girl gone bad. Black is usually a solidly good choice, though you can branch out.







, If your costume is quite complex or very personalized, you'll be easier off making it yourself. Of course, you can always take old clothes and customize them, or buy a dress and then add your own Halloween-ish embellishments. If you're making your outfit, be sure to make a detailed plan and be methodical in your sewing, as well as giving yourself plenty of time for mistakes and mishaps as they always occur in situations like these. If you're buying your outfit, look around for the different pieces you want - a black corset, a pink dress, evil fairy wings, etc. Good materials to use are silk or velvet, as they give off the perfect ""pretty"" sheen but can also be made to look perfectly horrific. Crumpled velvet is also beautiful for a number of dress styles - usually short. Make sure your outfit will be easy to rip, sew over and customize.

, Use fabric glue or fabric paint and decorate the clothing with it. Feel free to use glitter, sequins and colored beads as well. Rip the fabric, fray the straps, rub a burnt cork over the bodice - be creative. Strips of ripped lace, ordinary silver safety pins, a few badges or sewn on patches and ribbons are all easy to add on and finish the look. Make sure everything is firmly fixed on - you won't be raining accessories on the night.

, Chains and over sized rings are perfect. You can also add in a choker, some eye-catching earrings and bracelets. Be sure to balance out the Barbie vs Death look - so you may wear pink earrings but have on a black and silver choker.

, It's important to try the outfit on at least three or four times before you actually wear it out. Also be sure to add plenty of your own embellishments to it, such as lace, patches, paint stains, safety pins, etc. Be sure everything fits and looks good together.

, Hair is incredibly important. Don't worry if you don't have Barbies' golden locks and don't worry if you aren't in possession of a dark black mane either. You don't need to do anything drastic to your hair to make it look good. Either straighten or wave your hair. Make sure you do a good job, and use an anti frizz serum to keep things in place. You can leave your hair out, which is one of the easiest options, and will most likely pull off the ""Barbie"" look. Some other simple styles include two low ponytails (best with straight hair), a side pony (pretty with waves), a high ponytail (straight hair). However, if you're trying something different, you can always just go crazy.


Black velvet ribbons and interesting hair pieces brighten (or darken) any look.

Bangs and fringes are always welcomed: straight, sleek, side bangs or a thick blunt fringe will help you carry off the look in sheer style.

, Makeup is the finishing touch for your look - after all, Barbie's face is always perfectly made up.


Decide what foundation you want to wear. You can try a shade lighter than your original skin tone, to make your face a little paler. Or you can lightly dust white powder (not grease paint) over your face and any other exposed skin, to give yourself the Gothic, dead girl look.

Eyeliner is important. You can apply a thick, heavy black liner for a simple but effective look, or you can choose some eye catching colours. Blue, green, red or pink are all perfect colours. Mascara is optional - if you've got thick lashes, leave them be - but you can always lengthen them with a shade of black or a clear gloss. Apply fake eyelashes for eyes that truly stand out.

Lipstick or lip gloss. If you have the skills and the right look to pull it off, you can try a red lipstick. However, be careful to pick the right shade or you'll end up looking plain stupid. You can also try a deep purple lipstick, or a light brown colour for darker skin tones. You can always just wear lip gloss - candy pink for sheer Barbie, or a clear gloss. Be sure not to smudge!

Apply eyeshadow. Deep, dark purple, blue or black make good colours for a darker look. You can apply a heavy coat to make your eyes smudged and haunted. Silver or gold glitter eyeshadow is also perfectly girly, but can also help make you look a touch eerie if used with skill. Glitter eye shadows are great for girlier or crazier styles, while strong deep colours work better for solids.

, After doing all of the previous steps perfectly, you can ruin everything by simply having the wrong attitude on the night. Giggling endlessly or telling everyone how ""dumb"" you feel will not work in you or your costume's favour. Be confident - not arrogant or meek. Try to look blank and haunted, scary and dark, or simply be yourself. Make sure you have fun - after all, that's what it's all about.

Cut out the hood.,
Baste and gather the cape.,
Sew hood to cape.,
Personalize your cape.,
Alternatively, buy a costume cape.",How to Make a Vampire Costume1," Whether you prefer bloody red taffeta, jet black silk or inky blue velvet, make sure your fabric and color choice is sufficiently vampiric. You will need 1–2 yards (0.9–1.8 m) of fabric, depending on how long you want the cape to be.;
, Lay your fabric out on a large space, such as your living room floor. Use a measuring tape to measure from your shoulder to your calf, or wherever you want your cape to end. Use this measurement to mark the length of your cape on the fabric. Cut along this line to make your cape.


Another way to measure your cape is to lie down on the fabric. Lie with the top edge of the fabric at your shoulders. Sit up without moving your legs. Mark with chalk at your leg where you want the cape to fall. Make another mark a few inches lower. This is where you will cut. Use your measuring tape to mark this line all the way across the fabric. Cut across.
You can hem all around the edges of your cape if you are going for a refined look. For a rougher look, leave the edges raw.

, Measure a 30"" by 15"" rectangle in the corner of the remaining fabric. Mark this rectangle with chalk, then cut it out. This will be the hood of the cape.


To hem the hood, fold in the short edged of the hood about 1/2"". Pin and then iron in place. Stitch the hem and then set aside.
If you want an extra droopy hood, measure the rectangle as 35"" by 20"" instead.

, Loosely straight stitch along the edge of the cape, a 1/4"" from the edge. You are putting a loose thread along the edge of the cape so that you can use it to evenly gather the cape. This is called 'basting'. After you have threaded the edge of the cape, hold the extra thread with one hand and use the other to scrunch the fabric down along the thread. Continue to evenly gather the fabric along the thread until the edge of the cape is the same length as the hood.


If you are using a sewing machine, set it for the longest stitch available.
Leave plenty of loose thread on the edge.

, Lay the hood on the gathered end of the cape. Sew the cape to the hood.


Make sure you are touching together the right sides of the fabric so the hood is inside-out.
Use a straight stitch to sew the cape to the hood.

, You can add applique patches, such as bats, moons or spiders to personalize your cape.

, A costume shop will have them as props around Halloween, but comb vintage and thrift shops, too.

Determine what kind of vampire you want to look like.,
Wear dark colors.,
Have good fashion sense.,
Wear ornate jewelry.,
Inject your personality into your style.",How to Appear to Be a Vampire1," There are a variety of different styles of vampire over the years. For instance, Bram Stoker's iconic vampire, Dracula, is often depicted as wearing a tuxedo and cape.Other vampires, like ones from True Blood, Vampire Diaries, or Twilight have different personalities and clothing preferences that look more modern. Decide what kind of vampire you want to look like before you choose your clothes.


Draw your inspiration from your favorite vampire movies.
The vampires in the movie ""Lost Boys"" wore leather jackets which were popular among bikers in the 80's and 90's.Other vampire movies that you can draw inspiration from include, ""Let the Right One In,"" ""Interview With the Vampire,"" ""Nosferatu,"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""Often vampires must blend in with society, but dressing like everyone else may not be beneficial if you're trying to dress to look like a vampire intentionally.;
, The classic vampire look is heavily influenced by the gothic dress and takes inspiration from Elizabethan era Victorian era clothing. If you want to seem like an ancient vampire, then you should search for clothing at antique or specialty shops. If you're trying to look like a modern vampire, however, you can get away with just wearing dark colored clothing.


Another popular style of dress is called ""gothic glamor,"" which is dark colored clothing that is dark and uses a lot of lace.Some vampires in contemporary literature and media wear light white or bright colored clothing to go against widely accepted standards that vampires are dark and brooding.
If you're a guy, you can wear a black button down shirt with dark pants to get a more vampire vibe.
If you're a girl, you can wear black or crimson red to accentuate your dark aura.
Wearing a long black trenchcoat is the contemporary equivalent to a black tuxedo for vampires.

, Vampires wicked sense of style doesn't mean that they don't know how to dress. In fact, quite the opposite is true. In modern literature and contemporary media, vampires are often depicted as well dressed and sexually alluring.Wear clothes that look flowing and natural, and keep up on the latest fashion trends so you can incorporate it into your style.

, Vampires tend to wear gaudy jewelry in the form of rings, pendants, and bracelets. Pick up some jewelry from a shopping mall or look online for variations. Typical vampiric jewelry includes iconography that includes skulls and spiritual symbols like the pentagram and the Egyptian symbol known as the Ankh, which means eternal life.Make sure your jewelry is not silver, as this is associated with repelling vampires., Having a vampire style of dress is not only about wearing dark colors or doing what's traditional. When you are choosing your vampiric clothing, make sure that you inject some of your personality into your style. If you're typically happy or friendly, consider wearing lighter colored clothing instead of the usual blacks and dark reds. You can still pull off the vampire look by accessorizing your wardrobe and doing your make-up to look like a vampire.

Wear a white button-down shirt.,
Put on black dress pants.,
Consider wearing a suit vest.,
Tie a makeshift cummerbund around your waist.,
Wear black dress shoes or boots.",How to Make a Vampire Costume2," A simple button-down, long-sleeved white shirt will work, but a tuxedo shirt or a ruffled shirt will look better. Look for a lacy or brocade shirt at a thrift store for extra effect.

, Tuxedo pants work best, but any simple black pants will do. Black jeans or slacks will work in a pinch, just make sure that they are very black, faded black jeans that are almost grey would definitely dilute the effect you are going for.

, Any self-respecting vampire knows that it is important to always look your best. A suit vest adds an air of elegance and sophistication to your outfit, all the better to seduce your victims. Black, crimson or silver are all good colors vest colors.

, Use a swathe of black or scarlet silk to create a makeshift cummerbund. This is optional, depending on the type of vampire look you are attempting to create. A cummerbund adds an air of formality to your vampire costume, perfect for channeling Count Dracula himself.

, Again, you are aiming for upper-class elegance with your vampire costume. Wearing your white Nike's would completely ruin the effect.

"
"
Put on an elegant top.,
Wear a long skirt.,
Slip on heels or heeled boots.",How to Make a Vampire Costume3," A boned corset would be ideal, but any form-fitting top in black velvet, satin, lace or brocade will do the trick. Look for elaborate designs with some metal accents, such as grommets, buckles or zippers. In terms of color, black, dark purples and deep reds are best, although a ruffled, immaculately white shirt can be striking.

, A full-length, floor-skimming skirt is essential to complete your vampire costume. Try to find full-skirted black tulle for a glamorous edge, or choose figure-hugging satin to reveal your seductive side.

, Wearing high heels will elongate your figure and and ensure your vampire costume retains its classy style from head to toe. Wearing heels will also lend you an air of confidence and authority essential to any female vampire. Again, black is best, either in matte leather or shiny patent.

"
Consider wearing white face paint.,
Use facepaint or eyeshadow to make your eyes dark.,
Wear dark red lipstick.,
Paint your nails red or black if you're a girl.",How to Make a Vampire Costume4," Vampires are technically dead, so the paler you are the better. White face paint can be used to achieve that bloodless look, but it can seem fake if poorly applied. Use a make-up sponge to ensure even application. Blend the color well and make sure to extend the color down to your neck and chest if necessary. A subtler alternative is to apply a very pale shade of foundation.


Before applying any type of face paint, try slathering your face with a foundation primer or moisturizer. This keeps makeup from appearing cakey, especially if you have dry skin.
Apply a puff of powder over entire face to keep it in place. You can use white baby powder here to keep the white effect.

, For the perfect vampire makeup, you want a smokey eye. The trick here is to use eyeshadow for the smokey bits, over an eyeliner.


You can choose a dark gray, brown or black or have fun with aubergine. Any dark eyeliner and eyeshadow will do you.
Apply eyeliner on the inside of eye, on the top and bottom. Then take a dark eyeshadow and apply around the perimeter of the eye. Blend well.

, Apply dark red lipstick to create the appearance of having feasted on blood. You can even use red face paint or fake blood capsules to make it look like you have drops of blood around your mouth.

, The longer your nails are the better, file to a point if possible. Alternatively, you can apply false nails.


Opt for shiny, blood red lacquers or glittering blacks.
If you have a steady hand, try some nail art by painting on tiny white spiderwebs or black bats.

"
"
Wear fangs.,
Use liquid blood capsules.Blood capsules can be used to achieve the ""I-just-fed-on-human-blood"" look.,
Consider a wig.,
Wear gothic jewelry.",How to Make a Vampire Costume5," You can find a wide range of vampire fangs both in costume shops and online, and the more that you are prepared to pay, the more realistic your fangs will look. They come in plastic, wax or even edible candy.


If you are really dedicated to looking like a vampire, you could go to the expense of having a set of fangs made especially to fit your mouth by a dentists.
To make a set of vampire fangs at home, try to find a round washing-up liquid bottle in white plastic. Make sure that you clean the plastic thoroughly and cut out a pair of fangs from the white plastic bottle where there is no writing. As the bottle is naturally rounded they should fit in your mouth quite well and use a bit of red nail varnish to create the effect of the dripping blood. Be careful not to swallow any fake fangs that you are wearing and do not make fangs from bottles that have contained bleach or any other strong chemical.
Alternatively, give the impression of having fangs using tooth black-out goo. Blacken the bottoms of your incisors to make your pointy canines look longer.

, Blood Capsules are filled with non-toxic liquid fake blood. You simply place the blood capsules between your upper and lower teeth and bite down til the blood oozes out of your mouth.

, Female vampires tend to have long, lustrous black locks, so if your natural hair is not like this, you can try on some wigs that will give you that true gothic vampire look. Wigs can be found in costumes stores, online or at specialty wig stores. Again, the more money you are willing to spend, the more realistic your wig will be.

, Vampire jewelry is generally quite chunky and dramatic, and comes in silver or pewter.


Look for chunky crosses and crucifixes on silver chains. Layer them up, if desired.
Look for bat charms on necklaces, bracelets, earrings and rings.
Opt for red gemstones. A large red gemstone worn on a choker-style necklace can look very effective.

Get fangs.,
Grow your fingernails long.,
Wear colored contacts.,
Make your skin look pale.",How to Appear to Be a Vampire2," You can do many things to achieve the teeth that are found in most popular vampire myths. One option is to file down your canine teeth to a point so that they resemble vampire fangs. If you're going to go down this route, consult with a dental professional before doing it. Filing your teeth is a permanent procedure. Another option is to get caps to cover your real teeth so that they resemble vampire fangs. Lastly, you can pick up artificial fangs that can glue over your real teeth. You can find these artificial teeth at most Halloween or costume stores.


The cost of getting dental crowns that resemble vampire teeth can range from $2,000 to $5,000., Vampires are known to have excessively long nails because they grow at a faster rate than a normal human. Long nails also enable vampires to grab their prey. Grow out your fingernails to at least a centimeter in length and cut them so that they form a point., If you want to freak people out and embrace the vampire look, consider getting colored contacts. Vampires are sometimes known to suffer from Scleritis, a debilitating inflammatory disease that can make the white of your eyes red.To replicate the look, buy red colored contact lenses and wear them when you're around other people.


If you are considering getting colored contact lenses, go to an accredited eyeglasses shop. Do not buy lenses from novelty or costume shops because they could potentially damage your eye., If you have naturally fair skin, it may be easier to appear pale. Stay out of the sun so that you don't tan. If your skin is naturally darker, try applying white foundation to your skin to give it a white, vampiric look.If you are trying to lighten your skin permanently, a skin lightening solution can also be used.


Skin lightening or skin whitening can have an adverse affect on your skin's quality and health."

Become a person of the night.,
Be more mysterious.,
Act unpredictable, moody, and temperamental.,
Walk with purpose.,
Drink blood.",How to Appear to Be a Vampire3," Vampires hate the sunlight and are often photosensitive, prone to sunburns, and are sluggish during the day.If you want to appear to be a vampire, you need to make sure to stay out of the sun and be awake and active during the night.


If you work, try to find a job with a night shift.
If you are forced to be awake during the daytime, act as if you are tired and scared of the sun.

, Something that makes vampires interesting is how mysterious they are. Don't divulge a lot of information to your friends about your lifestyle, and don't go around boasting about being a vampire. The more you keep to yourself, the more mystery that's built around you.


If someone asks you ""What are you doing tonight?"" you can say something like, ""It's none of your business.""
If someone asks ""Why do you look like a vampire?"" you can say, ""That's for me to know and it's no one else's business.""

, Vampires are known to have serious mood swings which cause them to get angry quickly. If you want to appear to be a vampire, you must act moody, sullen, depressed, misanthropic, and was withdrawn.Be entirely selfish, and slightly annoyed with those that don't associate with your vampiric lifestyle.

, Vampires often have a slow, deliberate way of walking. Don't act energetic or cheerful or else you may come off as being a normal human. Throw concerns about being late out the window and walk as if you have a purpose wherever you are going.


You can increase your gait if you feel like you aren't getting to places fast enough.

, One of the biggest staples of being a vampire is drinking blood. While drinking human blood requires a donor, you can create artificial blood by mixing corn syrup and red dye. One of the easiest ways to look like a vampire is to drink blood in front of other people.


Drinking blood in front of your friends may scare them and prevent them from hanging out with you again.
Drinking blood can be toxic and can cause serious health problems like liver damage, fluid in your lungs, low blood pressure, dehydration and nervous system disorders."

Be a walking, shuffling zombie who’s slow and dumb with dead eyes.You won’t need any specific type of clothing for this type. Use whatever’s on hand, such as old jeans and t-shirts.;
, Wanna be a zombie princess or ballerina who’s been zombified? Go for a cute identity that’s gone terribly, terribly wrong.This might be where last year’s costume comes in handy. If you have an old ballerina tutu or princess costume hanging around, you could zombify it so long as you don’t mind destroying it in the process.

Use a spritz bottle filled with water and a few drops of brown or black food coloring or black tea to make your clothes look old.Spritz your clothing unevenly to make it look more realistically aged.

, Zombies stumble around catching themselves on things, so to make it realistic tear up those clothes. Add some tears into your clothing with a seam ripper or knife. Don’t be afraid to also use your hands to tear at some small cuts.To make your tears look realistic, cut in random areas and vary the size of the cuts and the amount of fraying.
Remember that your clothing will need to stay on your body, so don’t get too carried away with the ripping and tearing!

, Take your clothes outside and rub them around in the dirt and mud to get that grimy zombie look down for your clothing.

, Zombies are all about blood and gore, so add some to your clothing to help add to the effect. Use store bought blood or make your own, and then spatter it all over your clothing using your own hands and sponges.


Make sure to step away from your clothing to see how it looks at a distance.An easy do-it-yourself recipe for fake blood is combining corn syrup with a few drops of red food coloring. Then add a squirt of chocolate syrup to thicken and darken the blood., Using extreme caution, take a lighter to your clothing to singe or burn parts of it to achieve that zombified look.You should always do this in an open area away from flammable surfaces and have a fire extinguisher nearby.

, Apply liquid latex on your face in a light layer using a sponge, and then stretch your skin tight while drying the liquid latex with a hairdryer. This’ll be sure to make your face look old and tired.Do this before you put on your face makeup so when you apply makeup the wrinkles will appear deeper.

You won’t want your natural skin tones to give you away as alive!Don’t make your face blue or green since zombies are always very earth toned., Zombies shouldn’t have pink tongues, so mix a drop of black food coloring in with your mouthwash and swill it around in your mouth.

Get some white fabric.,
Lay out the sheet of fabric.,
Tear the strips from the slits along the length of the sheet.,
Dye the material.",How to Make a Mummy Costume1," Old sheets work great, but you can also purchase some cheap material at fabric stores. If you don't already have something usable, try thrift stores for bargain-priced items.


You'll be cutting these up, obviously -- so if you need more than one, that's not a problem (as long as you have it!).;
, Using scissors, cut 2"" to 3"" (5 to 7.5 cm) slits down the side of the sheet. Don't feel the need to bust out the ruler -- if they're uneven, that's fine. Mummies look better when they're asymmetrical and full of imperfections.

, They will have a perfect mummy-style frayed edge. These become your mummy bandages.


Again, if they don't rip perfectly, don't freak out. If you absolutely must, grab a pair of scissors and start ""redirecting"" the rip; then, resume tearing as normal.

, The look that you are aiming to achieve is the dirty, off-white, centuries-old mummy look. To get this look you'll be dying your fabric with teabags!


Get out a large pot. Fill it 2/3 full with water and bring it to a boil.
Add in a handful of teabags. Presumably, the larger the costume wearer, the more fabric you'll be using, and the more teabags you'll need. For a child, a few is good. For an adult, kick it up to a handful.

If you don't have teabags, use watered down coffee.Stir in the material and steep for about 30 minutes to an hour.
Take the material out and let it dry. If you'd like, take some black face paint and haphazardly brush some on at random intervals. To speed up the process, throw it all in a pillowcase, tie it up, and toss it in the dryer.

The pillowcase is necessary to avoid getting a mess all over your dryer. Don't skip this part if you choose to do it!

Start from the bottom and begin sewing your strips on both legs.,
Turn the pants inside out and sew up the legs.,
Put on your outfit.",How to Make a Mummy Costume2," While you don't need to wrap them (they wouldn't stay in place anyway), make sure they're long enough to go around the entire shirt. Place them nonchalantly; you probably don't want to be the most well-manicured at the party. Work from the bottom up, stopping when you get to the chest area.


Thermal underwear is probably preferable to your shirt and pants combo, looks-wise, at least. But if you don't have it around, don't want to spend the extra money, and want a two-piece outfit, this is the way to go.

, This is the most time-consuming part of making the costume. The good news is, the sloppier and less conformed that the strips are sewn on, the better. Leave some strips open, some longer. It's a mummy costume--you seriously cannot muck it up!

, This should open it up, allowing you to lay the shirt down and see the entirety of the sleeve. That way, you'll be able to sew the strips on without worrying about rotating and curving.


So do just that! Lay the t-shirt down flat. Cut some pieces of the bandage material to make them the appropriate length for the sleeves and sew them on, layer by layer by layer. Continue sewing the rest of the strips once you have completed both sleeves.

, It's important to sew from the inside to avoid any visible seams. You want people wondering if you raided a pyramid for this thing. (Who's to say you didn't?)

, Lay them flat and cut your strips out to cover them. Employ the same I'm-in-a-rush mentality you had for the shirt.

, You can stop when you get to the crotch because your shirt should cover the rest. However, a little extra mummy wrap is a good idea if you have it. A stiff breeze or a limbo contest could present itself, after all.

, If the seam isn't perfect, great! Leave it. Who's gonna see it anyway?

, Ahh! Oh, that's just you in the mirror. Phew. Now what to do with your hands and feet? A few more strips here, a few more strips there (around a pair of gloves and socks or two) and you're set! Scroll to the bottom for tips on what to do with your noggin.

Tie four or five strips together.,
Put on your long underwear or white base outfit.,
Start wrapping up a leg.,
Wrap up from the waist and over the shoulders.,
Wrap up the arms.",How to Make a Mummy Costume3," The knots in the end will actually add texture to your mummy and look purposeful -- not like you took the easy way out!

, Any combination of white long-sleeved something and white pair of pants will suit this costume. However, something bulky (like cargo pants) isn't ideal for your mummy silhouette.


Don't forget those thick wool socks!

, You can either use overlapping to secure the end, or just add another tie (since you already have loads, it'll blend right in). Go in straight lines, criss-cross, and however else you need to cover every inch. Repeat for the other leg and hips. When you hit the end of your strip, either tie on another one, tie it to an already-wrapped section, or just tuck it in.


With material from one leg, wrap around the pelvis. This can be your first or second leg. But don't wrap above the waistline of the pants -- those glasses of Halloween punch will be no match for even the steeliest of bladders. What a nightmare.

, This is easiest if you form an X over the sternum and wrap strap-like strips over the shoulders. A fair amount of overlap will be needed to cover every inch. Again, if you run out, just tie on another strip or tie off the one you're using and start anew.

, If you've ever wrapped a wrist for boxing or other sport, use the same artful weaving between the fingers. If you haven't...well, weave the material between the fingers, around the base of the thumb, and onto the wrist, over and over. In case you run out, start at the fingers and work your way up to the shoulder.

Cover your face with excess bandage material.,
If your face is visible, add some makeup.,
Go trick or treating in your new disguise.",How to Make a Mummy Costume4," The freakier you want to be, the more your face should be covered. If you're going for the cute, innocuous, smiling kind of mummy, just wrap from your chin, over your head, and a bit on your forehead. If your aim is to scare all the neighbors, only leave space to see and breathe.


Rope a friend into doing this part for you. You'll be able to get it on, but tying it securely will prove a task, especially if you have limited vision.
If you have a ski mask and want your entire face covered, you can use it as a base for your head wrap.
A safety pin, bobby pin, or other securing device may prove useful. Just tuck it into a different layer to keep it from being exposed.

, You want sunken eyes and hollow cheeks. A bit of white as a base and black around your cheekbones and under your eyes will give you a more ghastly feel. Add some baby powder on your body for the ancient mummy effect and you're ready!


Use gel around a stain or on your face to make your mummy globby and rotting-looking. Pull some hair out from a place or two and mess it up to look truly nightmarish., Or sit on your porch as the kiddies come up, be very still, and jump at them when they're least expecting it! Ha HA!

Use a paper template.,

Design your own mask.,
Trace the design.,
Cut out the shape of your mask.",How to Make a Superhero Mask1," If you’re looking to make the mask of a specific super hero, you’ll probably want to use a template to make sure you get all of the details right. You can find a lot of super hero mask templates online, particularly websites like Pinterest. A Google Image search will also turn up templates you can use.

When you’re choosing a template, keep in mind your own skills. You don’t want to select something too intricate if you’ve never made this type of mask before.;
, If you’ve already got a mask that you’ve used before but it’s a little beat up, you can use it to trace the same design onto new material. This is also a good option if you’re making a group costume and everyone needs the same mask., If you’re good at drawing, you can design your own mask. You can draw the mask of a super hero that everyone knows, or you can draw an original design. This gives you more freedom in how the mask will look., Whether you’re using a template or a freehand design, trace it on to the material you’ve chosen for your mask. You can use a pen or a marker to trace the design. A marker is probably best because it will be easier to see when you’re cutting out the design., Once you’ve traced your design on your fabric, you’ll need to cut it out. If you’re working with little kids, an adult should do this part. Use a larger pair of scissors, especially if you’re using a thicker material like craft foam.Don’t worry if you don’t cut exactly on the lines you’ve drawn. When you paint or decorate the mask, these lines will get covered up anyway.
Fold the mask in half to make sure that the eye holes you’ve cut out (and any other holes, depending on the design) are even. Folding it over and then cutting off excess material makes your mask nice and symmetrical.

Play spooky music in the background.,Happy spooking!",How to Be Spooky," Being really spooky takes time, so don't expect to have Scooby & the Gang chasing you overnight. First off, you need to give yourself a really spooky image.;
, Dracula's fangs and cape can really accentuate a spooky outfit, and Frankenstein's stitching and mechanical accessories also make a great start. Remember that Halloween is a great time to stock up on essentials for a cost that doesn't leave your ""spiderweb purse"" empty!

, Makeup is essential on both men and women. A pale white face with some eye makeup as dark as your soul are utterly essential (unless you're aiming for a Frankenstein/Zombie look, where pale green tinges are acceptable)! Fake blood around your pitch black lips can really send a shiver down people's spines, and for the real artist, try drawing bones or bats across your face.

, Most people would think ""Great! I look like Herman Munster, I am all ready to go out and be spooky"", but think again! You need to be able to act spooky as well. Greet your friends with a frightful ""boo!"" and leap out at them as if springing from the grave. Practice walking in a distinctive, spooky fashion. Perhaps a zombie-like stance (think Dawn of the Dead), a werewolf prowl or a ghostly glide whilst emitting menacing wails. For the expert, an even scarier ""crooked back fiend"", hunching over whilst waving your clawed hands towards unsuspecting victims. For this look, introduce a twitching eye, a homemade hunchback and screeching bizarre noises.

, Sleeping is a necessity even for the spookiest among us. A coffin or dungeon would be most appropriate. But if these are un-attainable attaching yourself upside-down from a curtain rail will suffice, make sure to keep your arms crossed to really give the neighbours a fright!

, For entertainment purposes, (even Dracula get bored sometimes!) try reading a Goosebumps book by candlelight or visiting the local graveyard to meet up with your pals from beyond the crypt.

, Every ghoul need to eat, but a diet of simply moldy pumpkin, maggots and human blood may get a little boring though try to limit yourselves to foods that look spooky. Ketchup or jam ""blood"" sarnies look hair-raising but taste delicious and adding green food colouring to milk really adds a scare to your cereal. On Sundays try a terri-fry-up: Bacon made from the pigs of the damned, eggs laid by raven and black (soul) pudding are horrifically tasty!

, It could be your dog, your relatives, or even your skeleton friends., Remember: location is very important; after all, you can't spook your friend in a water park in the afternoon, as they wouldn't care. But if you spook them in a graveyard at nighttime, then they will be sure to get the shivers down their spine., Have it looping in your room/hideout or eerily emanating from your portable digital device.,"

Use fabric for little kids.,
Add extra fabric.,
Use elastic to wear it.",How to Make a Superhero Mask2," If you’re making a mask for kids, a soft fabric like cotton is the best material to use. The mask will be breathable, and it will be more comfortable for little kids. It’s also a good choice if you’re making a mask for an adult but you’ll be somewhere hot, like a party.You can also use felt, although this could be hotter and more uncomfortable on the face.

, If you’re making a fabric mask, you can decorate it with fabric accents once you have the basic mask cut out. You can also add fabric to masks made from other materials to give the mask more depth and detail., Once your mask is complete, you’ll need to find a way to attach it to your face. Poke two holes in the side of the mask, and put one end of an elastic band through each hole and tie them off.Make sure you measure the elastic before you tie it off. You don’t want the mask to feel too tight or to keep falling off! Measure it by wrapping a piece around your head and making a mark where the elastic ends.

Use cereal boxes for a group craft.,
Break down the boxes.,
Use spray paint.,
Attach a stick.",How to Make a Superhero Mask3," If you’re making superhero masks as part of a superhero themed party, especially for kids, making them out of a cereal box is a cheap and easy option. Just ask each guest to bring an empty cereal box to the party., Before you trace a design onto your cardboard, you'll need to break the cereal boxes down so that they're flat. Simply tear each box open at the places where it's sealed with glue., If you’re using craft foam or cardboard, you can spray paint the mask to give it color. You can use one color or multiple colors, particularly if your mask has an intricate design). If you want to use multiple colors, tape off the edges of the area where you want to paint. This keeps the color in that area. If you are using multiple colors, let each color dry before you move on the next. Putting tape over wet paint will cause the paint to peel off.You should only use spray paint in a well-ventilated area or outside.

, Once your mask is finished, you'll need a way to wear it. Using crafting sticks to make a handle by hot gluing a stick to the bottom of the mask. This allows you to ""wear"" the mask by holding it in front of your face."

Use craft foam for durability.,
Heat the mask.,
Shape the mask.,
Spray the mask with a sealant.,
Decorate the mask.,
Reseal the mask.,
Use spirit gum to attach the mask.",How to Make a Superhero Mask4," If you’re designing a mask that you want to last a little longer - for example, if you’re using it for Comi-Con or cosplaying - use craft foam. It’s very pliable but will also hold its shape well once it’s set., If you’re using craft foam, you’ll need to make it pliable by holding it over heat. This could be an open flame on your stove or the heat from a hair dryer. You should only need to hold the mask over the heat for a few seconds. Once you feel the foam become pliable in your hand, it's ready for the next step., One benefit of craft foam is that you can use it to create a mask that’s really durable but also fits your face well. Once the foam is warm and pliable, press the mask to your face to shape it to your exact features.You can also use a Styrofoam head – like the kind available at craft stores for designing wigs – to shape your mask. Press the mask onto the Styrofoam head and hold it there with crafters’ tape., If you’re using craft foam, you’ll want to spray the mask with a sealant like Mod Podge, which will help the mask keep its shape and durability. Let the sealant dry completely before you begin to decorate the mask., You can use pretty much any decorating supplies to decorate a craft foam mask. You can spray paint it, add other fabrics or things like sequins, or paint it with craft pain., If you’re using craft foam, you’ll want to reseal the mask with Mod Podge again to protect the paint and make the mask more durable., Spirit gum is a skin-friendly adhesive that you can place directly on the mask and then press to your face. This allows you to wear the mask without needing a stick or piece of elastic to hold it in place."

, This should be the where you want the top of the mask to end.









If you want a full face mask, draw a line at your hairline.
If you want a masquerade look, cut just above the brow.

, Cut around the marks. They do not have to be perfectly circular or almond-shaped at this juncture.









Cut holes to fit the design of your mask. If you want large eyes, make some serious snips. If you want snake eyes, cut two small slits.

, Following a line along your upper lip, cut the bottom jaw off the mask.









The cut should be about 2 cm (3/4 inch) below the tip of the nose
This creates a more pronounced nose and chin.

, They should be an inch (2.54 cm) below the nose. Fold in.









It should now look as if the top of the mouth is forming.

, They should be small -- their purpose is just to round out the top of the mask.









Tape the slits with the material slightly overlapping to curve the forehead.

,









Whisk water and flour in a wide-brimmed bowl until it becomes a paste.
Tear or cut strips of newspaper about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide.
Dip the paper and apply. Repeat until whole mask is covered.
Allow it to dry (or use a hairdryer to speed up the process).
Apply another layer. This time, add more layers to the mouth to give the illusion of lips.

The extra volume creates sturdier ears. Of course, make whatever shape fits your mask.

, Place the tape on the front and back.









Apply two layers of paper mache to the ears and let dry.
If any area of the mask is left wanting, apply more paper mache now.

, These should be the same size (or slightly larger than) the newspaper but placed vertically.

Apply white acrylic paint on the mask for a base layer.

Leave it to fully dry.


Draw your design on the mask -- depending on your confidence level, this could be with pencil, pen, or paint.

If water is pooling, use paper towels to dab it away.


Rub the fibers from each strip into each other for a smooth look -- they should seem to converge and bond.

, Do this when it is mostly dry.









If it is cold, it has not completed drying.

, Be sure it has fully dried!









If you want a slightly different shape, use the plastic mask as a guide. For a longer chin, place the cloth layer slightly above where it would naturally lie. Add more plaster cloth to the chin, extending it. For a longer forehead, do the opposite. For wide cheeks, place off to the right and left.

You may have to apply strength to adjust the mask; don't worry, everything is reversible at this stage. Bend it to your will. If something goes awry, hold it from the back and reapply.



, Cut, roll, and mold the cloth into your desired shape. Add another layer on top to smooth it out, if desired.

, You want the fabric to be long enough so that you can wrap it around you head, tie it, and have a couple inches leftover—about 3 feet (0.91 meters). If this is for an adult, start with a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide strip.If this is for a child. start with a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) wide strip., There are two ways you can do this. You can measure the distance between your eyes, and make marks on the mask. You can also drape the mask across your face, and make marks over your eyes with a pen., Spread the mask out on a flat surface. Draw two almond-shaped eyeholes on the mask, right where you made the marks. It is better to start with smaller shapes that you think you might need. Remember, you can always cut the holes bigger if they are too small.

, Make a small slit in the center of each eye, then cut the holes out along the eyes that you drew.

, Be sure to tie the mask behind your head, as the fabric will scrunch up a little. If the eye holes are too small, take the mask off and make them bigger.

With this option, all you have to do is color it in and cut it out.This will also make it easier to get various kinds of monkey masks such as a simple ape or a lemur.
Search for monkey mask templates and pick whichever option you like best.
Check out a good option at http://www.firstpalette.com/tool_box/printables/monkeymask.html.
You could also use the one at http://www.woojr.com/printable-animal-masks-monkey-mask/.;
, You can use regular paper if that’s all you have, but making the mask with cardstock is sturdier so the mask will last longer. White cardstock is probably your best option, but if you’re in a pinch for time you could use tan or brown so you don’t have to color it.

, You may also find a mask template that is already colored in, and if you don’t mind using colored ink to print, you can save time that way too. Check out the dimension that the mask will print to make sure that it is big enough to fit your head. Making it fill most of a standard 8 ½ x 11 piece of paper should do.

, If you want the monkey to be festive or exotic, you can use other colors. This is the part where you can be creative to get the look you find most interesting. Using markers is the quickest way to get a good color.


If you want an even nicer look, you could use craft paint. The majority of the face should be brown, while some areas around the ears, mouth, and nose might be colored tan.
If you find a template that has the mouth open at all, you can color it with red.

, Make sure you use sharp scissors and take your time during this step. Carefully cut just inside the printed outline so that none of the outline is left on the mask. Cut slowly so that you finish with a smooth outline, not a wavy or crooked one., A razor knife can cut circles around the eye holes much more easily than scissors. Set the mask down on a cutting board or a piece of cardboard and carefully cut out the eye holes.Always be sure to use a sharp, clean blade so you can get a smooth cut. Sharp blades are safer than dull blades.
Depending on the template, you most likely have some freedom in regards to how much of the eye you want to cut out. You can cut small pupil holes and leave the rest of the eye colored in, or you can cut the entire circle of the eye out so you’ll see most of the eyes of whoever wears the mask.

, You’ll be cutting holes which you’ll feed some string through to hold the mask. The purpose of this tape is to strengthen the paper so that the holes don’t rip out when the string pulls on the mask.

, With the razor knife, cut a small hole through the tape and paper just under each ear. Feed a piece of yarn, elastic string, or rubber band through each hole.You can either make a small knot which will keep the string from slipping out of the hole, or you can loop the string around the outer edge of the mask tying it in a knot.
You can attach a separate string to each hole, which would tie in the back of the head, or you can tie one string connecting both holes. Make sure the string is long enough to fit around the wearer’s head.
If you use rubber bands, you’ll loop them around your ears when you wear the mask.

, Another option is to skip the strap altogether and simply glue a popsicle stick to the bottom of the mask, which allows you to hold the mask up to your face without it being stuck there.

The width of your nose
The height of your nose;
, The mask's shape is roughly a rectangle with a rounded bottom, with places for eyeholes and a mouth hole. You can find a reference picture of the mask online to guide you.


You'll also need to mark out a hole for your nose to fit into the mask. Although the mask features a nosepiece, you'll want space for your nose so you can wear the mask if you choose.

Cut a shield-shaped outline from a piece of construction paper.,
Use enlarged comma shapes for the eyes.,
Use a jellybean shape for the mouth.,
Glue a popsicle stick to the mask.",How to Make a Mask out of Construction Paper1," These instructions show you how to make a mask resembling the ""comedy"" and ""tragedy"" masks that are often used to symbolize the concept of drama. Though the expression on each of these masks is different, the overall shape of both masks is the same - roughly the shape of a rounded shield or crest. Cut this shape from your piece of construction paper. You'll want to use most of your paper so that your mask is big enough to cover your face.;
, Both the comedy and tragedy masks use the same basic shape for the eyes - a rounded comma or half-crescent shape with one thick end and one tapering end. However, based on whether you're making the comedy or tragedy mask, the placement of these shapes changes. For the comedy mask, cut the comma shapes into the mask so that the thick ends face outward. This imitates the merry, rising cheeks of a laughing face.For the tragedy mask, cut the comma shapes so that the thick ends face inward to imitate the furrowed brow of a sad or dismayed face.


In either case, cut out the eyes by gently folding the mask so that you're able to cut spaces in the center of the mask without cutting in from the side.

, As with the eyes, the basic shape of the mouth in both the comedy and tragedy masks is the same, but the orientation of the shape changes. For the comedy mask, draw a smile by cutting an upward-curving jellybean shape. For the tragedy mask, flip this jellybean shape upside down to create a frown.


Again, in either case, fold the paper and make a small cut in the middle of your shape to allow yourself to cut out the mouth without having to cut in from the side of the mask.

, Often, tragedy and comedy masks are represented as being attached to sticks that a performer can use to hold them in front of his or her face. You can recreate this with a popsicle stick - simply glue a popsicle stick to the bottom or the side of your mask to give yourself a handle with which to hold your mask.


If you don't have any popsicles in your freezer, you can buy some for cheap at a crafts store or simply use a wooden dowel or a piece of disposable silverware in a pinch.

You can also use an existing mask as a template.
You will be placing colored fabric across this mask, so make sure that it is tall enough.

, If you want to, you can add a slight curve or groove to the bottom-center of the mask for the nose bridge. Don't worry about the eye holes just yet.

, The strip needs to be long enough so that you can wrap it around the person's head, tie it in a knot, and have a couple of inches left over. It needs to be wide enough to cover the eyes, but without covering the green mask. What color the fabric is depends on what turtle the person wants to be:Donatello = purple
Leonardo = blue
Michelangelo = orange
Raphael = red

, Place the fabric strip across the mask, right where the eyes would go. Make sure that the fabric is centered, with equal amounts hanging off to either side. Once you are happy with the placement, secure the fabric to the mask with hot glue or fabric glue.If you are using fabric glue, let the glue dry before moving on to the next step.

, The easiest way to do this would be to measure the distance between the person's eyes, and then draw the eye holes on the mask.You can also drape the foam across your face, make marks where your eyes are, then draw the eyes out.


Make the eye holes almond-shaped.

, The easiest way to do this would be with a craft blade. If you don't have one, cut a slit in the center of each eye, then cut around the lines that you drew., If the fabric is loose around the eyeholes, secure it with more glue. For an added touch, cut the ends of the fabric strip at angles. You could also cut notches into them as well.

",How to Make a Monkey Mask2," You’ll probably want the eating side of the plate to be the face, but it’s up to you exactly how you want the mask to look. If you want to use more than one shade of brown you can add depth to the face.You can use craft paint if you have some handy or you want to buy some. You can also use a brown marker. Crayon or colored pencil will work but will not give you a full color.
If you paint it, let it dry as directed by the paint bottle. You’ll probably need at least 20 minutes.

, Make a straight line from edge to edge on the plate. Start about one inch down the line and draw the left curve of the heart up to the edge of plate and extending down to one inch from the bottom of the center line. Repeat for the right side of the heart.

, It’s not important for the bottom of the heart to be perfect, as it will be covered up. Just make sure the top has two nice curves. These will form the top of the opening for the eyes. It may work best to use a razor knife with the plate sitting on a cutting board or a piece of cardboard.


Don’t throw this piece away because you’ll be using it again soon.

, You can use scissors this time since you aren’t cutting out of the middle. You can cut perfect half-circles, or you can make them more oblong and ear-shaped.


Since monkeys often have large ears, it is okay to exaggerate the size of the ears a little bit. The size of the ears is up to you.
It may be easiest to simply cut the rounded tops off of the heart and use these pieces as the ears of the mask.

, These half circles will be the inner part of the ear that is lighter than the rest. You can cut them in the exact same shape as the ear pieces you just cut, or you can shape them more like an inner ear with curves.


If you don’t have tan or cream paper, you could cut the inner ear from the heart shape and color the unpainted part tan.
You could also cut from white paper and color the shapes tan.

, Using a glue stick is best because it dries faster and makes less of a mess. Line the small half-circles up on the big half-circles and glue in place. Then glue the whole ear to the back of the mask in the proper place, with the brown part matching the brown of the face.

, Using the tan paper from before, cut out an oval shape, which will be the mouth and the nose of the mask. You can draw the shape first, or you can simply cut an oval shape out of the paper.If you don’t have tan paper to use, white paper will work, but you’ll need to color it tan so it looks right.
Make the oval large enough that when you attach it to the paper plate, the heart shape you previously cut will be completely covered except for where the eyes are.
On the other hand, you want to make sure that the oval is doesn’t take up more than half of heart shape from top to bottom. If the area where you cut the heart shape from is seven inches or so, your oval should probably be about three inches tall, and four inches wide.

, The long side of the oval should be horizontal. The mouth can look however you want it to. It could be a fairly straight line across the oval, or could be a smile, or you could even draw it so it looks like the mouth is open.


The nose can just be two nostrils or two curves with nostrils under them.
You don’t have to scrutinize this part too closely, as people will be able to tell it’s a mouth and nose.

, Using a glue stick, glue the tan paper toward the bottom of the heart that you cut out of the plate previously. Don’t put the mouth too far down, but make sure it covers the bottom of the shape you cut out.


A little glue on each end of the oval should hold it in place.

, This will allow the wearer of the mask to hold the mask in place rather than having it sit right against their face.You can also cut holes just under the ears and tie a string through them to hold the mask in place.

Affix the ""L"" inside its circle on the nosepiece.

",How to Make a Loki Mask2," Again, use a reference picture to guide you. The nosepieces should roughly resemble elongated hourglasses, with the nose-end lobe longer than the forehead lobe.


You're cutting three pieces so that you can layer them over your nose. If you have a particularly long nose, you may want to cut four or five.

, This will give your nose ""breathing room"" when you don the mask.


Although you can cut square holes to fit your nose, you may want to cut the nose holes to the end of the nose lobe to expose your nostrils if you plan to wear the mask for extended periods.

, This is where you'll put the ""L"" that identifies the mask as the Mask of Loki.

, You may want to temporarily tape each nosepiece in place as your adjust their positions and refine your nose holes, then glue them in place when you're satisfied with their arrangement.

, You can create the four nose rivets in one of several ways:


Cut out cardboard circles.
Use the plastic or metal heads off thumbtacks. (Do not use the entire tack.)
Use actual light rivet heads.

, Use the reference picture as your guide to place them correctly.

, The ""L"" should be slightly italicized, without serifs, and of a size appropriate to fit within the circle. Again, consult the reference picture.

Paper towel is suggested for the faceplate, with toilet tissue for the nosepiece.
Avoid putting newsprint on the nosepiece, so that its details show up better.

, You want to create a gentle curve that matches your face, not a severe curve.


You may need to tape the back side of the mask to the surface it's drying on to prevent it from straightening as the papier mache dries.

Use a length of string to make a headband.",How to Make a Mask out of Construction Paper2," These instructions use about three or four differently-colored sheets of construction paper to make a fun mask. You shouldn't need any more than a standard-sized sheet of each. This mask also uses standard white paper for the eyes, but it's semi-important to use construction paper as the base material of the mask itself because it's sturdier.


Making a mask out of just a single piece of construction paper is certainly possible, but using multiple pieces of paper as your base lets you pick color combinations you like.

, Masks come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. This particular mask is roughly oval-shaped, like a real human face. To make this oval shape, fold one of your sheets of construction paper in half, then cut off the corners opposite the crease with curved, rounded cuts. When unfolded, your paper should have a symmetrical oval shape. This will serve as our mask's face.

, Cut your second sheet of construction paper in half by folding it down the middle and cutting along the crease. Then, make two small ovals by using the method in the step above for each of the half-sheets: fold down the middle, then use a curved cut to remove the corners opposite the crease.


These ovals aren't the eyes themselves - rather, they're the outlines of the eyes. So, make these ovals slightly larger than you'd like the eyes themselves to be.

, Secure your eye outlines to the mask with glue, a glue stick, tape, or any similar adhesive. Ensure that they're level with each other, unless you want your mask to have misaligned eyes.

, Take a sheet of white paper - you can use white construction paper, but standard 8x11 printer paper also works well - and cut it into two ovals using the technique described above. These ovals will be the eyes, so make them just a little smaller than the eye outlines that you just glued to the mask. When your white ovals are ready, glue each one in the center of one of the larger eye outlines that you've already placed on the face.

, Use a black pen or marker to give your mask's eyes pupils (the black circles at the center of an eyeball). Not only will pupils make your mask look more realistic, but they will also help hide the holes that you'll add to your mask so that you can see through it.

, To make your nose, you may want to use the same oval-cutting technique as before, then add small notches to your oval to make nostrils. Alternatively, you can use a simple triangle or a more realistic curved appearance - the choice is yours.


When you've finished your nose, use glue to secure it in the center of the face below the eyes.

, Use the leftovers of the eye outline construction paper to form two eyebrows for your mask. Glue these eyebrows above the eyes. You have many options here when it comes to shapes - you can cut thin eyebrows, thick ones, curved ones, or even zig-zag ones.

, Fold a third sheet of construction paper in half. Cut a curved scimitar or cornucopia shape in your paper, making it thickest at the crease and increasingly thinner as it goes toward the ""open"" end of your folded paper. Unfolded, this should give you a smile-shaped mouth (or, if you turn it over, a frown). Glue this to your mask under the nose.


If you have leftover white paper from cutting out your eyes, you may want to use it to cut small, square teeth for your mouth.

, Take a square piece of paper of the color of your choosing and cut long strips into it lengthwise. Stop your cuts just short of the far side of the paper - in other words, don't quite cut all the way through the paper. Next, use your scissors to put curls in your hair - hold one blade of the scissor against the paper, then pull it firmly down the length of the strip. This process is the same as that used to curl ribbons.


To expedite this step, you may want to stack two sheets of paper on top of each other before every step. This way, you'll cut identical strips into two sheets of paper at the same time, curl two sheets of paper at the same time, etc.

, Cut your strips of hair as short as you'd like them, then glue your hair around the upper edge of your mask to give your mask a full head of luscious locks. If your mask's hair is especially curly, you may also want to use it for sideburns, and if it's especially short and straight, it can make a mean mustache.

, Put a small hole in the center of each eye so that you can see through your mask while you wear it. You can do this by carefully folding the mask at each eye and using a pair of scissors to cut a half-circle in the center which, unfolded, will make a small circle. You can also use a hole punch, if you have one handy.

, To be able to wear your mask, try making a small hole at either edge of the face and tying a loose string from one to the other along the back. Slip this string over your head to create a makeshift headband.


You can also glue a short stick (like a popsicle stick) to the bottom of the mask to give yourself a handle to hold the mask in front of your face with.

Get a wooden dowel that is between 10 and 13 inches (25.4 and 33.02 centimeters).You can find them at craft stores; they are usually sold in packs.,
Sand down one end of the dowel so that it is rounded.,
Use hot glue to build up the handle part, if desired.,
Consider hot gluing a bead or button to the base of your wand.,
Use a hot glue gun to draw designs on the rest of the wand, if desired.,
Paint your dowel with a base color using acrylic paint and let it dry.,
Add some weathering.,
Let the paint dry, then seal the wand to make it last longer.",How to Make a Harry Potter Wand1," You can also get a longer dowel and cut it down using a hacksaw.


You can also use a stick that you found outside. Make sure that it is no thicker than your finger, close to the length you want it, and fairly straight.;
, This will make the tip.You can even sand the wand so that it tapers slightly, just like the wands in the movies. Start with a coarse-grit sandpaper and finish off with a finer grit.


If you are using a stick, you'll wand to sand down any sharp, pointy, or jagged ends. You can leave the bark and knobs on the stick, or you can cut/sand them off.

, The handle part is usually about the length of your finger. Use the hot glue to cover the entire handle of your wand. Let the glue harden, and add 2 to 3 more layers, if desired.Not all wands have to have a handle. For example, Hermione's wand did not have a handle on it.
Once the hot glue hardens, you can ""carve"" designs into it with the hot nozzle of the glue gun.

, Some wands have a knob at the end of the handle. You can make one by hot gluing a fancy button or bead to the end. Pick something that is about the same width as the base of your wand; you don't want it to be too big.Don't worry about the color; you'll be painting it later.

, This is ideal for creating swirly designs on the wand, like Hermione Granger's. You can do this by twirling the wand between your fingers while drawing with the hot glue gun. Also, if you don't have hot glue you can use tape wrapped around it to make a handle or use clay to make a nice handle without a glue gun.

, Most wands will be some shade of brown, but you can also make your wand black or white. To give it some extra texture, paint it several shades of the same color. For example, you can make your wand brown with light brown and dark brown streaks.


Consider using watered-down acrylic paint so that the wood's original texture shows through.

, Take a darker shade of your base color, and use it to fill in any nooks and crannies on your wand. Then, take a lighter shade of your base color, and use it to highlight any raised areas on your wand. Use a small, pointed brush to do this.

, Take your wand outside and set it down on a sheet of newspaper. Spray it with a clear, acrylic sealer and let it dry. Then, flip the wand over and spray the other side. Let the sealer dry and repeat if needed.


Sealing the wand is not absolutely necessary, but it will make the paint job last longer! You can use a glossy, satin, or matte finish.

Decorate your mask.",How to Make a Carnival Mask," A simple and inexpensive way to make a form for you mask is to use a balloon. The balloon is inflated to a size that is roughly that of your face. The paper mache will be placed over the balloon which is later popped, leaving you with only your mask., For a simple mask you can make use of cardboard or poster-board pieces to build the mask's form. Cardboard or poster board can be a great choice for your mask form, allowing you to create a stable shape that you find interesting. Cut out a flat piece of cardboard or poster-board that roughly matches the shape of your face.
Cut out smaller pieces and glue them to the first flat piece to build features like noses or mouths.

, If you want your mask to be highly detailed and have complex shapes, using paper and tape to build a form is the best option. On top of a flat mask base made from a piece of cardboard, paper is wadded up into bundles and taped down, forming any shapes you might want.This method allows you to make detailed and complex shapes.
Smooth shapes are possible to create with this method as well.
Try to line up your masks eyes, nose and mouth with your own so that you can see and breath out of it once it is done. Hold the mask form up to your face to get a rough idea of where these features should go.

, The first step in making paper mache involves preparing your paper. The paper will bind with your glue and help to form the sturdy body of your mask. Take which ever type of paper you wish to use and tear it into narrow strips which will later be laid on your mask, covering the form and creating the mask.Tear the paper into strips.
Strips should be around 1 inch wide by 6 inches long.
Newspaper is the most commonly used type of paper.
Colored paper can be used if you don't plan on painting your mask.
When building your final layer, using white paper can help cut down on the amount of paint needed.

, After you've prepared your paper you will need to prepare the paste which is the other key ingredient in paper mache. There are a few recipes for paper mache that you can make use of. However, all will have the final effect of binding your mask and making a strong material when dry. Try some of the following recipes to make a paper mache paste:Add ¼ cup water to ¾ cup and mix together.
Boil 1 cup of flour mixed with 5 cups of water for about three minutes.
Mix 1 cup of water with 1 cup of flour and mix them together.

, Once you are ready to start building your carnival mask, you will need to coat your strips in the paste. The paper will form the body of your mask and the paste will allow it to dry into the hardened final form of your mask. Dip your paper strips into your paste mix, covering them entirely before applying to your mask.Try dipping the strips in one at a time for the best control.

, After dipping your paper strip in the paste mixture it's time to apply it to your mask. Take your time and try to apply the coated strip evenly and as smoothly as you can. There will likely be some overlap but try to make each strip cover as much of your mask form as possible. Continue applying strips until your mask has been completely covered in a few layers.


Apply no more than 4 layers of paper mache strips.
Work slowly and try to have each strip cover as much area as possible.

, Once your mask has had the initial few layers applied to the form you will need to wait for them to dry. Adding more layers too early can cause problems with the first layers hardening properly, making the whole process take longer. Make sure your first application of paper mache is fully dry before continuing.This may take up to 24 hours for a layer to completely dry.

, If you feel that your mask is still to thin or not sturdy enough you may add additional layers of paper mache. Once the first layer is completely dry add more strips of paper mache over it, working slowly and making sure each strip covers as much area as possible.Apply no more than four layers of paper mache at this time.
Repeat the drying and covering process until it's as thick as you like.

, On the final application of paper mache to the mask form you can add something to make your mask wearable. Exactly what you add will depend on the style of mask you are making. Whichever methods you use should allow your mask to be held to your face and let you see, breath, or speak through it.Between two paper clips, attach a length of string. Place one paper clip on each side of the mask and cover them with paper mache. Once dried, your string will be held in place, creating a strap to hold you mask on.
A simple and traditional method of wearing a carnival mask is to attach a stick and hold the mask up to your face. Take a stick or pipe and attach it to the chin of your mask with paper mache, which when dry will hold the two together.
Cut out eye, mouth, or nose holes with scissors or a knife. Hold the mask up to your face to get an idea of where these holes will need to go. Marking these areas with a pen before you cut can be helpful.

, Once your mask is fully formed with the paper mache and has completely dried you can remove the form. Work slowly as you release the form from the paper mache mask to make sure they are coming apart without damaging either. Once your form is removed, you will be left with only your paper mache mask.It is possible to save your mold and make more masks.
Work slowly to avoid damaging your mask.

, Having a fully formed and dried paper mache mask calls for decoration. Carnival masks are known for their colorful and dramatic features and your mask will need to match that style. Feel free to let your imagination run wild as you decorate your paper mache carnival mask.Paint it with any colors or designs that you find appealing.
Add decorations such as gems or feathers with a hot glue gun.

Seal the wand with a clear, acrylic sealer to make the paint last longer.",How to Make a Harry Potter Wand2," If you are making this for a child, a regular chopstick will work just fine. If you are making this for a teen or an adult, consider getting one of those 15-inch (38.1 centimeters) bamboo cooking chopsticks.








Don't worry about the color; you will be painting it later on!
Can't find a chopstick? You can try using a long, wooden paintbrush instead. Just snap the brush part off, just below the metal crimp. You can also saw it off using a hacksaw.

, The handle should be about the length of your finger. Cover the handle area with hot glue let it harden. Add 2 to 3 more layers, if needed.









To create a wand like Harry's, draw vertical lines to make the handle. Make them thicker at the base of the wand and thinner towards the other end of the handle.
Some wands are plain but others, such as Hermione Granger's, have designs on the rest of the wand. You can use the hot glue to draw vines, squiggles, or spirals. You can create a neat design just by twirling your wand in your fingers while drawing a line., Some wands have a fancier handle base. If you'd like yours to have one too, you can hot glue a small bead or fancy button to the base of your wand. The bead or button should be the same width as your wand; it should not extend past the edges by much.









Think about the bead or button's design and don't worry about the color. You will be painting this.
You can always leave the bead or button unpainted, especially if it is a pretty crystal one!

, Most wants will be some shade of brown, but the Harry Potter movies also had wands that were white or black. You can even paint your want different shades of one color to make it look more like wood.


Consider using watered-down acrylic paints if your chopsticks are made out of bamboo. This way, the original texture still shows through.

, Take the darker shade, and use it to fill in any nooks and crannies on your wand. You can use a q-tip or a pointy brush to get to those hard-to-reach areas. Then, take your lighter shade, and use it to highlight all of the raised areas.


If your wand is black, you will only need the highlights. If your wand is white, you will only need the shadows.

, Bring the wand outside and set it down on a sheet of paper. Spray it with some clear, acrylic sealer, and wait for it to dry. When the wand dries, turn it over, and spray the other side.

Seal the wand, if desired.",How to Make a Harry Potter Wand3," Start at the bottom left corner of the paper and roll it towards the upper right corner. Stop when you reach past the widest point of the paper.

, To avoid making the paper too soggy, apply the glue in a thin layer with a brush. At this point, you can also add a core to your wand. Here are some options:


Phoenix feather: red, orange, or yellow feather.
Dragon heartstring: piece of red yarn.
Unicorn hair: silver or iridescent thread or tinsel.

, This can take 20 to 30 minutes. If you do not wish to hold your wand for that long, you can secure it with some string or twist ties. The glue must be dry before you move on.

, The tightly-rolled paper is probably very pointy at both ends. Use a pair of scissors or a craft knife to trim off both of the pointy ends. You will want to trim off one end more than the other. This will make the end wider, suitable for the base of your wand.

, This will seal the tube further, and prevent it from unraveling. For an extra touch, hot glue a small fancy bead or button to the bottom of your wand. Make sure that the bead or button is the same width as your wand; it shouldn't go past the edges.

, You can use the hot glue to build up a handle for your wand; they are typically the length of your finger. You can also use the glue gun to draw swirly designs on the rest of the wand.


If you'd like, you can hot glue fancy beads or buttons to the handle to make fancy designs.

, You want using paint primer, gesso, or even decoupage glue (such as Mod Podge). Allow the primer to dry before continuing. This will prevent the paper from becoming too soggy while you paint it. If it becomes soggy, it can fall apart.

, Most wands will be some shade of brown, but there are wands in the movies that are also black or white. You can paint your wand a solid color, or different shades of the same color. For example, you could paint your wand brown, and add some lighter and darker brown streaks to it to make it look more like wood.

, This will make the designs you drew stand out more. Take a color that's slightly darker than the one you used, and apply it with a paintbrush or q-tip to all of the nooks and crannies in your design. Next, take a lighter color, and apply some highlights to all of the raised edges.


If your wand is black, you only need the highlights. If your wand is white, you only need the shadows.

, This is not completely necessary, but it will help your wand last a little longer. Go to a well-ventilated area, and set the wand down on a sheet of newspaper. Spray the wand with a clear, acrylic sealer and let it dry. Turn the wand over and spray the other side as well. Repeat this step if necessary.

, Use a marker and trace around your eyes (it might be good to follow the bones around your eye socket) for where you want to place the eye holes in your mask. Also, trace around anything else you want cut out. (Breathing holes are useful for breathing!)you might also want to cut a hole for talking too.

, Cut with sharp scissors around the edges of the mask. And note––once you cut it, you can't really go back easily, so leave extra.

, Do this either by puncturing the foil with a toothpick and tearing the foil out, or snipping in the center of the area with the tip of scissors and folding the foil back.

, These are for the ribbons/cord/shoelaces to attach the mask to your face.

, While pressing the mask to your face to keep the features strong, gently place the tape onto your mask. When you feel the mask's features are firm enough, place all the sections of tape, overlapping, across all visible places of foil, including the back (foil is itchy next to the skin).

, Leave enough length to both wrap around your head, and to tie in a nice knot or bow.

,, Paint whatever you want, making sure to leave it to dry out of the way of children or pets. You can even sprinkle glitter on the paint while it's wet if you like. Adding sequins, feathers, beads, etc. can enhance the mask.

If you're experienced in sewing, you might be able to make costume pieces to suit your taste.;
, Find a black or olive green military-styled jacket. Sew fabric of the same colour to the end of the jacket to create the jacket’s below-the-knee length.Either leave the fabric symmetrical or continue to gain inspiration from Tonks by giving the added fabric an asymmetric look.
Give the jacket exaggerated sleeves by attaching some black fabric to add onto the jacket sleeves and give it length. Sew two long cuffs that you have made out of black fabric to the ends of the jacket’s sleeves.

, Create layers with a gray hooded jacket and a burgundy hooded pullover. The pullover will be worn underneath the gray jacket. Pull both of the hoods outside of the long overcoat to recreate Tonks’ layered look.An alternative to the burgundy hooded pullover is a burgundy shirt.

Attach a safety pin to the back and decorate it with glitter or a gold-coloured marker. This is a very low-budget example for a pin-on badge.
You could also purchase some jewelry featuring a Phoenix symbol and wear that for a classier and more grown-up look. Ebay might be a helpful source to find this accessory.

, Tonks is characterized as being clumsy. Apply a stain or a scorch mark to your clothes to give it a touch of Tonks personality.

",How to Make a Harry Potter Halloween Costume," This forms the basis of the Hogwarts uniform and can be any tailored, neat white shirt you've got in the wardrobe.;
, Again, these are fairly basic and you might even get away with very neat, loose dark jeans if you can't find suitable trousers or slacks.

, If you already wear such shoes to school or work, use those. Otherwise, use your dressy shoes.

, If this proves difficult, find a tie in either a yellow or maroon plain color. Use fabric paint to add the stripes in the opposite color. When wearing, tie it on with a very loose knot. If you can't find or make a tie similar to that, you can also buy a Gryffindor tie online.

, Find a suitable school robe. An old degree ceremony or law robe is ideal; call costume stores or used clothing/thrift stores to see what's available or ask around friends and family if they're likely to have one stashed away. You could also try a search online if there's still time. Failing finding a suitable cloak, you can make a simple black cape version using black fabric cut in a cape shape; even a sheet from the thrift store dyed black can work in a pinch.


If you have a Gryffindor crest applique (look online, in costume or craft stores), sew it on the right-hand side of your robe, on your chest area. If you can't find one ready-made, you could make your own by printing the design onto iron-on transfer fabric.

,, If you can't find a scarf representing Gryffindor, try making one of your own. The article How to make a Harry Potter scarf will explain what to do.

, If you can't make or find one, don't fret, you can simply skip this step.

, Have you or someone else use the Halloween makeup to draw a lightning bolt scar on the middle of your forehead. In addition, tousle up your hair to look Harry Potter-messy; keep your hair shaggy and in your face. And while it's best you have black/dark, short hair, but don't worry if your hair is a different color––you can always wear a wig.

, These are Harry's trademark glasses. Look in thrift stores or costume stores for suitable glasses or make your own using wire.

, Either purchase a wand from a costume or magic store, or make your own Harry Potter wand. Done!

, Some hairstyles you'll find her in are straight ponytails, down with some strands pinned back to the side with a bobby pin or a simple barrette, or just straight down with a wide headband. On one occasion, however, (Slughorn's Christmas party) she was seen with slightly wavy hair.

, You can wear flats, loafers, or even black Converse sneakers. The color is the most important part here.

, Ravenclaw colors are bronze and dark blue, so wear a traditional tie that incorporates those colors in a striped pattern.

Tie the tie in any knot, but make it look neat and clean., Wear a dark blue and bronze scarf. You can purchase one online easily; Harry Potter themed costumes are very popular. However, you can also knit the scarf yourself or sew it with dark blue and gold fabric., Luna Lovegood is known for this signature necklace, which features a butterbeer cork.


To make this necklace, you should find a cork; you can use one from a bottle of wine.
Find the material you want to use for the necklace. In the movie, Luna wears a double strand, blue-beaded necklace. If you want to make this type of necklace, put small blue beads on a wire necklace that is the length of two loose necklaces. However, you can also use ribbon.

Wear purple pants.,
Put on a dark-colored, knitted sweater vest and a gray long-sleeved shirt.",How to Dress Like Luna Lovegood3," In ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,"" Luna wears this hat to show support for Gryffindor in the Gryffindor vs. Slytherin Quidditch game, even though she herself is in Ravenclaw.Purchase a lion hat like Luna’s. You might be able to find one at a costume store or online, especially online craft stores such at Etsy.com.


You can also make a lion hat. You could do this in many creative ways, but one way to do it could be starting with a bike helmet as a baseand then adding the lion’s head on top and covering the rest with fabric. You can make the lion’s head yourself, or you can buy a stuffed lion and cut the head off to attach to the bike helmet with glue. You could also papier mache the lion’s head and then glue it to the bike helmet.
Add the lion’s mane with crepe paper, yarn, or any other orange and yellow fabric, gluing it securely onto the bike helmet and covering it completely.
Luna’s style is fun and creative. Don’t be afraid to add your own style and flare to the lion hat.

, In this scene in the movie, Luna complements the yellow and orange of the lion’s head hat with purple corduroys.

Gather supplies for your hair.,
Start the hair dyeing process.,
Purchase a great wig.,
Apply your makeup.",How to Dress Up As Tonks for Halloween2," Tonks is known for her distinctive mane. In the books, her hair was described as a “shocking pink”. It has also been a purple-pink color verging on lavender, a white-blonde, and brown. Choose which version and which method you want to go with when adapting your hair to Tonks’.If you’re looking for something semi permanent or permanent, dye your hair.
If you’re looking for something more temporary, there are wigs and temporary colour hair sprays available online and at costume stores.

, Separate your hair into workable pieces to apply colour onto. Use a vegan dye that does not last too long, like the Manic Panic brand. Electric Amethyst, Red Passion, and Cotton Candy Pink are the perfect ways to get the colours you might be looking for.Red Passion and Cotton Candy Pink blended together can create the perfect pink you’re after, while Electric Amethyst can be the perfect purple. Use both dye colours to emulate the look of the Tonks represented in the films with her pink-purple combination hair.
Create the colour by adding the dye and conditioner and then mix them together. For purple dye, you will need a drop of conditioner in your mix. For the other colours, use a ratio of 3 parts conditioner to one part hair dye.

, Wigs do not stop at costume shop brand options. You can also search online for retailers that offer neon pink, lavender, or bleached lace-front wigs. They are costly, but the quality and how closely the wigs look compared to your actual hair are great benefits of choosing this option.

, This is a completely optional step, especially if you’ve decided to go big with your hair. Tonks’ makeup look is simple and will act as an extension of her distinctive trait of pink and purple hair.


Use a duo eyeshadow palette in pink or purple and an eyeshadow brush to highlight just underneath the brow with the lighter shadow in the package. Apply the darker pink or purple shade directly onto your eyelid.Use a more pointed brush and a darker purple colour to create a cat eye shape with the shadow on the outer corner of your eyelid. Blend it in with your fingertip in that area to make the shape a little softer.
Apply some mascara to your lashes and some blush with a blush brush to create some rosiness in your cheeks.
If you wish, add a sheer purple-toned metallic lipstick to your lips.

A wand could be something fun to have, so you could buy or make one.,
There is also, of course, her Hogwarts uniform.,
Ginny doesn't usually wear make-up.",How to Dress Like Ginny Weasley from Harry Potter2," She likes to wear plain colored sweaters or blouses with skinny to regular dark jeans and cute flats. She generally wears knitted tops so you can do one yourself or get your grandmother or mother to knit one for you. In the movies, Ginny is often seen wearing henley tops and fitted cardigans. If you wear long sleeve tops pull the sleeves up - it looks much better.

Slytherin references You still look a bit like just a preppy who didn't know what to wear, so now is your time to embrace your inner Harry Potter geek.",How to Dress Like a Slytherin for Halloween," This step seems kind of obvious-you're going for a preppy image but a little bit ""bad"" since Slytherin is ""evil"" (but awesome).;
, It's quite easy to find one of these--ask any guy you know or just go and buy one. Just don't make it a purposely-Halloween-Slytherin one with the snake on it--that just screams amateur. You could also go with a scarf if it's cold.

, You can just wear the standard shirt with a collar over a tank top or find something at a vintage store. Get creative!


Some people will also want to have a sort of deconstructed blazer over their top. This is cool, but don't get overly preppy--try and destroy it a little bit (this is always fun).

, Make sure they're comfortable!

,,

For this costume, costume jewelry is your friend--Slytherins are supposed to be more well off and sophisticated so feel free to load up on fake pearl necklaces and giant cocktail rings.






Horcruxes--make sure you get a Slytherin locket (like the one in the 6th and 7th book) and for your costume jewelry ring--see if it has a family crest on it and you can pass it off as a Marvolo Gaunt ring. If you want, you can also carry around a beat-up old book and say its Tom Riddle's diary.






Slytherin robe--if you buy one from one of those online costume retailers, it will look amateur (of course, you can buy one as a last resort). If you have a black sheet, try to sew it together. Add a green ribbon lining and get creative in leaving a snake emblem on the robe. Make sure it doesn't drag on the ground--that would be rather disgusting.






Dark Mark--every good Death Eater and Slytherin has one of these. Draw it in Sharpie (just make sure it doesn't smudge) or get a temporary tattoo.






Wand--obviously this is necessary or you'll be a Muggle wannabe.

Make a Slytherin tie.,
Put on a white collared shirt.,
Pull a V-neck grey top over your white shirt.,
Black dress pants for boys and a black skirt or pants for a girl are the correct wear.,
You may stop here, or you may use a large black shrug or cardigan as a robe.,
Wear the Slytherin crest.,
Finish off the look with a sleek and polished hairstyle.",How to Dress As a Slytherin in Four Different Styles1," For this, you will need a green tie, a ruler, a pencil, Scotch masking tape, and a silver paint pen. It is best if you buy an inexpensive green tie, as you will likely not be getting too much use out of it. Also, be sure the tie is in a Slytherin shade, meaning evergreen as opposed to lime or mint green.


Use the ruler to measure one inch from the very bottom point of the tie. Make a small mark with the pencil at the one inch mark, and then run the Scotch tape along this mark in a diagonal line. Repeat this all the way up the tie.
Use the paint pen to completely fill in the spaces between the Scotch tape. Make sure there is no green showing.
Allow the tie to dry before removing the tape. If done properly, you should have a series of even diagonal lines on your tie.;
, Make sure the collar is very pressed, as no Slytherin would go out looking anything less than polished. Tie on the tie. If you do not wish to make a tie, you may order a green and silver or green and white scarf. Careful, as these may be hard to find.

, You may use a grey sweater vest or sweater, as long as it has a relatively low neckline. Be sure to tuck in your tie.

, Many people choose darker wash jeans for their look though, and either are alright.

, You can also make a proper robe on your own.

, There are a wide variety of crests out there. Choose one you like from the Internet, print it, cut it our carefully, and glue to a piece of felt. Trim the felt around the edges of the crest. Sew or pin the crest to your shirt or cloak.

, The first thing you need is a ruffled tan shirt. It should preferably have a puffy collar. If you find a shirt with a ruffled collar and sleeves, but don't like some ruffles, you can cut them off. Save the ruffles for making the pants, but don't cut off all the ruffles, it is an essential part of her costume.

, They should be tight, but not too tight. Sew the ruffles on the ankles and a little bit up the calves. The ruffles on the calves should make a curved upside down V when the pant legs are pressed together.

, To make one, pick up a big swath of black fabric (satin is best) and make sure it reaches your ankles. Cut holes for your arms to go through and add sleeves that droop at the wrists. Cut off any excess fabric and sew it on to create a hood. Finally, add some silver embellishments to make it shine. Add a silver clasp at the neck to hold it together. If you want, you can also add a Slytherin crest, as that was Narcissa's house.


You can also purchase a ready-made cape or ask to borrow one.

, These should be plain, and preferably flats, although heels will work as well. If you choose heels, make sure you know how to walk in them a few day before the event you're dressing up at without tripping on the robe.

, Narcissa had black hair in the books, and blonde highlights in the movies. Any darker hair colour can stand on its own, but if you adore her highlights, you can either dye your hair (temporary or permanent), but there's also the option of buying several light blonde hair extensions and weaving them through your hair. Alternatively, you could buy an inexpensive costume wig (check online sites for cheap options).


If you have blonde hair, however, it might be easier to get black hair extensions instead.

, If you want it, look at the article How to Do Narcissa Malfoy Makeup. If you don't, just washing up the night before will do.

, It was well known Narcissa supported Voldemort, but unknown to whether she had the dark mark or not. This is a matter of opinion (although it is unlikely she did, seeing as Bellatrix is the only female Death Eater, and Narcissa was not summoned when the Dark Lord was reborn). If you think she did have the mark, either use a black eyeliner pencil or temporary tattoo.

, You can buy a Narcissa wand or make your own wand.

Make/Purchase a wand.,
Make or thrift a long, black skirt.,
Buy a long-sleeved black shirt.,
Alternatively, you could cut the sleeves to elbow length and do a Dark Mark design on your arm using either Sharpies/Henna/Black Eyeliner etc.

,
Get a large piece of either black vinyl, leather, or other similar material or fabric -- as long as it's thick, black and sturdy, it'll be fine.,
Wear fishnets.,
Buy press-on nails, and file them to a point (not an ACTUAL one; leave them rounded off enough at the top).,
As for your hair: If you're getting a wig, get a standard Cher or Snookie style wig in black (can be curly, but doesn't have to be).,
Makeup: Do NOT put on a whole bunch of black makeup -- you're dressing as Bellatrix, not as Elvira.,
Other additions you could to for the costume are wearing a push-up bra to maximize your assets, 'dirty' up your Halloween costume for a more ""escaped-from-Azkaban"" look.",How to Be Bellatrix Lestrange for Halloween," A good tutorial for a DIY wand can be found here: http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-an-awesome-Harry-Potter-wand-from-a-sheet-of-/;
, The plainer, the better for this look. Grab a silver marker or some silver paint, and draw patterned curlicues around the bottom. If there isn't already one, create a high slit either on the back or the side of the skirt.

, Cut off its sleeves, then reattach by loosely weaving in some ribbon or leather cord, so that the sleeve is about an inch or two away from the arm holes. Cut off the hemmed cuff of the sleeve, so that it frays. Add lace trimming to it the cuffs, if preferred. If it isn't already, make it a v-neck by cutting a 'v' at the neckline. Then, gather or pinch the base of the v-neckline about a few inches lower, so that it puckers a bit; sew around the pucker to maintain its shape. Embellish as desired.

,, Basically, use it to create the girdle that Bella's wearing in THIS picture http://www.fanpop.com/spots/bellatrix-lestrange/images/7445348/title/bellatrix-lestrange-photo You could so the braid into it, if you liked; personally, I would just draw in some stitching or designs with a black, silver or gold permanent marker.

, Add silver jewelry (necklaces and rings) with jewel-toned pendants. And black high heels.

, Paint them red, black or tan.

, Next, get some white paint and using an old mascara or makeup wand, streak it through so you get either one solid strand of white hair, or one half of the head/wig in white hair. If you already have long, dark hair, curl it the night before, then mess it up to really frizz up your hair. Part up with tendrils falling down. Buy white/silver hair paint, then spray one side of your head (or merely a strand). You can try braiding your hair the night before then slightly teasing it. that is what I'm doing

, Instead, use a shade of foundation that is just SLIGHTLY lighter than your own shade. Using some BROWN or TAUPE eye-shadow, blend shadow onto your lids in layers, thereby creating a light, smokey-eyed effect. Next, add some shadow inside the corners of your eyes and curve downward, as though highlight the bags in your eyes. Then, brush the brown/taupe eye-shadow UNDER your cheekbones and along the sides of your nose, thereby creating a sharp, pallid expression. Finally, switch it up for lipstick: use a very, very pale color (not a deep red or black, which is what everyone else does). Dab on some lip-gloss. Essentially, pretty up your lips as you normally would. You want SOME part of Bella to have some sense of alluring to her; remember, in their youth, all three Black sisters were astonishingly beautiful.

, Use your imagination!

The simplest way to create this base is to wear a solid or checkered green button-down shirt.Avoid wearing a T-shirt. Leprechauns are old world creatures, and the look of a button-down shirt creates a classy, antiquated ambiance more effectively than a T-shirt would.
Alternatively, consider a green jacket and white shirt. Even though a green button-down shirt is the easiest way to start making your costume, a more traditional version of leprechaun attire is a white button-down shirt paired with a solid green suit jacket.;
, The idea is to be green from head to toe. Green trouser pants are the perfect article of clothing to pair with your green top, but you could also opt for green shorts made from trouser material if you want to wear your costume when the weather is on the warmer side.


If you have trouble finding green pants, you can purchase white pants and use fabric dye to dye the garment a bold shade of green.

, While girls and women can pull off a green top and green slacks, they also have the option to slip on a green dress, or to pair a green top with a green skirt.If working with a green skirt, you can still pair it with a green button-down shirt or white button-down shirt with a green suit jacket.
Depending on the print of the jacket and the print of the dress, you could even shrug a green suit jacket over a green dress. Try to keep the jacket a solid color rather than a print, though, and make sure that the shade of green on the dress is a little different from the green on the jacket.

, If your legs are exposed or partially exposed, wear a pair of white knee-high socks to cover your calves.This is important if you are wearing shorts, a skirt, or a dress. If you are wearing long pants, you should still wear white socks, but they do not necessarily need to be knee-high since any portion of the sock covering your calf will not be visible, anyway.

, Green top hats and pilgrim-style hats are usually fairly easy to find around St. Patrick's Day, but you might even be able to find a hat that can work during another time of year by searching online stores, thrift stores, or costume stores.You could make a leprechaun hat out of paper or fabric if you do not want to buy one or are having trouble finding a pre-made hat you like.
One of the easiest ways to make a green hat if you cannot find one is simply to purchase a top hot or bowler hat from a thrift store and spray paint it green.

, Make sure that the belt buckle is gold. If it is not already gold, use a bit of acrylic paint to paint the buckle gold.

If you go with a dark green belt, make sure that the green is darker than the green of your trousers.

, Find a green necktie or green bow-tie that matches your pants or jacket. Tie this around your neck for a classy leprechaun look.You could use a solid green tie, or you could liven things up with a green checkered pattern. A pattern works especially well if you are wearing a solid green shirt or jacket and solid green bottoms.

, For the gold, you can use gold-wrapped candy coins or plastic gold tokens. Carry the fake gold in a black plastic kettle, black bowl, or satchel style pouch.You could also make fake nuggets of gold by spray painting small, smooth stones with gold spray paint.

, Look for black slip-on shoes without laces. Spray paint the shoes using acrylic craft paint in green glitter or metallic green.


It is an option to leave the shoes black. Black shoes with a buckle can have a traditional leprechaun appearance, but painting the shoes green can add a bit of flair to your costume.
If you do not have an old pair of shoes you are willing to paint, check out some nearby thrift stores for a pair that might work.
Alternatively, apply green glitter with Mod Podge. If you cannot find green spray paint, apply Mod Podge or another type of craft adhesive to the shoes and sprinkle a coating of green glitter over it., Trace and cut two smaller rectangles out of this larger rectangle to form the shape of a buckle.


The final shape of your buckle should be a rectangular frame with one rectangle cut out of the top and a second cut out of the bottom. There should be a cardboard bar separating the two final rectangular cut-outs.
Cut out two of these buckle-shaped pieces of cardboard. You will need one for each shoe.
Each buckle should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide and 4 inches (10 cm) tall.

, Use acrylic craft paint or spray paint to color this piece of cardboard gold.

, The strip should be skinny enough to fit through the rectangular cut-outs of your cardboard buckle.


The length of each strip should be about 6 or 7 inches (15.24 or 17.78 cm). You will need two strips (one for each buckle and each shoe).

, The construction paper strip should go under the outer frame, over the middle bar, and under the outer frame again.Center the cardboard buckle in the middle of your strip.

, The strip of paper should run vertically, and the buckle should be taped to the shoe so that the buckle lies at the front top with the paper strip standing just above it, as though it were the tongue of the shoe.Use heavy, durable tape so that the paper buckle stays securely in place.

, Trace the shape of a beard or beard and mustache combination on a letter-size sheet of orange or brown construction paper. The length of the beard outline should span nearly the entire length of the paper, and the width of the beard should take up 2/3 to the full width of the paper.To get a more accurate perspective, hold the piece of paper up to your face and mark the distance from ear to ear. This is the width you will need for your paper beard. The length does not need to be quite as precise, though.

, Cut width-wise strips of orange construction paper, each with a width of roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm)., Take each strip of orange paper and wrap it around a pencil or pen to create paper curls.Wrap the paper tightly as you work. If you wrap the paper too loose, the curls will not hold well.

, Apply a line of glue to the bottom of the beard. Press orange curls onto the glue, following the outline, until the entire bottom row is filled with bushy orange curls.Continue attaching the orange curls in this manner, working in rows from the bottom to the top of the beard base.
When done, none of the base should be visible, and the entire thing should be covered with bushy orange curls.
Make sure you allow time for the glue to dry.

, Punch holes near the top of the beard, one on each cheek end. Tie a long piece of yarn to one hole and another piece to the other hole.The pieces of yarn should be long enough so that you can wrap them around the back of your head and be tied together into a shoelace bow.
Alternatively, buy a beard instead of making one. You can buy orange costume beard around St. Patrick's Day or around Halloween. If you want to buy one during any other time of the year, look in a costume store, party store, or online store.

, The ball of clay should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter.Make sure that the clay is well kneaded, first. Kneading the clay makes it soft and easy to work with. If you do not knead the clay, it will be more likely to crack and break as you work with it.
Form the ball into the shape of the pipe bowl as you attach it to the dowel. Use your thumb to create an imprint in the ball, making “walls” around your thumb and creating a bucket inside the center.

, Cut the wire to your desired stem length. , This layer of clay should be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick. Make sure to create a mouthpiece for the stem., Direct the wire through the opening of the bowl. Connect the stem and opening of the bowl.Avoid making the clay look too smooth as you layer it on. Use your thumb or fingertips to leave shallow impressions along the clay, giving it a lumpy and rustic look. Or, use a sculpting tool (like a dull blade) to make ornamental designs in the clay., Place the pipe baking parchment paper., The clay needs to be baked in an oven preheated between 210 to 220 degrees Fahrenheit (98.9 to 104.4 degrees Celsius) for 45 minutes to an hour.Check the clay frequently as it bakes to make sure that it is not burning. The exact amount of time you will need to bake the clay varies by brand, but it usually falls out to 15 or 30 minutes per 1/4 inch (0.625 cm) of thickness.
Place the clay pipe on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil, wax paper, or parchment paper when you bake it.

, Apply a coat of light to medium brown acrylic paint to the clay pipe after it cools.The color should be brown like wood, but you can use colors like green or orange for extra embellishment.

, Use a soft cloth to rub a coating of clay varnish onto the paint after it dries. Make sure you allow the varnish to dry completely., While a homemade leprechaun pipe can add whimsical charm to your costume, if you are short on time or crafting supplies, you can usually find an old-fashioned pipe in a costume store, thrift store, or online.

, Look for a gray or black skirt that almost reaches your knees. Pleats are optional.

, Pick a V-neck vest in gray or black to wear over your white shirt. Select a tie in Gryffindor colors (scarlet and gold) to wear underneath the vest.


You could also wear a button down cardigan instead of a vest, especially if you're not going to be wearing a robe.

, Look for knee-high socks in a solid color, such as gray or black. Wear black or brown shoes in a simple style, such as Mary Janes or loafers.

, You can find one at academic bookstores, costume stores, or charity and thrift stores. Just be sure to find one in nice condition, as Hermione wouldn't have had ragged or worn robes.


Ask any lawyers or academics in your family if they have a robe you could borrow. If so, be careful not to permanently attach a Hogwarts insignia to the robe.

, If you're portraying a younger Hermione, go for a bushy, somewhat large hairstyle. If you're depicting an older Hermione, go for loose waves that may be pinned against the side of your head.


Remember, Hermione has medium-brown hair, so avoid light brown or blonde hair colors.

, If you're portraying a younger Hermione, blow dry and brush your hair to create lots of volume. Don't use hairspray, but let your hair be frizzy and loose. To easily create wavy hair, rub mousse through your wet hair, part your hair into two sections and braid each part. You should end up with two braids running down the sides of your head. Let your hair dry in braids before unbraiding. Your hair should now have kinks and waves.

, Hermione isn't known for stylish dressing and lots of makeup. Instead, keep your look natural. Consider applying concealer, a basic powder, and a bit of blush. Use a pale pink lip gloss for a younger Hermione or a matte lipstick for an older Hermione.

, If you're portraying an older Hermione and want to wear eye makeup, use natural shades, such as taupes or beiges and avoid eyeliner. Use a basic mascara and keep the eye makeup simple.


Avoid any eye makeup if you're going for young Hermione, but consider filling in your eyebrows to make them bushier.

, You can simply carry a few around or use a book bag. Be sure to carry magical books. To do so, choose several books and make covers for them out of brown butcher paper. Then decorate the covers and title them appropriately. For example, these could be textbooks like, ""Muggle Studies,"" ""Divination,"" or ""Potions.""


To use a book bag, stuff the bag almost full with book-sized objects. Real books would be too heavy. Try using small, empty cardboard boxes or square chunks of Styrofoam underneath a few real books that you've decorated.

, Find a tiny hourglass and place it on a gold chain around your neck. If you can, find one with rings that encircle the hourglass. This will be the Time-Turner that Hermione used to get to all her classes in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban.""

, Make or buy a Hogwarts badge that shows the four houses. You could also make a silver S.P.E.W. badge like Hermione wears to support the Society for Promotion of Elfish Welfare. Simply use silver-colored paper or stretch Aluminum foil over cardboard. Write S.P.E.W. in decorative lettering.

, You can purchase a wooden wand or craft your own. If you plan to make your own, decide how realistic you'd like it to be. You can make a wand out of rolled up decorative paper, or carve your own. Whatever you choose, make her wand a little less than a foot long.


Consider adding embellishments, such as vines, along the end of the wand. Make it reflect Hermione's character.

Fill your pockets with odds and ends.,
Create a glowing potion.,
Show off a specimen in a jar.",How to Make a Mad Scientist Costume," Get a white lab coat to use as the visual base for your costume. The lab coat is one of the staples of the mad scientist look and is one of the things that will make your costume identifiable to people right away. You can usually find lab coats and other medical garments for sale at thrift stores, or you may be able to buy one of a moderate quality new without dropping too much money.If you choose to wear the lab coat open, find a plain collared dress shirt to wear underneath. You can also button up the coat so that you don’t have to worry about showing off another layer.
Create a name tag prop to clip to the pocket of your lab coat and give your homemade mad scientist an inventive name.;
, For your lower half, put on a pair of plain khakis or pleated dress pants to accompany the doctoral appearance. You’ll have a little freedom in this area in terms of color and style, but black, brown or another darker shade will probably work best to go along with the “mad” theme. Wash and press your pants for a clean lab-ready look, or cover them with weird stains to make it look like you’ve been performing experiments.Complete the scatter-brained appearance characteristic of the theme of the costume by wearing a pair of pants that are a few sizes too big.
Avoid wearing jeans. They’re a little too casual for the look you’re creating, and may end up making you look more like Doogie Howser than a mad scientist.

, Cover your own hair with a crazy gray or white wig: the more out of the control, the better. This is another part of the costume that will define your look and make it known to people what you are. Most costume stores sell ready-made wigs specifically for costumes like this, so pick one up and let everyone see just how mad your crazed projects have driven you.For best results, find a wig that’s bald on the top but has longer, unkempt hair on the back and sides.

, A pair of rubber gloves will make a nice touch for your costume. Simply put on a pair of basic surgical latex gloves, or find a pair of heavy-duty rubber gloves that fit up to the elbow to make it look like your work is particularly dangerous or icky. The gloves will look great when paired with the right props and accessories later on.Be sure that you don’t have any allergies or irritations caused by latex before you wear gloves as part of your outfit.Rubber dish washing gloves that reach up to the elbow are inexpensive and would be a good fit for this costume., No mad scientist look would be complete without a set of spectacles. For this part of the costume, snag a cheap pair of low-strength reading glasses, or, better yet, a prop pair with plain glass lenses. You could even check your local Halloween goods store to see if they sell a pair of costume glasses with comically oversized frames and lenses. Exaggerated is good with this costume!Prescription glasses can strain your eyes if you don’t actually need them to see, so find another option first if you can. Otherwise, just push them to the tip of your nose and don’t look directly through them., If a regular wig isn’t zany enough for what you have in mind for your costume, try out a brain cap or makeup prosthetic. This accessory will make it look like the top portion of your skull has been opened, exposing your evil genius brain. A brain cap will lend your costume a little extra over-the-top humor if you’re looking for something beyond the normal look., To really play up the wacky old lunatic angle, make your eyebrows match your hairdo. Purchase or make your own set of adhesive bushy white eyebrows and stick them on before you go out in your costume. Instantly add years of age and multiple degrees of insanity to your aesthetic!To make your own fake eyebrows, cut a small faux-fur sample into strips or pull apart a couple of cotton balls and use eyelash adhesive to fix them to the skin around your own eyebrows., Instead of normal glasses, throw on a pair of lab goggles or some gag glasses that feature spiraling vortex lenses or eyeballs that pop out on springs. This will give your costume another little bit of eye-catching visual appeal—no pun intended. Alternately, you could rig up your own ocular contraption and tell people they’re your “X-ray specs.”, Use a small amount of makeup to enhance your look once your costume is complete. A light smudging of charcoal or black face paint can make you look like you’ve been working with dangerously combustible chemicals, or some fake blood splatter will hint at unspeakable surgeries if you’re not worried about ruining your clothes. Get creative and think of ways to use makeup effects to highlight the particular image you’re trying to achieve.Don’t go too crazy with the makeup. Makeup and face paint might run throughout the course of the night, which can stain your clothes and make a mess of your costume.

, Bring an old clipboard along and fill it with odd hand-drawn notes and sketches. Take it out and scribble on it frantically now and then like you’re recording your observations about the people and things around you. Now you’ll appear ready to conduct your experiments.Get other people involved by pretending to study them briefly, then writing down their costume name in a checklist like you intend to make them part of an experiment.

, Stuff the pockets of your lab coat with whatever scientific implements you can find: pens and pencils, rulers, a calculator, a pocket protector, etc. Incorporate these tools into your costume’s theme by periodically taking them out and pretending to use them to write notes or take readings. This is a small touch but one that adds a lot of detail to the costume.

, Here’s a fun prop idea: take a laboratory flask, beaker or measuring cup and add a few ounces of a brightly colored flavored drink mix and water (or just food coloring), then place a glow stick in the center and watch the whole concoction light up. Your glowing serum will look great while trick-or-treating in a dark neighborhood or when you break it out at a party.Be careful about using breakable objects for your container, or potentially toxic substances like glow stick liquid. Do not drink the potion if you’ve used a glow stick in it.

, As a creepy alternative to a glowing potion, buy a small rubber animal or monster figurine and put it in an ordinary mason jar, then fill the whole thing up with water to create a neat little specimen for display. A frog or spider would serve this purpose well, or you could even find a fake hand prop or some plastic eyeballs to really give people the heebie-jeebies."

Suit up.",How to Make a Knight Costume1," The classic Foil Knight costume utilizes around-the-house supplies for its construction, so even if this is a last minute, thrown together costume, you're likely to have the right supplies on hand. Try to accumulate your supplies completely, thinking about what you might like to add, so that you do not have to waste costume making time hunting down a pair of scissors!

Aluminum foil
Black elastic or ribbon
Cardboard
Construction paper
Gray pants and sweatshirt
Markers
Paint
Phillips screwdriver
Scissors
Silver card stock
Tape/stapler;
, Some fantastical depictions, like the movie Lord of the Rings, show some noble characters, like elves, going into battle with a circlet in place of the traditional medieval battle helm. To give yourself an air of nobility, a circlet might be the way to go, but if you want to come across as a no-nonsense knight, you might prefer a battle helm.


Circlet: take your card stock and draw a crown. You can do this in a traditional style, with the crown coming to elaborate points over the head, but in principle, cut a strip of construction paper wide enough to fit around your head in the shape of a crown. This will form the headband. Wrap the strip of paper around your head to find the appropriate length for your head. Cut and fasten the two ends of your paper together with tape or a stapler.

If you have no card stock and no time to get any, a shirt box will work in a pinch.



Battle Helmet: use a plate or circular object to help draw a circle on your silver card stock that is bigger than your head for the top piece of your helmet. Add a point to your circle that comes out to one side, making a teardrop shape. This point will be the front of your helmet. Now outline your teardrop shape so there is about an inch in between the two lines. Cut along your outer line, clipping slits in your inch margin between first and second lines. Fold your inch margin down to form tabs to connect the top and bottom pieces. Make the bottom piece by cutting a 10 to 20 inch piece of silver card stock, folding it in half longways, and then cutting a triangle that has its right angle opposite the crease. This will be where the top of your helmet inserts. Along the fold, cut a slit or slits for eye holes, and then fit your tabs into the opening of your bottom piece, stapling, taping, or gluing the two pieces together., Don't go over the top with elaborate designs or minute detail; your sword will be covered with aluminum foil before too long, to give it a metallic effect.Cut a simple, cross-shaped sword to your desired size.

Small details might not show up under the tin foil, but curving your sword will give it the look of a scimitar. You can cut almost any simple medieval weapon (ax, trident, spear) from cardboard.
You can achieve the same metallic effect with some paints. Use metallic paint to give your sword a unique design.

, Card stock and cardboard might not seem so impressive, but you can easily give each a metallic gleam, as though made by a medieval metal smith, by covering both crown and sword in aluminum foil., Draw the shape of your shield (likely diamond) onto cardboard to cut out.Measure and mark the holes for shield-strap, which occupy the center of the shield.Cut your shield from the excess cardboard, and then use your Phillips screwdriver, punch holes for your shield-strap., Taking your elastic or a piece of hardy ribbon through the two holes in the center of your shield, tie knots to keep your handle in place. From here, you can cover your shield with foil, paint it with designs, or add a coat of arms.

Popular shield designs you might want to consider: the fleur de lis, a roaring lion, a griffin, a castle turret.

, Put on your gray clothing and have a friend or your squire help you into your newly made knightly gear. A larger sweatshirt will give you the appearance of a medieval tunic.

Black undergarments can also be worn for more ominous effect.

Get the Kesha hair.,
Go gold.,
Get the right shades.,
For Kesha's shirt, a messy or over the shoulder look definitely fits her style.,
Most times, Kesha wears ripped tights.,
Do your makeup.",How to Make a Kesha Costume," Kesha's hair always has that bed-head messy look, as well as a side part with little waves. To achieve this look, tousle your hair and use a brush to make it a bit poofy and frizzy. Don't go over the top with the poof and frizz, though. If you have straight hair, curl it slightly. Go for messier curls - Kesha doesn't have perfect Hollywood curls. If you have thin or hair that doesn't hold curls well, tease your hair back.;
, Kesha always wears gold or glitter, so try something like gold high-top sneakers or sparkly sneakers. If you can't find any, buy a regular pair of high-tops and spray-paint them gold, or cover them with glue and gold glitter.

, In her music video ""Tik Tok"" she is wearing gold shutter shades, so it's a good idea to grab a pair. They're sold at most accessory stores such as Ardene and Claires, and they're not very expensive, either. Again, if you can't find gold shades, consider spray-painting them gold. If you don't want the shades to block the make-up, consider putting the shades on your head instead of wearing them over your eyes - it would still look just as good.

, Even a baggy shirt or sweatshirt would go perfectly. Tee-shirts look great after they have been slashed-up by a pair of scissors! Make sure that it's black or another dark colour - Kesha doesn't wear pink, after all!

, You could just wear the tights alone, or a gold sequined tight skirt would make it look fabulous. If you can't find any pre-ripped tights, buy some black tights and rip them yourself. Again, this doesn't have to be perfect, so rip them as messily as you want. After all, Kesha's look is messy. Kesha also wears patterned lace tights. The crazier the pattern, the better!

, Kesha's makeup is one of her most recognizable traits. Make sure you're all dressed before doing your makeup, as there is a lot of makeup. Start by lining both your top and bottom eyelids heavily with black eyeliner. You may also want to wing the eyeliner out a bit. Again, if it looks a little sloppy, don't bother to fix it. Then, move the eyeliner down one of your cheeks so it looks like it's dripping down the side of your face (look at the image for ideas). Put on some black or dark coloured eyeshadow for a messy smokey-eye look. Finally, but on some body glitter all over your face - Kesha's face is usually almost the same. Kesha usually keeps her lips a pretty nude colour, so just put on some gloss or sparkly gloss to top off her makeup look. Or, just do a thick line with liquid liner on the top and do a crazy lip color like blue or purple, or pink! And remember, the body glitter doesn't need to be retrained to your face... Kesha wears it all over her body! Don't be afraid to get it on your clothes and in your hair!

Assemble your costume.",How to Make a Knight Costume2," The Colander Knight costume, though still finding most of its components in the home, requires a few craft supplies to give it that finished look. Make sure you have a hot glue gun, glue sticks, measuring tape, and scissors in addition to:

1 yard elastic
1/2 yard patterned fabric
12-inch pieces red and black felt
2 yards silver ribbon
4 white or metallic scouring pads
Black boots
Black gloves
Black hoodie
Cardboard wrapping-paper roll
Disposable pie tin
Gray long johns
Gray nonskid drawer liner or rug pad
Large red and black feathers
Small metal colander
Small roll canvas-backed foil insulation (available at hardware stores), You'll need to take your measuring tape to find the distance from your shoulders to mid-thigh. You should also take your chest measurement. Cut a neck hole by folding your insulation in half and cutting a slit, then cut your insulation so that it falls to mid-thigh, stopping at the outside of your shoulders.

Dress up the edges of your tunic with silver ribbon, or take drawer liner to give your tunic the appearance of being chain mail.

, What kind of coat of arms will grace the front of your shield? Cut a piece of felt as you desire, and glue these to the front of your pie tin shield. Now you can finish the shield by giving yourself a handle; glue a piece of elastic across the inside of the pie tin to do this., Your scouring pads will be perfect imitations of the joint armor knights wore. Simply glue loops of elastic to each scouring pad. Now you can slip these on over your knees and elbows., Red and black feathers are striking, but any colors you choose will work for your plume. Glue these to one side of your metal colander, and your helmet is ready for action.

If you have a sensitive scalp or the colander is uncomfortable, it may help to attach an elastic chinstrap or wearing a hat underneath the colander for padding.

, The fabric of your black gloves don't exactly look knightly, so glue your drawer liner to each to give your gloves the appearance of gauntlets. The liner doesn't have to completely cover each glove; enough liner for effect is fine., Put on your gray and black boots, gloves, hoodie, and your knightly gear."

Consider overalls.,
Roll up your jeans.,

Choose a hillbilly shirt.,
Find appropriate footwear.,
Go for checkered patterns.",How to Make a Hillbilly Costume1," Overalls are a classic aspect of a hillbilly costume. If you have old overalls lying around, you can use those. You can also purchase a pair of overalls at a thrift store or regular clothing store.It may be a good idea to undo one strap of your overalls to look messy, much like a hillbilly.
Consider going for old overalls that are somewhat worn down. Faded clothing, or clothing with holes or patches, can look great for a hillbilly costume.;
, If you're unsure about wearing overalls, try wearing rolled up jeans. You can roll up one leg of your jeans, or both legs. For women, this can work particularly well as it's similar to the style of Daisy Duke, a character from The Dukes of Hazard.As with overalls, old jeans work best. Go for jeans with holes or patches, or faded jeans.

, Cut-off shorts may look somewhat trashy, and therefore be associated with the hillbilly lifestyle. If you really want to commit to the hillbilly style, you can try making your own cut-off jean shorts by trimming off the legs of an old pair of jeans.

, Take some time to choose a shirt that gives off a hillbilly style. Use an old shirt you have lying around, or make a trip to the thrift store and purchase a shirt that conveys the hillbilly style.


Tank-tops and plain white t-shirts, especially when paired with overalls, may work for the hillbilly style.
As with your jeans and overalls, go for things that are old, ratty, and torn. Pick a shirt with holes in it or a shirt with stains. Consider adding patches to the sleeves of a shirt you don't wear much anymore.

, You will also need to choose proper footwear for the hillbilly style. There are a variety of different types of shoes that could work for a hillbilly outfit.


Consider trying open-toed sandals, ratty tennis shoes, or going barefoot if possible. If you're going to a house party, for example, barefoot can work great.
Think about buying a pair of cowboy boots. These can work particularly well if you're tying to capture the hillbilly style. Go for work boots over dress boots., Plaid and checkered patterns are often associated with rednecks, which are sort of like hillbillies.Consider investing in plaid or checkered shirts for your costume. A plaid shirt underneath a pair of overalls can make for a great hillbilly costume. You could also try wearing a plaid or checkered skirt if you're a woman.

, If you are attempting to make a costume the day before Halloween, you probably want to create a last-minute costume that can easily be thrown together using items, clothing, and supplies that you already have lying around your house.

, Once you know you how much time you want to spend on a costume, you’ll need an idea. A good place to start is to make a list of your favorite characters: from books, movies, or TV shows. Dressing up as your favorite character always make a great costume., Another good place to find inspiration for your costume is in current events. Recent news stories, celebrity mishaps, or current pop culture references always make a great costume., If you’re still stumped for a costume idea, start by picking up some great costume accessories that you love – a hat or a cape or a tiara – and build a costume around the accessory., Costumes that require multiple people can be fun and impressive if they are executed well.A few examples of group costumes include: bands, superhero groups, celebrity couples, or a set of characters from a book, movie, etc.
Make sure everyone in your group is committed to the group costume. If anyone backs out, it might ruin the costume.

, Arts and crafts stores are great places to look for costume materials, even if you don't know exactly what you want before visiting the store. As long as you go in with a costume idea, you should be able to find fabric to make it work., If your costume requires you to sew clothing, you will want to pick a material that is easy to sew or piece together, particularly if you are a beginning crafter.


For example, felt is inexpensive and can be glued together using a hot glue gun or even stapled together to create clothing. Basic cotton fabric is easy to sew with a sewing machine or by hand., Before you visit a fabric store, you'll need to take exact measurements of your costume. If you’re unsure how much you need for your costume, ask for assistance., If you’re not up for sewing your costume, secondhand clothing stores can be great places to find cheap, wacky clothes perfect for a costume. Sometimes these stores actually have homemade costumes for sale if you choose not to make your costume from scratch.

, When you’re choosing your materials, think about embellishments and accessories you can add to it. Many accessories can be purchased cheaply at arts and crafts stores.Look for accessories like crowns - from big tiaras to small flowers crowns - or capes or feather boas.
Good examples of easy to add embellishments include fake flowers, buttons, and glitter glue.

, When you’re searching for costume materials, look in the back corner of your closet or the drawer you never open in your dresser. You might have the stuff you need right at home!, If all else fails, a cardboard box can serve as a good base for a costume. The boxiness lends itself well to robots, washer or dryers, cars, or a TV.Box cutters work best for cutting through cardboard.
Decorate your box after you’ve cut out the holes for your arms, head, and body.

, Even if you’re not sewing together your costume, you should still gather the materials you’ve decided to use. Lay everything out and start to make a plan for how you’re going to put them together., Once you have your materials together, make sure you have the correct measurements for the clothes you're creating. Double checking these measurements before you create a template and begin cutting out fabric can save you a lot of wasted time and money.For pants, you will need the following measurements: waist, hip, crotch depth and full leg length from waist to floor.
For shirts, you will need the following measurements: neck, chest, shoulder width, arm length, armhole length and shirt length.
For shorts, use the pant measurements you have, only shortening the pant length to the desired length.
For skirts, you simply need waist and hip measurements. The length and fullness of the skirt will vary depending on what type of skirt you want to make.
Make sure that the material you choose to use is not see-through or itchy if you are making clothing as part of your costume.

, Creating a template for your costume on paper first gives you a chance to double check measurements. This is a good technique regardless of whether you're gluing or sewing your costume Transfer the template to a piece of felt with a pen and use scissors to cut out the template before gluing it together.

, Using your template, make clothing for your costume out of fabric. This might require either sewing or gluing material together. It's best to take this step slowly as you double check measurements and try things on as you make them., Using a glue gun, paste on objects or embellishments to the clothing you've made or the existing clothing you're using for your costume. For example, you and a partner could cover a green outfit in real or fake leaves, wrap a toy snake around your neck, and hold an apple in your hand for a quick and easy Adam and Eve costume.

, Once you’ve got the base of your costume, add your accessories. This might mean gluing or sewing additional material, or simply draping a cape over your shoulders or adding a tiara.

, You’ll want to check out how everything looks together at least once before you wear your costume on Halloween. Once you have everything put together, try it on with all of the accessories and make sure you're happy with the result. You should do this a few days before Halloween so you have time for changes if they're necessary.

Lay out the costume clothing.,
Create a draft of stick figure pattern.,
Attach the glow sticks.,
Create the head of the costume.,
Crack the glow sticks.",How to Make a Glow Stick Costume," The clothing for this costume must be all black. The black clothing will give the allusion that there’s nothing behind the glow sticks (creating the appearance of a genuine stick figure), and the glow sticks will appear to glow brighter with the contrasting black background. Lay the top and bottoms on a flat surface such as a floor or table.The type of clothing used for the costume can be anything black, such as leggings, sweat pants, hoodies, turtlenecks, etc.;
, On a sheet of paper, draw a couple different styles of stick figures to brainstorm what kind a pattern you want to create for your costume.Stick figure patterns are relatively simple in nature, but by sketching out a rough plan for your costume, you’ll have a better idea on how to position the glow sticks and how many glow sticks you’ll need.
Err on the side of caution and get more glow sticks than you think you may need.
Aim for approximately 50 glow sticks for both the back and front of the costume. This will be beneficiary if any of the glow sticks break, don’t glow, or if you want to make more patterns.

, While the costume clothing is laid flat, assemble the glow sticks on top of the clothing to make the stick figure pattern. Generally, a straight line of glow sticks span from the neck area of the clothing, to the waist of the pants. Then, glow sticks lead off on both the top and bottom ends of the middle section of sticks, to create the arms and legs of the stick figure. When your glow sticks are in the pattern you want for the costume, use clear packaging tape to secure the glow sticks to the clothing.Stick the tape on the glow sticks lengthwise, so the entire glow stick is covered in tape. Do not crack the glow sticks at this time.


When the front of the costume is finished, turn the clothing over and tape glow sticks on to the back of the clothing.Try to have all of the glow stick ends touching each other in the pattern. This arrangement will help make the stick figure look like it is made of one continuous line rather than a bunch of dashed lines.

, If you decide to wear a black hoodie for the top portion of the costume, consider decorating the rim of the hood with glow sticks in order to make a “head” for the stick figure. If you aren’t wearing a hoodie or don’t want to assemble the glow sticks that way, use the plastic connector pieces of the glow sticks to create a circled necklace of sticks. Then, consider taping the circle to your forehead, or using sturdy hair clips to attach the circle onto the hair on your head.Remember, you want to make a head for the back of the costume too. If you’re wearing a hoodie, you can tape the top of the circle necklace to the back of the hood. If you aren’t wearing a hoodie, use clips to attach the circle to your hair at the top of the back of your head.
If you clip the circle onto your hair, the circle will be around your face with a little bit of your actual face poking through the hole of the circle.

, When you’re ready to wear the costume, bend all the glow sticks to crack the inside that starts the glow in the dark chemical reaction. Try not to undo any of the taping as you bend the glow sticks.


The glow sticks tend to only glow for about six hours, so crack them as late as possible so the glow lasts throughout the night."

Invest in fake teeth.,
Consider a trucker hat.,
Carry a knapsack.,
Add a bandana.,
Carry a beer can.,
Go for a straw hat.",How to Make a Hillbilly Costume2," You can buy fake teeth at many costume shops. Fake teeth are often designed to look as if some of your teeth are missing. You can visit a local costume or craft store and see if they sell fake teeth. Many people think of hillbillies as people with missing teeth., A trucker hat may be a good idea, for either a man or a woman. Trucker hats are sometimes associated with redneck/hillbilly culture. Rednecks are slightly different than hillbillies, however. Rednecks are thought of as working class southerners, while hillbillies tend to live in rural areas not necessarily in the south. A trucker hat may be seen as more redneck than hillbilly., You can try carrying a knapsack, which is a small bag usually made out of a blanket or rag. As hillbillies are often thought of as homeless or wandering, this could help you get the image down.


Try carrying something like toilet paper in your knapsack. You can pull it out and carry this at parties or for pictures. Toilet paper may indicate you have to use the bathroom in the woods, giving you the rustic hillbilly feel., Bandanas are often associated with hillbilly outfits. Try tying a bandana around your neck or wrapping your hair in a bandana. You can choose any style you like, but a checkered style may best convey the hillbilly aesthetic., Beer can help you give off a rustic, working class vibe. Consider carrying a beer can around, or something like a forty ounce of beer.


Keep in mind beer is slightly more associated with rednecks than hillbillies. As stated, the two are different. A beer can may result in your costume getting mistaken for a redneck costume., Straw hats are often associated with the hillbilly lifestyle. Consider buying a wide-brimmed straw hat and adding it to your hillbilly outfit.

Make sure to gather the hair in a messy fashion, leaving some hairs falling down., Pigtails can give you a country bumpkin-like vibe that can help with the hillbilly style. Try braiding your hair in two pigtails or simply tying your hair on either side of your head., If you're a guy, you may not want to do a ponytail or pigtails. You can try simply messing up your hair so it looks disheveled. You can also tuck your hair under a hat, giving the impression your hair is greasy or dirty., A hillbilly costume may benefit from dirty makeup. You can purchase makeup kits at costume shops designed to make your face look dirty. You can also use brown and black eyeshadow to create a dirty look.Try using a makeup brush to dab shades of brown and black around your cheeks.
You can also dab slightly wet coffee grinds to your cheeks and neck. This can help make you look like your face is covered in dirt and debris.

,
Get a wig with long red hair.,
Do Ariel’s makeup look.,
Add your finishing touches.",How to Make a Disney's Ariel Mermaid Costume," To make Ariel’s top, you’ll need 4 components – 1 strapless purple bathing suit top (or bra or bandeau), 2 large seashells, and a swath of sheer purple fabric about the size and shape of a handkerchief.This is a very basic list and there are multiple ways to approach almost every element on it, so alternate options will be mentioned in each step. You can mix and match whatever works best for you to get your perfect Ariel costume.


You’ll also need a sewing machine, purple thread, scissors, super glue, and light purple paint (lavender or lilac is the shade you want).;
, You can use a machine to do this or sew it by hand, whichever you prefer. Since it’s such a minimal amount of sewing, you could easily do it by hand if you wanted to. The sheer fabric is square-shaped, and you want one of the flat sides to be the part that gets sewn into the purple strapless top.


After it’s sewn on, the sheer fabric should hang at approximately your waist, covering most of your stomach. Try it on to make sure it looks the way you want it to before proceeding. If everything looks good, set the top aside for now.

, They are both approximately the size of your palm. You could do a perfectly fine Ariel costume without this element, but it’s a nice detail from the movie that will really set your costume apart. Skip ahead if you’re omitting the seashell element. To do the seashells, you can use actual seashells or a light purple felt fabric cut into seashell shapes.


If you want to use real seashells, check out Amazon (or another similar site). You can order them this way, and the price is relatively low. You want the shells to be about the same size, so when placing your order make sure you note that to the seller.
If you live near an ocean, you can always get your shells by making a trip to the beach.
If you’re using fabric for the shells, get purple felt (if possible, a shade lighter than the rest of the top is).

, If you’re using real shells, you’ll need to paint them to be a light purple (lavender or lilac is the shade you want).Use acrylic paint, which you can obtain at any art supply store for quite cheap. Paint the front of each shell with the purple acrylic paint and lay them on an old towel to dry. Acrylic paint takes about 20-30 minutes to dry completely.If you are using fabric for shells, simply cut the shell shapes out at the size you want (about the size of your palm).


You could also use purple spray paint for the shells.Feel free to add any additional elements you want to the shells. Some great ideas would be glitter, stick on rhinestones, additional painted details – whatever you like!

, You’ll use super glue to do this, whether you’re adding real shells or fabric shells. Shells have a flat bottom and a fan-shaped top. Arrange your shells with the fan-shaped tops facing outward, toward each arm, and with the flat bottoms facing each other in the middle of your chest, so that each cup of your bathing suit is covered by a shell.


Super glue dries in about 30 seconds and sets in 2 minutes.When you place the shell on the top, hold it down tightly in place for the full 2 minutes before going on to the next shell.

, To make Ariel’s tail and fins, you’ll need 1 large piece of green fabric and about a yard of shiny turquoise blue fabric. For the green fabric, you need a fabric that has some stretch to it. Spandex is a good choice.


You’ll also need a sewing machine, green and blue thread, scissors, and about 12 inches of elastic.

, Lay out the green fabric on the ground and have a friend trace a mermaid tail around your body with a sharpie.When tracing around, make sure your friend draws the lines about 1 inch away from your body so that the final piece won’t fit too tightly. Cut the piece out of the fabric after the traced lines are drawn. You need 2 of these.


Since you need two of these green pieces, you could save time and ensure the pieces are identical in size by fold the green fabric in half before you start. That way you can trace around your body and cut them both identically at the same time.
When you lay down on the green fabric, you want to make sure you’re on top of it from the waist down only. The fabric needs to extend past your feet when you lay down. This is so the fins can be drawn.
If you prefer, you can lay down on a large piece of paper and trace your body onto that. You'd then use that as a stencil with which to cut the fabric down to size., You want to sew the two together all the way around the tail, leaving only the top part open and unsewn for your waist. This is so you can slip it on once your costume is ready.

, Take your green fabric and lay the end down on top of the shiny turquoise blue fabric. Trace around the bottom of the green fabric, where the fins are, onto the blue fabric. Then cut the fins out of the blue fabric. Sew the blue fabric on to the green.

, Now you need to cut a split into the bottom of the tail so that you’ll be able to walk. Cut the split right up the middle of the fins, starting at the bottom, up to your knees. This creates an opening for your feet and bottom part of your legs, so that you can walk in the costume.


You can cut the split just at the bottom of the fins, so it does not show your legs.

, You’ll do this right where the green tail meets the blue fins. Sew it all the way around. This allows you to slip the costume bottom on, and the bottom of the tail will cling at the bottom, resembling Ariel’s tail.

, To make Ariel’s tail you’ll need 1 large piece of green fabric that has some stretch to it. Spandex is a good choice. Check out material intended for dancewear - you can find some really fun material, like a deep green fabric covered in green sequins and other sparkly things that would be great for Ariel.You’ll also need a sewing machine, green thread and scissors.

, Adjust it until you have the ideal fit for you. Make sure that, once wrapped around your waist, the material extends beyond your feet by about 6 inches.Pull it close to your legs all the way down, stopping at your heels.


You can stop at your calves rather than your heels if you want a costume that's a bit easier to move around in.

, Before pinning it, make sure it fits you exactly how you want it to. You now have the foundation of the tail there. The green material will drift out in front of your feet about 6 inches, with the material gathered in at the heels in the back, creating a tail fin effect.

,, Ariel’s hair is very long, red and wavy. You’ll want to style the hair to be tousled but pretty. Use bobby pins to secure it to your head. If you have a hard time finding one, you can definitely order one inexpensively on the internet.It would be cute to add some little embellishments in the hair, like small barrettes with starfish on them. You could also spray the hair lightly with the canned glitter made specifically for hair – it would be pretty and look like water droplets.

, You’ll want to use red lipstick in a shade almost identical to the red hair on the wig. That’s the most important element.


You could also add glittery aqua eye shadow or face shimmer for a great Ariel vibe., There are so many things you can do for this – your imagination is the limit! Body glitter would be great for Ariel. Painting your fingernails a nice glittery shade of silver would be a great touch, as well!

Tie a piece of string in each of the holes.You want the strings to be long enough that you’ll be able to tie the necklace around your neck.,
Consider getting a wig.,
Draw on Pocahontas’s arm tattoo.,
Give yourself a Disney's Pocahontas makeup look.,
Pick out your Pocahontas shoes.",How to Make a Disney's Pocahontas Costume," You’ll want to use a very large t-shirt, probably from the men’s section.


The t-shirt should come down to your mid to lower thighs, and it should be long enough to wear as a dress.
You can find inexpensive, plain cotton t-shirts in a variety of colors at stores like Target or Walmart.
Before you begin to work with your shirt, you’ll want to make sure it is ironed and completely wrinkle-free.;
, You want to cut one entire sleeve and the neckline off at an angle.


Use a fabric pen or water soluble pencil to mark your t-shirt.If you want, you can use a ruler or yardstick to help you make a straight diagonal line from the bottom of one sleeve to the opposite side of the neck hole.
With the sleeve that remains intact, you want to mark it so that, when cut, it will become a sleeveless style. You’ll want to mark this part to be at least three inches wide, so it doesn’t break over time, and so you will be able to glue on your fringe.

, In the movie, this is the shape of Pocahontas’s dress.


Make sure not to cut this point too high on the sides so that the t-shirt still remains a dress-length that you are comfortable with.To make sure you don’t cut your shirt too high: put on a pair of shorts or a skirt you like the length of, put on your t-shirt overtop, and make small marks on each side of the oversized t-shirt at the bottoms of your shorts. Don’t cut past this mark.

, You’ll want to use sharp fabric scissors.As you cut, make sure that you are getting rid of the marker lines from your finished dress by cut on the edge of your line.
It’s fine if the edges are frayed because Pocahontas has a more rustic, natural look.

, You should use a slightly lighter tan material than the color of your t-shirt.


Suede fabric looks great, but feel free to use any kind of fabric you want. You can find fabric at local hobby stores or repurpose an old blanket or shirt.
The size of your dress will determine the amount of fabric you need. Measure the bottom and top perimeters of your dress, where you want to attach your fringe.This is how long you need your strips to be.
Most dress won’t need more than half a yard of your fabric of choice. You can cut your strips in multiple sections to get more out of your material.
The strip should measure about 4 inches wide.

, First, cut out the fringe strips by length and width according to your measurements.


After you have cut out your strips, make them into fringe.To do this, simply cut in vertical lines upward from the bottom of the strip, spacing the cuts about half an inch apart. You also want to leave about half an inch uncut at the top of each strip.

, The fastest way to do this is with hot glue or super glue.Line up your fringe against your shirt. Then, make a line of hot glue around the top of each strip, and press it onto your t-shirt dress.
Alternatives to hot glue or super glue are fabric glue, which will take longer to dry, or sewing the fringe on in a straight line with a sewing machine, if you have the experience., You can use the same fabric you used for the fringe as your belt.


Make the belt as thin or wide as you like.
Measure your waist.The belt should be about 8 inches longer than your waist, so you have room to tie it. Or, you can make it 8 or so inches more than twice your waist, so you can double wrap it.This will cinch your t-shirt dress, and make it look more flattering. The belt takes your costume from an oversized t-shirt to a dress.
If you want a more intricate belt, braid three thin strips of your fabric together, and knot each of the ends to keep the braid together.

, Use a plain piece of paper.


You can do this freehand while looking at a picture of the necklace, or just print out a screenshot picture of Pocahontas from the movie, and use this necklace as your template., You want your lines to be clean. If you are using a printed picture, just cut out the necklace portion of the picture.


On each side of the necklace above the pendant, you only need about three-quarters of the necklace because you will tie it in the back with string.

, Use your template, and trace around it with pencil.


Feel free to use material you have on hand, like an old cereal box.

, Using sharp office scissors, cut out your necklace along the lines you traced.


It’s fine if some of these lines still show, as you will paint the necklace.

, Using a movie screenshot for reference, paint the sides of the necklaces a turquoise blue and the center pendant white or cream.


Acrylic paints works well.If you want the necklace to have a glossy finish, go over the top of your dried paint with glossy Mod Podge or clear glue., You can use a single-hole punch or the tip of a pen or knife.


You want the hole to be at least half an inch from the edge of the necklace so the string doesn’t break through the cardboard.

,


You can cut the strings too long, and then tie your necklace around your neck and cut off the excess while you are wearing it.
Use a brown hemp string for a rustic look. You can find this at any craft store or craft section.If your finished necklace doesn’t have enough weight to stay flat against your neck, hot glue a penny to the back of the pendant portion of your cardboard necklace.

, If you don’t already have long, dark hair, you might want to find a wig to complete your look.


You can find wigs at wig shops or party supply stores. You want to make sure you get a wig that will stay secure on your head., Her tattoo is a dark orange-red circle around her upper arm that comes down in drips.


To draw this on your arm, you can use face paint or an inexpensive, colored eyeliner pencil.
Create the outline first, and then fill it in.

, You want to create a natural look that is still dramatic.


Use bronzer instead of blush, fill in your brows darkly, and wear a brown-toned lipstick.
Wear brown eyeliner, and keep your mascara natural.

, No matter what type of shoes you choose, they should be brown.


If you have moccasins or boots with fringe, wear those. You could also wear a strappy Gladiator-style sandal.
If you don’t have either of those choices, brown flats are a nice, simple option that will put the focus on your costume.

Wear simple, flat shoes.,
Get a long, black wig in a low, knotted ponytail.",How to Make a Disney's Mulan Costume1," Mulan’s original outfit has a floor-length, cream-colored skirt, and a hint of whitish fabric showing underneath her top. There are two ways you can achieve this look. If you can find a long, off-white dress with a square or boat neckline, you can wear that underneath your costume. Alternately, you can wear a floor-length off-white skirt and a camisole.The camisole should have a neckline that reaches about up to your collarbone.
Look for a dress or skirt in your closet, online or at a second-hand store. If you like to sew, you can make the skirt.;
, Preferably, the body of the shirt will be more fitted than the sleeves. You’ll be adding another layer of clothing over your torso, so you don’t want the green top to be bulky. Look for a light apple green color.

, If you can find a tank top or short dress with a royal blue body and thick teal straps, that would be ideal. You’ll be more likely to find a close match by shopping online. However, that’s quite a specific look to track down, so you may want to improvise instead.


To recreate this garment, get a strapless tube top or dress that reaches about hip-length. The length can be a little longer or shorter – it doesn’t have to be exact. Wear a turquoise tank top with wide straps underneath it, or sew wide teal ribbon straps onto the strapless piece.
This piece should go around your torso as a middle piece rather than being worn like a regular tank top.

, You can use a long piece of fabric, a sash or a scarf. Keep wrapping it around your waist until there’s a bit of fabric left hanging in the back. Tuck that fabric underneath and secure it with a concealed safety pin.

, Little Brother is Mulan’s small beige dog with dark brown spots, long ears, and a black nose. He wears a blue collar. If the toy dog you’re using doesn’t come with a blue collar, use a blue ribbon around its neck. There are a few ways you can incorporate Little Brother into your costume.Simply carry the stuffed toy around with you.
Have the toy dog peeking out of your purse or tote bag, if you’re bringing one.
Attach it to your costume. You can sew it to the front of your dress with a simple stitch.

, Mulan’s skirt is floor-length in this look and covers her feet. Opt for whatever comfortable, neutral flats you like. Avoid wearing heels as they might show underneath your bottom hem.

, Look for a wig with a center part and without bangs. Put the wig on. Arrange the hair in a low ponytail with a hair elastic. Then take a small piece of hair and wrap it around the ponytail at the base.Pull at the elastic underneath the ponytail and slide the section of hair through the gap. Secure it with a bobby pin.
You may want to wear a wig cap and secure the wig with bobby pins and/or wig adhesive tape.

Get a pink robe.,
Find a navy blue fabric.,
Use a red fabric, belt or sash.,
Get a soft purple scarf and a green necklace.,
Style your hair in a topknot with a flower.,
Wear gold drop earrings.,
Wear strong makeup.",How to Make a Disney's Mulan Costume2," This will be the main part of the costume that you will layer the other pieces over. It’s okay if the robe has pockets, because you can cover the pockets up later with another fabric.

, If you can find a wide scarf or shawl, that will work. You could also use a long tube top or a short strapless dress. Otherwise you can purchase some dark blue fabric.


The piece should be able to wrap completely around you from front to back, and span from your bust to your thighs. Try the piece on or hold it up to you to make sure it will be long and wide enough.If the piece is loose fabric or a scarf, have someone help you pin it closed on the back when you put your costume on. Alternately, you can apply Velcro to the piece so that you can put it on yourself.

, If you’re buying fabric, make sure you have enough to wrap around your waist at least once. This should go around the smallest part of your waist. You should also ensure that you have a little bit left over so that you can use it for your hairstyle.

, Ideally, the purple scarf will be a light, sheer lavender fabric. It should be long enough to hold in the crooks of your arms like a shawl. You can buy a simple green beaded necklace or make your own.


You can make your own necklace using craft supplies and the following tutorial: https://family.disney.com/craft/mulans-jade-necklace/


, You can use a fake magnolia blossom, cherry blossom, or similar artificial flower from a craft store. Cut the stem down with wire cutters so that there is a just a few inches of stem. Stick the flower in the side of your topknot by the stem. Then wrap your extra piece of red fabric around your topknot and the stem of the flower.If you’ve cut the stem with wire cutters, you may want to bend the cut tip or file it a bit so it doesn’t poke into your head.
Secure it all in place with clips or bobby pins.

, Mulan wears round gold earrings with dangling teardrop beads. You can look for similar earrings online or at a local store that carries costume jewelry. eBay is a great place to find unique, vintage, and even clip-on earring styles., When Mulan wears her hanfu look to visit the Matchmaker, she has dark purple eyeshadow. Her cheeks have pink blush. She also wears a dark berry-colored lipstick.

Start with a light blue shirt.,
Add a light-colored skirt.,
Layer on the outer dress.,
Add a mauve sash.,
Overlay a pink ribbon or sash.,
Choose shoes and hosiery.,
Wear a long necklace with a large gold medallion.,
Get or make a prop sword.,
Get a gold fan.,
Wear a short black wig.",How to Make a Disney's Mulan Costume3," Make sure it isn't too dark since Mulan's was a soft blue. Also, you want it to stand out against the darker blue piece you’ll be layering over it. Use a long-sleeved blouse with peasant sleeves if you can find one.


Peasant sleeves are puffed and wide, but end in a band of fitted trim at the wrists., Choose a skirt that is ankle-length to floor-length. The color should be somewhere between white and powder blue, at least a shade lighter than your shirt. Look for an A-line or mermaid skirt so that it has some flare to the bottom., Look for a dark blue dress that is about knee-length, with short, angled sleeves, such as exaggerated cap sleeves or short kimono sleeves. Alternately, you can get a sleeveless dark blue robe (preferably without pockets), or cut the sleeves off a robe yourself.

, Your sash should be at least two yards long; if you can’t make a sash or buy one, get the same length in an extra wide ribbon. Hang it around the back of your neck, as if you were about to put on a necktie, but so that both ends of fabric hang evenly in front of you. Cross the fabric once at your navel, and then wrap it around your waist and back to the front.


Continue wrapping the mauve sash around your waist until there is just a bit of it left, then tuck the bits in and pin them.
The wrap of the sash around your waist should cover where the fabric crosses in the front, so that it looks like it comes to a “V” rather than an “X.” Use a safety pin to secure the fabric from the inside.

, Place it over the top of the mauve one around your waist. At the left front of your waist, loop the fabric over itself as if you’re about to make a simple knot. Instead of crossing it again to finish off the knot, arrange the two straps so that they’re hanging on top of each other.


Use a safety pin concealed inside the pink sash to hold the waist belt and straps in place.

, Mulan wears dark gray flats with rounded toes, but you could get away with navy blue or black flats. Wear pantyhose, tights or knee highs in any shade from nude to white., How elaborate you want to get with this detail is up to you. You have multiple options. You can wear any type of large gold medallion on a chain necklace or a long gold ribbon. Or you can recreate Mulan’s Crest of the Emperor medallion in a simple or a complex way.To make a simple medallion, cut out a circle from foam board or cardboard. Draw the dragon on in pencil, and then color it in with bronze and gold metallic paint markers. Punch a hole in it at the top, and attach it to a long chain necklace with gold ribbon. You can also use a hot glue gun to attach gold ribbon around the edge of the medallion.
To make a complex medallion, you can use worbla over craft foam, wood, or clay, and paint the finished product., Mulan carries the sword of Shan Yu with this outfit. The length of the sword is from the top of her head to about midway between her hips and knees. The sword has a wavy blade and a tip like the head of an arrow. You can look for a prop sword to buy online or at costume shops.To make your own prop sword, make a template out of foam board. Make the sword’s handle with an armature of toilet paper rolls and masking tape. Cover the full creation with papier-mâché paste and strips of newspaper. Once that dries, you can paint it with acrylic paints.Optionally, you can wrap the middle of the sword with brown paper or beige fabric and tie it with a burgundy string, the way Mulan presented it to the Emperor. If you add another loop of string to the knot that is long enough to wear like a sling over your head and one shoulder, you won’t have to carry it around loose., Mulan has a fan that saves her from a wielded sword! It’s a gold-colored fan with black trim. You can buy a fan and spray paint it gold, or make your own fan from scratch., If you can’t go to a wig store in person, you’ll probably need to measure your head in order to buy one online. Mulan’s hair is parted down the middle, so opt for a lace front wig if you want to look realistic.


Mulan wears wispy bangs with this look. You can buy a wig that way, or trim the bangs on the wig.

Finished.

",How to Make a Cupcake Costume,"


If the laundry basket is too narrow for the wearer to slip on, you may also need to cut a straight line down the back. The basket will keep its shape, but you will be able to spread it apart enough to slip on if needed.
If you cannot find a round laundry basket, you could also use a large, plastic, bucket-shaped toy tub.;
, Hook two white suspenders to the top of the basket and adjust them so that they can cross over the wearer's shoulders.


You could also tie two cords or heavy-duty ribbons to the basket to mimic straps.
If using a solid plastic toy tub, use a hot glue gun to glue the straps in place.

, Each fold should be about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) wide.


Measure the height and circumference of the basket before proceeding. The board you use should be at least as tall as the basket and three times as long as the circumference. If using standard size poster board, you may need to use 5 to 6 sheets.
Staple the sheets of poster board together as you fold them. If possible, hide the staples inside the folds.
You could also use heavy foil-based wrapping paper instead of poster board.
Make an accordion fold by taking your first section of poster board and folding it over the remaining board. Make another section that is equal in width, but fold the board in the opposite direction so that the end of the board is still visible. Continue on in this pattern until the entire board is folded.

, Use a hot glue gun to adhere the folded board onto the basket. Draw a line of glue onto each inside fold of the board and press it to the basket to fix it in place.


Instead of using glue, you could also attach the the board by punching small holes 2 inches (5 cm) away from the top and bottom of the folded board. Punch the holes on the inner folds to conceal them. Loop pipe cleaners or craft wire through these holes and around the cross bars of the basket.

,


The color you use will depend on the type of ""frosting"" you want your cupcake to have. Use white tights for vanilla, brown tights for chocolate, and pink tights for strawberry.
Cut the legs off in a straight line, not at an angle.
For taller children and adults, you may need to use three pairs of tights.

, Stuff each cut leg with batting or polyfill stuffing. Knot the open ends.


Pack the tights so that they feel full, but not so full that they become stiff an unable to mold.

, Use a hot glue gun to adhere the stuffed, sealed ends of the stuffed tights together, positioning them end to end.


You could be left with one long, snake-like tube of stuffed tights.
Let the glue dry.

, Line 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of the top basket rim with hot glue. Fix one end of the stuffed tights to this spot. Wind the remaining tights tube around the basket's circumference, creating several layers of frosting.


Glue as you go. For every 4 inches (10 cm) or so of your frosting, apply a generous amount of hot glue. Press it in place to secure that section before continuing on with the next.
Create a spiral pattern with the stuffed tights. When it comes time to overlap the tights, apply the hot glue directly to the top of the bottom layer.
Gradually position each layer of frosting further in, giving it a stacked appearance. The top layer should be snug against the wearer's body, but the wearer should still be able to slip it over his or her head.

, Cut small rectangles out of felt or snip numerous pipe cleaners or plastic straws into small sections.


Use multi-colored materials for rainbow sprinkles or dark brown materials for chocolate sprinkles.
Attach the sprinkles to the frosting using a hot glue gun.
Position the sprinkles in randomized, scattered directions. Do not arrange the sprinkles to face the same direction since this will not look appropriately cupcake-like.

, Wear a red knit cap and use hot glue to attach a red pipe cleaner to the uppermost tip.


Bend the pipe cleaner slightly so that it looks like the stem of a cherry.

, Dress in tights and a sweatshirt.


The tights and sweatshirt should match the color of the frosting. If you used white frosting, then wear white clothes. If you used chocolate frosting, wear brown clothes.
Alternatively, you could wear flesh-tone tights instead of colored tights. Wear short running shorts above the tights, checking to make sure that they do not extend past the bottom of the cupcake costume wrapper.
You could also trade the sweatshirt for a tank top or sleeveless shirt.

, Wear shoes that match your tights, if possible.


Wear plain sandals or flats. Avoid elaborately decorated shoes.
If you cannot match your shoes to your tights, simply select the simplest pair of shoes you can find.

Britney brought this look back on Glee, but it was actually first worn by Britney in 2001.;
,
Purchase a metallic green bra or swimsuit top from a store like American Apparel.,
Wear a royal blue swimsuit bottom or tight navy denim booty shorts underneath.,
Get multiple light scarves, preferably with a gradient of colors, that are green, light blue, royal blue, purple, and/or yellow.,
Lather shimmer lotion all over your face, neck, chest, stomach, arms and legs.

,
Use a heavy amount of makeup on your eyelids and below your eyes to complete the look.,
Ask a friend to take a marker and draw diamond-shaped designs on your chest.,
And, the easiest way to pull this costume off is to buy a large yellow snake to carry around your neck and shoulders.",How to Make a Britney Spears Costume for Halloween1,", Use superglue to embellish it with beads and rhinestones in the center of the bra as well as where the straps meet the cups.

, Sling several heavily embellished belts around your waist, using safety pins to clasp them unevenly around yourself. Alternatively, use fashion glue to adhere rhinestone designs all over your swimsuit bottom, as Brittany does.

, Use a safety pin to attach one end to the sides of your swimsuit bottom, and tie a knot there. Let the other end flow to the ground.


Alternatively, if you can attach rings to your swimsuit bottom, you can simply tie the scarves on. This closely matches what Britney does on Glee.
Use at least four scarves for the best effect.
These scarves should be by your hips or slightly behind you, not in front of your body.

,, Line your eyes with black or brown eyeliner and then apply a matte blue color. Blend a shimmer green eyeshadow in.


You may vary the colors based on what you know looks good with your skin tone and eye color, but make sure that the colors match your costume.

Find a white t-shirt or singlet top that can be transformed.,
Sew a row of really large and brightly colored buttons or pompoms down the center of the top.,
Sew a length of ribbon down each front side of the top.,
Sew (or glue) a bow tie in place.,
Decide whether you wish to wear pants or a skirt.,
If you chose pants:


Find some baggy pants.,
If you chose a skirt:

Wear a tutu.,
Choose shoes.,
Add gloves.,
Paint all of your face white.,
Exaggerate your facial features to portray the clown's emotions.,
Add a red nose.,
Add a wig.",How to Make a Clown Costume," You will be stitching or gluing this top, so make sure it's a top you don't want anymore.;
, Vary each button's color, so that it looks very bright and colorful.


If preferred, glue the buttons or pompoms in place.

, Measure an equal distance on each side of the top for placement of the ribbon, then stitch in place. These ribbons represent the suspenders for the pants that clowns would wear to hold up their pants.


If preferred, glue in place; just be sure to smooth out the ribbon to prevent wrinkling.

, Center this under the chin area of the top, then stitch or glue in place. You can use a real bow tie or a more simple bow made from ribbon.


Old bow ties can be sourced from thrift stores, grandpa's closet, etc.

, Either is acceptable.

, These could be large sized pajama pants with spots on them, baggy pants with polka dots painted on them, or similar large-sized pants.

, It is best bright and even better if multi-colored. Wear striped or colorful tights under the tutu.






Wear a skirt made from a range of ties. This type of skirt looks zany, fun and is ideal for a clown design.







, Clown shoes are usually over-sized and large. Finding real clown shoes might be difficult, so you can improvise in one of the following ways:

Use a normal pair of shoes but add some cardboard ends. Draw large shoe-shaped ends from cardboard, paint them the same color as the shoes, then attach them to the end of the shoes with tape. This will only last one wear and if it's raining, they need to be covered in contact paper first, but they should suffice for a single wear.






Use shoes that are a size or two larger than your normal shoes, preferring sandshoes, sneakers or other soft sports/beach style shoes. Tie them up tightly so that they don't come off your feet. Walk with care and do not run in them.






Check online for clown shoe sales. There might be an affordable pair.






Wear ankle boots. Boots look bigger than shoes naturally, so they are ideal in place of the standard clown shoes.







, Although optional, this is a good addition, as it adds to the exaggerate effect. Wear white gloves, or rainbow colored gloves, for the best clown appearance.

, Use face-painting white paint for this purpose.

,

Paint a really large red mouth. It can either be smiling or frowning; the main thing is that it be larger than your actual lips. Be sure to really exaggerate the smile or frown, by making the ends of your mouth turn right up or right down.






Paint red rosy cheek circles, with red face paint.






Use black face paint to make your eyes much larger or more obvious. You could paint black circles around them, paint really long eyelashes, darken your eyebrows to make them stand out, etc.






Add other features as wished. For example, you might add a tear or cross sections through each of your eyes. Love hearts make a cute and more upbeat look.







, Purchase a red nose from a costume store or online. Simply attach it in place with the elastic just before you finish dressing.

, Synthetic, colored and multi-colored wigs are easy to source from the dollar store and costume stores. Look for ones with short lengths but lots of bounce and curls. Tie your hair back and up, if needed, then put the wig in place.


Medium to long hair is best kept in place by a wig cap.

Don’t overlook classic toy options.,
Spur the imagination with “make-believe” toys.,
Consider feeding or bathing gifts.,
Buy a few sturdy toddler books.,
Don’t discount the notion of buying clothes.,
Make the fun last.",How to Choose a Gift for a Baby's First Birthday1," While everyone appreciates a creative or unique gift, it’s often easiest and best to go with the tried-and-true. Little kids have loved red wagons, wooden blocks, stuffed animals, dolls, rattles, and drums for generations, and they still do. One year olds don’t recognize fads; they want things they can push, pull, pile up, knock down, shake, and cuddle.Classics like building blocks, nesting toys, and shape sorters (think “the square peg doesn’t fit in the round hole”) are great options because they’re fun and educational. They also stimulate creativity, coordination, and problem solving.;
, By the time they’re one year old, kids try to mimic practically everything they observe other people doing. If they see you fixing the sink, they want their own tool set; if they see a mother holding an infant, they want their own baby (doll) to cuddle; if they see you chatting on the phone, they want something to babble into.Simple, age-appropriate costumes like firefighter hats, royal crowns, or superhero capes also help stimulate kids’ desires to play and pretend.

, With messy one year olds, feeding time and bath time often happen one right after the other. In both cases, fun implements and toys can make getting messy and cleaning up afterward more enjoyable.Ergonomic, high quality utensils, bowls, and spill-resistant cups with favorite characters on them are always welcome additions to mealtime. Likewise, even the humble rubber duckie can bring a bit more joy to bath time.

, It's never too early to start building up a personal library for a child, but make sure you pick books that can stand up to lots of use and probably some abuse. Little kids love books they can hold, flip through, twist, toss, and chew on.Either board books (with rigid, tear-resistant pages) or soft books (which can be twisted and wrenched without ripping apart) with few words and colorful pictures are fine choices for a kid celebrating a first birthday.

, You may reflexively assume that all kids turn up their noses at getting clothes for gifts. Remember, though, that a one year old will probably be more intrigued by the bow or wrapping paper than the actual gift regardless. A whimsical onesie or playful pajamas can make a fun but practical gift.When in doubt, buy the bigger size. Kids this age grow amazingly quickly.
Also, while it’s tempting to buy a fancy, frilly dress or tiny suit and tie, opt for comfortable, practical clothes in most cases. The kid and the parents will get much more use out of such clothing.

, Toys made with cheap plastic, mystery materials, or shoddy construction may save you some money, but they aren’t likely to last long in the hands of a toddler. Even worse, they may present a health or safety hazard. Opt for sturdy toys made of solid wood, durable plastics, or strong fabrics with secure seams. Check safety recall notices and toy evaluations online to further ease your mind.


You can also “age-up” a bit so the toy remains interesting to the child longer. In the U.S., a toy that may present a choking hazard must be listed as “ages 3 and up,” so you can safely buy a slightly more complex toy aimed toward two-year-olds. A younger kid will still find a way to play with it, even if not precisely in the intended fashion."

Pack the basket or tote with plenty of plain white, yet strong drawing paper.,
Pack a few of the child's favorite ""theme"" toys such as a super hero, puppies, dinosaurs, or a princess.,
Include a book that the child can read for themselves, or one to read to them.,
Include something soft and cuddly.,
Add something fun to accompany the softie.,
Consider adding something creepy or silly.",How to Make a Gift Basket for a Grandchild2," While coloring books are a okay, children of a certain age can't follow the black line pictures and they can easily become disinterested. Drawing comes from the heart. Don't force them to say what it is, and be okay with the blue hippo.;
, This will allow for dramatic play using the imagination.

, After the child has opened the gift basket, offer to read the book to your grandchild. Interact with the child and ask about the main character, where the story takes place, and talk in funny voices––as the characters might.

, Every child need a softie; this could be a small blanket, a stuffed animal, a swishy-Nerf type ball, a pillow, or a lap pillow/table to do their drawing or writing on. 

, A small flashlight (age appropriate) is fun for reading at night, making shadows on the wall, playing spotlight, etc.

, Inspire your grandchild with something unusual to inspire make believe. Visit a museum gift shop, or a dollar store to find the perfect something. Be careful not to buy anything with small parts, or which might spill, or lose right away.


Choose rubber bugs, snakes, trick/prank items, etc. if your child has a sense of humor.

Choose something suitable for the older child.,
Look at their interests.,
Consider including an invite for a trip away from home and allow them to bring a friend.,
Think food for the trip.",How to Make a Gift Basket for a Grandchild3," While older children can be tough to please, impress upon them that you loved them dearly from the day they were born, and you love them even more today. 

, Find out what music they are into, a store they favor, or get them a book they have been wanting.


Ask them if they want to talk about anything––(right?)––well, maybe someday it will come out. In the basket, include some of the things suggested above.

, They can look at maps, discuss what they want to do, and whether they can get a hotel with a pool. The destination could be an hour a way, but you are giving your time to them. If the trip is a longer car ride, consider offering gifts during the drive, to keep them amused for longer. In other words, rotate the surprises and everyone will keep it together, with less crankiness.

, Pack some really great treats in this basket. Oranges and small snack treats are nice, but this bonding may call for some serious treats, such as chocolates, cookies, cake and candies. You could even make the treats together the night before including the ingredients in the basket, with the recipes included for them to try again some day. 


Let their parents know your plans for the trip, but hey, you're their parents, so tell your grandchild's mom or dad to chill it with the kids! Let your grandchild think you're the coolest.

Chart the child’s progress with your gift.,
Look into labeled or monogrammed gifts.,
Create a time capsule.,
Buy a savings bond or similar long-term investment.",How to Choose a Gift for a Baby's First Birthday2," A one year old is likely to already have and additionally receive an abundance of toys, so it’s fine to pick out a gift based on sentiment more than play. Since you’re celebrating how quickly this little one is sprouting up, a month-by-month photo collage or a personalized growth chart will probably touch the parents’ hearts.If you feel guilty about buying something the kid won’t immediately appreciate, tie a small rattle or other toy to the ribbon on the package, and the child will be plenty happy too.

, Whether it be a photo frame or album, towel or blanket, or t-shirt or travel bag, you can get pretty much any type of gift personalized with a child’s initials, full name, or any other type of message. Some personalized gifts may be targeted toward future appreciation, while others can be more immediately useful.For instance, labeled sippy cups, bowls, bibs, or bath towels will probably come in handy right away, and may be particularly appreciated if there is more than one child in the house.

, Especially if you’re sure the child is going to be buried in new toys anyway, there’s no shame in choosing a gift they’ll appreciate years from now. You can create a small but sturdy “time capsule” box and fill it with trinkets, mementos, clippings, photos, and a letter from you that represent the child’s first year. Mark it “Do not open until 20xx” (when the child is 16, 18, 21, 30, etc.)., A savings bond placed in the child's name can serve as another type of ""time capsule,"" and one that the kid may be even more eager to ""open"" in seventeen years or so. Also, if you feel awkward about giving cash for a one year old's birthday, this can feel more tangible and personalized.


Take some time to read over the procedures and regulations regarding purchasing a savings bond (or other investment product) in a minor child's name."
"
Give the kid cash.,
Support a special cause or goal.,
Accept a “no gifts, please” request.,
Suggest a book exchange.",How to Choose a Gift for a Baby's First Birthday3," You might think that money is an inappropriate gift for a one year old, but remember that a) kids are expensive; and b) it’s never too early to start saving. A nice contribution to the piggy bank (or even better, the savings account) may not send the kid into a frenzy right now, but it is certainly a thoughtful and useful gift.If you must, buy a cheap little board book for the kid’s immediate gratification, and slip the cash or check into the birthday card. Just let the parents know it’s in there before the kid shreds or chews it!

, Some parents may specifically ask that, in lieu of traditional gifts, you contribute financially to a special, larger gift, or donate to a specific charitable cause. Even if your inclination is to buy a fun and/or cute toddler gift, fight this urge and abide by the parents’ wishes. Remember that they’ve made the request for a reason.You could, of course, gift a donation to charity on your own initiative. Most parents would probably welcome and appreciate such a gift, but use your best judgment in regards to how such a non-tangible gift might be received.

, Some parents will simply want only your “presence,” and not any “presents,” and will spell this out on the invitation. While there is still some debate over the propriety of requesting no gifts (for birthdays, weddings, etc.), it is best to go along with the request. Remember, a one year old doesn’t know to expect gifts, and will have plenty of fun at the party regardless.If such a request really bothers you, talk to the parents directly and see if there is any kind of gift or contribution you can provide. Maybe you could even offer to help set up before or clean up after the party.

, If you know the parents would prefer a “no gifts” party but are concerned about stating this explicitly, you might mention the idea of having a book exchange instead. There are many variations here, but essentially, every invited group brings a kids’ book to the party and they are either drawn, swapped, or otherwise distributed to all the kids in attendance. Any leftovers can be kept by the birthday child or donated to a library or family shelter."

Write a journal of your favorite memories with them.,
Make them a compliment jar.,
Make a scrapbook of old photos.,
Donate to their favorite charity.",How to Buy for People Who Have Everything1," Describe what happened in each instance and what was so memorable about it. Include big things, like special occasions, and little things, like good conversations you remember. It’s a great, personal gift that shows the recipient you appreciate your relationship with them.For example, you could write something like, ""On July 4, 2001, we tried to go to the fireworks show downtown, but couldn't find any parking. So instead we drove out to the middle of nowhere and sat on the hood of the car, watching the fireworks from the shows all around us.""
You could also write something like, ""I had a cold once, but had to go to work anyway, and when I woke up, you'd packed me a lunch with chicken noodle soup in a thermos. It was so thoughtful and reminded me how much you care."";
, Ask each of their friends and family members to write down their favorite thing about them on a slip of paper. Then place all of those slips of paper into a glass or decorative jar. The recipient can read them all at once, or pull one out when they need a little boost to their day.For example, people can write things like ""Your eyes are my favorite color blue,"" or ""You always tell the funniest jokes!""

, The photos you choose are up to you and can vary depending on who the recipient is. You can place the photos in a photo album, or you could go a few steps further and make an actual scrapbook with different colored paper and decorations.For example, if you recently lost a loved one like a grandparent, you could gift your siblings with a scrapbook of photos of them with your grandparent.
You can also make a scrapbook of a vacation you took with the recipient (or that they took with someone else).
If you don’t have enough photos on your own, ask the recipient’s friends and family to help out and send photos they have.

, You can choose the charity one of two ways: you can donate in their name to a charity that supports a cause close to their heart – like the ASPCA for animal lovers. Or you can donate to a charity related to something that’s happened in their life – like the ACS if they or someone they love has had cancer.Donors Choose is a great website for looking up reputable charities to donate to.

"
Ask about their interests.,
Don’t ask simple yes or no questions.,
Look into their social media account.,
Ask the teen's parents.",How to Buy a Gift for a Teenager1," Find a chance to get to know the teenager you are buying the gift for. Ask them about their interests and look for clues. Ask what they like to do on the weekend, what they are passionate about, or what their favorites are. Also, take note of their style, i.e., what they are wearing, how they talk, and how they carry themselves, to clue you into what kind of person they are.If you are buying a gift for your niece or nephew, then make a trip to your sister or brother-in-law’s house. Ask the teen if you can see their room, or visit with them in their room. Take note of the things that you see in order to get a sense of what kind of person they are. You can also use objects in their room as conversation starters; for example, ask about a movie or music poster they have.;
, Instead, ask open-ended questions. These questions will give you a lot more information, and will enable you to delve deeper into the teen’s interests. Examples of good open-ended questions are:“How do you spend your free time?”
“What is your favorite book or musical band?”
“Can you describe your perfect day?”
“Would you rather watch Star Wars or Star Trek, hike or bike, visit the beach or the mountains, watch a movie or read a book?”
When asking questions, don’t make it a one-way conversation. Reveal things about yourself, as well. You might find that you and the teen have something in common, or that you were interested in similar things as a teenager.

, Their social media account(s) might clue you into their interests, as well. Look into their Facebook and/or Instagram history to see what they like and post about.For example, if the teen you are buying a gift for likes a lot of posts about video games, or posts a lot about video games, then think about buying them a video game.

, Asking their parents might help you pick the right gift. Parents often know what their teenagers hate and love, what they already have, and what their passions are. Call their parents, or send them an email or text. If you already have a few gifts in mind, ask them which gift their teen would prefer.


Additionally, if you know other teenagers who have similar interests, ask them what kind of gifts they would like to receive from someone.
You can also ask the teenager's siblings or friends for some suggestions, as well.
Remember, if you have a great gift in mind, but are not sure if it is appropriate, run the idea by their parents first.

Have a hair style that suits you and your lifestyle.,
Dress classy to act like a kid again.,
Wear comfortable shoes.,
Keep jewellery minimal when acting like a kid.,
Play with toys!,
Make your room look nice by painting it your favorite colors, and have of wooden desks and drawers to act like a kid.,
Adopt the attitude of a kid This is the most important thing to master when acting like a kid.,
Try to eat kid foods such as: chicken nuggets, fish sticks, sandwiches, macaroni and cheese, hot dogs, applesauce, Happy Meals, etc.,
If you want to go the extra mile, bake sweets.,
Respect your family.,
Be inquisitive.,
Study hard.",How to Act Like a Kid Again (Girls)," Do not feel that your hair must always be perfect. Even if it seems old-fashioned, the best way to make your hair look pretty and natural (besides shampoo/conditioner) is to brush it regularly. Most kids will never bother curling or straightening their hair so you shouldn't either. If you want to, you may wear a few hair accessories (like hairclips, bows, ribbons etc) but keep it simple. Or, tie it up in a ponytail, pigtails or braids, but leave it at that.;
, Pastel pinks, Purples, greens, light blues etc, are good. If you want to be extra feminine, go with floral prints. You may also wear hooded jackets, blouses, dungarees (overalls) and little print dresses or skirts with cute designs. You are acting as a kid, it is acceptable to wear whatever you like. However, avoid wearing black, anything with inappropriate slogans, or garments that expose cleavage or underwear. Steer clear of any clothing with logos splashed all over them. That is not very kid-like. Also, skirts and dresses should be knee length or below.

, Be sensible. These can include ballet flats, vans, trainers or sandals. Face it - while parading around in high heels is fun in some circumstances, they can be uncomfortable and impractical to wear and can result in foot problems in later life. Save those high heels for special occasions, such as weddings.

, You may wear one or two bracelets if you wish (or a necklace). You don't need to own or wear tons of flashy jewellery. If you have pierced ears, stick to studs or sleepers only, and no other piercings on the face.

, Have a Tamagotchi and a plush toy to sleep with (i.e. teddy bear). You can take a chibi doll or stuffed animal with you in your bag wherever you go.

, You could also wallpaper your room, with hearts or flowers. You may decorate your tech gadgets like laptops and smartphones with cute stickers.

, Don't do anything bad, and try not to hurt other people's feelings. If you're mean to one person a lot, be extra nice to them. (Not creepy though!) Try to be honest.

, However, don't be unhealthy. You know you always have to eat your vegetables or otherwise you are not allowed any dessert.

, Try making cupcakes, brownies, cookies/biscuits, slices etc, or even an entire dessert. Kids love to help out with the cooking. One afternoon you could arrange a time for you and your mum (or any family member who is willing) to do a big bake-off together. At the same time you'll be having some bonding time together.

, Appreciate all the things they do for you. Actions speak louder than words. Show how much you love and respect them by doing small favours for them when acting like a kid. You could try helping Mum with food shopping, stacking dishes in the dishwasher and not being immature.

, Do not be afraid to speak your mind. Kids are biologically programmed to have curious minds. You know how kids always ask questions, even when it seems 'silly'? You should too. Be that kid who always questions things. Asking questions may seem intrusive and nosy to some people, yet that's the only way you'll learn things. Kids have lots to learn, just as an adult has lots to learn as well. Thus, you make yourself smarter. Ask yourself: Why did this happen? How does this thing work? etc.

, Kid's minds are always active. Always do your homework, no matter how much you hate it. Do not focus on being a kid when it comes to this. Even if you hate maths or struggle with spelling, your studies will help you in the long run. You can still act like a kid at heart, but you must always have some common sense. Kids are not all stupid.

Recycle unwanted fabric.,
Use cooking related fabric items for cooking gifts.,
Use clothing to wrap gifts.,
Use towels to wrap bathroom treats.,
Use bed linen to wrap gifts.,
Make a craft person's day.",How to Wrap Presents With Fabric," The first possibility is to use fabric that you have sitting around in your stash that could be used as wrapping. Another alternative is to use old clothing that is in good condition and to cut it into pieces suitable for using as gift wrapping. Wherever you've sourced the fabric from, it's easy to use it for wrapping:


Using pinking shears, cut the fabric into a rough circle or square. Ensure that the fabric is adequate to cover the bottom, sides, and top of your gift.
Add several inches or centimeters more, for a gathering of fabric, at the top or sides of the package. If wished, pinking adds a decorative edge and helps to keep fabric from raveling.
Gather the fabric around the gift.
Fold into place.
Secure the gathered fabric, at the top of the gift, with a ribbon or similar item. As you can see from the image here, the fabric was easily tied into the shape of a Christmas cracker (bonbon).;
, There are lots of fun items for cookware gifts, such as using an apron, dish towel, oven mitts, tablecloth, serviettes, etc. Simply place the gift inside the cooking related cloth and fold over. Complete by tying in place with a ribbon or get creative and use cooking items to hold it in place, such as bag clips, tongs, utensils, etc.


In this case, the apron ties were able to double up as the gift tie as well – think outside the box when coming up with wrapping solutions and see whether attachments to the fabric item itself can be used to hold it together.

, If the clothing is durable and won't be marked easily by transporting it or leaving it with other gifts, it can make a great gift wrap. You could use a more substantial item such as a sweater to wrap around more delicate items such as lingerie inside. Seal with a lovely ribbon. Here is one method:


Choose the clothing items; here, a sweater with an interesting design and some socks.
Stuff the socks inside the sweater.
Fold up the base of the sweater.
Fold the sleeves in from each side.
Finish folding into a neat bundle and turn it over.
Fix into place with a suitable ribbon or tie.

, You can use any size from face washers and hand towels to bath sheets and even bathrobes as gift wrapping. Towel is a resilient fabric that will work well as a gift wrapping. Ideas of things to place inside include more towel items, spa products, shower products, cosmetics, soaps, etc. Tie in place with ribbon or other soft fabric pieces. Here is an example using a face washer and a small gift:


Select a suitable towel item, such as this face washer.
Place the gift in the center.
Start folding the gift into the face washer.
Tie into place. In this case, a patterned silk scrunchie was used, which also forms part of the gift.

, The suitability of doing this will depend on the durability of the item used but for some bed linen, it can be a great gift wrap. For example, you could wrap a set of sheets in a single pillowcase, a duvet cover, or a blanket. Always use the most durable linen item to protect the other items. Use string, raffia, ribbon, etc., to keep the wrapping place. Here is one example using a sheet set and a fancy sunroom pillow case:


Choose your items and check that the fabric wrap is large enough.
Place the sheet set inside the pillowcase and fold over.
Tie into place. In this case, the pillowcase ties formed the first layer of tying, followed by the yarn for the outer layer of tying.

, For someone who loves quilting, sewing, or making craft using fabric pieces, let your imagination run riot in using fabric as wrapping. For a quilter, an obvious choice is to use a fat quarter to wrap a stack of fat quarters. For a seamstress, wrap a bundle of fabric inside a piece of fabric. The idea is best if the fabric used to wrap can also form part of the gift and be used in the craft person's pursuits. Here is an example using a stack of fat quarters inside one fat quarter:


Select your stack of fat quarters.
Center the stack over the single fat quarter piece.
Wrap with a pretty ribbon or piece of lace. In this example, the lace piece was left long, cascading down from the gift because it was considered to be part of the gift for use in sewing later.
Read How to make a fat quarter Christmas tree if you'd like to add it as a decorative feature to the top of the gift.

Give them your favorite book.,
Make them your favorite meal.,
Put together a playlist of your favorite music.,
Give them your favorite bottle of wine.",How to Buy for People Who Have Everything2," Inscribe the book with a note explaining why you love the book and what it means to you. You can also include an invitation for a drink (your treat) once they’ve finished the book so you can talk about it., You can invite them to your home and cook your favorite meal for them. This lets them try a type of cuisine they might not otherwise try and gives them a night off from cooking. You can also put together the ingredients for your favorite meal or treat, and include detailed, step-by-step instructions. In both cases, they’ll get to enjoy something you love, too., You can also burn the playlist to a CD if you like. The more variety the better – you might introduce them to music they’ve never heard before, and make a new fan for one of your favorite groups.

, You can also switch this to beer if the recipient prefers beer to wine. Choose your favorite bottle (or two), and include a card that describes what you like so much about that type of wine. You can even include a suggestion for the type of food they could enjoy with them.

For example, you could say something like ""I found this wine when I was on vacation in New England. I love the fruity flavor of it, and how light it is. Try it with a piece of chocolate!""

"
"
Send regular flowers.,
Sign them up for wine or beer delivery.,
Get coffee delivered.,
Send food packages.",How to Buy for People Who Have Everything3," If the recipient is a big fan of fresh flowers, try a flower delivery service. Companies like H. Bloom, FTD, and 1800Flowers allow you to choose weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly deliveries. You can also talk to a local florist about setting up regular deliveries, which can be cheaper than using a subscription service., Companies like the Wine of the Month Club, the New York Times Wine Club, or the Craft Beer Company will send a selection of wine or beer to the recipient. The types of wine or beer, frequency of delivery, and price all vary by company, which gives you a lot of freedom to personalize the gift to the recipient’s tastes., If you have a serious coffee-lover on your hands, consider signing them up for coffee delivery. Starbucks Coffee has a subscription service that sends one 8.8 ounce bag of Starbucks Reserve Coffee for one, six, or 12 months. Other companies like Intelligentsia Coffee or Stumptown Coffee Roasters give you a larger variety of coffees to choose from., You can try a meal delivery service like Blue Apron for the foodie in your life. Fresh grocery delivery from somewhere like Local Harvest or the Department of Agriculture CSA lets you send fresh, local produce to the recipient that they can use in their own recipes."
"
Sign them up for classes.,
Hire a chef for a day.,
Get a gift card for Cloud 9 Living.,
Buy tickets for a joint experience.",How to Buy for People Who Have Everything4," There are so many classes and lessons available to help the recipient hone a skill they already have or learn a new one. You can either sign them up for the classes yourself, or prepay for the classes and let them choose when they want to go.Tennis lessons are a great option for the athlete in your life.
Painting or ceramic lessons would be a great gift for the aspiring artist.
Some race tracks offer racecar driving lessons, complete with a chance to drive around the track after the lessons are over.

, The United State Personal Chef Association website will let you search by zip code and cuisine. Prices vary based on how many the chef will be cooking for, the cuisine, and the type of meal, but it’s a great way to gift the recipient with a meal without relying on the same restaurants over and over again!, Cloud 9 Living is a website where you can search for a variety of experiences for a variety of budgets. You can send a gift card for the website to the recipient, letting them choose which experience sounds the most fun!, Maybe you have the same favorite band or singer. Or you both love art shows, or there’s a play you both want to see. Buy two tickets and make it a night to remember with dinner or drinks before or after the show!


For example, if you and the recipient both love classic 1940s films, you could buy two tickets to a film festival.
If you both have a need for speed, buy tickets to a race. It could be a boat race, car race, or air show.

"
"
Make a list.,
Look to your past.,
Browse the Internet.,
Narrow down your options.",How to Buy a Gift for a Teenager2," Once you have determined a few of the teen’s interests, and their personality and style, make a list of all the things they are interested in, as well as the things that define who they are. Spend at least two minutes writing down as many things as you can. Next, think of something to go with every item you wrote down. Pick one of the items, or combine a few.For example, if the teen loves watching movies, pay for a one-year Netflix or Hulu subscription. If they already have a subscription, then upgrade their account for a year.

, Another way to pick a great gift is to think about the types of things you were interested in as a teenager. Most teenagers are transitioning into new periods of their life where they enjoy more freedom and responsibility. Choose a gift that speaks to these newfound freedoms.A quality watch is a classic coming of age gift you can give to any teen.
A set of headphones or bluetooth speakers make great gifts for teens, as well. This way, they can take their music with them everywhere.

, There are many sites that list top gifts for teenagers, or have gift suggestions for teenagers. These lists are often based off of gifts that others are buying for teenagers, as well as contemporary teenage interests. Browse these sites to see if you can find an appropriate gift.Sites that offer great suggestions are Pinterest, GoodHousekeeping.com, GiftsforTeens.com, and Realsimple.com.

, By factoring in how much you are willing to spend, what is appropriate, what they might already have, and how much time you have to purchase the gift, you can make the process of purchasing a gift much easier.


For example, if their parents deem concert tickets as an inappropriate gift, then you can rule this out. Opt for a CD, or a subscription to Spotify or Pandora account instead.
Avoid gifts that the teen's parents might get them like clothes.

"
"
Give a gift card.,
Opt for a cash gift.,
Include a gift receipt.",How to Buy a Gift for a Teenager3," If all else fails, a gift card is always a safe choice. Give the teen a gift card to their favorite retailer, for example Urban Outfitters, Best Buy, or Game Stop. If you do not know their favorite retailer, then fill a temporary credit card with money, like Vanilla Visa., Alternatively, you can give them cash. This way, you can ensure that you are giving the teen something they want and like. Buy a card for the occasion from your local store or pharmacy and place the money in the card.

, Gift receipts are important because they allow the gift receiver to choose something they like in the event that they do not like the gift they received. When purchasing the gift, make sure it is returnable, and ask for a gift receipt. Choose a gift from a retailer that has a flexible return policy.


See if the store only allows exchanges with products of equal or lesser value, or will issue the person a gift card or store credit in equal value.

Start with a crossed or knotted ribbon or string.,
Make a loop with the left side of the ribbon.,
Make a second loop.,
Tighten the bow.",How to Tie a Bow1," The technique for tying a basic bow is the same no matter what type of ribbon you use and for what purpose you are using it. You just need a ribbon with a left end and a right end stemming from the same knotted center.


If you're tying a bow on the top of a package, loop the ribbon under the package, bring the ends together over the package and knot the two ends together so the ends are equal in length. You now have a right side and a left side to work with.
You can tie a bow from a piece of ribbon that isn't attached to a package. Tie a knot in the center of the ribbon so the left and right sides are equal in length.
;
, Pinch the loop between your thumb and forefinger to hold it in place. If you're tying a ribbon, make sure that it isn't twisted; the loop should be smooth.








, This time bring the right side of the ribbon around and under the left loop. Pull it through until you have a second loop of the exact same size. Use the same technique you use when you tie your shoes.








, Pull on the loops to tighten the knot at their center. Make sure the two loops are the same size and that the ends are even in length. The bow is complete.

Remove all of the price tags.,
Put the gift in a box, if it isn't in one already.,
Mark your cut lines.,
Place the gift or box upside down in the middle of your paper.,
Fold the paper around the gift.,
Fold one side of the box at a time.,
Add ribbon.,
Add a card.,
Try some creative twists if desired.",How to Wrap a Present1," There's nothing more annoying than investing your careful efforts into a gift only to realize you forgot to take the price sticker off. If you cannot remove the sticker, get a black pen and black out the price. You can also use a piece of tape if you put one end on the tag and pull it off, the price sticker will usually come with it. You don't want the person to see that you bought his electric shaver from the clearance shelf, now do you?;
, This optional step will make the gift easier to wrap. If your box comes apart easily (like a shirt-box), be sure to use a little bit of tape to keep it from opening during the wrapping process. Use only as much as necessary to keep it from coming apart, not so much that the person will need a machete to open it.


If you need to, you can almost always cut off excess wrapping papers. You can't add more wrapping paper on.


, Especially if cutting in straight lines is difficult for you, be diligent about this. Use a straight edge (like a ruler) or you can fold neatly along the line you will need to cut along, unfold, and cut along the fold. Put the rest of the roll aside.








, This will make sure that the recipient of the gift, when opening it, will land on the top of the box instead of the bottom.

, On the horizontal side of the paper, take one side and fold it over to the bottom of your gift. Then take the other side, folding it over, too. Now is where you need that extra inch. Take the longer side and fold it under so that you have a nice smooth crease instead of jagged cutting. Put it on top of the other end and pull it tight. Then tape together.








, On one end of your package, fold the corners in so you have kind of like a triangle. Fold the straight end over, then pull it to the top of your package. Tape. Repeat on the other side.


If you want to, add a crease to the triangle flap by folding the straight side over on itself.


, Make sure your ribbon is long enough and can go around the gift in whatever pattern you decide. For the ""classic"" look of a cross on top and bottom, the amount of ribbon you will need will be twice the length, plus twice the width, plus twice the height, plus enough to tie it and make the bow.


To tie the ribbon, put the ribbon on top of the gift and center it. Wrap it to bottom and cross the two ends past each other and pull it tight. Turn the gift 90 degrees, the lift the ribbon up the two remaining sides. Pass the two ends under the middle of the ribbon and Tie a bow on top. Get your scissors. Pull one of the sides of ribbon and curl it using the scissors. With all the spare ribbon, cut it and then tie it under the bow, cut in half and curl again, do so until there is no un-curled ribbon.


, Take the index card. Write to and from, name, etc. If you are good at calligraphy, this makes a beautiful personal touch. If not, you could either type it or write it neatly.


If you have lousy handwriting, and no to/from cards or stickers, you can cut a square of coordinating wrapping paper, fold it into a ""card"", and tape it in place.
You could also neatly cut out an element of the wrapping paper design (like a snowflake, a balloon, etc.) and turn it into a card. Tape this about an inch or two from the corner of the box.

, There's a lot you can do to make your wrapping more unique!

Wrap a newspaper around your gift elegantly. It will look different and unique.
Cut up word search or comics from news paper and wrap it around the gift.
Write some inspiring and beautiful quotes on paper inn your best handwriting with markers and pencils.
Wrap the gift in ordinary wrapping paper and add finishing touches with colorful tulle.
Use tissue paper. You can use it creatively and it will look different.
Give it a 3D effect by cutting butterflies or making bows and pasting them on the wrapping paper.
Use weaving to wrap your gift beautifully. It will spice up your gift and will look excellent.
Use rose petals to make a pattern with it on a plain cream wrapping paper. The fragrance will be lovely, however you can use artificial rose petals if you want to. But be careful as the petals may dry up, if using real flowers.
Take an extra large or a large piece of cloth and wrap it around the gift and give it a chick and classic knot on the top.

, Start about three inches from the end of the bow and make a loop. Hold it in place with your thumb and forefinger.

, The ribbon should now look like a backwards ""S"" with a tail at either end. Hold the loops with one hand so they don't come undone.








, Loop the remaining length of ribbon accordion style, so that you have a pile of loops with two ends of equal length sticking out from either side.








, Use a piece of florist wire or a thin string to tie the loops together at the center, dividing them in two. You now have a pile of loops on the right side of the cinch and a pile of loops on the left side.








, Separate the loops and fluff them up so that the cinched center is no longer visible. Use a scissors to clip the ends into inverted ""v"" shapes for a professional touch.

, Hold the folded loop in one hand so that the center folded part is facing up. With the other hand, use a scissors to cut the corner off of either side of the cinch, the folded middle.









Make sure you cut through all of the ribbon layers. Use a careful, firm snip of the scissors to ensure the cut is even and none of the layers slip.
Don't cut the two corners too close to the center of the ribbon.

, Fit the second ribbon between the notches you cut in the middle of the loops and tie a knot there. You can also use florist wire or a small string.








, Separate the loops one by one from the inside to the outside. Pull the loops gently from the center and twist them toward you. Arrange the loops so that they form a petal-like circular pattern. The floral bow is now complete.

Remember the tails.,
Form tails as long as possible.,
Cut the tails.",How to Make a Bow Out of a Ribbon5," Along with loops, tails are a distinctive part of how a bow turns out. Not all bow designs have tails, but for those that do, making them appear neat and sharp is important.








, Make sure that the tails are as long as possible when making bows. You can always cut them shorter but it's near impossible to make them longer without ruining the loops of the bow.







, Cutting the tails prevents fraying of the ribbon and neatens the final look. Use a sharp pair of scissors suitable for cutting fabric. The ends of tails can be cut into distinctive ways:









Diagonally: This is a cut along a diagonal line along the tail fabric.
Chevron: Choose a center point at the end of the ribbon’s tail. Cut diagonally to this point from the left and then the right side. Meet the two in the middle at the chosen point. Carefully remove the cut piece if it hasn't already fallen away."
"
Decide what the bow is for.,
Choose by quality.,
Experiment.",How to Make a Bow Out of a Ribbon6," This will help you choose the ribbon by texture and color. For example: if the bow is to be added to a garment you're sewing or it's part of the accessories accompanying an outfit, match the ribbon to the colors or textures of the clothes.

, Satin is a standard type of ribbon used for making bows from but it can be slippery for the novice bow maker. Grosgrain can be an easier beginner ribbon. Prints, velvet, Lurex, cotton, sheers and other varieties of ribbon are all suitable too. Ribbons with wire edges are great for gifts and bouquets.









At its most basic, if you can tie the ribbon into a tight knot, then it can be tied into a bow by hand.
Some ribbons are too stiff to make into bows without additional help, such as wiring or stitching.

, Try experiment with different types or ribbons, including different widths, to find the exact style you're after.









Always keep in mind that you need a lot of ribbon to make a bow. All the folding and tying consumes a lot of the ribbon.

Cut your curling ribbon to desired length.,
Find the natural curl of the ribbon.,
Note which side is shiny and which is dull.,
Grasp one end of the ribbon between your forefinger and thumb.,
Hold the scissors upward, with the blades facing up and open.,
Press the dull underside of the ribbon firmly against the blade of the scissors with your thumb.,
Pull the ribbon across the scissors blade while continuing to press with your thumb.,
Release the ribbon from the scissors blade.",How to Curl Ribbon1," If you're not sure, cut about 12 inches (about 30 centimeters). If this isn't long enough, you can cut off a longer piece. Remember that when you curl a ribbon it will get shorter, so take that into account.;
, Even when the curling ribbon hasn't been curled, it will have a natural curl to it. You will want to follow that natural curl when you're using the scissors to curl it.

, The dull side will need to face downwards, towards the ground, when you're curling the ribbon with scissors. Typically the curl follows the shinier side of the ribbon.








, You want to pull this as taut as possible. It depends on whether you've already tied it to a package, or whether you're going to do that after you've curled the ribbon.


It's easier to tie the ribbon on the package and then curl it, because then you only have to grip it on one end. Otherwise you have to tape down one end to hold it in place.
If you're right handed, place the ribbon in your left hand, and vice versa if you're left handed.

, Wrap your fingers around the middle of the blades and handles (in the X that's created when the scissors are opened up). Your thumb should be holding the ribbon against the sharpened edge of the scissors

, Make sure that the ribbon is still facing dull side down.

, You need to make sure that you do this quickly. The pressure will cause the ribbon to curl.









It's important that you do this part quickly, because if you do it too slow the ribbon won't curl. In some cases it will actually get flatter.

, The curling ribbon should spiral up. If it doesn't, or isn't as curly as you want it to be, then you can try the procedure again. If it doesn't work a second time, then you'll need to get a new length of ribbon and try again.

Decide what size bag you want to make.,
Cut the fabric.,
Press a fold about 0.5"" (1cm) of fabric along the top edge.
,
Fold and press again, this time a 1"" flap (twice the previous fold).,
Press a vertical fold halfway across the fabric; this will be the side without a seam.
,
Unfold and mark the placement of buttonholes on the wrong side of the fabric as shown, positioned below the lower horizontal fold.,
Make four buttonholes where they were marked.,
Open the buttonholes with a seam ripper.

,
Sew the side seam(s) and bottom seam of the bag.,
Turn the bag right side out and turn the casing to the inside.
,
Stitch down the casing to the inside of the bag.,
Cut two pieces of ribbon, or cordage to use as drawstrings.

,
Tie your ribbon to a small safety pin for ease of threading through the casing.
,
Pull the ribbon through the casing.
,
Note: The photo shows only one ribbon, but if four button holes were made, you should use two ribbons as shown in the drawing... one ""U"" shape from each direction so that you're pulling two ribbon ends from each side of the bag to snug down the opening.

,
Drop your gift in the bag.

,
Snug up the drawstring.

,
Tie a bow and add a tag if you like.
",How to Sew a Cloth Gift Bag," You can do this two ways.
The easy way is to wrap the cloth around the object you want to wrap and mark its dimensions on the back of the fabric you want to use.


 


A more complex way is to measure your object's dimensions (length, width, height) and add an inch or two in each direction for seam allowances. Bear in mind that these instructions are for two dimensional, rectangular bags, and that you will have to allow for all three dimensions of your gift to fit.
In this example, the width of the rectangle equals the circumference of the object plus two inches (diameter times pi plus two) and the height of the rectangle is equal to diameter plus height plus two (you could add 3 or more inches instead of two for a roomier fit).




;
, You can do this all in one piece or in two pieces, just remember to double the seam allowance if using two rectangles instead of one. The following pictures are for a small gift bag made from a single rectangle. If your gift is larger, it may require that you cut two rectangles and sew an additional side seam to make a bag large enough. Otherwise, the same principles apply.
,, This will be the casing for the tie closure.
,, These are to run the drawstrings through.
, Make them about .75"" (2 cm) long.
,, It's a good idea to clip the corner before sewing to prevent it from bunching up later. Zigzag the seam edges to prevent fraying. You can also pink the edges or sew a French seam to obtain the same effect.
,, Allow for clearance of the buttonholes.

Gather your materials.,
Mix one tablespoon of cornstarch powder with one pint water.,
Clip fabric ribbon to one end of your dowel.,
Wind ribbon around dowel.,
Spray ribbon with cornstarch solution.,
Allow your ribbons to dry.,
Remove clothespins and slide ribbon off dowel.",How to Curl Ribbon2," Although you need more materials than you would if you used a simple curling ribbon, this procedure doesn't take that long to accomplish. Fabric ribbons that you've taken the time to curl can add something a little extra to a nice package.Find a dowel stick (pencil or rod works, too) which you’ll use to curl the ribbon around. A bigger diameter creates a bigger curl, while a smaller diameter creates a smaller curl.
Get a length of fabric ribbon. The width doesn't particularly matter, it just depends on what you want in terms of width. Make it a few inches (or centimeters) longer than the final desired length because curling will make it smaller.
Mix cornstarch and water in a spray bottle.
Grab a couple clothespins or clips, or use tape.

, You'll slosh the mixture around in the spray bottle until you've made sure that the cornstarch has completely dissolved.








, You'll do this with the clothespin or the clip, or you can tape it. Make sure that the ribbon is secured, because if it comes undone during the drying period, it won't curl very well.








, When you're doing this you want to make it as tight or as loose as you want your curls to be. Again, depending on the diameter of the dowel stick (or whatever rod you're using) the curls will be bigger or smaller. Don't overlap the ribbon as you're winding it or those parts won't get the starch spray.









Tape or clip the end of the ribbon in place, so that it is secured on both sides.

, Don't drown the ribbon in the solution, but make sure that the entire ribbon is completely coated. Any parts that aren't coated completely won't be stiff enough to maintain their shape.








, They have to be completely dry before you remove them from the dowel, because otherwise they may lose their shape. This can take awhile so it's a good idea to curl your ribbons with plenty of time to spare before you need to use them.

, Your ribbon should be stiff and curling. You can somewhat manipulate the shape if you need to attach it to a package, but don't let it get wet, because that will make it lose its curls.

Gather supplies.,
Wind your ribbons around the skewers and secure them.,
Spray the ribbons with water.,
Bake ribbons for about 10 minutes at 200 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Remove from oven when ribbon is completely dry.,
Take ribbon off dowel when it is cool.",How to Curl Ribbon3," Unlike curling fabric ribbons with a starch solution you'll need a few more supplies and a little more time, because it can take a little bit of time to bake the ribbons into curls than to simply allow them to dry. This method, however, tends to leave them less stiff than the cornstarch method.


Get your fabric ribbon. When it curls it is smaller than what you started with so always cut off a bit more than you think you need.
Grab some wooden dowels or skewers to wind the ribbons around.
Get clothes pins to hold the ribbons in place.
Use a spray bottle with water to spray everything before baking it.
Line a cookie sheet with tinfoil on which to bake your ribbons.

, You want to make sure that the ribbons are tight enough that they won't slip off or lose their shape when you bake them. Avoid overlapping them so that the water gets every part of the ribbon.









Secure ribbons on both ends of skewers with clothes pins.

, You don't have the soak the ribbons, but give them a good spray and make sure that you're getting all parts of the ribbon. This will make it so they don't burn while in the oven.









Spray the clothes pins as well, so they don’t burn when they’re in the oven either.

, Place the ribbons on the tinfoil lined cookie sheet. The timing depends on your individual oven, so if it needs to go a little longer that's okay.


That would be about 93 degrees Celsius.

, Keep checking while it's baking so that you don't over or under-bake the ribbon or ribbons. When the ribbons are completely dry, that's when you take it out of the oven.


Check underneath to make sure that it is completely dry on all sides.

, Your ribbon should be well curled It should retain this shape unless it gets wet. You can use it to decorate a hair clip, or add it to a lovely package for that little extra touch!

Decide on a theme.,
Make or buy the gift items.,
Choose an appropriate basket.,
Layer filler in the bottom of the basket.,
Arrange the gift items inside.,
Wrap the entire basket.,
Attach an enclosure card, if desired.",How to Make Gift Baskets1," Nearly all gift baskets have some type of theme, and choosing a theme makes it easier to plan the contents of the basket. Choose the theme of your gift basket before you do anything else.


Sometimes, the theme is based on an occasion or set of circumstances. For example, you might plan a Christmas-themed basket around the holidays, a ""get well soon"" basket for someone who's ill, or a house-warming basket for couple who recently purchased their first home. Since these baskets are fairly generic, they tend to be easier to plan.
Other times, you may determine the theme of the basket based on the receiver's personality or interests. For example, you might plan a spa basket for a workaholic who regularly needs to unwind, a romantic basket for your significant other, or a gardening basket for someone with a green thumb. Since these baskets are not dependent on outside circumstances, they tend to be more versatile.;
, You can include store-bought items, homemade items, or a combination of both in your gift basket. Make sure that the items you choose fit your chosen theme, though.


For example, if you choose a food theme, you should only include edible items or related non-edible items in the basket. You shouldn't fill a basket with cheese, crackers, and wines, then throw in a random packet of flower seeds or bottle of scented lotion.
To save money, consider shopping at dollar stores and other discount shops.Gift baskets contain multiple items, and if you don't set a budget for yourself, you can easily overspend while creating them.

, While wicker baskets are the most common choice, you can pick from baskets made of different materials.The ""basket"" doesn't even have to be a basket—boxes, bags, and jars may also work, depending on the overall theme.


Note that baskets can be made of wood, plastic, fabric, and metal. Wood baskets work well for traditional gifts, but they may not be durable enough for gift baskets given to children. For kids, choose a basket made of plastic or fabric.
You can also use gift boxes, gift bags, muslin bags, canning jars, plastic buckets, and wooden crates instead of actual baskets. These may even work better for the theme of the basket. For example, a plastic beach bucket would be perfect for a child's beach-themed gift basket.

, Regardless of the basket you choose, you should fill the bottom with crumpled paper or another type of filler before adding the gift items. This filler provides an even, decorative base.Crumpled tissue paper is one of the most common options, but shredded paper, shredded cellophane, and straw can also work well.If you're including any fabric items, consider folding and using the fabric as your filler.

, Place the gift items inside the basket, resting them directly on top of the filler. Stuff additional filler in between the items to help hold them in place.Typically, you'll need to place the tallest gift in the center of the basket. Arrange the other items from tallest to shortest around it, turning them so that they face the outer perimeter. Try to keep the basket looking balanced from all sides.
On the other hand, you could arrange the smallest items near the front of the basket, then place the taller items further toward the back. In this case, all items should face the front of the basket.
Regardless of how you position the items, make sure that the basket and individual items can remain upright when left alone.

, Wrapping the basket can secure the individual gift items while also protecting them from moisture or damage. Cellophane, shrink wrap, and tulle are among the most common wrapping options.Cellophane comes in sheets, which must be gathered around the basket from the bottom up, and bags, which hold the entire basket without being gathered. Either way, tie the opening closed with a ribbon.
Shrink wraps and shrink bags are placed over the basket from the top to the bottom. Gather the excess beneath the basket, then use a hair dryer or heat gun to shrink the entire wrap from the bottom up. No ribbons are needed.
Use tulle only if you don't need to protect the gift items from moisture. Gather the tulle netting around the basket from the bottom up, and tie the opening closed with ribbon. Cheesecloth and twine can also be used in a similar manner.

, You can include a full-size greeting card or choose to omit the card altogether, but gift baskets are commonly accompanied by a 3.5-inch by 2-inch (9-cm by 5-cm) card.You can use themed enclosure cards, blank miniature note cards, card stock, or heavy-duty scrapbook paper.Include the ""to"" and ""from"" information on the card, as well as a brief message about the occasion or the contents of the basket.
Tie the card to the ribbon or tape it to the outer wrappings. If desired, you can also slip it inside the basket itself before wrapping it up.

, This may depend on the design on the front of the card, or on how big the item is that you want to enclose. This demonstration uses 1 inch (25mm) for the top, and 1 and 1/16 (27mm) for the bottom. Add a little to the measurement for the bottom, so the top will fit over it.

Consider using a toy for the basket.,
Think about the receiver's age and personal interests.,
Pick one feature toy.,
Surround the main toy with smaller trinkets.Regardless of what you choose as the feature toy, you should only pick one.",How to Make Gift Baskets2," To maximize the fun of this gift basket, choose a large bucket-like toy instead of using an actual basket.Options worth considering may include wagons, large dump truck toys, plastic beach buckets, plastic treasure chests, or baby doll carriages/strollers.
If this isn't an option, try to stick with child-friendly basket options or those marketed toward kids. Brightly decorated plastic baskets, plush animal-shaped baskets, and aluminum buckets decorated with children's characters are common.

, These should determine the types of toys you fill the basket with. Make sure that the individual items are safe and appropriately matched to the child's age level, and gear the toys toward the specific child's interests as much as possible.


For example, learning toys and toys without small parts are more appropriate for toddlers and other young children. While these toys are safe for all ages, though, they probably wouldn't appeal to an older kid.
Try not to assume that the traditional “boy toys” and “girl toys” will appeal to the child in question unless you already know they will. Some boys aren't interested in action figures or toy cars, and some girls may not find dolls or play tea sets particularly enthralling. If you aren't sure about the child's interests, it's best to ask someone who knows him or her before choosing the gift items.

, Gift baskets should present the receiver with multiple treasures, but choosing one toy to stand as the focal point of the gift can make the overall basket appear more eye-catching and appealing to a child.


For example, the feature toy in a gift basket for toddlers might be an electronic alphabet toy. For an older child, it might be a popular board game (or video game, if you have a larger budget).
You might be able to skip the feature toy if the basket itself is a great toy itself. For instance, if you use a wagon as the basket and the child is still young enough to ride around in it, you might consider counting the wagon as both the basket and feature toy.

, Avoid overloading the entire basket with expensive or elaborate toys, and instead, surround the feature toy with smaller gifts that accentuate it without competing for excitement.


Examples for toddlers and young children may include balls, toddler-safe plush toys, and toddler-safe cars. For older children, these toys could include small puzzles, yo-yos, action figures, and dolls.
Limit “practical” gift items. It might be tempting to throw in a few gifts for the parents—e.g., clothes or school supplies—but if you include too many of these in the basket, the child might lose interest in it. Limit the amount of practical items to one or two per basket, and try to make them appealing to the child by choosing fun or cool designs.

"
"
Choose a rustic basket option.,
Narrow down the theme further.,
Use a combination of fresh foods, ready-mixes, and commercially prepared foods.The exact combination will depend on the theme you choose and your own talents in the kitchen, as well as the amount of time you'll need to wait before delivering the basket.",How to Make Gift Baskets3," Food-themed gift baskets are among the most common, and the traditional wicker basket is an appropriate fit in many cases. If you want to vary from this, however, try to stick baskets or containers that have a comforting, cozy ambiance.


For example, you could stack wine and cheese items on a cheeseboard, place gourmet coffees and teas in a burlap gift sack, or arrange fruits and wines in a wooden crate., Knowing that you want to treat the recipient to a basket of delicious food is a good starting point, but “food” is too general to stand as a solid theme. Try to pick a specific type of food or common food pairing and work from there.


Popular examples can include:

Wine and cheese baskets, containing one or two bottles of wine and several blocks of cheese to accompany the wine;
Gourmet tea or coffee baskets, accented with tea biscuits or coffee cake;
Chocolate baskets, containing chocolate goodies in multiple forms;
Fruit and nut baskets, offering several types of fresh fruit and cans of salted or flavored nuts.


Think of the receiver's favorite foods. If the receiver loves chocolate, then some type of chocolate theme is probably a good way to go. On the other hand, that same basket would be a bad choice for someone who lacks a sweet tooth.
Consider the time of year. Certain seasons and holidays are associated with different types of food, and you could build a theme around that. For example, autumn is associated with pumpkin, apples, cinnamon, and caramels; winter calls to mind hot chocolate and mint.

,


If you plan to present the basket later that same day or the following day, you can probably include more fresh foods like fruits, cheeses, and homemade baked goods. These won't work if you're making the basket a week in advance, though.
Opt for preserved foods, commercially prepared foods, or ready-mixes if you need to save the basket for more than a few days. Ready-mixes also work well for recipients who enjoy spending time cooking in the kitchen.

"
"
Use a metal or plastic basket.,
Add luxurious skin and hair care products.The recipient should have everything he or she needs to enjoy a relaxing “spa day” at home.,
Provide related products to enhance the experience.",How to Make Gift Baskets4," Spa baskets need to have a “clean” appearance, and the use of a metal or plastic basket can accomplish that more effectively than a traditional wicker or wooden basket. Metal and plastic won't absorb moisture, so the recipient should be able to carry the entire packed basket into the bathroom without worry.


If you aren't sure where to get a metal or plastic basket, try looking in a home goods store for a shower caddy. Choose one with very few compartments, though, since it can be difficult to fill if there are too many small sections.

, As such, you should include a variety of both common and uncommon bath products.


Common bath products include anything that most people regularly stock in their bathrooms: shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion, and face wash. Uncommon, luxurious bath products include things that most people may only treat themselves to on rare occasions: bubble bath, effervescent bath tablets, exfoliating body scrubs, and body spray.
You can also transform common bath products into luxurious items by splurging and purchasing higher quality versions, homemade products, or organic products.
Pick a scent. The products don't need to smell the exact same, but they should all fit within a similar scent family so that the recipient can use all of the products during a single “spa day.” Choose the recipient's favorite fragrance, if you know it, or opt for something that popular like rose, lavender, or vanilla.

, Think of ways to enhance the “spa day” experience beyond the bathtub, and consider accenting the basket with a few other small items to that effect.


For instance, scented candles can create a warm, cozy, and romantic ambiance for the recipient during a bath. Similarly, a small nail care set can help the recipient groom herself or himself further, enhancing the recipient's “spa day” glow even more.
Avoid including edible accompaniments, though. Many soaps or effervescent tablets can look like food, and you don't want the recipient to accidentally toss the chocolates into the bath water while biting down on the chocolate-shaped soap.

Wine, Bread and salt are some things that are usually included.

,
Try to put useful and practical things in the basket.,
If you plan on including a gift card or two in your gift basket, consider buying many gift cards in smaller increments and lay them across the bottom of the gift basket for a fun filler.",How to Make a Gift Basket for a New Homeowner," Consider purchasing a gift basket that the new homeowners might be able to double-use as an item of décor in the new home:


Consider the basket color - the new homeowners might favor dark wood in their home, if so, buy a cherry colored wicker basket.
A picnic basket is also an excellent choice as it will allow the new homeowners to later take a break from moving in and enjoy a cozy and romantic picnic.;
, Colored tissue paper and decorative moss are standard choices in gift basket filler. Perhaps also choose colored stones as your gift basket filler so that the new homeowners can later use these as decorations in their home.

,, Like: candles, mini pillows, etc.

, Some good places to buy gift cards for are: Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, and Barnes and Noble.

Provide highly visible costumes for your child.,
Ensure that the costume fits well and is comfortable.,
Make sure that children do not wear anything that obscures the vision.,
Leave the sharp and pointy props at home in case they accidentally stab someone in the eye or a child falls on them and cause very bad incidents.If you do want to have some props, make sure they are soft, without sharp edges, flexible and bend when pushed.,
Keep kids warm and dry.,
Use non-toxic make-up only.,
Think road, driveway and path safety.,
Give your child a flashlight.,
Add glowsticks.,
Tell children that they must only cross roads at lights, corners or pedestrian crosswalks.,
Discourage kids from riding their bikes or skateboards.,
Check the town trick-or-treating hours.,
Consider physical and emotional safety issues.,
Provide escorts for young children.,
Forbid children from ever entering a house.,
Set a route and a time of return.,
Look at the possibility of getting walkie-talkies if your kids are going out alone.,
Tell children to keep away from unleashed dogs that are barking incessantly, baring their teeth or growling.,
Be aware of candy capers.,
Try something different from visiting homes for trick-or-treat.,
Think manners.,
Consider health safety.,
Schedule treat eating time to avoid snacking on candy throughout the day.,
Ensure that your child cleans his or her teeth thoroughly after eating the treats.,
Ask your child to consume water at the same time as having treats.",How to Have a Safe Halloween," Bright colors, reflective parts or tape are key elements to ensure that your child can be easily seen at night. If your child has a dark costume, add reflective tape, tags or buttons.;
, A costume that is dragging or shoes that are too big is just setting the scene for a tripping child. And nothing is as miserable as blistered feet and blocks to go to get home when a child has ill-fitting shoes. Sew up loose ends, baggy sleeves or legs and choose shoes that fit well., Masks are best left for the party back at home unless an older, responsible person is holding the child's hand while crossing roads. Or, make sure masks have very large eye holes for children to see through clearly.,, Watch the weather forecast to be sure the costumes will be suitable for the conditions. Nothing worse than having a cold the day after Halloween. Even candies cannot cure sore throats and runny noses.

, Check the ingredients of make-up used on children very carefully to ensure that it doesn't contain ingredients harmful to children. Also take care when applying false eyelashes, eyebrows, nails etc. - anything that sticks to a young child's skin may cause pain on removal.

, Children must be highly visible to people driving cars. In addition, a child must be able to clearly see where he or she is walking - some paths leading up to house doors are poorly lit, have stairs or uneven surfaces that children can trip on. Provide a source of light to help., Flashlights are essential if children are going to make their rounds in the dark, particularly when crossing roads. There are special Halloween ones if you'd like but ordinary ones will do just fine. The type of flashlight with a bright orange cone is especially visible to drivers.

, Although glowsticks should not be relied upon as a light source, as an addition to a flashlight, they can help to make your child highly visible.

,, Well lit areas with good sidewalks may seem safe, but many parents drive their children around, and so there is much more driveway traffic than usual.

, Some towns have set times for trick-or-treating and if they do, make sure to follow these and have your child home on time.

, Young children may be scared by some Halloween displays and should never trick-or-treat unaccompanied. If you do not accompany older children, you should be aware of where your children intend to trick-or-treat and set some basic ground rules about house visits and return times.

, Young children are those under nine years of age.Have an adult or older teen siblings go along trick-or-treating for children in this age group. If there is a group from your neighborhood, it may be safer for your children to go with them, there is safety in numbers.

, Unless it is the home of a relative or very close family friend, make sure that your children understand to never enter a home during trick-or-treat. Even where a child enters the house of a relative or friend, the adult accompanying them should go in too.

, Do this if your kids are old enough to go out by themselves. This will allow you to backtrack them if they are late.

, This is especially important in rural areas where there may be some distance between houses.

, If a house has not leashed its dog for Halloween and the dog is making a ruckus, take this as a sign that the inhabitants are not interested in trick-or-treating. Better a safe child than a bitten one.

, Stories of poisoned candies and treats abound. Although most accounts of poisoned candy/concealed needles have been proven false,it is always better to be safe than sorry to avoid any villainous urban legend copycat. Be vigilant and keep your child safe.


Tell children to bring the candy home first before eating it.Make sure that the candy the child eats is wrapped. Go through candy given to younger children and discard anything that is opened or tampered with. Explain to older kids to do the same thing.






Also be aware to remove any treats that are too small for children under 3. Anything that might pose a choking hazard should be discarded., If you live somewhere that you feel is perhaps a little rough or is perhaps just too dark or far for your child, consider looking for alternatives run by businesses or organizations:

Check the local schools, malls, and churches to see if they have a special program running. Something like a Halloween Carnival or Fall Festival might be occurring as a substitute for trick-or-treating.






Look at local shopping malls. They might have store-to-store trick-or-treating.







, While not necessarily safety, manners can prevent the potential for belligerent responses from tired and grumpy old adults. Encourage your kids to be respectful to everyone, regardless of whether they get their treats. Sure, the tradition is ""trick or treat"", but many people choose not to recognize this holiday at all, and hard feelings can result from a small prank. And teach kids to be gracious for what they do receive., Finally, last but not least, consider your child's health. Teeth, immune systems, body weight and general health are all impacted by too much sugar. Treats should be fun but should not be overdone. Help your child keep a health diet by:

Sitting down with your child and dividing up the treats. Ask your child to identify any treats he or she doesn't like and have those discarded immediately. Why eat something you don't like just because you have it?







, Insist that meals be eaten as always and allow treats only after meals have been eaten., Children under 7 should be assisted in cleaning their teeth so that they get rid off all the candy stuck to their teeth. Try to explain to them how if you eat sweets you must clean your teeth because you don't want fillings.

, Not only is this healthier than soda and therefore less of a sugar overload but it also helps to fill them up and slow down the rate at which candy is being gulped down.

Consider the age of the person that the gift is for.,
Think about their personality.,
Throw in something generic.,
Consider buying them treats.",How to Find the Best Halloween Gifts," Obviously, a four-year-old would like a different present than a 25-year-old, so keep the age of the person in mind while you shop for the present.;
, The large majority of the success of this present depends on their personality and their likes and dislikes. When shopping, keep the following questions in mind:



Do they like to read? If you know that the person loves reading, buy them a Halloween-themed book, for example, ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!"", mystery novels, suspense novels, horror books, or humor books about Halloween topics, like zombies are also good ideas.







Are they creative? If the person that you're buying the present for is creative, consider buying them a Halloween craft kit. There are various ones on the market that help your child make foam pumpkins, decorations, door hangers, pom-pom creatures, etc. A jack o' Lantern carving kit (complete with a pumpkin) is another possible idea for a present.







Are they wearing a costume this year? If they are, buy something to enhance their costumes. As trick-or-treating is still very important for children, consider getting them a gift that they can wear as part of their costumes. For example, if you want to give a present to a child who's being a witch, give her a package with some green face paint, fake warts, black nail polish, and black teeth wax.







Do they like decorating their house? If the person likes decorating their house for Halloween, decorations will be a huge hit. Consider buying pumpkin lights, window stickers, caution tape, a fake hand, arm, or leg, styrofoam tombstones, a talking witch, a scary music soundtrack, etc.







Do they like makeup or accessories? Teenagers may no longer be celebrating Halloween by trick-or-treating, but they still attend costume parties or have other reasons to dress up. Glow-in-the-dark makeup is a good idea for older girls. Any accessories that are Halloween-themed, like spider earrings or a necklace with a witch hat are other ideas for girls. You could also get some purple, black, or orange nail polish and some Halloween nail decals for her. For boys, stuff like fake blood or theatrical effects makeup that can make someone look impaled are good ideas, as well as fake knives, axes, or scary masks that they can wear.







Will they use lotions and fragrances? Many beauty & cosmetics stores sell hand creams, lotions, candles, soaps, hand sanitizers, and fragrances that have Halloween themes, such as pumpkin spice. Some stores will even have pre-made gift baskets. If not, pick and choose the things that she'd like. Try stores like Bath and Body Works or Bed Bath & Beyond. There might be something that catches your eye.







Do they like scary movies? If you know that the person in question loves horror or thriller movies, buy them a classic scary movie that they can watch on Halloween night.







, Add something else that everyone likes, such as a Halloween-themed stuffed animal (for younger kids), or Halloween-themed t-shirts (orange and black, have Halloween-themed pictures or quotes on them, etc.)

, Everyone loves candy, so throw in a few small chocolate bars, bags of chips or a cookie to top off your Halloween gift.

",How to Fill Trick and Treat Bags With Toys Instead of Candy," The only proviso is to purchase or make larger ones if the toys you'll be giving away are larger than the candies you'd normally be adding.;
, There are lots of possible toy ideas but they should be small, cheap and available in large quantities. Your best place of purchase is the dollar store but also check out party stores, toy stores and bulk sale places. Things that you might like to add include:


Plastic animals, dolls or toy soldiers (and the ones with parachute attached)
Bubble blowing liquid and blower
Toys that enlarge when water is added or the sticky toys that walk down walls
Costume jewelry
Halloween toys made specially for the season such as spooky spiders, skeletons, skulls, etc.
Stuffed toys
Small bouncy balls
Wind-up novelty toys
Small games or puzzles.

, A lot of Halloween stationery is made for the Halloween season, shipped direct from China to your local dollar store. Fill the bag up with pencils, erasers, markers, sharpeners, rulers, etc.


Stamp kits are a nice addition and while there are Halloween options, they don't have to be Halloween focused.
Stickers are a good option at Halloween. Entire sheets of Halloween or other designs can be purchased and cut around to make lots of additions for trick and treat bags.

, Small musical items can be a fun addition that allows children to make lots of noise when their parents would like some peace. For example, whistles, triangles, tambourines, maracas, shakers, etc. Look in the dollar store and toy stores. Also check out stores that support trade aid projects for much better quality whistles and small instruments.

, Small items like plastic fangs, an eye patch, a skull ring or a glowing Halloween brooch might make interesting additions to a trick and treat bag. Be sure to keep these goodies small and decorative, as the kids will already have their own fun costumes.


A reflective necklace or a flashlight might be a helpful item to give out. You could even keep such items aside in a bowl and hand them to kids you think don't look obvious enough in the darkness of night.

, Add things like glow-sticks, paper whistles, balloons and other fun items.

, If you're not standing on principle about the evils of sugar, then you can still add a few candies to complete the bag.

Realise that you will not necessarily need to buy a costume.,
Make the top of your dead school girl costume.,
Find a suitable skirt.,
Select appropriate accessories to look more like a dead school girl than a scruffy girl.,
Optimize your outfit.",How to Dress Up As a Dead School Girl for Halloween1," You may use any old school or work tops and skirts, however note that you probably shouldn't use something you need. Try to borrow things rather than buy them. As this is an outfit for one night only, probably, make your maximum spending limit a small amount, $8 / £5.;
, Apply fake blood to an old blouse if you want your costume to resemble a school girl who died in a gory way. You could, alternatively, apply a little dirt or dust to imitate a reanimated corpse of a school girl who did not die violently.

, A (short) black, blue or grey skirt would be fine. You can wear a longer skirt if you prefer. Apply blood to your skirt too, it may not show. If you prefer the reanimated corpse look, glue fake worms to your costume.

, White knee high socks (not compulsory) which may be sprayed with blood. Pair this with black school shoes and a school tie for your shirt. The tie does not need to be neat, it is better scruffy and optionally blood sprayed too!

, It will look even cooler if you cut or rip the edges of your clothes. Remember though, October is very chilly (especially in Britain) and if you are going in a neighbourhood of young children, nothing too short or revealing - or scary for that matter too.

Give the gift of chocolate.The gift basket full of chocolate is a popular favorite among organic and inorganic consumers.,
Create an organic sweets basket.,
Bundle together organic grains.,
Give organic nuts to your organic nut.,
Put together a fruit basket.,
Treat your loved ones to an organic wine and cheese basket.,
Gift a basket full of organic coffees or teas.,
Give the gift that keeps on giving with an organic gardening basket.",How to Give an Organic Gift Basket1," It makes an especially good choice for those who are being introduced into organic lifestyles, since a basket full of chocolate can demonstrate just how flavorful organic foods can be. Shop in organic stores and online for various organic chocolates, which are made from cocoa beans that were grown and manufactured without toxic chemicals. Aside from boxes of chocolate, you can also introduce chocolate baked goods, like brownies, to the mix as well.;
, If the intended recipient is not a chocolate lover, you can still appeal to his or her sweet tooth buy filling the basket with other organic candies or organic cookies, cupcakes, and other baked goods. Organic cookies can last for a while, but you should be careful about buying other baked goods since they may go stale relatively quickly. This is especially true of organic goodies, which are made without potentially harmful preservatives.

, Sweets are great, but practicality can be good, too. A basket full of organic whole grain goods will remain usable for a fairly long amount of time and will provide the recipient with dinner food. You can choose a specific grain, like a pasta, or you can mix and match grains.

For an organic pasta basket, include several brands or various types of pasta noodles, as well as several BPA-free jars of organic sauces. If you plan on giving the basket away quickly, you can also throw in some organic French bread or garlic bread.






For an organic rice basket, you can include various types of organic rice, ranging from Basmati rice to whole-grain rice, as well as organic rice blends that mix rice together with dehydrated organic herbs or vegetables.






Avoid giving gift baskets full of bread. Bread expires too quickly, and unless you are giving the basket to an abnormally large family, the odds of your recipient being able to use it all while it remains fresh are relatively low.







, You can buy raw nuts, roasted nuts, or a combination of both, as long as they are certified organic. Roasted nuts are more common for gift baskets since they offer a relatively healthy snack for those who lack a sweet tooth, but raw nuts are more beneficial nutritionally and can also be used for cooking and baking.

, The fruit basket is a quintessential gift basket icon, and organic produce happens to be one of the most common organic products on the market. This works especially well if you have your own organic garden, but you can also assemble this sort of basket by picking up fresh produce at a farmers’ market or grocery store. Pick whatever produce is in season to reduce costs and improve freshness. While fruit baskets tend to be the most common, you can also mix in a few vegetables, like squashes or corn, depending on the season, if you believe your recipient will enjoy them.

, The wine and cheese basket is another classic option, and it has a more high class, elegant appeal than many other types of gift baskets can claim. Organic cheese is made from milk produced at organic dairy farms. Organic wine is made from organically grown grapes. Most wines contain sulfites, which preserve the wine, but an organic wine will also have a label stating that the wine is ""sulfite free"" or has ""no added sulfites."" Alternatively, you can also find wine labeled ""contains sulfites"" that was at least made with organic grapes., Like organic chocolate, organic coffee is made with coffee beans that were grown and processed without the use of hazardous chemicals, including pesticides and chemical additives. Organic tea, similarly, is made by grinding organically grown tea plants or herbs into a luxurious, aromatic blend.

, While not a food basket, strictly speaking, you can think of a gardening basket as a soon-to-be-food basket. Organic seeds are produced by produce that were originally grown under organic conditions. You can also include organic alternatives to inorganic pesticides and fertilizers.

Assemble an organic spa basket.,
Make an aromatherapy basket.,
Present the recipient with organic cosmetics.",How to Give an Organic Gift Basket2," A standard bathing basket includes fragrant soaps, shampoos, lotions, bubble bath, and bath salts. Thankfully, you can find organic versions of each of these products. Finding multiple product types that are all within the same scent family will create the greatest harmony and provide the most use. On the other hand, you can also theme your bath gift basket around one product, like organic soaps, and provide variety by offering the recipient multiple scents or organic brands.

, Aromatherapy is the art of altering one’s emotional state through the use of scent.


Use organic candles. Organic candles are made from organically produces and harvested wax, such as beeswax or coconut wax. The candles are also scented with organic oils.
Try organic potpourri. Potpourri is an air freshener made from a mixture of dried out flowers and fragrant spices. You can make your own organic potpourri by drying out organic flowers and materials grown in your own garden or you can purchase pre-made bags of organic potpourri. Include several different combinations in the basket.

, This is especially useful if the recipient is highly fashionable, has sensitive skin, or has just recently made the switch to an organic lifestyle. Organic make-up, ranging from mineral blushes to all-natural lipsticks, is cruelty-free and is often less harsh on the skin than standard cosmetics, making a beauty basket filled with organic cosmetics even lovelier than its inorganic counterpart.

Consider the recipient.,
Choose a container.,
Consider gift size.,
Add food.,
Add Media.,
Add hobby related item.,
Add Halloween trinkets.,
Arrange the gifts.,
Complete any finishing touches.",How to Create a Halloween Gift Basket for a Teenager," Are you making a Halloween gift basket for a boy or girl? A young teen or an older teen? What are their interests and hobbies?;
, You will need some kind of container for the gifts. This does not have to be an actual basket. Some ideas to consider are:


a black or orange basket
an old fruit crate
a backpack or tote bag
a plastic popcorn bucket
a trick or treat bag

, The size, shape, and number of gifts you choose should depend on the size and shape of your container. If you choose only big gifts, you won't be able to fit many and there will be enough gaps in between the gifts that it looks strange, and the size of the gifts may eclipse the container. If you choose only small gifts you may need dozens to fill the container. It is best to get gifts in an array of sizes, and always consider how they will look in proportion to the container.

, Halloween is a harvest festival and primarily about food. Candy is traditional, and individually wrapped fun-size candies are perfect for tucking in between gifts. You can also include popcorn balls, candy apples, crisps or chips, cookies, cakes, granola bars, and individual packets of nuts.

, Books, movies, magazines, and CDs are all good basket fillers. Horror would, of course, be traditional for the holiday, but you should only get things in genres or by artists the teenager enjoys.

, Include things that you know the teenager will like and use. These could include but aren't limited to:


Stickers and a shaped hole punch for the scrapbook enthusiast
Cookie cutters, sprinkles, oven mitt, or utensils for the cook or baker
pens and a journal for a writer or sketcher
Paints and brushes for a painter
Guitar picks, straps, strings, sheet music, or electronic tuner for a musician.

, Perhaps a small candle that looks like a jack-o-lantern, a gargoyle statue, a plastic skull, or Halloween printed socks would be appreciated.

, Fill the container approximately 1/2 way with crumpled news or scrap paper. Add a thin layer of shredded tissue paper, excelsior, or ripped up sheets from the Sunday comics. Arrange the larger gifts, such as DVDs or books, towards the back of the container. Add the medium gifts, such as CDs or guitar straps, next, just in front of the larger. Tuck the small gifts, such as fun size candies, into any gaps left.

, You may want to seal the basket in plastic for a ""professional"" look. You can buy plastic for this purpose from a craft store. You may also decide to place the basket in a gift bag, or simply to tie a ribbon to the container.

Find out what kind of books they like.,
Buy around 10 books of their choice.,
A collector would also love it if you can find a rare book, maybe a first or second print edition.,
Once you have your books in place, buy a nice basket.,
At the base of the basket (if it's not a stiff material) put in a piece of cardboard.,
Put some confetti or coloured bits of paper and add them at the bottom.

,
Put the books inside the basket, the way you would put them in shelves.,
Now take a big sheet of transparent paper (coloured/patterned/plain), big enough to cover your whole basket.,
Wrap your entire basket in it and tie it on the top with a cute ribbon.,
Watch the book lover's smile as they receive their favourite gift.

",How to Create a Gift Basket for a Book Lover," If they like religious books, search online about what kind of books have recently been released on that particular subject.;
, If you want to give them an entire range of books, buy a few comic books (they always work), a few books which have made it to the best seller lists, and a self help book or so. And you can also include a gift coupon of a book store along with it. If you know they like gardening or cooking, include some hobby books. If they are the sort who would like to mix drinks, add a book about cocktails and mocktails.

, Or you can try to find the entire volume of a particular series, or maybe the entire works of an author.

, It can be a cute re-usable wicker/cane basket or some canvas material basket in which they can store other things later. Make sure that the width of the basket is as much as the width of the book.

, Book lovers are known for the meticulous way in which they like the books being kept (more often than not) so make sure you present it well.

,, Don't lay the book in spine-up. Though it means that the person won't be able to read the titles of the books immediately, it's alright. You don't want to spoil the books in the gifting process.

, A gauzy piece of fabric will also do.

, However, make sure that the person who you are presenting this whole set to can understand that these are books!

Find a suitable tub.,
Fill the tub with cool water.,
Float several apples in the water.,
Select the order of players.,
Catch an apple with your teeth.,
Keep your hands behind your back while bobbing.,
Keep track of how long it takes each player to get their apple.,
Select the winner.,
Clean up.",How to Bob for Apples1," You can use a bucket, a cooler, a basin, or a bin, as long as it is big enough to hold water and apples. Wash the tub first, then place it on a table or cart that is strong enough to hold it when it is full of water. The top should be about waist-high to participants in the game.


You could also place the tub on the ground and have participants kneel down to bob for apples.;
, You don’t want the water to be too cold or too hot because people will be sticking their heads in it. Fill the tub about 3/4 full. Take care not to overfill so that water won't be sloshing and splashing out—much.


If you're playing inside, place towels underneath the tub and around the base so that the floor won't get wet.

, Put as many as will fit in your tub, but not so many that the apples don't move: you want it to be a bit of a challenge. You can choose to put apples in for all the participants, or refill the tub as you go along.Another idea is to have the same number of apples (e.g., 5 apples) in the tub for each player’s turn.
Choose smaller varieties of apples for children so it will be easier for them to sink their teeth into the apple.
Plan on 1-2 apples per player, as some might get bites taken out of them but not removed from the tub with a player’s teeth.

, You could do this by age, such as allowing the youngest person to go first, or alphabetically, or choose a random order. Alternatively, if you have a big enough tub, everyone can start at the same time and the first person to catch an apple in their teeth is the winner., Each player must try to grab an apple with only their teeth -- you can’t use your hands! Sink your teeth into the flesh, or try to catch the stem in your teeth. You must get the apple out of the tub using only your teeth, so if you drop it and it falls back into the tub you’ll have to try again.A trick is to hold your breath and push the apple all the way down to the bottom of the tub before attempting to bite it. The side can work too, but it is trickier!

, You are not allowed to use your hands for bobbing, so each player must keep their hands behind their back at all times. If a player touches the apple with their hands, their turn will not count and they must start over., To find out who can get their apple the quickest, time each player’s turn. You can have the other players count ""1000 one, 1000 two,"" etc. while the player is bobbing. Or, use a stopwatch to keep track of how long it takes each player to get their apple.Set a time limit, such as 2 minutes, for each player. If you have time, players who didn’t get an apple on their first turn may go again.

, The person who catches an apple in the quickest time is the winner. You could hand out prizes like caramel apples, popcorn balls, candy, or ribbons.

, Give a towel to each player so they can dry off. Remove any remaining apples and empty the tub of water."

Clean up any toys, trash, or animal droppings.,

Roll up garden hoses onto racks and be sure that your automatic sprinkler system is completed before dusk.,

Use glow sticks, LED lights, and other safe lights to illuminate your yard.,

Keep pets inside the house, the backyard, or in a safe location away from the area.,

Consider giving out treats in your driveway instead of at the door if your yard is unsafe.,

Turn everything off when you call it ""quits"" or don't want to participate.",How to Keep Your Yard Safe for Trick or Treaters At Halloween," The last thing you want a kid in a costume to step in is dog poo. Take a few minutes to rake leaves or sticks and be sure that the yard is safe to walk through. Place any small flower pots next to your door or in the carport, away from foot traffic areas.

If you've had renovation or cleaning work occurring in the yard, either put the items away or rope them off clearly. Put away ladders, buckets, garden tools, etc.
Remove any lawn decorations, chairs, etc. that might be in the way.
Tape down cords that cannot be moved from ground areas. Use duct tape or other strong tape.;
, Some systems are kept at ground level when not in use and not a hazard, as opposed to those that stick up a few inches. If you have a system that sticks up and could be walked on, consider making the spot obvious such as placing an upturned planter over it with an LED light placed on top., Be creative with the yard appearance. If you have stepping stones, consider creating a parallel glow stick path on the outside of the steps as a guide. Mini yard spot lights, overhead garage lights, and other eye-safe lights can be of assistance. Don't use automotive lights because they can blind kids while walking to your door.

Turn on the porch light. This will help trick or treaters find their way.
Invest in a small battery-operated light to insert in Jack O' Lanterns instead of candles. If you do use Jack O' Lanterns with real candles, keep them well out of the reach of kids, their blowing costumes, and any flammable decorations.
Ensure that any decorations, cords, etc., are well lit if they can't be tucked or placed out of the way.

, Dogs can be territorial of their surroundings and bark or even snap in defense. If a child is unfamiliar with animals or unexpected loud noises, they can get frightened as well and it may ruin their night. Scared pets, especially cats, can inadvertently dart across the street to avoid loud people or noise.

Keeping pets out of the way is also for their own benefit; all of the noise and activity can cause anxiety for pets and might cause them to run away.

, This can be useful if any part of your yard leading to your door could create a bottleneck if a crowd of kids turns up. If you see kids going around or playing with fences, gates, or other potentially sharp objects, inform the parents to steer them away. Driveway trick or treating can be fun in a few ways since you can play Halloween music next to you, create a haunted house, or even feel comfortable that you won't be bothered out of your TV chair every second., Lit porch lights are the most known ""signal"" to kids that tell them someone is home with candy. If you're home, but don't have candy nor want visitors, turn off any outdoor lights. With this, you can still join in the festivities with a lit Jack O' Lantern by the window or doorstep. When going to bed or out for the night, be sure to lock and secure windows and doors, as well as turning off anything that might attract people."

Tie string to apple stems.,
Vary the lengths of the strings.,
Hang the apples.,
Try to bite the apple.,
Select a winner.",How to Bob for Apples2," Select apples with long stems so that you are easily able to tie a string to the stem. Make a double knot and be sure the string is tied tightly., Each player should have an apple that rests at chin-height, so you may want to measure your players before hanging the apples., You can hang the apples from a tree branch or a swing set. A clothesline may even work if it is high enough above the player’s heads. Hang the apples so they dangle in front of each player., You cannot use your hands, so be sure each player keeps their hands behind their back. Attempt to bite the apple while it dangles on the string. This is harder than it seems, as the apple will swing around while you are attempting to nab it., The first person to grab the apple in their teeth is the winner. You could hand out prizes such as candy, bubbles, or chalk."

Buy a new costume each year.,
Carve a pumpkin.,
Celebrate the holiday with friends or family.,
Go trick or treating!,
Look at all the candy that came out of your bag This is the best part of Halloween: checking out the goodies to stuff yourself with.",How to Celebrate Halloween1," Shop around until you find the costume you're looking for -- there are literally hundreds to choose from. If you can't find what you're looking for in your area, try online. Some places will get you your costume in as little as a few days. Remember to ask your parents first!


If you're handy with a needle and thread (or mom is), having a costume that no one else will have is always better. Make your own. And if you're not, all you have to do is think outside the box. Want to be Katniss Everdeen? Grab a green button-down, some cargo khakis, and a bow and arrow. Bruno Mars? A fedora and a mic. The more accessories, the better.;
, One of the quintessential American traditions of Halloween is pumpkin carving. Grab mom or dad and go the pumpkin farm or a regular shop to pick out your next pumpkin victim. Do you want to do a spooky face? A friendly face? Maybe not a face at all?


If you want to do something different, think of your carving as a shadow. The light behind it will illuminate it. The part you carve out will surround the silhouette. Maybe the shadow of a ghost? Skeleton? Tombstone?
Have an adult help you with the carving and gutting out of the pumpkin. And you can keep the pumpkin seeds for roasting!

, Halloween does not just have to be trick or treating. A night or two before, get your friends and family together, go bobbing for apples, stick in a scary movie, and load up on the popcorn and salty party foods -- you'll be eating chocolate, chocolate, chocolate for the next two weeks!


See what's available in your area. Maybe there's a haunted house or a pumpkin farm hayride near you. If the weather permits, it's a good tool to get you in the spooky mood. If that's not an option, celebrate at home all week long -- make homemade decorations to get in the spirit.

, Put on your ghoul make-up and join the ghosts and witches saying Trick or Treat! (Smell my feet, give me something good to eat!) But remember only to visit those with porch lights on or those with Halloween decorations. It's usually pretty easy to tell. If they have lights on and decorations up, these are clearly people happy to celebrate (and give you something!) and this is where the Halloween spirit explodes with vitality.


Take a very big bag along or an even larger empty plastic pumpkin bucket to carry all the goodies that you get from every house. If these are unavailable, a pillowcase will do the job.
Ask mom or dad about trick or treating for UNICEF. In addition to going house to house asking for candy, the people you visit can donate their spare change to you to give to UNICEF to help children all over the world. All you have to do is order your box ahead of time!Don't go alone! Make sure you're in a group of friends or have a parent with you. Halloween's scary enough as it is!

, Also check the candy -- make sure it's all fresh and safe to eat. Watch out for hard candies; these can break your teeth if you bite too hard. And make sure that you take out any candy with ingredients you're allergic to. If you're not sure, don't eat it. Better safe than sorry.


Some people will give you small toys instead. Don't eat those!

Set jack o' lanterns in your windows.,
Load up on candy.,
Decorate your house in the spirit of Halloween.,
Have a Halloween pre-party.,
Welcome in the trick or treaters.",How to Celebrate Halloween2," If you're feeling gutsy, place them lining your sidewalk; however, know that if they're outside they risk getting smashed and ruined. You can buy pre-made, decorative jack o' lanterns at any big box store or at craft supply stores. But making them yourself is always better!



Carving your own jack o' lantern can be very messy, but great fun. All you have to do is hollow out a pumpkin, trace on a face, and cut it out. Then place a tea light or an LED light inside to light the way for your trick or treaters.

, Have a good stock -- you never know how many children will be knocking on your front door. If you have any left over, well, all the more for you!


You may want to have some spare change available. Since about the 50's, UNICEF has started a trick or treat program where children collect spare change to help children in need in over 190 countries all over the world.If any come to your door with a small orange box, that's your first clue. Make sure it says UNICEF on it, though!

, You can choose a theme (like a haunted house or cemetery) or you can just swallow your house in orange, black, cobwebs, and stuffed witches, like many choose to do.


If you're going for the haunted house feel, make sure to keep dim lighting inside and out. Line the walk, but little else. Play Halloween noises and cover your entrance in fake cobwebs. If you can, have someone in costume outside your house, beckoning the children to your door.
If you'd like to try turning your house into a cemetery, put gravestones throughout your yard. Dead flowers are a nice added touch. Fake crows, hands clawing out of the dirt, coffins, screams playing in the background, and fog rolling in will seal the deal.

Of course, if you're handing out candy, you have to dress up too! You're part of the show as well. It's not complete without you.



, Why only have your decorations up only for kids 2 or 3 hours one day a year? You went to all that work -- might as well put those fake skeletons and dry ice to good use. At your party, have halloween games, finger foods, drinks, and music. Not every party has to be scary, but you certainly can add a ""room of horror"" if you so choose.


One annual game for the holiday is bobbing for apples. This is only advised if you're not having a costume party -- or all the makeup will run off! Grab a huge bucket or barrel and fill it with water and some apples. Tie guests' hands behind their backs while they duck their heads into the water, trying to catch the apple with their teeth.
Halloween food decorations get better and better each year. Buy eyeball candies to place on Red Velvet cupcakes with white icing for the blood vessels. And sugar cookies can easily be molded into witches' fingers (think of an almond slice for a fingernail).

Make dry ice (or buy some) to perfect that witch's cauldron. Your drinks will be smokin' in no time.
If you're really intense, you could always stage a blackout or, with enough tight-lipped friends, a zombie attack (blood capsules will come in handy). Halloween is a great excuse to fulfill your strangest fantasies. (But don't let your guests in with weapons.)

, The time has come. Make sure all the right lights are on, the music is playing, you're in your costume, and the candy is ready. You'll probably get a few that come before your city's designated time, so stay on the lookout.


If you run out of candy and have no substitutes (and can't go out for more), turn your lights off. Do this as a courtesy to the children so they know that your home is off the Halloween market.This time comes only once every year, be nice to them and give them open heartedly. Children are going to love you for that! Make your Halloweens magical by just following few steps!

, If you don’t want anything to do with Halloween, don’t decorate your house. Don’t put out pumpkins or fake cobwebs or any Halloween décor. Leave your house plain so trick-or-treaters know you don’t celebrate Halloween.

, It is a well-known sign that you don’t have any candy if you turn off your porch lights. Make sure all your lights are off outside of your house. Close all your blinds and only keep a few necessary lights on inside so trick-or-treaters get the message not to ring your door bell., Halloween often leads to childish pranks.

",How to Dress up As an Evil Witch for Halloween," Nothing needs to be in perfect condition! A poorly kept, decrepit witch is no less evil than a well turned out one.;
, Your evil witch dress can be inspired by any period in time. Wear a sleek, elegant modern evening dress if you wish, you can be the type of evil witch who uses her stunning looks to achieve her evil desires. Find something with a touch of the puritanical, as would of been seen in the Times of the Salem Witch Trials or go further back in history and go for something even older and take inspiration from the late 1400s.

, Add some boots to your outfit.

, Improvise with a shawl, blanket or throw if you can't find a suitably evil looking cape.

, Wear a long black wig, or even a bald wig! In the Roald Dahl book, The Witches, all the terribly evil witches are actually bald! If you have long dark hair already, you could add a white or grey streak. Make your hair look like you've been for a wild ride on your broom stick if you like.

, Go traditional brimmed, pointed hat if you want to be traditional. Wear a Puritan's bonnet, or, a jaunty mini witches hat, for a more modern, sophisticated evil witch look.

, Black nail polish can stain, apparently. If you want to go for the evil, unkempt witch look, you could rub coffee grounds into your nails to make them look dirty, like you've Bern mixing poison potions.

, If you are being a witch from 1480 or so, makeup isn't really required. You can make yourself look glamourous and evil, or raddled, aged and evil.

Create a North West costume.",How to Dress Like a Little Kid for Halloween," Are you going for a “dirty from playing outside” look or one that says “trying to look like a grownup”? Put some thought into exactly how you want your costume to look. Kids get themselves into some pretty ridiculous situations, so be creative. You could cover your face and hands in Halloween makeup to make it look like you’ve been playing in the mud, or deck yourself out in a frilly pink tutu and tiara to play dress-up princess.If you want an even more elaborate costume, dress up like a kid who is dressing up for Halloween! For example, put a cheap cowboy vest and hat on over your kid clothes and tote a couple cheap toy pistols with a juice-stained mouth.;
, Nothing makes you look more like a child than clothes that swallow you up. After you’ve zoned in on a look for your costume, start picking out the clothes you plan to use in a couple sizes larger than what you’d normally wear. This look will be especially effective with oversized dresses, collared shirts, dress pants and shoes, and might be part of a “dressing like mommy/daddy” costume.Wearing clothes that don't fit is a popular dress trend these days, so try to select clothes that play into the kid theme and don't just make you look like you're trying to be hip.

, Head down to Goodwill and pick up a brightly colored t-shirt or backpack emblazoned with a Disney princess or little yellow minion. Kids love wearing clothes with their favorite characters on them, and it’s a staple of their dress. It might be tough to find clothes with a kiddy look in your size, but these types of products often get made in adult sizes as well.There are constantly movies and TV shows coming out that manufacturers use to sell clothes. Take a look at places like Walmart and Toys 'R' Us for this kind of thing. Chances are, you'll be able to find something that fits you.

, The more childish, the better. Denim skirts, ruffly overall dresses and brightly-colored tights are all fair game. Look for floral print or designs that feature animals or wacky patterns. If you’re aiming for a normal little girl costume, a knee-length skirt and tights pairing will look just right. You might even be able to find a jumper or set of full-length footie pajamas to wear.

, Think back on the types of clothes and accessories you used to wear as a kid. You might pull off a little kid costume better if you’re not wearing the same clothes that are trendy today. Put together an outfit consisting of the brands, styles and pop culture references that were popular when you were growing up, and finalize the look with era-appropriate accessories.Be sure to style your hair the way people used to in the decade you select for your throwback look. This can mean perms, mullets or big, feathery teased 'dos. Rock the look from head to toe and have fun with it!
Accessories like slap bracelets, fanny packs, Moon Shoes, and sunglasses in funky shapes all have a dated look and can help clue people in on what time period your costume is meant to represent.If you want, you could even dress up like a kid from a bygone era like the 30s or 50s. Getting this look right will require more thought, but will definitely make for a unique costume. Run a quick image search for some inspiration., Grab some adolescent footwear to accentuate the clothes you’ve picked out. Velcro shoes are often worn by little kids because they don’t know how to tie their shoes, which makes them a good choice, or you can use a basic pair of colored Converse low-tops. Try to find something chunky or multicolored and be sure to wear them with plain white or character-printed socks.If you're not able to find Velcro shoes, some Mary Jane flats with tall white socks will work for a more dressy look.

, Pick out accessories that match the look of your outfit that will make you look more like a kid. This can be anything: a colorful backpack, hula hoop, lollipop or doll will make a perfect prop and help spell out the intention of your costume. Think of accessories that play into the particular look you’ve chosen. If you’re dressing as a little girl in a princess outfit, for example, you could make a magic wand, or a boy in grass-stained clothes might carry a baseball and bat.


You can probably find most of these props around your house or garage. If not, try making them yourself.

, Kids’ clothes are rarely in pristine condition, so soiling or tearing your costume in the right places can enhance your chosen look. Take shorts and shirts outside and rub them in the dirt, or else use makeup effects to simulate mud, finger paints and milk mustaches. Dab a little grape juice onto plain white t-shirts to give them a lived-in authenticity. Dirty clothes will be much more convincing as part of a little kid costume than plain-looking clean ones.Make sure that your clothes don't smell bad if you dirty them up with actual dirt or food.

, Little kids who dress themselves don’t pay much attention to whether or not their clothes match, and neither should you. This kind of small detail can make your costume much funnier. Pair together tacky combinations of patterns and fabrics, and go crazy with the layers. If you end up looking like you’ve just thrown together whatever you found in your closet, you’ve succeeded., Get heavy-handed with the lipstick, blush and eyeshadow if you’re dressing like a little girl. You’ll look as though you did your own makeup for the first time, which will make a great detail for a dress-up “glamour” costume. In addition to makeup, you might heap on loads of fake jewelry., Mess up short hair if you’re a boy or give yourself an intentional cowlick. Girls can put long hair in braids or pigtails. If you’re wearing some kind of headgear as an accessory, think of creative ways of styling your hair with it, like putting it in curlers as part of a “makeover with mommy” costume or leaving it hanging over your eyes underneath a baseball cap.Girls can also tie ribbons or bows in their hair.

, Even people who never watched The Little Rascals know the Alfalfa character for his humorous suspenders-and-bowtie combo and trademark cowlick. An Alfalfa costume would be quick and easy to throw together with one trip to a thrift shop, and you’ll be able show up dressed as a kid character that everyone can identify. If you and your friends are celebrating Halloween together, put together group-themed costumes and recreate the entire Little Rascals gang.This costume should be simple. A checkered shirt, suspenders, clip-on bowtie, tall socks and gelled cowlick or cowlick wig should be all you need.
Use a brown felt-tip marker to dot fake freckles on your cheeks for extra detail.

, Wednesday is one of the most popular kid characters in all pop culture and one of the most recognizable. Creating Wednesday’s signature look will be similar to compiling a schoolgirl costume, only darker. You’ll need a long-sleeved black dress to layer over a white collared shirt, black buckle shoes, black or striped knee-high socks and pigtail braids. Remember not to smile too much—it’s part of the look!If you don’t happen to have long, black hair, use a wash-out temporary dye, or buy a cheap black wig and braid it yourself.
Bring along a rubber hand prop to be accompanied by “Thing.”

, Grab some khakis, a dress shirt and a Christmas sweater and you’ve got the clothing down, but Kevin McCallister’s most distinguishing feature was his engineering mischief, not his wardrobe. Deck yourself out with a clothing iron, hair dryer, BB gun and even a fake tarantula and see if your friends can guess who you are. If they need a hint, just slap both cheeks and scream.


It’s perfectly legal to own and carry a BB gun, but might be unsafe if it’s loaded or looked down upon in certain settings. Make sure the props you bring are appropriate for where you are and what you’re doing., No one is off limits for a Halloween costume, not even the children of famous entertainment moguls. North West has recently become famous in her own right not just for being the daughter of Kanye and Kim, but because of the ultra-hip modern fashion her forward-thinking parents routinely swathe her in. Modify this look however you want: jogger pants, hoodies, stylish sneakers, a fur coat. Finish it off with a pacifier and an endearingly bewildered look and you might be mistaken for the real thing.To avoid just looking like a particularly fashionable adult, utilize some childlike accessories, like a cartoon character backpack or pigtail braids with beads, or have a friend go as Kim or Kanye and hold their hand.

If you can find an adult sized onesie at a department store, especially if it has footies, this is a great option for a baby costume. If you can't find an adult onesie, consider wearing a patterned romper. This can make you look baby-like as well.Look for rompers or pajamas with childlike patterns. Cartoon animals, stars, checkered patterns, and bright colors are all great options.
Some stores sell animal costumes for adults that look a lot like footie pajamas or onesies. These tend to look like something a baby might wear. You could get, for example, a monkey costume and dress yourself up like a baby.;
, If you're female, look into a baby doll dress. These are loose dresses that look something like loose fitted t-shirts. If you already have a baby doll dress, wear that as your costume. You can also find one fairly easily at a local department store.Go for childish patterns. Striped dresses, polka-dot dresses, or dresses decorated with cartoonish patterns can all contribute to the baby-like appearance.
If you can fit into items from the juniors department, you may find some dresses have cartoon animal designs. This can really help you look like a baby.

, If you're willing to spend money on a costume, consider seeing if there are diaper costumes available at a local costume store. An oversized diaper, worn with a childish t-shirt, can solidify the baby look. Some stores may actually sell baby costumes, which can do a lot of the work of making a baby costume for you.


You can try to make your own fake diaper if you do not have the money for a store bought variety. You can wrap toilet paper around a pair of shorts, for example, to make it look as if you're wearing a diaper.
If toilet paper feels too much like a mummy, try taking a white pillow case or white towel. Wrap it over your bottom like a diaper. You can try having a friend wrap a towel around you as if they were putting a diaper on a large baby. This can help your fake diaper look more realistic.
A diaper pin can also help with the baby look. Try to purchase an oversized diaper pin at a costume store. You can bend gray pipe cleaners into the shape of a diaper in and glue this on your fake diaper.

, Do not forget about footwear. Babies often wear booties, so consider going to a party in thick socks if possible. You can also make a trip to your local department store and browse for shoes in your size that look somewhat childlike. Jelly shoes, which are made from a rubbery material, often look sparkly in appearance. They could work well for a baby costume.You can try to knit yourself a pair of adult-sized booties, if you have time. You can knit using a pattern for a baby bootie, but increase the length to fit an adult.
Department stores often sell colorful, fuzzy socks. Consider purchasing a brightly colored pair of fuzzy socks and sewing on buttons or buckles. This can give the socks the appearance of a baby bootie.

, Oftentimes, babies are dressed in overalls. If you can't find a onesie, romper, or dress, put on a pair of overalls. You can find overalls at most department stores if you don't already have a pair of your own.Wear a colorful, baby-like t-shirt underneath your overalls. See if you can find overalls with any patterns or embroideries stitched on. This can increase the childlike appearance.
Make sure you do not just wear overalls. This may make you look like you're going for a hillbilly or farmer costume. Colorful overalls, such as purple overalls, can lessen the farmer appearance. You should also make sure to incorporate baby footwear, as well as some baby-like accessories, to make it clear you're going as a baby.

, You can also make a scary baby costume. Halloween is often a time to wear costumes that frighten others. You can buy an oversized baby mask at a costume store, which many will find terrifying. You can also combine a baby with other, traditionally scary costumes. You could, for example, glue thick costume hair around your face and add a small pair of ears, making you a werewolf baby. You could use makeup on your face to create the appearance of wounds and skin decay to go as a zombie baby.

, To start with your baby makeup, apply a layer of moisturizing lotion to your face. This will give your face a smoother look as you begin putting on makeup, and babies have smooth skin.You can also try a basic makeup primer to match your skin tone. This will also smooth out skin and lessen the appearance of blemishes and imperfections.

, Babies tend to have big, pronounced eyelashes. Buy a handheld eyelash curler at a local department store if you don't already have one. Use this curler to gently curl your eyelashes to make them more noticeable. You simply clamp the curler over your eyelashes and hold for a few moments. This should leave your eyelashes curlier and more noticeable., You should also add a layer of mascara to your eyelashes. This will leave them more noticeable, making you look more like a baby.Do not overdo the mascara, however. You just want to make your eyelashes stand out more. You do not want to make it look as if you're wearing makeup, as this is not baby-like.

, As baby's skin is smooth, you'll want to cover any imperfections on your own skin with a layer of concealer. You can purchase a basic concealer at a local drug or department store.Spread the concealer across your face using your fingers, a sponge, or a makeup brush. Target any discolored skin or blemishes. Also, make sure to apply under the eyes and around the nose.
Work in the concealer until your skin looks smooth and baby like.

, Babies tend to have rosy cheeks. To finish off your makeup job, dab some bright pink blush on your cheeks. You can also use bright pink lipstick if you want a more dramatic look. Do not be afraid to be a bit dramatic with the blush. You want to make sure you look baby-like, and babies often have very bright cheeks., Baby hair is often pulled into pigtails. If you have longer hair, separate your hair into two parts and then use hair ties to tie your hair into pigtails.Don't be afraid to go a little haphazard with your hairstyle. Babies often squirm when their hair is brushed or touched, so it's not uncommon for some hair to be loose or for the pigtails to be uneven.

, If you have shorter hair, it may be hard to pull off pigtails. You can go to a local costume shop and get a bald cap for your head. As many babies do not have hair, this can work just as well as pigtails.

, A pacifier and a bottle can really solidify the baby look. If you're not going for something overtly baby-like with your outfit, such as wearing a diaper, these accessories can help others understand your costume. Most costume stores sell pacifiers and giant bottles. You can carry these items around to make yourself look more baby-like.Make sure to tie the pacifier around a ribbon and carry it around your neck.

, You can also invest in hats to help yourself look more like a baby. You can wear a knit cap that comes in pastel shades, as these are often given to babies as gifts. You can also look into a bucket hat. Many babies wear bucket hats, especially on hot days. A bucket hat with a colorful, childlike pattern works best.If you want to solidify the baby look, buy a novelty pair of oversized sunglasses. You can wear this with a bucket hat or a wide brimmed hat. This can make it look like you're a baby on a warm spring or summer day.
Go for larger hats. If a hat looks awkwardly big on you, you'll look more baby-sized.

, Many babies wear headbands, so think about placing a head band in your hair. A lot of babies wear floral headbands, so try to find a headband with a flower in it. You can also opt for headbands that come in childlike patterns. Look for polka-dots, bright colors, and checkered patterns.


You can also look into oversized accessories. A giant bow, for example, can make you look baby-sized.

, Babies often cling to favorite toys or security blankets. Carry a toy, a blanket, or both around to help yourself look like a baby.


Many department stores sell oversized teddy bears or other plush toys. This can really help with the baby look. If you go to a large department store, such items will not be too expensive.
If you're choosing a blanket, choose a childish one if possible. Consider buying a cheap child's blanket at a local department store for your costume.

Finish with the lips.",How to Do a Doll Style Look for Halloween," Rub moisturiser in with your fingers. At first it will look oily, but don't worry - that will go soon! If you are having a long night (such as a Halloween party or trick or treating) and you would like your makeup to stay on for a long time, use primer. This will help to add on an extra few hours of that doll-like look. Add this after applying the moisturiser.;
, This gives you the flawless look that a doll has. It would probably be better if you could apply it with a brush rather than your fingers, because your fingers contain a lot of grease. To completely make yourself look artificial and doll-like, go over all the nooks and crannies on your face with some concealer. This is only if the foundation didn't cover everything. Or, maybe you don't have any spots, which means you don't have to do this.

, Use powder. This adds matte to your look. The foundation can leave you looking shiny and sticky, and it will be more likely to run. Whereas, when you use powder to top it off, you will not experience any of these problems.

, Just trace your own eyebrows. For this, you could use an eyebrow pencil, or kit. Or you could even use eyeshadow. Do whatever you usually do. Dolls don't have specific shapes for their eyebrows, but the brows are usually quite high up on their face.

, This is the most interesting part.


Use a purple eyeshadow on your eyelid. Then use a slightly lighter purple (or lilac) colour, getting closer to your eyebrow. Make sure it is all blended together. Make it lighter as it gets closer to your eyebrow but make sure there is always eyeshadow there. You wouldn't usually wear this to a day out but because you are being a doll, it's okay.
Add a bit of white eyeshadow in the corner of your eye and closest to your eyebrow. Then blend it again, altogether. You want there to be a gradient.
Add liquid eyeliner. You don't want there to be a massive wing, just a thin line going along the top of the eye and a small wing. Too much eyeliner covers the eyeshadow which is the main focus. But it is just enough to give the eyelashes a more full look.
Get a white kohl eyeliner pencil and draw it along the waterline. Also draw a semi circle under the eye, making it seem as if the eye is bigger. Fill that in with the white eyeliner.
Outline the semi-circle eye with some liquid eyeliner. Draw on a few long bottom lashes with it.
Apply some black mascara onto the top lashes. Don't apply any to your real bottom lashes because that is not where your eye is supposed to end.
It would also be a great idea if you wore fake eyelashes, because dolls have perfect eyelashes.

, The cheeks are pretty simple. You don't want to use highlighter or bronzer. You put some blusher on a round blush brush and you dab in the same spot, just below your eye. Don't put it anywhere else. This gives the effect that there is just a circle of rosiness that a doll has. It is probably best to use a pink blush rather than a red blush, and make it look very bright. Do this to both cheeks.


If you have a brown eyeliner, it would be great to use it at this point. If not, just use black. It could be liquid or pencil. Make lots of freckles all around your cheeks and maybe on top of the nose.

, Apply concealer or foundation onto the lips and blend it into the rest of your face. This way, you can create your own lip shape. Using a lip liner, outline a lip shape. It should be half the size of your actual lips. A lot thinner. But the same size in height. So only do this to the middle of your lips. Then fill it in with a lipstick. You can use whatever colour you like, but preferably pink, red or maybe even purple. Then finally, get a black kohl eyeliner pencil and draw two long lines going from the corner of your lip to the middle of your cheek. Add crosses to the lines. This makes it look like you have been stitched up. You can also add this to other parts of your face, like your forehead or even on your body.

Combine 16 parts white corn syrup with 1 part each of powder washing detergent, water, and either beet or pomegranate juice. Stir to mix the ingredients. Add in a small squirt of chocolate syrup if you wish to make the blood a more realistic color.
You can buy 100% pomegranate juice at the store, or use the beet juice that comes in canned beets. You can also use beet powder in place of beet juice.
This blood is non-edible and is quite sticky.;
, You can also make fake blood using Kool Aid. In a bowl, combine a packet of dark cherry Kool Aid with 1-2 tablespoons ( 14.79 ml-29.57 ml) of chocolate syrup. Add a teaspoon (4.93 ml) of water and stir. Adjust the mixture as you wish, adding more water if you want it more liquid-y or more chocolate syrup if you want the blood to look darker.The chocolate syrup darkens the blood to give it a more realistic color.
This fake blood recipe is fully edible!

, Jello and Kool Aid powder, combined with flour and water also make a great realistic blood. Heat 1 cup (236.59 ml) of water over medium heat in a small pot, then add 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) of flour, ¼ teaspoon (1.23 ml) of sugar-free black cherry Jello and 1 packet of black cherry Kool Aid.

Gather your supplies.,
Test your ingredients.,
Clean the soon to be ""scarred"" area.,
Imagine your scar pattern.,
Apply the liquid collodion in layers.,
Add color with makeup.,
Remove your scar when finished.",How to Make a Fake Scar1," This simple scar imitation can be accomplished without much preparation and in a relatively short amount of time. The only ingredients you will need are liquid collodion and scar colored makeup, both of which can be found at most costume, drug, or department stores.


Collodion is a liquid compound that is highly adhesive and frequently used in medicine or special effects makeup.;
, Collodion is a component that can be harsh on the skin, so you should test a small area before making your main application. This way you can be sure you do not have a negative reaction.


You should also test the color of the makeup as well. Try a little bit on the location you intend to use it. You natural skin color might offset the makeup color, making it look less authentic.

, When your body is clean, FX makeup bonds better to your skin, creating a better seal between you and the adhesive. A baby wipe, or mild soap and warm water, will prep your skin for your new scar.Wait until you skin is completely dry before applying your collodion.

, You may need to use a mirror if you will be applying the makeup to your face, but looking at the part of your body you will be applying your scar effects to, image the scar pattern you desire.


For more complicated scar patterns, you may want to use an eyebrow pencil to faintly sketch out the pattern before hand.
You might consider hash-mark patterns, jagged lines, or menacing x shaped scars for your look.

, As the collodion dries, it will draw your skin together and provide the appearance of a scar. For a more pronounced effect, you can use multiple applications. You should allow each application to dry before adding another layer of collodion.


Applying the liquid collodion to areas where you have tight skin could diminish the effect.

, Depending on your skin tone the color you use to tint your fake scar tissue will vary greatly. Your makeup can be applied over top or underneath your collodion scar.


Underneath applications of makeup will require you to put on the makeup before your liquid collodion, first allowing the makeup to dry completely, if necessary.

, Before trying to remove the scar, you should take a baby wipe and remove any makeup from your prosthetic scar. You should be able to peel off the your false scar without too much trouble with your fingers. If you are having difficulty removing your scar tissue, apply a prosthetic makeup remover, like Super Solve  or Isopropyl Myristate."

Combine red and blue paint with water.,
Mix red ink with glue.,
Combine red and blue paint, maple syrup and water.",How to Make Fake Blood Without Food Coloring2," In a medium sized bowl, add 2 parts red washable tempera paint to one part water. Then pour in a dash of blue, about one teaspoon (4.93 ml) per cup (236.59 ml) of red paint you are using. Stir with a paintbrush or a spoon until the colors and water are mixed.Washable tempura paint isn’t edible, but it also won’t stain your clothes.
Adding a touch of blue gives fake blood a darker and more realistic color.
Stir the tempura paint instead of shaking. Because of the chemical composition of the paint, shaking can cause it to foam.

, Glue dyed with red ink makes thick and sticky fake blood. Add your desired amount of liquid school glue to a disposable bowl, using as much glue as you want blood. Add in red ink, which you can purchase from art and hobby stores, until you are satisfied with the intensity of the color. If you want a darker blood color, add brown ink or chocolate syrup.You can also remove the ink tube from a red pen, cut it with a serrated knife, and pour the red ink into the glue.
Aim to use about 3 parts glue and 2 parts ink.
To make the fake blood less bright and more realistic, add in cocoa powder a teaspoon (14.79 ml) at a time. Cocoa powder darkens the fake blood to make it more of a burgundy color than a bright red.
Corn syrup and cocoa powder creates a thicker blood than using just paint and water.

, You can also make fake blood by mixing red paint with maple syrup and water. In a disposable cup or bowl, mix equal parts red poster or acrylic paint with maple syrup. Then add in a touch of blue, about one teaspoon (4.93 ml) per ½ cup (118.3 ml) of paint. Add water gradually by the teaspoon, stirring until you reach the consistency that you want.If you want very thick paint blood, you don’t have to add water.

",How to Make Fake Blood Without Food Coloring3," You can also easily make homemade red dye from raspberries, which you can combine with thickeners to make fake blood. To begin, place 1 cup (236.59 ml) of fresh or frozen raspberries in a blender, then blend until liquefied.It should take around 15-20 seconds to blend the strawberries. Add a teaspoon (4.93 ml) or so of water if the mixture is too thick.

, After the raspberries have blended, strain them by placing a fine strainer over a bowl, then pouring the liquefied raspberries into the strainer.The strainer should catch the seeds and chunks of the raspberries and let the liquid pass through. You should be left with about ½ cup (118.3 ml) of raspberry juice.
Dispose of the raspberry pulp or use it in baking if you wish.

, In another medium-sized mixing bowl, combine 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) of corn starch and 1/3 cup (78.8 ml) of warm water. Use a spoon to rapidly mix the ingredients to make a paste., Measure out 2/3 cup (157.7 ml) of corn syrup and pour it into the bowl with the cornstarch paste. Use a spoon to mix the corn syrup in with the paste., Add around 4 teaspoons (59.14 ml) of raspberry juice into the corn syrup mixture, mixing to integrate the color. Add more if the color isn’t opaque enough.You may need to add up to a few tablespoons of raspberry juice, depending how dark you want your blood.

, After you add in your raspberry juice, you should be left with a reddish pink liquid the consistency of blood. To give the blood a more realistic color, add around 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) of powdered cocoa. This will darken the blood to a dark red and give it a more realistic hue.,"

Ready your canvas.,
Prepare your gelatin.,
Heat up water for ready-made FX gelatin.,
Apply your gelatin mixture.,
Stain your scar to scare.,
Seal your makeup, if necessary.,
Remove when finished.",How to Make a Fake Scar2," Gelatin is a cost effective and easy to use substance, and when applied correctly, can give the appearance of scars, wounds, or burns to your skin. To make your gelatin scar, you'll need:


Gelatin applicator (popsicle stick/makeup spatula)
Glycerin
Gelatin (or ready-made gelatin)
Hot water
Makeup (scar color)
Mixing cup

, You should have a firm idea of where your new lines of your scars will run on your body. Gelatin is very friendly when it comes to removal, so you don't have to worry about pain if you apply it to an area with hair.


For more artistic scar patterns, gently drawing guide lines with an eyebrow pencil can be very helpful.
You might consider hash-mark patterns, jagged lines, or menacing x shaped scars for your look.

, Whether this is your face or your arm, a clean and dry surface is best for applying your fake scar. A baby wipe works wonders, but if you don't have that available, a mild soap and warm water will do the job just as well., The simplest ratio you can use for mixing up your gelatin scar solution is 1 part gelatin to 1 part hot water in your mixing cup. The problem with this sort of ratio is that the gelatin can get dried out and shrink, putting you at risk for losing your prosthetic scar.Many FX makeup artists recommend adding some glycerin to prevent your scar from drying out too fast.


Add ¼ teaspoon glycerin to your 1:1 gelatin/hot water mixture.Stir your gelatin mixture thoroughly, otherwise you might have bubbles form in the mixture and spoil the effect.
Be prepared to move quickly after preparing your gelatin; gelatin solidifies very quickly.

, In your mixing cup, bring enough water to surround and heat your gelatin to a piping-hot temperature. Ready made gelatin usually comes in a bottle, which you have to heat to liquefy. Once it is liquid and at a safe temperature, you can apply it to your body.


It's always best to test gelatin heated this way on a safe part of your body, like on your hand or forearm, before applying a large quantity of it to your body.

, Using your gelatin applicator, move the gelatin over the surface of your skin in the fashion that imitates the kind of scar you want to have. Due to the fact that your gelatin will not be malleable for long, you will need to apply your scar to your body fast.If you are trying to create a scar effect over a large portion of your body, or if you are trying to create an intricate scar pattern, you may need to prepare your gelatin in several batches.
While your gelatin is in the final stages of setting, you can tap it gently to create a puckered effect.

, Now that your gelatin scar is fully set, add some makeup to your scar to make it look more realistic. Foundation or concealer are great for blending the edges of the false scar, but a dash of something more livid can make your scar look like a fresh wound.

, If you plan on an exciting night out, or if you're the type that can't keep your hands off yourself, you might want to consider using a setting spray to keep your makeup on your gelatin. A smear caused by an accidental gesture will leave your look less than believable.

, Gelatin applied directly to the skin can be removed easily by peeling it off. Any stubborn bits can be loosened with warm water and a mild soap. This will ensure that all makeup and gelatin have been removed.

Revert to your normal self.",How to Make a Fake Scar3," Many professionals, including theatre companies, often use a special kind of wax, called nose wax or scar wax, to give the appearance of a cut or wound when needed.The following supplies can be found at most costume shops or online costume supply providers:


Makeup (scar color)
Nose wax/scar wax
Spirit gum
Spirit gum remover
Wax applicator (Popsicle stick, palette knife, etc.)

, Any oil, dirt, or grime on your face can make your wax bond imperfectly to your face. To prevent your scar wax from peeling off or coming loose over the course of your activities, use mild soap and water to make sure the place you will be applying your wax scar is clean.

, Be sure that you verify the ingredients used in your scar-making products to prevent an allergic reaction. If you have sensitive skin, you should test a small amount of your products somewhere on your body before applying your scar.

, Movement of your body causes your skin to bunch and fold, which will put stress on your scar makeup while you are in costume. Bony areas, like the nose, chin, cheekbones, and forehead, are more likely to keep stationary and leave your scar looking pristine., Some scar wax may be sticky enough, and the part of your body stationary enough, that you won't need to add adhesive to keep it stuck. Even if you don't think your scar is in danger of being knocked loose, using a little spirit gum to the back of your scar will help keep it in place for a few hours, in most cases.Apply your adhesive to the area of your body the scar will cover, leaving it slightly tacky.

, Depending on the brand you have purchased, there may be some small differences in wax consistency, but scar wax is often thick, much like a putty. It can be sold in tubes, which can be squeezed to dispense your wax, or tubs, which you will have to scrape/scoop with your applicator.


Professionals often break off a small piece of wax to work with at first, adding more as necessary.
As this kind of wax can be quite sticky, you may want to cover your applicator and fingers with a little mineral oil to make the process more efficient. Vaseline will also keep the wax from sticking to your fingers.

, At room temperature, your wax will likely be stiff and inflexible. You can make the wax more pliable and easier to shape by kneading it with your hands, warming it in the process. You should do this until the wax is soft, but not so much that the wax loses its ability to hold shape., Now that your warmed up wax is ready to go, form it into the general shape of the scar you wish it to become. A long, thin scar can be made by rolling your wax into the shape of a thick thread. Start by smoothing the entire scar on your body into a neutral line on top of your adhesive. You can give the scar texture and depth by building up your wax-line, or by using precision tools., Even the most convincing shaped wax might not be believable if you don't blend your new disfigurement with its surrounding skin. Liquid foundation is a good option to fill in seams between your wax and face, but you should at least use some makeup to give it the appearance of your complexion., Apply your spirit gum (or other adhesive solvent) to the area around your scar and allow it to sit for a short while. When your scar begins to feel loose, you can peel it from your face, cleaning any residue leftover with either warm water and mild soap, or a baby wipe.

Maybe your taste runs more toward Harry Potter or Elizabeth from ""Pride and Prejudice."" Whatever you decide, make sure your costume is something you'll enjoy representing., These are some examples of characters you can portray for Halloween, taken from well-known books, movies and music: Cruella de Vil, Elsa, Flash Gordon, Spider-man, Luke Skywalker, Shrek or Fiona, Elvis, Belle or the Beast, an Egyptian mummy, Dorothy or another character from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" Cinderella, Snow White, Aladdin, Captain Hook or Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, the Cat in the Hat, Mary Poppins, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, a witch or a vampire., If you choose to dress up as Elvis, for example, think of what people associate most with the King of Rock 'n' Roll. A white jumpsuit with colorful rhinestones would look great with some matching platform shoes. And don't forget that shiny black hair!, The trick to dressing in period style is to understand the trends and fads of that era. So if you're dressing as the Great Gatsby, knowing a bit about the Roaring '20s is helpful. That means wearing a pinstripe suit, shoes with spats and maybe even a decorative cane or low-brimmed hat with a band., When you think of history, what comes to mind? Great conquerors, presidents, royalty, celebrities? These are some examples of people to portray whom others will recognize immediately: George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, Queen Elizabeth I, Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, a Roman gladiator, Joan of Arc, Napoleon, Marie Antoinette, William Wallace (Braveheart), Amelia Earhart, Florence Nightingale, a Viking, Albert Einstein or Pocahontas., If you choose to be Benjamin Franklin, you might find some colonial-style dress in a costume store, but what about a pair of spectacles or stockings? Sometimes, you might have to look elsewhere for these kinds of items, whether it's your grandmother's attic or a thrift store., Whether you're sewing a queen's regal gown or a court jester's multi-colored leggings, it's important to have an idea of what color or type of material you'll need. Then you can gather the correct thread, along with other tools needed for the job.If you've decided to dress as Queen Elizabeth I, for instance, several yards of red satin or velvet should work well. You'll want to include the square, low-cut neckline particular to the Elizabethan period in England, along with a stiff white fabric for the high collar, or ruff, shown in the most common portraits of Elizabeth. A pearl diadem with a large pendant – or delicate headband that dips onto the forehead – will complete the look.

, If your costume is complicated or has several different pieces, such as in the Queen Elizabeth example above, you might want to begin putting it together well in advance of Halloween so it will be ready on time. Costumes like this one take many hours and several steps to assemble properly., Stop by your local fabric store or search online for a sewing pattern that matches what you plan to be for Halloween (for example, a nun or a witch). This will help save time by providing a template for the pieces of material you'll need to sew together.


The variety of patterns available are as expansive as your imagination, so you're bound to find anything from a simple cat motif to a much more complex Frankenstein suit."

, It will be a plastic cylinder with ink inside. Pull that out and place it on your table. You need to have a disposable cup and a baby medicine feeder ready.

, Get as much as you can and keep it in the disposable cup. When all the ink you can squeeze is out, take the baby medicine feeder out and use that to get out whatever else you can.

, Some inks are too thick to be blood, so you need to thin them out with a little bit of water. Don't put too much in, or it will ruin the color and feel of the ink.


If your ""blood"" is too bright, follow steps 1-4 with a green marker. Mix only until the color is dark enough. If your ""blood"" is too dark, follow steps 1-4 with a white ink. Its difficult to find a white marker, so instead of doing that, you could put in a lot of water.

Use foundation that matches your own skin tone. If you have regular everyday makeup you can use this as it’s probably already matched to your skin tone.






You can also use a liquid foundation that’s a little off from your skin tone to enhance the effect of wounded flesh.






Lay some newspaper down and make sure you aren’t wearing any clothes you don’t want to get ruined should you accidentally spill.





;
, Grab some toilet paper and tear it so it’s a little larger than the area where you want to create the wound.


If you’re making the wound on your hand you may only need half of one square of toilet paper.






For large wounds you may need two or three squares.






Tissue paper such as Kleenex also works. It;s best to use tissue paper with no etching or markings.






Once you have the toilet or tissue paper you need, tear another section to match this one. You want to have at least two identical strips of paper. You will be applying at least two layers of paper and glue to the area where you are making the wound.







, Pour a bit of glue onto some wax paper or into a cup and then using your brush, paint your skin.


If you are making a zombie bite or cut on your hand you won’t need as much glue. But if you are making a gash on your arm you’ll need more.
You need to use enough glue so that your toilet paper can stick firmly to the area.

, Press down firmly to ensure that your toilet paper is attached to the area.


Let the glue dry for a minute or so. When your paper is firmly attached, repeat the process.






Use your brush to add another layer of glue on top of your toilet paper. Cover the entire surface and then lay down another layer of paper.






Two layers will work but adding more layers will give your wound more depth. If you want to create a deeper cut or gash, add three to five layers.







, Once both layers are on and dry you want to go over and paint down the edges so that your wound will look realistic.


The texture from the glue will add a nice effect to the edges of your wound once you apply makeup.






If the paper has a defined edge and isn’t painted down then your wound won’t look as realistic.






Use a hairdryer, if you have one, to help the glue dry faster.







, To make the wound look real, blend the paper into your skin by painting it with your foundation.


Smooth out the areas where the wound joins the skin by applying some foundation to your actual skin. This will make it harder to tell where the tissue paper stops and your skin begins.






You want to use a foundation that closely matches your skin tone. It doesn’t have to be exact as an off-color foundation can add a nice discoloration.






A flat foundation brush works very well and will blend the area nicely.







, With your foundation applied, you now want to take a pair of scissors or tweezers and cut or tear the paper to create the opening.


You can cut a straight line if you want more of a gash or a circle for something like a zombie bite.






Be very careful while cutting as you are using scissors very close to your skin. It’s best to cut just a little slit to create an opening in the paper. Once you have an opening, tear and peel the rest of it.






Don’t remove the torn tissue paper from the area. You want to give your wound a peeling look. This will add depth to your fake wound.







, Get some red, purple, and gray or black eyeshadow and brush it onto your skin.


Brush the eyeshadow directly onto your skin which you exposed by tearing away the tissue paper.






You should also brush the areas of paper around your skin.






The dark eyeshadow creates a nice bruising look.







, Once you are satisfied with your wound and the color, add fake blood.


To make the wound look more realistic, apply the fake blood to your skin and the paper. Then take a brush and brush the blood to blend it in.






After you have blended some fake blood, you can then pour more onto your wound to give it a bleeding effect.






To make the blood drips look real, apply a few drops to an area and then let it run downward. For example, if you made a gash on your arm, apply the blood to the top of the wound and then let your arm hang naturally to allow the blood to trickle down. When you want to remove the fake wound, simply wash the area.

Gather everything you need.,
Apply a layer of Vaseline to the area you want to use to create the wound.,
Draw a line in the Vaseline to shape the open wound.,
Apply the eyeshadow to the wound.,
Complete the look by applying the red lip gloss or lipstick, and fake blood.",How to Make a Fake Wound2," For this method, you need Vaseline, eyeshadow, lip gloss or lipstick, makeup brush, and a toothpick.


You want to get eyeshadow with colors that include dark blue, light blue, light brown, dark brown, red, dark pink/peach and yellow.
Dark red lip gloss or lipstick works well for the blood. Lip gloss will give your wound a shinier, more fluid look than lipstick. Lipstick will work perfectly as dried blood.
You can also use fake blood at the end to add an extra touch.

, The thicker the layer, the more swollen the wound will look.


Blend out the edges so that it looks less like a clot of Vaseline and more natural.






This method with Vaseline is better for smaller wounds around your hands or arms.







, Use your toothpick to trace your wound in the Vaseline.


If you wish for your wound to look as if you were stabbed by something, make the line a little uneven but keep it relatively thin.






If you’re going for a larger cut or gash, carve a larger area that’s a bit wider.







, Let the Vaseline dry a bit so that you don’t blend it too much with your eyeshadow. Then with an eyeshadow applicator or brush begin adding the eyeshadow.


Use a darker shade of brown or gray in the center to add depth.






At the edges, use a light pink/peach tone to blend the edges of the wound to your actual skin tone.






Use the red eyeshadow between the pink/peach and the brown to make part of the wound look fresher.






You can also use the blue and/or yellow eyeshadow around the wound to create a more beaten up look. Blues, yellows, greens, and purples will give your wound a bruised component.






Make sure the eyeshadow is blended well, so there are no unnaturally straight edges.







, Apply the gloss or lipstick to the middle of the wound to give it a freshly cut look.


Lipstick will give your wound more of a dried up look than lip gloss.






Drip the fake blood in the center of the wound and let it pool or run to complete your wound.

Gather your materials.,
Apply the liquid latex.,
Add your tissue paper.,
Apply at least one more layer.,
Create the open wound.,
Apply liquid foundation.,
Apply powder, eyeshadow, and fake blood to create the bloody part of the wound.",How to Make a Fake Wound3," Stage makeup and latex is designed to give you a realistic look that you could use on stage. But, you can also use it for a costume, party, or simply for fun. You will need:


Liquid latex. Ben Nye makes a good liquid latex that is often used in the theatre.
Brushes.
Fake blood.
Tissue paper. Try to use plain tissue paper without etching or designs.
Dark eyeshadow.
It’s also a good idea to lay some newspaper down as liquid latex and the fake blood can get messy.

, Shake the bottle of liquid latex before opening. Then begin brushing it onto your skin where you wish to create your wound.


Liquid latex can be messy and kind of tricky to use. Try to paint it on evenly and don't rush. Though liquid latex dries fairly quickly, you want to make sure you apply it as smoothly as possible.







, Liquid latex dries pretty quickly so you want to work in smaller sections rather than one large area. Press the tissue paper down on the latex.


The tissue paper will stick pretty well to the latex. You can then pull and tear away the edges of the tissue paper which aren’t attached.







, Repeat the process by brushing more liquid latex over the tissue paper and then adding another layer of paper.


Two layers of paper are usually sufficient, but if you want to create the look of a deeper wound you should add three to five layers.







, Once your layers are dry you can rip open a hole or make a cut in the tissue and latex.


You can use a toothpick or tweezers to tear a hole or cut a line.






The paper and latex will peel back giving the effect of an open wound with your skin peeling away.







, With the fake wound opened up you now want to apply liquid foundation to the tissue and latex. Make sure that you apply the foundation in a way so that it blends out from the latex and tissue onto your actual skin.






Rub the surrounding area with your finger to further blend.







, Using your eyeshadow and any red powders, you can use your brush to add these to your wound.


Paint around the wound and on your actual skin with darker colors in the center of your wound. Use lighter colors as you progress outward.






Add a few drops of blood and mix. Then add a few more in and around the wound and let the blood drip.

Start collecting cardboard boxes and tubes now.,
Select a kind of costume: this is possibly the most vital part of creating your costume but sometimes it is also the hardest.,
Look around for parts of your costume.,
Plan your costume.,
Select your base costume item, a top and a bottom (trousers etc) or a dress.,
Buy the rest of your stuff too.,
Make your costume.,
Test out your costume and your makeup before the day.,
Keep looking for props even when you think your costume is complete, you don’t want to miss anything!

",How to Create an Original Costume," These will always come in handy.;
, Sometimes the theme for your fancy dress is already set, e.g. you must be dressed as a witch, but other times the theme is more general, e.g. book character.


When choosing your outfit, think about any props you already have or will be able to get hold of. Sometimes it’s better to have a simple idea and a great costume than a fantastic idea and a poor costume.
If you know any young children then it is likely they’ll have lots of common props such as swords, toy guns, pirate eye patches.
Talk to people you know and ask for their ideas. Be smart about who you ask, if you need to dress up as a book character then talk to someone who is interested in books, if you need to dress up for a science fete then talk to someone interested in science.
Make sure that you like the idea, you are going to have to wear it after all.

, Don’t try fancy dress shops until you’ve looked at charity shops and pound/dollar stores. Goodwill is a good example. Don’t forget to raid your wardrobe, fancy dress box and your relatives’ old clothes. Don’t be left feeling gutted because you bought something you already had at home.

, Evaluate your finds from the step above and plan your costume. Some costumes rest on their simplicity but on the whole don’t let your costume rely on one prop, but try to make every part count. It is not advised to plan your outfit before you’ve checked out the shops as it may lead you to ignore a really good prop.


Don’t make the project too big, after all you want it finished for the big day, plus you’ll probably only wear it once. While planning you should consider how long it will take you to make it and also how easy it will be to get your hands on key items.

, For most outfits you don’t need to customize the trousers much but the top may be a completely different story. Go for plain and cheap. If you are not customizing much, it may be worth spending a little more, but if you’re only going to wear it once then quality is not that important.

, You may need fabric paints, PVA, wigs, glasses, hats, jewellery, stickers, glitter.

, This depends on what you’ve chosen to be but make sure you start well in advance. Some costumes may not need much customising, but you will probably need to make at least one prop or customise one piece of clothing if you want to stand out from the crowd and show that you’ve put in the effort.

, If you’re a guy who doesn’t wear make-up but you need a bruise, scar, motif etc on your face, then you should get advise from a female friend.

, This creates the ""exoskeleton"" of the mouth and creates the upper and lower lips. Get your spoonful of peanut butter ready.

, Make sure it is completely filled in and use your spoon to smooth out the edges.


This may be a good time to use a paper towel and wipe away any excess peanut butter left on the ""lips."" The peanut butter acts as the gums of the mouth and offers a sticky surface which is helpful for the final step.

, Since these are acting as the mouth's teeth, the more crooked and disturbing they look, the better. It does not need to be perfect, it just needs to look spooky! This is also the fun aspect for kids to be a part of. They can design their own mouths to look any way they would like!


The final outcome should look a lot like this. Although it is not necessary, try continuing with some of the additional steps to make them even more festive and spooky. However, it is perfectly fine to stop here and enjoy your snack.

, You can use a green apple this time, but it does not matter which color you use. Hold the bottle over your newly created mouth and let the sauce drip all over it. This creates a bloody and gory look that is sure to give children nightmares.

, Let it sit for about ten minutes until it starts to melt. You can then place your apple on the plate and use your spoon to pour some of the melted ice cream on top of your apple mouth. This mouth came right off of a slimy monster.

, Take pinch-fulls of the cookie powder and sprinkle it all over the apple mouth and the plate. This mouth ate itself out of its own grave.

, Insert as many pieces as you wish into the peanut butter, in between the two rows of sliced almonds (teeth). This mouth fell right off of a monster that eats insects.

Purchase a Jem costume to keep it simple.",How to Create a Jem and the Holograms Costume," Jem’s makeup look is all about the bold eyes, so primer is an imperative first step. Makeup primer creates a nice base for your makeup, helping it to go on smoothly and stay put. It will help keep your makeup from smudging, which is very important for Jem’s crisp, geometric eye makeup.Typically, eye makeup primer only goes on the eyelid. However, apply primer all over your eyelid to your brow bone as well as underneath the eye. Jem wears more eye makeup than you might in your typical, everyday look!
Apply the primer simply by dabbing it into your skin with your fingertip. Let it absorb into your skin for a minute or so before moving on to the next step.;
, Jem’s signature look is a bold pink shape around her eye. Purchase a hot pink eyeliner at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store. You don’t need to purchase anything fancy, because you may or may not use hot pink eyeliner after aside from creating this look!First, place your eyeliner in the center of your bottom lash line. Draw a line slanting outwards to your cheekbone. Then, draw another line extending from your temple and meeting the first line in a point. These two lines should look like a triangle extending down from your eye.
Draw a third line extending from the tail of your eyebrow and meeting the line at the temple. This will create another point at your temple.
Draw a final, straight line extending from the inner corner of the eyebrow down to the top lash line.
Repeat these steps on the opposite eye, so that you are left with two symmetrical shapes framing your eyes.
Jem has a variety of specific looks in the television show and movie, so feel free to create an alternate one if you desire. By sketching the shape first with the pink eyeliner, it’s easier to clean up any mistakes.

, Again, you can purchase this product at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store, and it doesn’t have to be a high end product. Simply look for the brightest pink you can find, because that is Jem’s signature, bold style. Using an eyeliner brush, fill in the pink outline you created with the eyeliner, making sure to cover all of your skin completely with pink shadow., When you’re satisfied with the pink shape you’ve created with liner and shadow, it’s time to clean up the edges. You really want these shapes to have crisp lines and corners. Use your favorite concealer and concealer brush to carefully clean up the borders, sweeping concealer around the perimeter of the shapes to conceal any smudging or mistakes. Once you’ve outlined the shapes with concealer, carefully blend it all out.

, You don’t want to change the color of your lid, but adding a soft layer of white shadow can add a bit of dimension. When your lid and surrounding skin is all pink, your eyes may appear dull and flat. By adding a bit of white shadow to highlight the eye, you can make them look big and bright. Make sure that you don’t cover up the signature pink, however! A light dusting is all you need., Jem uses a bright blue to add even more pop to her intense eye makeup. You can buy a bright blue eyeliner at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store, and feel free to buy whichever type of eyeliner you like working with best. Draw a thin line across your top lash line, extending fully from inner corner to outer corner. When you reach the outer corner, wing your eyeliner out subtly to open up your eyes.If you don’t want to purchase a new, royal blue eyeliner, you can use the black or dark brown you already own.

, This will help make your eyes stand out from their bold pink background. Using your favorite black eyeliner, simply line the very inside of the waterline from inner to outer corner. Connect the bottom eyeliner to the top eyeliner in the outer corners., Hold your eyelash curler at the base of your lashes and press down, holding for about five seconds. Then, release the curler and do this again at the middle and ends of your lashes. This will create a voluminous curl. Coat your lashes in black mascara, wiggling the wand as you sweep the product onto your lashes from base to tip. Apply your mascara generously, and feel free to do a couple of coats. You want your eyelashes to be dark and full so that they can stand out against the pink makeup.If you want fuller, darker lashes than you can achieve naturally, you can also apply false lashes now.

, This is the cherry on top of your eye makeup. Jem is all about glitter, so add some sparkle with a pink glitter shadow. Use your finger to gently dab it over the pink eyeshadow, covering the entire pink shape.You can find glitter shadows at many beauty supply stores, but you can also order it online if you have difficulty finding it locally.

, After your eyes are finished, clean up any fallout and apply your favorite foundation. There is no special trick to Jem’s foundation, so you can apply your foundation as normal. Your foundation will even out your skin tone, allowing the eyes to really steal the show. Be careful to avoid smudging the carefully created eye look.

, Just like with the eyes, your lips should be hot pink. Use the hottest pink lip liner you can find, similar to the eyeshadow you used. Carefully trace your lips, starting in the center and moving to the outer corners.

, You can use a bubble gum pink or a hot pink, just make sure it is bright and bold. Once you’ve applied it to your lips, blot them to remove any excess product. Then, grab your lip liner and blend out edges, so that you don’t have a stark line., Again, choose a bright pink for this step. Pick up the blush on fluffy blush brush and hold a smile. Sweep the blush onto the apples of your cheeks that raise when you smile. Dust it upwards towards your temples. Remember, you really can’t have too much pink for this look!, Jem has fierce pink hair, and unless you want to dye your hair pink, a wig is your best option. Depending on your local costume store, you may be able to find a pink wig to purchase. You can also find pink wigs online. However, if you cannot find a pink wig or want to repurpose a wig you already own, you can dye it yourself.In order to dye your wig, it has to be a light color. Otherwise, you will not be able to see the pink overtop. White, blonde, and silver synthetic wigs all work well for this.

, Because costume wigs are synthetic, you cannot use regular hair dye. Regular hair dye only work on real, human hair. Instead, head to a craft store and pick up a bottle of acrylic ink. Make sure to choose a dark pink color, because you will be diluting it with the isopropyl alcohol. You can purchase the alcohol at a pharmacy., Dying your wig is a messy process, so make sure to cover a large surface area with garbage bags or papers. Ideally, find a place outside to do this so you don’t risk getting paint on walls or floors. Because you’ll be spraying the homemade hair dye onto your wig with the spray bottle, it can really make a mess. Be generous with your coverings!, The more alcohol you add to the ink, the lighter your final color will be. If you want a pastel pink, add more alcohol. If you want a bright, vibrant pink, add less. Jem has rocked both looks, so it’s really up to you. Just make sure that you create enough spray to fully saturate your wig.Pour the ink and alcohol into the spray bottle and give it a shake.

, Make sure to wear rubber gloves as you do this, because this will get messy. As you spray the dye into each section, use your hands to rub it into the hair. Make sure to move the hair as you spray so that the dye covers the entire wig, rather than just the top layer. Continue spraying and running your fingers through the hair to make sure you don’t miss any sections. The hair should be completely saturated when you are finished., Depending on how long and thick your wig is, the drying time will vary, so don’t dye your hair the day of Halloween. Give yourself plenty of time! When you are able to run your bare hands through the wig and not get dye on your skin, it is ready., Once your wig has dried, it’s crucial to wash out the dye. Otherwise, you risk getting dye all over your clothing and hair and ending up even pinker than you meant to. Hold your wig under the cold water until the water runs clear. Make sure to rub the hair, getting the dye out of every section. Make sure to rinse the cap as well., Again, let your wig air dry completely. Once it’s dry to the touch, brush it out. Brush your wig gently so that you don’t break or rip any of the synthetic strands. Once it is fully brushed, it is ready to wear., The original Jem was an 80’s rock star, so her signature look is all about the 80’s. Band t-shirts and distressed jeans are perfect for Jem, but so are bright mini dresses. Don’t worry about buying expensive pieces that you’ll only wear once. You can certainly wear pieces you already own, or buy a few things that you’ll wear after Halloween. The costume designer for the Jem and the Holograms movie says that Jem (and her Holograms) wardrobes were eclectic, a mixture of vintage pieces and new pieces from places like Forever 21 and Goodwill. You can have fun and be creative in making your very own Jem-inspired outfit., Your pink eyes and lips aren’t enough! Jem loves wearing pink clothing, so make sure to add pops of pink throughout your outfit. A pink jacket is perfect, and Jem rocks a pink leather jacket in the movie. If you can’t find a great jacket, try adding things like a pink belt or pink shoes. Embrace Jem’s signature color, and make sure your outfit has enough of it!, If you couldn’t tell by Jem’s makeup, this costume is all about glitter and pizzazz. Try to incorporate pieces that sparkle and catch the eye. Think rhinestones, sequins, metallics, and glitz. If you find a funky piece that is probably not something you’d ever wear to school, it’s probably perfect for your Jem outfit., If you don’t have anything in your closet that screams “Jem” and you aren’t in the mood to hunt for individual pieces, simplify the process and buy a Jem Halloween costume online. Amazon sells a few different versions of a Jem costume, and you can even buy a pink wig as well. This option is perfect if you want to embody Jem this Halloween, but don’t necessarily want to build her look from scratch.

Put your apron over the dress.,
Fix your hair to look like Raggedy Ann's.,
Do your makeup.,
Put on black boots.",How to Be Raggedy Ann for Halloween," See ""Things You'll Need"" for suggested clothing. The hair is the most distinctive feature, so this will the most important part to get right, followed by the striped tights. Don't forget to check in your closet to see what you might already own and visit a thrift store for missing items.;
, A dark color, preferably blue, is best. It is an added bonus if you can find a dress with floral prints on it. Look for old Laura Ashley clothes from the 1980s in your local thrift store for the right sort of dress.

, If you cannot find tights like these, try knee-length socks or buy tights of either red or white and sew on ribbons of the opposite missing color. Be creative in your solutions!

, Try to use something that resembles bloomers. The bloomers only need to peek out from under the costume, so any type of shorts that are white might work. You could always sew white calico lace to assist in creating the right effect.

, Raggedy Ann's apron is a pinafore shape, both above and below the waist. Preferably it should be a little shorter than the dress. You might need to improvise here and use a normal apron and sew on a white cotton top half with some ruffles if you cannot find a full-length apron.

, There are two possible ways:

Fix your own hair. Find a can of red spray dye suitable for temporary hair color change and spray your hair red. Wash and curl you hair if it is long. The more ""raggedy"", the better. Add a red ribbon when it's done.
Create a wig. This is probably the easier and less messy option and more likely to give a Raggedy Ann look. Perhaps purchase a wig from a dollar store or get creative and make one by dying a mop-head red and turning it into a wig.

, Add some freckles, exaggerate the smile by drawing cartoon style wide smile lines to the sides and create wide, open eyes with mascara and eyeliner. Use the photo below as a guide.

, Lace-up boots, if possible, are best.

First, take an assessment and see which Noodle you look most like: Phase 1- Short, no bangs, radio hat; Phase 2- Taller, skinnier, bangs cover eyes; Phase 3- (Cyborg Noodle) army cap, woman's body, bangs cover one eye.,
If you look like Phase 1 Noodle, go to #3.,
Phase 1 Noodle is 10 years old and very short.,
Phase 2 Noodle is 15 years old and rather tall.,
Phase 3 Noodle (Cyborg Noodle) is only seen in 3 videos- On Melancholy Hill, Stylo, and the Rhinestone Eyes storyboard.,
Phase 3 Noodle (Normal Noodle) is 20 years old (She went missing for 5 years) and is seen in 3 videos- On Melancholy Hill, Broken (Live Visual), and the Rhinestone Eyes storyboard.",How to Cosplay As Noodle from Gorillaz for Halloween," (Normal Noodle) Oni mask, woman's body, bruise on left side of face.;
, If you look like Phase 2 Noodle, go to #4. If you look like Phase 3 Noodle (Cyborg Noodle), go to #5. If you look like Phase 3 Noodle (Normal Noodle), go to #6.

, She is never seen without her radio hat except for certain performances. An easy look for her to make from Phase 1 is from the 19-2000 music video. She wears a beige jacket and her radio hat. Her clothes from her waist down are hidden. You can use jeans for this or some sort of skirt that blends into the outfit. To make the radio hat, use a large bowl and attach smaller bowls to the sides with duct tape. The rest you can make yourself for a more original look.

, Her bangs now cover her eyes. One of the easiest looks is from DARE, in which she has white capris, white sneakers and a white shirt with a basketball on it. Noodle also puts on a football helmet and plays a small keyboard near the end of the video. If you need an outfit for a colder day, try the outfit she wears in Dirty Harry- an army cap, green pants, a beige shirt and a yellow handkerchief around her neck. Or you could go with her El Manana outfit- a black and white striped 3/4 length shirt, black short shorts, and black knee-high boots.

, She's wearing the same outfit in all three. There is also a bullet hole in her head (from the Stylo video), which you can easily make with an empty soda can, hot glue, a scissors, black felt, and a bobby pin. Cyborg Noodle wears black shorts, a black army jacket, black knee-high boots, and a blue beret/army hat with a red star on it.

, She wears a white mask with a green cat-face outline, black and white striped thigh-high socks, white gloves, a white shift dress with red lining on the bottom of the skirt and sleeves, as well as 4 pockets with red lining. She technically does not wear shoes, but a pair of ankle-length or knee-length black boots would be advised if you wear this outside or to a convention. Under her mask, she has a large bruise on her right eye.

Choose a lightweight costume.,
Ensure the costume allows mobility and visibility.,
Eliminate costumes with small parts.,
Avoid noisy costumes.",How to Choose a Halloween Costume for Your Dog1," Make sure the costume you choose for your dog is not too heavy, both in terms of weight and breathability. Costumes that are too heavy can possibly injure your dog, or cause your dog to overheat. Lightweight costumes also facilitate movement.Weigh your dog before buying their costume. Then, buy a weight-appropriate costume.
If you notice your dog panting after wearing the costume for 30 minutes, take the costume off and return the costume. Try to avoid costumes made with 100% wool or cotton.;
, The costume should not cover your dog’s eyes or ears. Your dog should also be able to stand, walk, sit, and lie down, as it normally would, while wearing the costume., Before buying a costume, examine it closely to see if it has any small parts that your dog can easily pull out, ingest, or choke on. Avoid costumes with small parts like buttons, little plastic objects, or excessive fabric., Costumes with moving and noisy parts should be avoided. The noisy or moving parts can stress out your dog. If your dog is pacing or pawing at the costume excessively, these are signs that your dog is uncomfortable with the costume. Take it off immediately."

Choose the right size.,
Consider your dog’s personality.,
Choose a theme.,
Make your dog's costume.,
Rehearse with your dog.",How to Choose a Halloween Costume for Your Dog3," By knowing your dog’s size, i.e., small, medium, or large, and weight, you can find a costume that fits your dog appropriately. Costumes that are too small can impair circulation and movement, and can cause your dog to overheat. On the other hand, costumes that are too big can cause your dog to stumble or become tangled.Try to avoid costumes with long capes. Your dog can trip or become tangled in the cape.

, Is your dog a protector or an explorer? Does your dog love to eat? Is your dog goofy or bossy? Pick a costume that reflects your dog’s personality. If your dog is a protector, dress it up as a police officer or comic book hero, like Batman or Superman.If your dog loves eating, dress it up as a hot dog or a pumpkin.
Dress your dog up as a pirate or a sailor if it loves to explore.

, Themes are fun, and allow you and your dog to enjoy Halloween together. Some common examples of themes are Batman and Robin, a hot dog and ketchup/mustard, Beauty and the Beast, Star Wars themed costumes, and other famous duos.

, You will need to buy a t-shirt (the size depends on the size of your dog), felt cloth, marker, glue, scissors, and any other materials you will need to make your desired costume. First, cut the sleeves off of the t-shirt. Then, draw and cut any patterns from the felt cloth. Finally, glue the patterns to the t-shirt to make your design.For example, if you decide to dress your dog up as a stegosaurus, you will need to buy a green t-shirt and brown felt cloth. Fit the t-shirt on your dog. Then take it off to cut the sleeves. Outline the stegosaurus' plates on the brown felt cloth, and cut them out. To complete the outfit, glue the plates on the back of the t-shirt.
Try to avoid gluing any small objects to the costume that your dog could choke on.

, Before the big night, it is important that you dress your dog in the costume multiple times. This way, you can see how your dog reacts to the costume, and if it fits properly. If your dog shows signs of pacing or excessive panting, paws or claws at the costume, or refuses to move, then the costume is causing undue stress on your dog.If the costume stresses out your dog, opt to accessorize your dog instead. For example, you can buy a matching leash and collar that reflects a particular theme, a head band, or a bow tie for your dog to wear."

An old/unwanted bed sheet
Scissors
Safety pins
A black permanent marker
A sash, cord or belt (optional);

The bed sheet should be white, or light colored such as cream/pastel. Once you've cut it up, you obviously won't be able to use it on the bed again, so make sure you're willing to part with it.

, If you want holes for the mouth and/or nose, cut those as well. Try to make the holes circles or ovals, or jagged if you like. Good eye holes will help you maintain good vision for walking around.

, Do not do it when the person is wearing it, though!

, Add a sash, cord or belt, if you like.

, Make sure you can move comfortably in it, especially if you're hitting the streets or a party. Avoid catching fire from candles in pumpkins on the floor/sidewalks, so take care with the sheet that may trail on the floor.

Consider adding some warts or other blemishes, too.

, You can keep it simple with a stick from the back yard, or decorate it more in the style of a Harry Potter type wand, if you prefer.

A red top and red leggings/red tight slacks or a red dress
Hair band or a head band (optional)
Cardboard horns (optional)
A broom handle (optional)
Cardboard tines or sticks (optional)

, Make these by cutting out two narrow horn-shaped (tall triangle) pieces (about 3 inches (7.5 cm) long) from a piece of cardboard. It doesn't need to be too detailed. Keep an extra bit of cardboard towards the bottom so that you can glue or staple it to the hair-/head-band, in such a way that they will extend upward.


When your whole horn piece is complete, paint it red or cover it in red paper or fabric, if you have the time and supplies.

, It should be an ""E"" shaped fork. Make this by cellophane taping/tying string around the cardboard tines/sticks so that they are secured onto the broom handle.

Ta-da!",How to Be a Scarecrow for Halloween," Or just a baggy pair of jeans/overalls. If you're comfortable with ruining your jeans/overalls, you can rip holes in them (this comes in handy later!) and sew little patches on them. If you plan on wearing these jeans/overalls after Halloween, just leave them as they are.;
, Use one of your own, or borrow one from somebody else. If possible, find one with a pocket (again, this comes in handy later).

, If possible, destroy it. Make some holes in it. Farmers wouldn't put a brand-new, gorgeous straw hat on a scarecrow, now would they?

, These can be bought at the Dollar Store for a buck if you can't find one lying around at home.

, You can use real hay, or go to a craft store and buy some fake hay. This is essential for your costume, because otherwise nobody will understand that you're a scarecrow. You'll be projecting more of a farmer image.

, Glue some inside your hat so it's sticking up through the holes. Put a clump in the pocket of your plaid shirt! Glue some onto your pants and stick it through the holes and in the pockets. If you're wearing boots on Halloween, stick clumps of (fake) hay so it sticks out the top of your boots. If you want, glue some of the fake hay to the cuffs of your shirt sleeves. If you don't want to do this, follow the step below for a genius idea!


If you don't want to glue hay to your shirt, get some armbands. They're used for sports, so if you play any, you'll probably have a couple lying around your house. If not, you can buy some at a sports store. Hot glue the (fake) hay to the armbands, and put the armbands on under your shirt. Make sure that the hay sticks out the sleeves! It looks really cool! Instead of using armbands, you can always use stuff like headbands, ponytail holders, spare pieces of fabric, etc.

, Now for the face paint. I'd suggest going for the look of the scarecrow in ""The Wizard of Oz"", since people understand that you're a scarecrow that way. Use black face paint. Start at the bottom of your eyebrow and paint a triangle up about an inch or so. Do the same to the other eyebrow. Finally, cover your nose in black face paint. (If you're having trouble visualizing this, look up pictures of the 'Wizard of Oz scarecrow' on the Internet)

,, Now you have the perfect scarecrow costume. Go out trick-or-treating or to a Halloween Party and feel confident that you look awesome!

Find some inspiration.,

Think of famous nerds from history.,
Get into character.,
Look for pieces at home.,
Visit some thrift stores.,

Don’t leave it too late.",How to Be a Nerd for Halloween," The first thing to do if you have decided that you want to dress up as a nerd for Halloween is to find some inspiration and get some ideas. Geeks and nerds have become an increasingly popular choice for Halloween costumes, so a quick search online will bring up countless examples of costumes people have worn in previous years.Try an image search, or looking on websites that specialise in pictures, such as Instagram and Pinterest.You will also find a host of videos of people on YouTube talking about the nerd costumes they have put together in the past.;
, Once you have looked through plenty of pictures and videos, you need to decide exactly what kind of nerd outfit you want to put together. You can keep it simple with some high-waist trousers, suspenders, glasses and a bow-tie. To help you visualise and plan your costume break it down into parts, such as shoes, pants and shirt.


A typical outfit might include some short white shorts and a short-sleeved plaid shirt.
This would be worn with suspenders, a nerdy hairstyle, glasses and some big clunky shoes.
A classic alternative to clunky shoes would be teaming up socks and sandals.

, You need to think about what you want to do to your hair to complement and complete your costume. Typically a man who dresses up as nerds for Halloween will opt for parting his hair in the centre and pasting it down with a hair product. It’s important to have the hair looking greasy.


An alternative nerd hair style for a man would be a bowl cut. For this option, you will probably need to get hold of a wig.
A woman will often go for pigtails. Adding some hair product to make it look a little greasy can also be a good option for a woman.
A pony tail is an alternative option. You can place the pony tail on top of your head or on one side of your head.

, For a great costume you will need to include some appropriate accessories for your finishing touches. The classic accessories for a nerd costume could include glasses, a tie or preferably a bow-tie, suspenders, and a pocket protector, some pens, a ruler or a calculator in your shirt pocket.Don’t forget to add a little bit of tape to your glasses over the bridge of your nose.Carry a book with you as an accessory. Something like a serious maths book will work well with your costume., Dressing up as a famous nerd from a TV show or a movie can be a great option for Halloween. It enables you to piece together a more specific and less generic costume, which will help you stand out from a crowd of other people dressed as nerds. Think about nerds from TV and then try to match your costume to them as closely as possible.


There are countless great TV nerds to choose from. You could go as anybody from Spock from Star Trek, to the Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons, or one of the characters from the Big Bang Theory.Try to think of a character that is easily recognisable, but that not many people will have thought of dressing up as.

, Another way to dress up as a famous nerd, is to think about well-known nerds from history and real life. This could be someone like Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs. For a more historical figure, who has a very distinctive look, why not dress up as Albert Einstein.


For Einstein, you could get a big white wig, a lab coat and a fluffy white moustache.Alternatively, you could dress up as another iconic figure, Sigmund Freud. For Freud you would need small circular glasses, a white beard, and a suit.
Whoever you choose you can add accessories, such as a notepad, clipboard, or a small chalkboard.

, Once you have prepared your famous nerd costume, you can have fun by getting into character. Try to act like the person you are dressing up as and have fun with it. If you go as Einstein, try and talk with German accent. If you go as Freud, you can also adopt a Germanic sounding accent.


You can also have fun by pretending to psychoanalyse friends.
Invite a friend to lie down on the couch and ask them about their childhoods, just like Freud would.

, Even if you don’t think you have any nerdy clothes at home, it’s sensible to start your search there. Something like a short-sleeved plaid shirt can easily be transformed into part of a nerd outfit with the addition of some shorts or trousers worn high up above the waist. Your parents or another family member might have some old suspenders, or even a bow-tie lying around at the bottom of a draw that you could use.

, If you can’t find what you need at home and don’t mind spending a little bit of cash on your costume, the next place to look could be some local thrift stores. These have the advantage of being cheap, and having a potentially wide variety of items to look through. With thrift stores, however, you can never really predict what they will have in the store.


Try to visit some in your local area that specialise in clothes.
Keep an open mind when you go looking around thrift stores as you may find an item that would be great for a slightly different type of nerd costume.

, If you are not having much luck with your costume, or you want to save some time and hassle, you can visit a local costume rental store. It is highly likely that they will stock nerd outfits which you’ll be able to pick one up complete with all the accessories. Search online for stores near you, and try to get an idea for the kind of costumes they stock and the rental prices before visiting the store.


These costumes will typically be a shirt, high shorts or pants with suspenders, and some glasses.
Ask about the wigs that are available if you want to change your hair dramatically.

, You also have the option of buying a costume outright. To buy a costume you would in most instances look online. Your local store is a better bet for rentals. Halloween costumes have become big business and there is a large variety of places you can buy costumes for somewhere between $10 and $50.These stores will often also have accessories such as “nerd glasses” or gum shields that make it look like you have braces.

, Nerd costumes have become a staple of Halloween fancy dress, so if you opting for a nerd this year it’s sensible to plan ahead. This is especially true if you plan to rent your outfit from a local store. If you leave it to the last minute you may find that the store is out of stock.

Lay out newspaper.,
Spray paint the poly-fil.,
Glue the poly fil onto your costume base.,
Fill in empty spaces.,
Create a cone headpiece.,
Attach poly-fil to the cone.,
Apply cotton candy makeup.,
Add the final touches.",How to Make a Cotton Candy Costume," To make your homemade cotton candy costume, you’re going to need a few materials:Your costume base (a pink dress, pink top and bottoms, etc.)Newspaper
1-2 16oz packages of poly-fil polyester fiber (pillow filling)
Glue gun and glue sticks
1 can of light pink spray paint (or any light cotton candy color)
1 can of adhesive spray (optional)
1 white poster board (optional)
Pink or white ribbon (optional);
, Your costume base is what you are going to glue the cotton candy (poly-fil stuffing) to. Some adult costumes use a pink or white dress as their base, whereas children’s costumes tend to use pink leggings, tights, t-shirts, leotards, etc. It doesn’t matter what kind of base you use for your costume, but aim to have your base a pink color, or whatever color cotton candy you are going for.
Consider looking through thrift stores or recycled clothing stores to find cheap clothes that can work as your costume base.

, Lay sheets of newspaper on a flat surface either outside, or in an area with excellent ventilation.This is where you will be spray painting and gluing the poly-fil onto your clothing. This will protect the surface from the products you're using.


The fumes from the spray paint can be noxious, so it’s best to work somewhere with fresh air.

, Open the bag of poly-fil and gently pull apart the pieces of stuffing. Spread all of the poly-fil over the newspaper and carefully being to spray paint the stuffing from 18 inches away.It’s okay if there are sections that not as heavily painted as other sections. This will actually help the poly-fil look more like real cotton candy.You don’t want to spray paint the poly-fil too close, because the paint will spray on too thick and ruin the texture of the stuffing. Allow the painted ploy-fil to dry for approximately 1 hour., Plug in your hot glue gun and load in a couple sticks of glue. Lay your costume base onto the newspaper. When your glue is nice and hot, use the glue gun to draw a zig-zag (about 3-4 inches in height) line onto the bottom portion of your costume base.For example, if you are using a t-shirt and leggings for your costume base, draw a glue zig-zag across the bottom section of your t-shirt.Place some poly-fil across and on top of the glue, and hold the stuffing in place for approximately 5 seconds.
Be sure to use an adequate amount of hot glue to make sure the poly-fil stays attached to your costume base.Keep gluing on small rows of stuffing, making sure to leave enough stuffing to cover the back of your costume base as well.

, Be sure to glue some poly-fil in any spaces that have gaps between the stuffing (places like the sides of your dress or shirt, the underarms, dress straps, etc.).If you want the cotton candy to look fuller, consider adding a few pieces of poly-fil onto the first layer of cotton candy.This can help give your costume some depth and make it look more life-like.

, Take your white poster board, and roll one corner of the poster board to an adjacent corner, creating a cone shape with a pointy tip. Once you have your cone shape, attach the poster board together using the glue gun, adhesive spray, or taping the poster board together inside the cone.Cut the cone from the opened end so the cone can fit on top of your head like a hat.


Consider attaching two pieces of ribbon on the sides of the cone, so you can tie the cone underneath your chin.
If you want to decorate the cone even more, you can attach a red ribbon about a ½ inch thick at the tip of the cone, wrap and glue it all around the the base of the cone.This red ribbon will give the cone a spiral look.

, Draw a line of glue at the base of the cone hat, and attach more poly-fil.Try and make this poly-fil as fluffy as possible; you want it to look like the cone is sitting on top of some cotton candy.

, Apply as little or as much makeup as you like to try and mimic the cotton candy look. Put on some pink lipstick (the more pastel the better), pink blush to your cheekbones, pink eye shadow, and even brush on some glitter.The more makeup you have, the more extravagant your costume will be. Once all the pink makeup is on, you can continue doing your makeup as normal using eyeliner and mascara to finish.

, Once your costume is put together, consider wearing some sort of pink or pastel shoes.This will wrap up and pull together your entire costume.


Consider painting your nails a light pink. Paying attention to the small details like your shoes, makeup, and nails will make your costume a memorable hit!

,
Done.",How to Be a Butterfly for Halloween," Something with shine or glitter would be sweet, or something transparent and flowing. Bright colors are good too. The fabric type is important because it will help to suggest fairy wings when the wearer puts these on.


You'll need about a yard or 90cm of it for a child's size, and about half that size more for an adult.;
, If needed, cut to shape.

, Pull the center of the fabric in from the top and from the bottom. This will cause the fabric to bunch up. Tie a rubber band or elastic around the center, where the two edges meet from being bunched up. Wrap a pretty ribbon in a matching or contrasting color around the rubber band, to cover it up and look prettier. Glue, knot or stitch in place.

, This means whichever part you've decided will form the top of the wings. Leave plenty of loop space open for going around the child or adult wearer's wrists.

, The wings will be attached after the rest of the costume has been assembled.

, Some suggestions for colors include the natural greens, blues and purples of the forest floor or the bright colors of bold butterflies not trying to hard, such as oranges, reds and bright blues.

, The style of the clothing should emphasize ease of movement (think stretch fabric) and a little glamour (think flowing, lace, sparkly). Camisoles, gym tops, leggings, short flowing bamboo skirts, etc., are just some possibilities. Don't be constrained by these suggestions––check the wardrobe and feel free to mix and match existing clothing to create a fairy style, accounting for the colors you're trying to convey too. Also consider the color and style of the wings made earlier––what will work well with those?


It doesn't matter that you wouldn't normally wear certain items together, after all, this is costume time.

, Ballet shoes are a good choice but sneakers, sandals or kitten heels could also work well.

, You can buy these or make them. Simple ones could be made using a headband and attaching skinny spring lengths to the headband with pompoms glued on top.


You can always substitute with buns on top of your head if you don't want to make a headband antennae.

, Sparkly hair spray can add glitter, and doesn't have to be confined to your hair, go all out! You could also use glitter nail polish and face glitter for added sparkle. And consider having a butterfly face paint done by someone who knows how.

, Then have the wings pinned to the back using safety pins. You'll definitely need a helper for this, and be sure to stand still while it is being pinned on. Thread your hands through the elastic loops to hold the wings in place. They will only look like wings when you lift your arms up and ""flutter"" them but that's the whole point of these easy-to-make wings. Finally, put on your shoes.

, Pull your hair up off your face and place in a ponytail or the two buns if you're not using antennae. Have someone paint a butterfly on your face, if this is happening or simply add the glitter makeup.


If using glitter spray in your hair, spray it on now.

,, You're all good to go. Don't forget to get a photo taken at least once. And flutter to make those wings work!


Show your wings moving after you've received your treats, as a way to say thank you to people. Put your treat bucket down first.

dark blue face paint
white face paint
non-metallic white glitter (using non-metallic glitter reduces the chance of a problem if the glitter gets into the child’s eyes)stencils
jewels to stick on your face
a variety of paintbrushes (you will need a thick one and a couple of small pointed ones)
a makeup sponge;
, You will need to run a wide brush across your light blue face paint and get a little dark blue face paint on one side of the brush as well. Then, make a thin, vertical line on the area just above and in between your eyebrows.








If the paint that you are using seems too thick, then you can also dip your brush in a bit of water to help thin it out., Next, take the brush and extend it out past the center point to create a large teardrop in the center of your forehead. Start with the brush pressed against the center point as you do so and just use one long sweeping motion.







, After you have created the large teardrop, take the brush and run it along the outside edges of the teardrop, extending them out and up towards your hairline. Now you have created the central piece of the crown.








Using the light blue face paint, create one more point extending out from each side of the crown.

, Paint two loops next to the outer points on each side of the crown. Make sure that the outer loops on each side of the crown extend a little past the eyebrows.








You will also need to create two loops just above each of your cheekbones. Use the same light blue face paint to create these loops.

, Next, you will need to dip your small brush into some dark blue face paint and use the brush to create three dark blue scallops over the area between your eyebrows. Draw one scallop shape in the center and then two smaller ones on either side of the center one.








Make sure that the paint is dry on your center point before you draw the scallops. If the paint is not yet dry, then it may smear., Use a sponge with a bit of light blue paint on it to blend the edges of the crown and soften the details a bit. Just lightly pat the areas around the edges of the design you have created to blend and soften the edges.








Make sure that you dab some light blue paint between the loops on the cheekbones and the loops on the edges of the crown. This dabbed on face paint will connect the whole design.

, Hold your snowflake stencil over the central point of the crown, between your eyebrows. Press the stencil close to your skin and then use a sponge to dab white face paint over the stencil.








Before you remove the stencil from your face, press some glitter onto the area you have just painted.
Repeat the process to create two more snowflakes over the painted areas just above your cheekbones.

, Start above your central snowflake and use a small brush sipped in white face paint to draw a teardrop extending down towards the upper tip of the snowflake. Then draw two more teardrops opposite this central teardrop.








Keep adding teardrops to the upper part of the crown that extend down towards the central snowflake.
Then create four teardrops on the painted cheekbone area that extend down towards your mouth.
The teardrops should be different lengths to add interest to the crown.

, Take one of your small paintbrushes and dip the tip in some white face paint. Then, add small and large dots of white face paint to the areas under and next to the snowflakes.








These little dots should be different sizes to add a bit of interesting detail to the design.

, Next, take your small brush and dip the tip in dark blue face paint. Then, use the paint to outline the edges of your design. Go over the edges of all of the teardrops and loops to define the border of your design.








Having a dark outline will help to set off the crown. If you decide to experiment with different colors, just make sure that the color you use for the outer line is darker than the base color.

, Finish your design by attaching three jewels. Use a bit of water soluble adhesive or use some gems that already have adhesive on the backs of them. Place the jewels in the centers of the snowflakes.








This step is optional, but it adds a bit of extra sparkle.

Be mysterious.",How to Look Evil," If you’re introverted you might want to look more subtle or sexy-evil, whereas if you’re an extrovert you might go for a more crazy-evil look. Choose whatever feels right for you.


Some examples of famous sexy-evil characters include Morticia Addams, Vampira, Dracula, and Thor’s Loki.
Some less conventional and more modern examples of crazy-evil characters include House of 1000 Corpse’s Baby, Suicide Squad’s Harley Quinn, Ichi the Killer’s Kakihara, and either of the lead characters of Tim Burton’s Sweeney Todd.
If you want to look more subtle, you could model yourself after an old-fashioned mortician (or the Tall Man from Phantasm, on whom the Slender Man is partly based) and just wear a simple dark suit while looking very serious all the time.;
, If you really want to look evil, contour your face so that it mimics the shape of a downward-pointing triangle.


Studies have shown that people find this shape threatening, as it appears to mimic an angry face.To do this, you’ll want to highlight your forehead and cheekbones, and make your mouth, jaw, and chin look more narrow.
You can also use contouring to make yourself look sick or corpse-like.

, Having bold, angry-looking eyebrows that slant down towards your nose will make you look more evil.You might need an eyebrow pencil or a shadow-and-wax kit to help make your brows look thicker and fuller. This will also help darken and shape your brows.
Arched brows are also good. They might look more snobby or judgmental than angry, but they’re still a popular choice.
Having no brows at all (accomplished by either shaving them off or gluing them down and then covering them up) is also an unnerving look. If you’re going to do this though, make sure you’re really committed to it, as you’ll regret it if you ever want normal-looking brows.

, A common trick is to back comb your hair into a big, wild mess, but really any hairstyle will work — it’s more about how you rock it:


You can do long, flat, hair like Morticia Addams, big wild curls like House of 1000 Corpse’s Baby, or messy greasy locks like The Exorcist’s Regan. You could do girly pigtails like Harley Quinn, too. If you have short hair you can make it look very messy, or you can slick it back.
If you’re a man, you can make your hair big and messy like Robert Smith of The Cure or Johnny Depp in Sweeney Todd, or you can grow it long like Gary Oldman in Bram Stoker’s Dracula.
You might even draw in a widow’s peak using eyebrow pencil/shadow or cut your bangs to come into a point, as these are popular looks amongst famous evil movie characters. (Note that these shapes make an upside down triangle.)
As for hair colors, black and red are popular options for villains, but natural colors also work. Gray is popular right now and would be great for an old-fashioned ghosty evil look.

, If you’re a guy, having a pointy beard or goatee and accentuated eyebrows that slant down towards your nose have been scientifically proven to make you look evil.


Scientists think it’s because that way of wearing your hair can make your face look like a downward-pointing triangle, which people generally find threatening., A lot of shops now carry creepy contacts. These are generally good for at least 30 days. White irises are always good, and full black ones are classic too.


You should be able to find these at shops (especially shops that sell alternative clothes/accessories and Halloween supplies) for between $15 and $30, if not less.
Eye doctors will generally charge more for creepy contacts because they fit them to your eye. If you have any eye issues, talk to your eye doctor before using these.

, Maybe your evil look is inspired by The Exorcist’s Regan. In that case, you’ll want to look very sick. Here’s how you can do it:Put on a foundation that is just slightly paler than the color of your skin naturally.
Exfoliate your lips to make them look red and swollen.
Dab a tiny bit of red lipstick on the tip of your nose and around your nostrils, then rub it in. You can also add some red to your lips too, it just needs to look natural so don’t go overboard.
Darken under your eyes. A flat mauve, burgundy, or brownish-red powder will work well.
Rub a small amount of the same red you used on your nose on to the outer corners of your eyes.
Rub moisturizer between your hands and then gently press your hands on to your face. You can also spritz yourself with a facial mist. The goal is to look clammy and sweaty, and … sick.
The more natural the makeup looks, the better, so avoid shadows with sparkles in them or anything that will give it away that you’re wearing makeup.
You could try doing a fancy version of this — making smokey eyes with the same palette — just for fun, although it will probably ruin the effect of you looking sick.

, Dark, dramatic eyeshadow and winged eyeliner will make your eyes look more intense. It will also boost the power of your evil glares.


There are a lot of variations on the winged eyeliner style, so choose one that suits you. You could do very large wings or just small subtle ones, depending on your abilities and comfort.
Another fun and dramatic style is Egyptian eye makeup, which is also quite dramatic. You might try a variation of that to see how it suits you. It will involve more eyeliner than a regular cat’s eye.

, Dark colors (especially black and red) are usually what you’ll see on evil characters throughout popular culture. Punky and gothy clothes are in style and readily available at malls.


It might be more interesting if you make your own look by shopping at thrift and vintage stores, and altering clothes so that they fit your style. If your clothes appear to be older (i.e. not that brand new skull sweater from Hot Topic), there’ll be an added level of strangeness to you that will boost your evil look.
Two great horror movie characters with a unique style are Ginger and Brigitte Fitzgerald from Ginger Snaps. They have an old-fashioned, grunge-witch look going on that is all their own. The highlight of their outfits is the bird skull necklace that they’ve made themselves.

, Conventional accessories include skulls, crosses, spikes, and other horror- or punk-themed items. They’re cool but also so popular now that you’re more likely to fit in with the crowd rather than looking particularly evil.


Instead of buying the same things that everyone else is wearing, go to vintage and thrift stores and see if you can find funky old-looking stuff that matches your look.
A long string of beads will look great with a Vampira-style outfit and hair.
An old-fashioned pocket watch will look good with a Bram Stoker’s Dracula-style three-piece suit.

, If you can afford it, try to make everything you use be an extension of your dark side:


Use bone pens, old-fashioned notebooks that look like the Necronomicon (i.e. like they’re made from human skin), and bookmarks that look like hanged people.
If you have a locker, you could keep The Satanic Bible or the Necronomicon, or other occult books in your locker so that people see them when they walk past.
You could also decorate your locker full of creepy drawings and images, or have a little voodoo doll hanging inside your locker or off your backpack.
An old-fashioned porcelain doll would look pretty creepy sitting inside your locker too, and you could carry her around for added creepiness.

, This will make it seem like you’re up to something no good, and may disturb whoever it’s directed at. Again, this is where it may help to have a few of your favorite movie villains on hand for reference.


You could have a small, mischievous grin like Morticia Addams, a smirk like The Vampire Diaries’ Damon, or even a full-blown, wild toothy smile like the Joker from Batman.
Look intensely at your target while grinning to make them uncomfortable. During an argument, stare into your opponent’s eyes with an evil smile on your face.

, There are a lot of ways to do this, so practise in front of a mirror to see what you like best. You might even alternate an evil stare with an evil laugh for added creepiness.Narrow your eyes and focus on your target. Avoid blinking for as long as possible. You can ease some of the pressure to blink by narrowing your eyes a little more once in a while.






If you’re talking to a few people, be sure not to blink when you’re looking from one person to the next, as this will be extra unnerving.
Try playing with the timing of moving your head and your eyes. Moving them at separate times can be creepy. For instance, if you are talking to two people, move your eyes to one person while keeping your head pointed at the other, and then move your head to where your eyes are pointed.
Tilting your chin downward and looking up from under your eyelids is also a great way to achieve a creepy glare.
Your mouth could be serious, smirking, grinning, or full-on smiling while you do this. It’s up to you.

, Most famous villains have an evil laugh. What will yours be like? Deep and slow? Fast and high-pitched? Try recording yourself to see what laughs you like best.


Try different styles of laughing. For example, you might laugh really hard for only 1 or 2 seconds, then suddenly stop laughing and look very serious or do your evil stare.
If you’ve let a friend in on your goal of looking evil, ask them to give you feedback on your laughs to tell you which ones are the creepiest.

, Having an evil voice is sure to boost your evil appearance. Movie villains are often famous for their voices. To decide on your villain voice, consider what your evil persona is like.


Are you the silent type? Maybe your evil voice is just a bit slower, deeper, and quieter than your regular voice. Or maybe it’s the complete opposite: loud, higher, and faster.
Maybe you’re pretty extroverted, with a higher, louder voice. Maybe that voice gets higher and louder when you’re evil, or maybe it goes in the opposite direction — low and slow — just to surprise people.
Have fun playing with different voices before you settle on what your signature evil voice will be.

, The less people know about you, the more they’ll wonder if you could actually be evil. Note that if you do this, you’ll likely be a pretty lonely person.


Even if you think you want to be lonely, and you want to push people away, consider your reasons for doing this. If you’re unhappy you owe it to yourself to get help rather than making the unhappiness worse.

Press glitter around your eyes.,
Put on lipstick if desired.",How to Face Paint a Fairy," Doing a fairy face paint design requires some special face paint colors and brushes to complete, but it is quite easy to do. Before you get started, you will need:








face paints in medium blue, light green, white, and dark pink
non-metallic glitter (non-metallic glitter is safer to use on your face because it is less likely to get stuck in your eyes)a small paintbrush
a thin paintbrush
a makeup sponge
a cup of water for thinning out face paint;
, Use a makeup sponge to dab some medium blue face paint onto your eyelids, temples, and the area just below your eyes. Then take a new makeup sponge and use it to dab some of your light green face paint onto the edge of your eyelid and extending out towards your temple as well.








The paint should not go past the inner edges of your eyes. Leave this area bare.
Keep in mind that designs that cover the eyes are not always ideal for young children because they tend to rub their eyes and may end up smearing the paint and getting it into their eyes.Make sure that you let your base dry before you start adding details., Next, take your small makeup brush and use it to draw a series of teardrops extending out from your eyes. Start above one of your eyebrows and gently press down with your paintbrush and pull it down towards your eye. Then, create another teardrop right next to this one.








Create three more teardrops on the outer edge of your eye. The teardrop in the middle should be the biggest one.
Create three more teardrops that start just below your cheekbone and extend these up towards your eye. Again, the central teardrop should be the largest one.
Make sure that you create the same kinds of teardrops around your other eye as well.
If the face paint is too thick to use, dip your brush into your cup of water and then dip it into the paint., To create the flowers, take your small paintbrush and dip it into white face paint and scrape off any excess. Then, dip just the tip of the same paintbrush into dark pink face paint. When you press the brush against your skin it should create a petal-like mark.








Use your brush to create flowers around the outer edges of your eyes and on your cheekbones. The number of flowers that you can create will depend on how much space you have left.
After you have made the same number of flowers on each side, add some petals extending down from the flowers on your cheekbones.

, Next, switch to a thin brush and dip it into pink face paint. Scrap off any excess paint, and then use the brush to outline your teardrops.








Use the tip of the thin brush to add central dots to the flowers you have created as well.

, Using a clean, thin brush, get a small dab of white paint on the tip. Use the tip to dab little specks of white face paint onto the areas around the flowers and teardrops.








These specks can be somewhat random and in slightly different sizes.

, After you have finished your fairy design, let it dry for a few minutes. Then, take some of your glitter and gently press some of it into some of the flowers and teardrops to help accent your design.








When you are ready to remove the glitter, try using a piece of tape.Press the sticky side of the tape onto the glitter and then slowly peel it away. The tape should pull off most of the glitter.

, Lipstick is optional, but it is a nice touch. Try a dark pink color that will bring out the pink highlights in your design. Make sure that you ask first if you are painting someone else’s face.

face paints in the following shades: light blue, medium blue, violet, light green, neon pink, neon orange, neon yellow, pink, and black
makeup sponges
small paint brushes
splotch stencils;
, Use a makeup sponge to dab some of your light blue face paint onto your forehead, cheeks, and nose. Do not worry if this layer looks uneven or splotchy because you will cover it up with other face paint colors.








If your face paint is too thick, then you can also dip the sponge in a little water before dipping it into your face paint., Your medium blue face paint should be about one shade darker than your base color (the light blue). Use the medium blue to highlight the edges of your forehead, cheekbones, and the tip of your nose.








Dab the face paint onto these areas until the base color is covered up.

, Next, get some of your violet face paint on a new makeup sponge. Use this color to highlight the outer areas of the medium blue highlights that you just applied.








Dab on enough of the violet color so that you cannot see the base color or any medium blue under the violet.

, Take a new sponge and dip it in the light blue color. Then, take the sponge and use it to go over the areas of your face that you already painted light blue and that have not been highlighted with medium blue or violet.








In other words, just add another layer of light blue to the areas where you already applied a layer of light blue.

, Next, get another new makeup sponge and dip it in your light green color. Dab the light green onto the middle of your forehead near your hairline. Then, dab a little of the light green face paint over your cheekbones as well.







, Take a new makeup sponge and dip it into your purple face paint. Then, dab the purple paint along your hairline and blend it into the other face paints you have already applied.








Wait for the layers of face paint to dry before adding any details over them. You can speed up this process by sitting in front of a fan for a few minutes.

, Hold the splotch stencil over the center of your forehead. Then take a makeup sponge and use it to apply neon pink face paint over the stencil. Then, lift away the stencil and move it to a different part of your face and apply some more neon pink.








Repeat this process with the neon orange neon yellow face paints as well.
Make sure that the other neon face paints have dried before you apply a new color over top. You may need to wait a few minutes between each application to avoid smearing., Take a new makeup sponge and use it to apply white face paint over your eyelids and upper lip. Make sure that you have fully covered these areas in white face paint.








Give your eyelids and upper lip a few minutes to dry before you start adding details.
If you are painting a child’s face, then you may want to skip the eye area details. Young children tend to rub their eyes, so they are likely to smudge the design and get paint into their eyes. Face paints are not meant to get into your eyes and they can cause irritation if they do., The black squiggles will start to give your face a tiger-like appearance. Start by dipping your paint brush into some black paint and use it to create squiggly lines all over your face.








Start by outlining the eyes in an exaggerated cat eye.
Draw smaller squiggles in other areas around your face.
Change the pressure of the brush as you create the squiggles and wiggle the brush to achieve a wavy effect.
Make sure that all of the lines end in a point and that the points are directed in towards the center of your face.

, Next, take your paintbrush and dip it into your pink face paint. Then, take the paint brush and use it to cover your entire lower lip and the tip of your nose with the pink face paint.








You can also add a bit of purple paint to the edges of your lower lip to add a little more detail.

, Next, take you paint brush and paint a thin line of black along the lower part of your upper lip. Then, use the brush to draw a line from the tip of your nose to the center of your upper lip.








The black face paint should create a triangle where the line connects with your lip.
Add some black dots on the outer edges of your upper lip as well. These can be in different sizes and placed in a somewhat random order.

, Dab a bit of black face paint onto your paint brush and then dab it onto the edges of the pink area of your nose. Then, smudge the black paint around the edges of the pink area of your nose. These black, smudgy areas should look like nostrils when you are finished.

face paints in white, grey, and black
a small paintbrush for outlining and detailing
a thick paintbrush for filling in large areas
a fine paintbrush for precise details
a cup of water for thinning out face paint;
, Use your small paintbrush and white paint to paint white lines all around your eye sockets. This is the area just below your eyebrows and about an inch or two below your lower eyelid. Try to trace along the bones around your eyes to create this outline.








If the face paint seems too thick, then you can just dip your brush into the water before dipping it into the paint., Next, use the small paintbrush and white face paint to create an outline that extends over your forehead and around your cheekbones as well. The outline should then curve down towards your lips and end at the corner of your lips.








Your outline should resemble the shape of a skull when you are done.

, Use the white face paint and your thin paintbrush to create two triangles right above each of your nostrils. There should be one triangle above each nostril when you are done.







, Next, switch to a larger brush to fill in the large area that you just outlined with white face paint. Do not fill in the triangles above your nostrils or the areas around your eyes. Leave these areas unpainted for now.








Allow this first coat of face paint to dry completely before you start shading or adding details., Use your small paintbrush to paint over your eyebrows with grey face paint. You can even extend the paint past your eyebrows a bit so that it looks like you have extra bushy grey eyebrows.







, Use the grey face paint to draw a half circle in the middle of the white painted area below your eye. The ends of the half circle should be facing up towards your eye. Blend the half circle into the white paint so that it is somewhat blurry.








Repeat this process under your other eye.

, Use grey face paint on your small brush to shade in the lower edges of the skull shape. This is the area just below your cheekbones. Make sure that you shade in both sides.







, Next, use the grey face paint and your thin brush to create vertical lines along the area above your upper lip. Do not draw these lines on your actual lip, just on the area above your lip.








Start by making one line in the center of the area above your upper lip and then move out from there.

, Switch to a thin brush and dip it into black face paint. Use the face paint to darken the grey areas that you just created. Go over each of the lines that you made with the grey paint to help define them a little more.







, Take your large brush and use it to paint the areas around your eyes with black face paint. Cover the eyelids and the areas under and beside your eyes with black face paint.








To make these areas extra dark, you can also add a bit of black eyeliner to your waterline on your lower eyelid.
Since this design requires you to paint the areas around the eyes, it may not be the best design for young kids. Kids tend to rub their eyes and may get face paint into their eyes.If you want to use this design for a young child, then consider leaving the areas around the eyes unpainted.

, Use your small paintbrush to fill in the triangles above your nostrils. Be careful to keep the black paint inside of the white lines.








If the small brush seems too big to fill in the triangles, then you can also use the thin brush to fill them in.

, Next, take your small paintbrush and use it to outline your entire mask with black face paint. Try to draw long continuous lines rather than short lines.








If necessary, go over the lines again to make them thicker.

, Start in the center of your upper lip and draw a vertical black line. Then, continue making vertical black lines along the length of your upper lip and just above your upper lip as well. Close off the teeth with pointed tops.








After you have outlined all of your teeth, you can go over your teeth again with the black face paint to make them darker.
Draw thin black lines extending from the top of the teeth as well to make them look more realistic.
Add a dot of white face paint to the center of each tooth to highlight it.

Find appropriate shirts.,
Wear the right pants.,
Accent your style with shoes.,
Wear classy piercings.,
Don't get too buff.",How to Dress Ghost (for Guys)1," Wear bohemian style shirts or gothic t-shirts. Look for ruffled shirts or frock coats. Elegant waistcoats are very good for fancier occasions. Try to get ones with gothic buttons such as caskets or skulls.


If you cannot find clothes like this, you can get away with wearing certain T-shirts. Black or white band shirts with subtle logos are okay, as is anything with skulls or skeletons on it.
Romantic goth is very similar to ghost, so draw inspiration from romantic goth looks. Lace can be a wonderful addition to an outfit, as long as it's not too feminine.;
, Try to always wear dress pants, preferably black ones with pinstripes. If you can afford it, look for old Victorian dress pants.


If you want, you can also wear black jeans. Try to keep them relatively fitted without being skin tight. Try to avoid wearing sweats.

, You have some options with shoes, as long as you keep them black. Depending on the occasion, you can wear:


Dress shoes. These work best if they're vintage, or at least an older style.
Platform boots. If you're daring, add lots of chains to them.
Brothel creepers. These are not ideal, but they'll work if the rest of your look is very ghost.

, The best piercings are Monroe, nose studs, cheek piercings and eyebrow rings. If you don't like piercings that's okay.

, A very thin figure gives the illusion that you're barely there, which will enhance your ghost appearance.

"
"
Do your hair properly.,
Wear eyeliner.,
Keep your skin pale.,
Paint your nails black or white.",How to Dress Ghost (for Guys)2," Keep your hair long (shoulder to waist length), strait and flowing with sharp layers. Always leave it down and part it in the center. Dye it black or bleach it white blond. If you have curly hair, you can get away with keeping it chin length.


If you're unsure how to do your hair, draw inspiration from any of vampires (male or female) in the Vampire Chronicle movies.
Avoid fringe—fringe is a specifically emo haircut, and thus does not apply to ghosts.

, Wear black, gray or dark red eyeshadow all around your eye. This will make your eyes look somewhat hollow.


Plain eyeliner with red or pink eyeshadow will also work if you want a more subtle look.

, Powder your face very white.


If you have darker skin, you can skip this step. Just make sure to wear eyeliner.

, Keep them simple—don't add any designs.

"
"
Make sure you have the right personality.,
Read a lot.,
Watch horror movies.,
Listen to appropriate music.,
Be musical.,
Write Gothic poetry and horror stories.,
Appreciate art.",How to Dress Ghost (for Guys)3," The right personality should be intellectual, morose and philosophical. It's important to have a dark aesthetic. A large vocabulary and a high level of intelligence are important.

, Be known for devouring book after book, preferably classic horror books such as Dracula and dark fantasy (anything by Anne Rice). Some high level reading is great too. Dystopian science fiction is amazing. Avoid utopian science fiction and happy fantasy, however.


If you want to go the extra mile, memorize ""The Raven"" By Edgar Allen Poe.

, Try to memorize the lines to Nosferatu, Dracula, and any other old horror flick. At the very least, know their stories very well.

, Listen to goth, dark cabaret, post-punk, horror-punk, shock-rock, metal, dark ambient,and classical music. The best metals are death metal, gothic metal, doom metal, neo-classical metal, symphonic metal, ambient black metal, symphonic black metal, blackened death metal and black doom. Classical music is best if it is melancholy. You can also try history inspired music such as Medieval Babes and Rasputina.

, Learn to play either guitar, keyboard, piano or violin. Practice a lot. If you get good, join a metal, dark cabaret or Gothic band. You can also just focus on classical music if you want.

, Not only should you read a lot, but you should write your own poems and stories to add to your ghost persona.

, Try dadaism, pointillism, romanticism, neoclassicism, impressionism, and expressionism. Anything dark or depressing is great, too.

Place the bruise.,
Apply a base layer of red eye shadow.,
Add purple eye shadow to the area to give the bruise some color and depth.,
Age your bruise with yellow and green.,
Dull any bright spots using black eye shadow.,
Blend the bruise into the skin and make it last with face powder.,
Fool your friends.",How to Make a Fake Bruise with Makeup1," Decide where you will put the bruise and consider what would have caused a bruise in that particular area. This will help you decide where the bruise should be as well as it’s shape and size.


Put the bruise in a place which is easy to reach to make applying makeup simple.
The shape of the bruise should reflect whatever you think would have caused it.
Consider a bruise on your forearm as if it was hit by a blunt object like a bat, which would be an oval bruise. It would be a little longer than it is wide and have rounded edges.
Another option is giving yourself a black eye as if you were punched in the face.;
, Cover your bruise area with a base layer of red eye shadow. This should create a good size and shape for you to work with. The red will represent all of the area of irritation effected by the bruise.








For example, if you are creating the effect of a black eye, curve the red around the bottom of the eye, beginning in the corner and expanding out below the eye and to the side in a crescent shape. It should be about one inch wide at the largest section near the outer, bottom corner of the eye.
You can add some red on the edge of the top eye lid to show irritation.

, Purple should be used on the deepest sections of the bruise to make it really stand out.









In the black eye example, start at the bottom corner of the eye and draw along the edge of the bottom lid. Starting back at the corner, draw down along the edge of the eye socket. This will create sort of a “greater than” symbol or a “v” on it’s side., If you have yellow and green eye shadow and want your bruise to appear to be healing, you can blend some green out around the edges of the bruise, as well as a spot of it in the center. Dab yellow on the edges and in the center of these green sections as highlights.








Use green and yellow around the edges of the crescent in your black eye. Also put some in the corner of your eye, pushing it into the dip in the socket and dragging it slightly up the top lid and down the corner of the bottom., If your green and yellow stand out, are too bright, or make your bruise look unrealistic, you can dab little spots of black throughout these areas to dull them and break up the color a bit.








You can also use black to darken the purple areas if your shade was a little light, or you want more emphasis.

, Take a large makeup brush and apply some powder to the area. Powder the entire bruise with face powder to blend it into your skin tone and take out some of the shine from the eye shadow.







, Let them notice the bruise before you go around showing it off. They are more likely to believe it is real if you don’t say anything about it. Let them ask you what happened and be prepared with a fake story.


If they don’t ask about it, you can “accidentally” touch the bruise or hit it on something, then react as if it hurt.

"

Decide on the timeline of the bruise.,
Purchase a color wheel.,
Create a red base layer.,
Add depth with darker colors.,
Highlight the bruise with yellow.,
Age the bruise with yellow and green.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Fake Bruise with Makeup2," Bruises go through a cycle of trauma and healing. Each part of this cycle reflects different colors and intensity.A new bruise is dark red due to the blood pooling under the skin.
Next the bruise begins to loose iron and purples.
As the bruise begins to heal, it will green around the edges.
Before the bruise fades, it will develop yellow spreading across the skin.
Lastly, the bruise fades back into regular skin color.

, There are several brands of stage makeup which range from inexpensive Halloween makeup to professional stage makeup. The most popular brand of makeup used for theater is Ben Nye.Mehron and Ben Nye both offer a product called a “Bruise Wheel.”
The colors you will want for your bruise are red, purple, yellow, green, and blue.
Choose darker, duller tones like maroon, mustard and olive.

, Using a makeup sponge, dab it in the red makeup. Apply a cover of red in the size and shape of your bruise.









Keep this layer light. Your skin should still show through the makeup.
This layer of red should resemble skin irritation.

, Use a stippling sponge to add purple and blue makeup to your bruise. Work from the edges toward the center of the bruise.








Continue using very little makeup and add small amounts at a time.
Blend hard edges with your finger or makeup sponge to blend the dark colors into the red makeup.

, Use your makeup sponge to apply a dab of yellow to the center of the bruise. This will give it highlight, as well as the appearance of beginning to heal.








, If you want the bruise to look like it has been there for a while and is almost healed, start with a base layer of yellow instead of red. Create a circle of purple in the middle of the yellow for depth, then add green around the outside edges of the purple.

Buy fake blood and fake fangs from a costume shop.,
Look for foundation that will make your skin appear pale.,
Decide if you are going to do detailed makeup or keep your makeup simple.,
Start with a very pale foundation or white face paint.,
Use a press powder to set the foundation or paint.,
Apply brow liner and eyeshadow.,
Use black eyeliner and mascara.,
Apply lip makeup.,
Insert the white contact lenses.,
Finish your look with fake fangs and fake blood.",How to Do Vampire Makeup," The most essential elements of your vampire costume are your fake vampire fangs and fake blood. You can often find fangs and fake blood as a set at a costume shop or in the Halloween section of a big box store like Walmart.


You can also make your own vampire fangs if you are really trying to do-it-yourself. You can make vampire fangs by using fake nails, a straw, acrylic gel, or a plastic fork.
Most vampire fangs in stores will come with a way to keep the fangs in your mouth or attached to your top teeth, such as teeth glue or a mould that fits over your teeth. Make sure the vampire fangs include an adhesive of some kind in the package.
You can make your own fake blood as well out of basic household supplies if you are really looking to DIY your costume.
You can even do this step if you have braces. It will take a bit more work, seeing as you have to make your own that will work with braces. You can use orthodontic wax if you have any, or use denture glue for a more longer-last look.;
, To really get the vampire look, you will need to make your skin appear very pale. You can do this by using a foundation that is one to two shades paler than your normal foundation or by using pale face paint.The hue of the foundation will depend on your skin tone. If you already have a pale skin tone, you may not need to use that much foundation on your skin. If you have a darker skin tone, you will likely need to use a very pale foundation to make your skin appear lighter.

, The amount of makeup you use on the rest of your face, such as your eyes and mouth, will depend on the vampire look you are going for. If you are going for a more glam vampire look, you may decide to also apply dramatic eye makeup and lipstick. But if you are pressed for time and are trying to go for a more scary vampire look, you may decide to keep your makeup simple and minimal.


You may also want to consider the rest of your vampire costume, such as your clothing and your hair. If you are planning to dress up in a dramatic costume with a dark wig, you may want to go for a glam vampire look. If you are keeping your outfit simple, you may decide to also keep your makeup simple.
If you are going to do more dramatic eye makeup, you should have access to makeup brushes, makeup sponges, and a makeup palette that contains black, red, purple, and gray.

, Wash and dry your face so it is a clean palette. Using a makeup sponge or your clean fingers, apply a dab of foundation that is lighter than your skin tone on your forehead, cheeks, and under your chin. Blend in the foundation so it covers your entire face, but leave the area around your eyes and your lips bare.You can also use white face paint and apply it with a makeup sponge. You want to appear very pale and dead to achieve the ideal vampire look.
You should apply the foundation on your neck and your chest, especially if these areas are going to be exposed when you are in your vampire costume.
To give your face more definition, you can apply a light gray face paint or foundation under your cheekbones and your jawline so your face appears more hollow and skeleton like.

, Keep your foundation or face paint in place by applying a press powder in a very pale shade. You can use a brush to spread the powder over your face or press the powder to your face using a makeup sponge., Start by making your eyebrows appear more dramatic with a black brow liner or black eyeshadow. Apply the brow liner or eyeshadow to your eyebrows with a makeup brush. This will help to highlight your eyeshadow and eyeliner and give you a more bold look.Then, use the purple eye shadow to create dramatic eye circles under your eyes. Apply the purple eye shadow on your eyelids, on the area below your eyebrows, and under your eyes using a makeup brush. Do not be afraid to make the circles noticeable on your face; they are part of the dead look after all!
Alternatively, you can use the red eyeshadow to give your eyes a more blood like look. Apply black eyeshadow to your eyelids first, making the shadow appear darker on the inside area of your eyelids. Then, apply red eyeshadow above the black on your eyelids so it sits right underneath your eyebrows. Blend the red eyeshadow a little bit with the black eyeshadow. Finish your eyeshadow look by applying red eyeshadow underneath your eyes so your eyes appear spooky and dead-like., Finish your eye makeup by applying black eyeliner along your waterline, which is the line underneath your eye, and smudging the eyeliner with a makeup brush. Apply black eyeliner to the top line of your eyes and smudge this eyeliner as well. The eyeliner should appear smoky and blended against your eye shadow.For a glam vampire look, you may decide to create wings with your eyeliner. Use a small thin makeup brush to draw the eyeliner out into an upward wing shape on either side of your eyes. You can then darken this wing shape with more eyeliner and blend it using black eyeshadow.You can also apply black mascara to your eyelashes. This will make your eyes appear bold and dark. If you are familiar with how to apply false eyelashes to your eyes, you can also use fake black eyelashes for a very dramatic vampire look.

, Once you have completed the eye makeup, you can move on to your lips. For a dramatic effect, give your lips a blood red look using red lipstick or red lip color.Before you apply lipstick, use a lip brush to outline your lips and make your lipstick stay put. Then, apply the red lipstick to your lips, making sure you cover both lips well and evenly.
You can also use a lip brush to apply red lip color to your lips. Start by lining your lips with lip liner and then using a makeup brush to apply the red lip color.

, You can buy white contact lenses at your local drugstore or at a costume shop. They are not required for a vampire makeup look but they will make you look more scary and dead-like.Vampires are often depicted as having eye color that ranges from from soft, dark gray to blood red (if they're super hungry). If you want, you can get contact lenses that also change the iris color to one of these, or any color in between.
Insert the contact lenses using clean fingers. Be careful not to smudge your eye makeup as you insert the lenses.

, Complete the vampire makeup by applying your fake fangs and the fake blood. Use the adhesive for the fangs to attach them to your mouth or your teeth.Apply the fake blood by holding the open tube by one corner of your lips. Let the blood drip out of the tube onto your face so it rolls down your chin and dries. Use clean fingers to smudge the blood by the corner of your mouth slightly so it looks more realistic.
Repeat the same process on the other side of your mouth so it looks like you have two long drips of blood by your mouth. The blood will help you look like a more convincing and scary vampire.

Get some ideas for your outfit.,
Visit a thrift store or garage sale.,
Find a comfortable, simple shirt.,
Get loose-fitting pants.,
Try a muumuu dress or loose skirt.,
Wear a sweater (or two).,
Add a scarf around the shoulders or head.,
Wear sensible sneakers or other shoes.",How to Dress and Act Like an Old Lady1," Look up images of old women online or in books to see what they’re wearing and get ideas for yourself. Consider what decade you’d be from as old lady and what kind of style you’d have.


A good rule for placing your old lady costume in a certain time period is to choose clothing that was popular a couple decades before that time period, as the style of clothing on elderly people is often slightly outdated.
Try talking to a grandmother or other older female person you are close to for tips and advice. If you’re lucky, she might let you borrow some of her clothes! Just remember to be respectful and avoid offending her by wearing the clothes as a joke or costume.;
, Go to a secondhand store, garage sale, or vintage clothing store to find older clothing. Keep an eye out for clothing in outdated styles that you think an old lady might wear.


Choose garments that look more worn and even faded for a truly old appearance. You can always wash secondhand items before wearing them, but in this case keeping the strange, old scent of another person on the clothes might help your authenticity!
Check online stores like Ebay if you’re looking for an item that’s very specific. Otherwise, inexpensive items from a thrift store will suffice.

, Look for a loose-fitting top or t-shirt in a muted color. Go for one with an applique design of flowers, animals, or other similarly cute or cliche motif on the chest.


Pick out a shirt that is one or two sizes too big on you so that it is roomy and comfortable.
Avoid modern styles, bright colors or prints, and low necklines.

, Choose pants in a stretch fabric and a fit that is not form-fitting. Ideally the pants have an elastic waistband for the most comfort and ability to move in them.


If you can, find pants in a similar shade as your top, or any other element of your outfit. Or, look for two-piece sets of pants and a top that are intended to go together. The more matching, the better!

, Look for a house dress or muumuu, which is a long, shapeless shift dress, often in a colorful pattern. Or choose a long and loose-fitting skirt worn with a top.


If you wear a dress or skirt, pull pantyhose in a similar shade as your skin onto your legs.
If you’re going for the look of a very elderly person stuck in a hospital or their home, try a muumuu in more muted colors, or anything that looks more like pajamas, including a robe and house slippers if you like.

, Find an oversized knit sweater or cardigan to wear over the rest of your outfit. A sweater that looks hand-knit is ideal.


Layer on sweaters, even in warm weather, as old ladies often have poor circulation and get cold easily.
Also try a colorful vest, ideally with applique or embroidered details with scenes from nature, a holiday, or any other theme.

, Tie a thin scarf, either silk or knit, around the top of the head and tied at the chin or around the shoulders and tied at the chest.


If wearing a scarf around the shoulders, try securing it with an old brooch at the chest.

, Choose a simple white sneaker for the perfect granny shoe, or strappy white sandals if you’re wearing pantyhose with a dress or skirt.


For a dressier old lady look, try pumps with a small kitten heel, worn with pantyhose.
Look for sneakers with velcro, a signature senior style for those too old to easily tie shoelaces.

Create wrinkles with makeup.,
Achieve gray or white hair.,
Don large glasses.,
Use a cane or walker.,
Wear costume jewelry.,
Make a fake hearing aid.,
Keep other convincing items in your purse.",How to Dress and Act Like an Old Lady2," Scrunch up your forehead, eyes, and mouth to find where wrinkles naturally form on the skin. Use a brown eyeliner or eyeshadow to lightly trace the lines of those wrinkle spots, then smudge the lines with your finger or a brush. Add bags under the eyes and any other aging spots you want.You can even add highlighter or eyeshadow in a lighter shade than your skin to the areas on either side of your “wrinkles” to make them look more three-dimensional.
Try another method for wrinkles using non-toxic white glue, which you apply in a thin layer to your face. Apply it while your skin is stretched out by puffing up your cheeks or stretching it with your fingers, then when your skin relaxes to its normal state the glue will create wrinkles.Do the makeup or glue treatment to your hands or any other exposed skin as well. You can add blue or green makeup to hands and forearms to simulate prominent or varicose veins.
Finish with touches like bright lipstick or drawn-on eyebrows.

, Put on a white or gray wig, or use temporary dye or baby powder to color your own hair for the look.


Tie hair back in a simple, low bun. Or try putting hair curlers in and leaving them there.
If you use baby powder to make your hair gray, try spraying over it with hairspray to help it stick and stay put., Look for large, clear-rimmed glasses with thick lenses in an outdated style. Find a chain or beaded glasses holder to wear them around your neck when they aren’t on your face.


If the glasses have prescription lenses that you can’t see out of, just pop out the lenses before wearing them.

, Carry around a cane or walker with you to use for support when getting around.


This prop can help remind you to act like an old woman too, by staying stooped or bent over and relying on the cane or walker for balance.

, Choose large, colorful, and over-the-top jewelry for a classic granny look. Put on big pearls, flashy earrings, or several metal or charm bracelets. Stick to gold metal for everything.Alternatively, try a few subtler sentimental pieces, like a tarnished wedding ring or a locket with pictures that would represent children or grandchildren.
A sparkly brooch or pin is also a good addition, to either fasten a scarf or simply pin to the front of a sweater or dress.

, For a special touch, fake a hearing aid by fashioning a piece of wax to look like the ear piece. Or use other earplugs or headphones in a light color to look like a hearing device.


The bonus of putting something in your ears to look like a hearing aid is that you truly won’t hear well when others are talking to you, making for an authentic demeanor.

, Carry a large, unstructured bag or tote and fill it with some of the following convincing items:


Prescription or vitamin bottles
An extra sweater
Fruit and other snacks
Denture case and cleaner
Lipstick or other makeup
Crossword puzzles or other word games

Stoop or hunch over.,
Speak in a gravelly voice and use outdated expressions.,
Squint to see and feign difficulty hearing.,
Fuss and offer things.",How to Dress and Act Like an Old Lady3," When standing or walking especially, remain hunched over by rounding your shoulders toward the front and center of your body.


Walk very slowly and unsteadily when you move, and pretend to rely on a cane or walker for support.
You can also add other shaky or unsteady movements of your hands, arms, and legs when you move them.

, Try to speak with a scratchy or croaky version of your voice by constricting your throat slightly when you talk. Use words and expressions that are outdated for the time period.


Try out old-fashioned phrases like, “Pleased as punch,” “Well, I’ll be a monkey’s uncle!” and “Fiddlesticks!”Continually begin with “Back in my day…” and follow with a story of the comparative hardships, simplicity, or enjoyment of life in a long-gone time.

, Squint when you need to read or look at an object closely, or any time that you are trying to examine something. Also pretend not to hear people well, and ask for them to repeat themselves and “speak up.”


Wearing thick old glasses and a fake hearing aid can help you to naturally strain more to see and hear.

, Worry and chatter over people and their health and well-being. Offer the food, sweater, or vitamins in your purse, and don’t take no for an answer. Ask a lot of questions and express concern over everything going on in someone’s life.


Try using phrases like “Oh, we need to put some meat on those bones!” before offering someone food, or “Just looking at you makes me feel cold! Here, have my extra sweater” before offering a warm layer.
Offer unsolicited and frank advice to people about their health, relationships, or job.

, This will help fill in the pores and little wrinkles on your face. It will create a smooth canvas for you to work on.

, Even though you are doing a melted look, you still want everything to be neat. This will make the special FX easier to see. If your base makeup is messy, the special FX makeup will look messy too.Even if you are male or doing a male character, your face would still benefit from a little foundation. It will even out your skin tone.

, This is a great option for those who are going for a melted Barbie, melted doll, or melted fashion model look. If this is for a male character or look, consider doing just contouring and skipping the blush.

, If this is for a melted Barbie, doll, or fashion model look, consider doing some smokey eyes; save the false lashes for later. If this is for a male character or look, use neutral-colored eyeshadow and keep the mascara and eyeliner to a minimum.

, You can use finishing powder or setting spray for this.Setting your makeup will keep your ""canvas"" intact and make the finished look less messy. Don't worry, you can still add some melted makeup smears later on, if that's the look you are going for.

, Many theatrical-grade companies, such as Mehron and Ben Nye, will sell these products. You can find them in costume shops and online.


Many of these products offer a ""flesh tone,"" which may or may not match yours. If you have very pale or very dark skin, opt for a clear product.
Some products need to be mixed first. Read the label on your product for specific instructions.

, It might be a good idea to close your eyes and pull your hair back. If you have very short hair, consider clipping it out of the way with bobby pins.

, Pick some of the gel up using the end of a makeup brush or a popsicle stick. Dribble the gel wherever you want the melting to start.


Do not let the bristles of your brush touch the gel. You won't be able to get it out.

, You can tilt your head around to ""guide"" the drips.If you need to, apply more gel, and let it drip down some more. Let the gel dribble naturally down your face.


Avoid getting the gel into your eyes or eyebrows.

, Each product is a little different, so refer to the label on the bottle for specific drying times. It should only be a couple of minutes. The gel must be completely dry before you move onto the next step.


Consider brushing the gel with setting powder when you are done., If the melted makeup is very different from your skin tone, you will need to blend it in, or else it won't look natural. Take some foundation, and dab it along the top edges of the dribbles. Use your fingers or a makeup sponge to blend in the foundation into the gel and your skin.


Reapply blush or contouring, if needed.

, Use a small eyeshadow brush and some bronzer (or the darker shade from a contouring kit) to fill in the grooves between the melted dribbles. Add some shadow beneath the dribbles as well., Take a look at your makeup. If it still looks flat, take a thin brush and some highlighter (or eyeshadow a few shades lighter than your skin tone), and brush it along the raised edges of the dribbles. Be subtle, and don't get too carried away.

, Consider why your face is melting. Is it because it got burned? If so, add some red or dark pink into the upper creases of the dribbles for that burnt, raw look. Is it melting because you are a spooky Barbie doll or tragic fashion model? Add some smudged mascara with black eyeshadow.Choose red, pink, or black eyeshadow. Apply it using a thin brush.

, For a melted Barbie doll or fashion model, pop on some false eyelashes. Consider applying one of the falsies into the melted part of your face. It will look like it slid off.For a gorier look, fill in the crevices between the dribbles with coagulated stage blood. Add some scars with rigid collodion.You can get rigid collodion from costume shops and online shops specializing in theatrical makeup.

, This will ensure that your makeup lasts the entire night.

Oil can be transferred from your hands to your face, which can cause breakouts or blemishes., You can use a regular concealer, or a product specifically designed as an eyeshadow primer. The base layer will smooth out your complexion and act as a blank slate for your eyeshadow, allowing it to adhere better., Taking a small amount, dab the base layer onto your upper eyelid. Smooth the primer into one thin and even layer that starts at the edge of your upper eyelid and up to the crease of your eye., Apply the base in the same way, smoothing it across your whole eyelid. Make sure that you use the same thickness and shape on the other side of your face.

, Kohl pencils are perfect for the Jack Sparrow look, as they are made of compressed soot and other natural ingredients that make a smoother, softer line than regular eyeliners.Regular black eyeliner will work too, but it won’t blend as well.

, Using your non-dominant hand, pull your eyebrow up in the center to lift and smooth your eyelid. This will put tension on your eyelid and give you a firmer surface to work with., Start at the inside corner of your upper lid, and draw a smooth and even line to the outside corner of your eyelid. The line should be the same thickness all the way across. Hold your elbow on a table or counter while drawing to help stabilize your arm. , Since this look uses a heavy amount of eyeliner and will be blended at the end, you can fill in gaps or mistakes with a little more liner as needed. The most important thing is to make sure it’s a strong line of even thickness.

, Place your finger in the middle of your lower lid, again using your non-dominant hand. Gently pull down until you can see your water line, or the wet part of your lower eyelid.

, Starting at the inside corner of your eyelid, draw your lower line with the same thickness as the eyeliner on your upper lid. Adjust as necessary to make sure it’s thick and even.

, Line both your upper and lower eyelids in exactly the same way as your first eye, with the same thickness and darkness. If you find one is dramatically different than the other when you finish, adjust as necessary, filling in any gaps or thickening up the thinner line.

, Any black or dark gray eyeshadow will do: the darker the better. You’ll also want a small, rounded brush to apply the shadow. You won’t need anything super expensive for this look, because it will all be blended together at the end, but look look for brushes labeled “allover eye shadow” or “general use eye shadow”. , Go dark, using much more dark shadow than you normally might.Brush from the inside corner to the outside corner, sweeping up to the crease of your eyelid, where Jack Sparrow’s makeup stops. Make sure it’s smooth and even, with no gaps or darker spots.

, Cover the whole of your bottom lid, again applying the makeup as thick as possible. You don’t want to apply as low on your lower eyelid as you did up on your upper eyelid: about half a centimeter down should do.

, Again, use the same technique on your other eye. Adjust if you find that one eye looks a bit different than the other.

, While there are some brushes specifically made for blending, the messy style worn by Jack Sparrow won’t need that kind of specialized brush. Again, make sure that your hands are clean and dry.

, Blend the eyeshadow and eyeliner together to create a smoky, matte texture, starting at the inner corner of your eye and working up and out. Drag a bit of the powder up above your eyelid crease to create a bit of gradient.

, Using the same finger, blend the eyeliner and shadow starting at the inner corner and working towards the outer corner. Jack Sparrow’s lower eyeliner is a bit more defined than that on his upper lid, so blend a little less than you did on the top lid., A little powder applied at the end will help set your makeup and keep it from moving or smearing more throughout the day. Use a large brush to gently place the powder over your look and set it.

, Mascara can help make this look pop a bit more if you feel that your eyelashes are too thin. Use a black mascara that emphasizes volume and not length, as Jack Sparrow’s eyelashes aren’t particularly long.

Study color theory.,
Practice basic hair styling.,
Practice painting realistic horror makeup.,
Learn how to make prosthetics.,
Create basic wigs and hairpieces.",How to Become a Horror Makeup Artist1," Although a makeup school can be expensive, it will also prepare you thoroughly for finding work as a makeup artist. Look for schools that offer special effects makeup courses or concentrations. Horror makeup is a large component of special effects makeup, but schools don't generally have courses solely in horror makeup. The profession is generally called a special effects makeup artist.See if there are any makeup academies in your area that offer special effects makeup courses, and assess if you can financially cover the cost.
You can teach yourself how to become a horror makeup artist, but it will be a harder road. A makeup school provides the resources and facilities that you need for your projects as well as personalized guidance.
You can also see if it’s possible to just take a course or two if you don’t want to enroll in a program.;
, Knowing anatomy, particularly facial anatomy, is important for any kind of makeup artist, but it is particularly important for horror and special effect makeup artists. Because horror makeup often features characters whose bones or muscles are exposed, it’s vital to understand how the face and body are structured.Use books or online resources to learn more about facial anatomy. Test yourself by trying to draw skeletal or muscular systems from memory.
If you are studying at a makeup school, you will take classes that cover anatomy.
If you are enrolled in a non-makeup focused college, enroll in an anatomy course. You can also try to take an anatomy class at your local community college.

, Learn the basics of makeup application, starting off with learning about beauty makeup. Even though horror makeup artists use materials like latex, paint, and prosthetics, they also use beauty products like foundation, powder and lipstick. This is why it’s best to have a basic knowledge of beauty products that you can work off of.Many techniques that are essential in beauty makeup application, such as learning how to contour and how to use makeup brushes, are skills that you will use as a special effects makeup artist. With horror makeup, you push these techniques and exaggerate them to achieve a gory or horror effect.
If you cannot take a class in makeup application, watch Youtube videos from makeup artists and practice on yourself or a friend.

, Unlike beauty makeup artists or estheticians, special effects makeup artists use paint on their subject’s face or on prosthetics to create their makeup look. This involves learning how to mix paint and create colors. It also requires the makeup artist to understand which colors look good together and how to create basic skin tones.If you are enrolled in a makeup school, you will receive schooling on color theory. Many art schools also offer color theory courses.
If you don’t have access to classes, learn by taking a basic painting class or by using online resources like Youtube or Internet articles from credible sources.

, Although some studios and projects hire a separate hair stylist, you will be asked to do both makeup and hair in the course of your career. This is why it’s valuable to gain a basic knowledge of hair styling. You may also need to know hair basics to be able to create wigs or add hair to prosthetics., One of the first special effects-related skills you should learn is how to paint realistic gore and other special effects. Invest in some professional-grade face paint to practice. Learn how to apply paint either through classes or though Internet videos made by professional makeup artists.


Many special effects are created by patiently layering paint. You will need to learn how to build up the surface to create a realistic effect.

, After you have gained foundational knowledge, it’s time to learn about the different ways in which horror makeup artists achieve their creations. Learn about the basics of making prosthetics from latex and other materials.If you are enrolled a makeup school, you will gain this knowledge through your classes.
If you are not taking classes, use the Internet as a resource to practice and learn how to make prosthetics.

, Many special effects makeup artists incorporate wigs or hairpieces along with the actor’s regular hair to create their characters. Learn to create wigs, and also how to weave them into the actor’s hair using ventilation and other methods."

As it becomes tacky it is easier to stretch into shapes and the more crevices you create, the deeper and nastier the burn will appear.;
,, Start with the Red and dab it on to the Flesh Effects gel with your finger. Blend well, especially where it meets the skin; the aim is to make the burn look raw and inflamed.

, As with the Red, blend well and use sparingly.

, Add a bit off black to make the burn look charred but be very sparing. Ben Nye professional clown series in Black is a good product to use for this purpose.

Gather inspiration.,
Start experimenting.,
Come up with a vision.,
Plan out your idea.,

Do at least eight different projects.,
Assemble the pictures into a portfolio.",How to Become a Horror Makeup Artist2," Before starting work on your portfolio, surround yourself with resources and inspiration. Watch movies that are pivotal in special effect makeup history, and gather books and images of great work from the early days of film up until the present. This is a library that you can draw from if you ever feel uninspired or stuck during your work on a project.It’s essential to understand the history and breadth of horror and special effects makeup. Having this knowledge will widen your creative scope so you come up with new ideas more easily, and it will prevent you from making cliché or outdated makeup choices.

, Now that you have basic knowledge and a library of inspiration, it’s time to experiment. Use either yourself or a friend to try out a bunch of looks. Have fun, take risks, and don’t expect too much out of yourself. This experimental phase will get you familiar with using materials and combining different horror makeup methods.


If you aren’t enrolled in a makeup school and need more guidance as you experiment, follow step-by-step tutorials on Youtube created by special effects makeup artists.
Even if you follow a tutorial, try to add a personal touch. It’s important to exercise your creativity and to not get dependent on specific instructions.

, As you start to do independent projects, which you will eventually turn into a portfolio you can use to get a job, you will need to come up with ideas for a characters or effects. If you are in school, you will be assigned a project, and will likely have more specific guidelines. If you are learning independently, you will need to come up with an idea yourself.Don’t feel your idea needs to be especially elaborate. You can even start with just one word, like “Zombie” or “Monster”. In your planning stage, you will flesh out this idea more.

, No matter whether you are in a class or working independently, never skip the planning stage. This is the point of maximum creativity, when you can use a pencil and paper to draw or write out your idea. You’ll find that when you allow yourself creative freedom, your character may end up going in a much more interesting direction than when you started!Start by listing adjectives about your character or effect. Then start to draw the character in color.
You can even write a little story about your character, or figure out its background. Getting more familiar with your character will give you a better sense of what he, she or it looks like.
For instance, maybe you started with the word “Monster”. Add words like “brown”, “short” and “hairy”. You could make up a story about how this is a lonely monster that lives in the sewers of a large city and rarely sees sunlight. Just a short story like this can unfold a vision in your mind of the monster.

, Take your sketches and descriptions of your character and do the makeup either on yourself or on a friend. You may have to practice this look a few times before coming up with something that you’re proud of., Take a high-definition photograph of your work from several different angles. It’s important to document your work so that you can eventually put it in your portfolio and show off your skills to potential employers.


If you did the makeup on yourself, have a friend or family member take the photograph for you., Repeat the process of formulating an idea and creating a makeup look at least seven more times. For each project, pick ideas that are radically different from each other and showcase different skills. This will show potential employers that you have a varied skill set and ample creativity.For instance, one project could be a minimal zombie makeup look just using paint. Another project could be an alien where you use a bald cap and a large prosthetic for the top of the head, along with green and grey paint. Another could be a glamorous mermaid with scaly skin and a wig.

, Take all of your photographs from the projects you worked on and write a short description describing the idea for the makeup look and the inspiration you drew from. Then create both a physical portfolio and a digital portfolio that you will be able to show employers.Your description could look like this: “Zombie. This character makeup was created using paint and foam latex pieces. The latex pieces were designed, molded, and attached to the subject to look like damaged and dead skin. The illusion was enhanced by adding a greenish tinge to the skin using paint.”

Strengthen your portfolio and gain experience by working on small projects such doing makeup for haunted houses, amateur theatre productions or student film projects.Even if these projects don’t pay, they are a great way to get your work out there and to learn how to work with others.
Add pictures from these projects into your portfolio.

, Because special effect makeup is such a small field, it will be harder to find people to network with than it is for your average job field. If you have a degree through a makeup school, keep in touch with your professors and go to alumni meetings. You can also go to film industry events like screenings and openings and meet people in the industry who can help you get your foot in the door.


If you have learned by yourself, join Facebook groups centered around special effects makeup artists. Even if the people you talk to aren’t in your area, they may have contacts that could help connect you to professionals near you.
If you are networking at an event, bring business cards with your name, contact information, and the title “Special Effects Makeup Artist” on them.

, Get your cover letter and resume up to date with all of the skills and experience you now have. Write a basic draft of your cover letter and change it to include personalized details for every job you apply to., An internship at a film studio is a good intermediate step to finding a job. Because of the competition of the makeup industry, you may have to do a couple unpaid or low-paying positions before getting paid work.An internship in an established studio will give you a good understanding of how the industry works and the etiquette and expectations that come with the job.

, If you are living in an area that has a lot of film studios or companies, call or email them directly and ask if there are any open opportunities for special effects makeup artists. They may be hiring makeup artists freelance to help with a project, or they may have a more permanent assistant position open.Be sure to research the studio or organization beforehand so that you are knowledgeable about it.
In a few sentences, tell them about your skills and experience. If they seem interested, ask if you can set up a meeting or send them copies of your portfolio, resume and cover letter.

, Look on sites like Craigslist as well as specialized film industry job boards for special effects makeup opportunities. Once you have a couple of gigs under your belt, it will be easier to find work. Many makeup artists work freelance, so figuring out the best online resources for finding gigs will be a vital step in your progress toward achieving your dream., If becoming a horror makeup artist is your dream job, you may have to make major changes in your life. If you are living in a small town or somewhere without a big film industry presence, you may realize that you’d have a much easier time if you were living in a city like New York or Los Angeles. Think about whether this is a change you’d be willing to make to follow your dream!

Just remember that you will be doing the same makeup on the fake, second set of eyes and lips you’ll be creating, so simplicity is key. For example, sweeping one color shadow across your lid, lining your lash line with eyeliner, applying mascara, and applying a pigmented lipstick is great. You can use any color and product you like, but it won’t be too complicated to recreate on your “fake” eyes!, It’s best to use a pomade or gel for this step, because you will want to create dark, pigmented eyebrows that match your own brows. This second set of brows should go right under your eyes, on either side of your nose. The key is to mimic your natural brows. Begin your fake ones parallel to where your real ones start, and taper them off where your real brows taper.Recreate the length, thickness, shape, color, and so on of your real brows.
It’s easiest to apply your fake brows with a tapered eyeliner brush.

, Observe your own eyes carefully, and recreate the shape of your eyes with eyeliner. They should be basically parallel with your nostrils. Once you’ve created the outline of your new eyes, brush eyeshadow over the top. Begin by applying the eyeshadow right on the outer border of your eye outline, blending it upwards – just like on your natural lids.Once you’ve applied the eyeshadow, use your darker eyeliner to draw a fake “crease” in it. This will make your shadow look more like three-dimensional eyelids.

, Use a white, pigmented eyeliner to fill in the entire outline you created. This will create the whites of your eyes. Then, you will need to create your colored iris. Try to find an eyeliner or pigmented eyeshadow that matches the color of your eyes (brown, blue, green, gray, hazel, etc.). Use a small concealer or eyeshadow brush to create your iris, and then use a black eyeliner to create your pupil within it. Again, you are simply trying to make this second set of eyes look like your real eyes, so use those for reference!


Once you’ve created the iris and pupil, dot a bit of white liquid eyeliner in the fake pupil. This will give the effect of light shining off these eyes, and make them look more realistic and lifelike.
Once your fake eyes are completely created, line the outline darkly with the same eyeliner you used on your real eyes.

, This step takes your fake eyes from cool to downright trippy. Pick up a pair of full, fake lashes from a local pharmacy or beauty supply store. Apply lash glue along the band of the lashes, letting it dry until it’s tacky. Then, place your fake lashes onto the top border of your fake eyes.Make sure to hold the lashes down for a couple of seconds to make sure they dry securely on your skin.
Be careful not to touch your face at all while you’re wearing this look. If you touch your cheeks out of habit, you can smear your carefully constructed fake eyes.
Add a row of bottom lashes by just drawing lines extending from the bottom lash line in eyeliner.

, You will want to apply it to the tip of your natural nose, but also where your second, fake nose will be. The nose you will create should go about midway up the bridge of your nose, between your real and fake eyes. Apply the concealer, and then blend it out. This will create a smooth, blank canvas to work on., Use a pencil eyeliner in a tan or brown color, depending on the color of your skin. You don’t need to be Picasso and create a freakishly realistic nose. Instead, just recreate the shape of your natural nose as you look at it straight on.Your outline will probably only consist of a few curves, where your natural nose curves from nostril to tip.
Observe how your nostrils poke out on the sides, and create that same shape with your eyeliner, extending upwards slightly.

, You don’t want your fake nose to be a hard outline. By blending the lines out gently with a blending brush, the lines will look more like shadows around a three-dimensional nose., There should be darker shadows in the “nostrils” and up where the sides of the nose would be. Use a tan or brown eyeshadow and small brush to create these areas of shadow. The sides of the nose should extend upwards, towards your natural brows., Again, the shape you create should look like the shape of your natural lips. Create this general outline with the same product you used on your natural lips, like a cream or liquid lipstick. You can use a doe foot applicator to create the lips, or you may want to use a lip brush.


When you’re finished with this step, you’ll have the general shape of your lips but they won’t look realistic yet.

, Use a dark lip liner to outline the entire border of the lips, taking care to really copy the shape of your natural lips. Make sure you use a lip liner dark enough to show up against the lipstick you used to create the lips. Once you’ve outlined the border, draw a line through your lips. This will separate the shape into a top and bottom lip., Using the same dark lip liner, draw vertical lines down your lips. This will mimic the ridges of natural lips. You can shade in the outer corners a bit and add a bit of shading between the top and bottom lips, making them appear more three-dimensional and lifelike.To create a bit more dimension within your lips, you can dot a bit of white eyeliner at the two peaks of the top lip and the center of the bottom lip. This will look like light reflecting off the highest points of the lip.

Grab a bucket that's large enough to completely submerge your model's hand along with a 2"" (5 cm) section of the wrist.

,
Mix up some alginate in the bucket and stir it with a wooden paint stirring stick.,
Apply release cream to your model's hand.,
Ask your model to dunk his or her hand into the alginate and pull it back out.,
Submerge your model's hand into the alginate.,
Tell your model to wiggle his or her fingers and to slowly pull the hand out of the alginate.,
Let your model wash his or her hands to get rid of any alginate or cream residue.

",How to Make a Severed Hand Snack Tray1," Invite some friends over and make a party out of it. Just remind them to wear old clothing that they don't mind damaging.;
,,, Purchase alginate online from Amazon or another website. You can also look for ""life casting"" starter kits that have all of the tools for mixing alginate in a single package.


The recipe is usually about 3 parts lukewarm water to 1 part alginate.
If the water is too warm, the mold will will set too quickly. If the water is too cool, the mold take longer to set.
Leave at least 1"" (2.5 cm) at the top of the bucket so that the alginate level can rise when the model puts his or her hand into the mix.
Mix the alginate until it has the consistency of a thick, creamy yogurt. You'll need to mix quickly before the alginate starts to set up.

, Doing this will ensure that your model's hand comes out of the mold easily without ripping hair out of his or her hand or arm.

, Use a chip brush to paint the hand so that you can break up any bubbles.

, Your model should hold his or her hand with the palm facing downward and parallel to the bottom of the bucket. About 2"" (5 cm) of his or her wrist should also be submerged.


Have the model curve his or her fingers as though holding a tray. Doing this will ensure that you can set a snack tray on top of the severed hand.
Tap the bucket lightly. Doing this causes air bubbles to float to the top and makes a better cast.
Ask your model to sit still until the alginate sets, which usually takes 7 to 10 minutes. The alginate is cured when it's firmer and less spongy.

, If the mold cracks slightly at the wrist, don't worry. The container will push the cracked part back together while you're casting the hands.

Pour a pint of water into a mixing container.,
Pour about 1/4 of your plaster into the alginate mold.,
Pour the rest of the plaster into the mold.,
Allow the plaster to cure.,
Invert the container that is holding your alginate mold and plaster over a work surface.,
Peel the alginate away from the plaster using your fingers.,
Scrape the surface of the plaster hand and base gently to remove any air bubbles.",How to Make a Severed Hand Snack Tray2," Slowly add plaster until an island forms in the center of the container.


Wait for the island to sink. Then, mix the plaster into the water with a paint stick.
Test the plaster's thickness by dipping your finger into the mixture. The plaster should coat your finger opaquely, like a cotton glove. Rinse your finger and add a little bit plaster more if the mixture is too thin.
Add a pinch of salt to your plaster mixture. Salt will make it set more quickly.

, Rotate the mold to get a coating of plaster all over the inside. Making a coating like this keeps bubbles from forming on the surface of the hand.

, Overflow the mold with a 1/4"" (6 mm) layer of plaster. The overflow will create a round base to support your severed hand.

, Plaster produces a lot of heat as it hardens. When the plaster has heated up and then cooled down, you know that your plaster has cured.

, Gently squeeze the sides to release the mold, but don't squeeze too hard; you might break a plaster finger.

, Be especially careful around the fingers so that you don't break them off.


If you accidentally break one of the fingers, set it aside and continue de-molding the hand.
Reattach the broken finger using a surface-intensive adhesive.

, Allow the plaster to dry completely.

Prepare your snacks.",How to Make a Severed Hand Snack Tray3,", Priming it will allow the plaster to breathe so that you don't seal in moisture, which will cause the hand to deteriorate.

, Doing this will make the base less noticeable and will make the hand look more realistic.

,


Apply red variations to the bottom of the wrist to make it appear as though the hand was cut off of a body.
Paint the hand with your preferred skin tone. Add details like fingernails or painted on rings.
Paint them a grayish color and sponge purplish splotches on them to create zombie hands.
Add lace gloves to the hands. Cut about 1/3 to 1/2 of the fingers off of the gloves so that they don't entirely cover the fingers. Then put the gloves over your hands, leaving the fingers exposed.

,


Balance the styrofoam onto the plaster hand, adding clear tape to secure the styrofoam if needed.
You can also paint the styrofoam, if you wish. Spray paint is the quickest option.

, Look in the mirror as you wrinkle your face. Scrunch your forehead. Notice your natural wrinkles. You should add highlight and shadow to these. With a dark brown makeup pencil or small brush, draw a thin line just above each wrinkle .


Start in the middle and work outward. Just like the wrinkles on your head, your shadow line should be thicker in the center and fade out at the ends.
Do the same thing below the dark line with a lighter brown color. When you're done with your forehead, make crows feet at the outside corners of your eyes.
Scrunch your mouth and nose, and highlight and shadow those wrinkles as well.
Gently run your finger around the wrinkles to blend them in.

, Take a darker brown or purple and gently brush in a shadow above your eyes. Then add another shadow below your eyes, in the area where you'd have a black eye.


These should be as subtle as your wrinkles, and nicely blended out on the edges. You can add a highlight under your eyes, and in the corner of your eyes to help them stand out and Outline with darker color bags under the eyes.

, You can paint your lips with your base color if you want, or go lighter or darker. Many old people will not have any pinkish color in their lips.


Once the base is applied to the lips, take your shadow color and add several vertical lines on your upper and lower lips, to make them seem wrinkled. Purse your lips to get an idea of where to put them.
These lines can extend past your lips if you want to look really old, but don't make them go more than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) past. Be selective and don't make an even pattern.

, With everything you do, remember that to make something three dimensional, you simply need to apply the appropriate highlight and shadow.


Remember that light usually comes from above, so highlight accordingly. Wrinkles are highlighted on the bottom because that's where the light would hit them. At the same time, a wart would have highlight on the top.
You might also want to use a darker or lighter color on a stipple sponge or brush to give parts of your skin a little more texture.

, Use powder on a puff to apply a light coat of translucent powder to your entire face and neck. After that, splash cold water on your face and blot dry with a paper towel or cloth.



Do not rub your face dry. This will set your makeup and let it last a bit longer without coming off on your clothes or hands as much. It will still come off, so be careful.
If you want to look like a woman, after you're done, put on bright lipstick or purple or blue eye shadow, as well as some blush.

, Now that you look like an old person, take care of your old face while you put the rest of your outfit together.


Try not to smile or laugh too much until you're ready to bring your outfit into the world.
When you put your clothes on, be careful not to smear your face. If you're wearing something tight that won't easily wear over your face, put it on before you do the makeup.
For the most part, though, putting on your clothes afterwards works best because you won't accidentally ruin the clothes with your makeup.

",How to Look Like An Elderly Person for Halloween3," Before you put together every aspect of your outfit, there are a few rules of thumb that will help you achieve the right look.


Remember to bring lots of layers, whether it's a on old sweater for men, or a long cardigan for women. Old people are always cold and love their layers.
All of your clothes should look like they've been through the wash about a hundred times. Achieve a convincing and faded look for your clothes.
Either gender should wear a white wig or sprinkle baby powder in their hair to achieve a gray look. Men can consider getting a ""wig"" that makes them look bald. You can at least add highlights to the roots of your hair by rubbing white/gray eyeshadow.
You should think thoughtfully about your outfit, but it should have the appearance of just being thrown on.

, If you want to look like an old person, you'll have to dress the part and to know where to look. The right clothes will make the difference between people loving your outfit and asking what the heck you're supposed to be for Halloween. Here are a few tips:


Ask your grandparents. The first and most obvious place to get the right clothes will be to raid your grandmother or grandfather's wardrobe. A real old person will have real old person stuff.
Only ask your grandmother or grandfather if he or she has a good sense of humor about you wanting to look old. And even if they only let you look and their clothes, the clothes you see can give you inspiration.
Check out thrift stores or garage sales for ""old people"" stuff. You may be able to find a real treasure for almost nothing.

, Dressing like an old man can be easy, but it will require some work for you to find the perfect old man outfit. To look the part, you'll have to think carefully about everything you're wearing, from your hat to your shoes. Here's what to do:


Put on a thin white t-shirt or a t-shirt that mentions their retirement community or bingo league.
The right knitted vest will tie your old man outfit together.
Wear tan, gray, or brown slacks that are way too short, and hike them up even further with a pair of suspenders.
Wear a hat such as a fedora, worn baseball cap, or straw hat. Just a pair of loafers or orthopedic shoes will look great on your feet. Wear brown socks.

, To be the best old lady you can be, you have to have the right outfit, shoes, and accessories. Here are a few things to wear to make your outfit come together:


Wear pants, skirts, or dresses that are a size too big. Their tops should be a little loose and should not fit perfectly. Look through your old house dresses to see what fits.
Wear pantyhose, and shouldn't expose their legs, even if it's ninety degrees outside.
Put on orthopedic shoes or old sneakers. Or if you're going to be a ""spiffy"" old lady, wear a pair of low high heels with a thick heel. Lots of velcro will do the trick.
If you're a woman, wear chunky jewelry and an old reasonably-sized purse. Put foods like muffins and bananas in your purse and periodically offer then to people.

, Your clothes will help you achieve your old person look, but the right accessory or prop will tie your outfit together and will help people recognize your costume quickly. Here are some tips for finding the right props or accessories:


Wear thick, clear glasses.
Bring around a walker or a cane if it doesn't annoy you.
If you're really ambitious, consider getting a hearing aid, or making an earplug look like a hearing aide.
Carry around a bottle of vitamins and offer them to people.
Old people love gardening. Carry around an empty watering pot.

Avoid last-minute decisions.,

Be inspired in your costume idea from other people's picks.",How to Choose a Halloween Costume," Are you sexy? Scary? Funny? Cute? Perky? Angry? Your Halloween costume is a great excuse to project a side of yourself you don't usually get a chance to share if you'd like to ""hide"" behind something really fun, wacky or scary. Or, the costume could emphasize a side of you that everyone already knows and loves well, such as being zany, cheeky or bright.

In finding your own style, think about what you wear on a daily basis and what's comfortable for you. This alone may help you to think of a costume right away. For example, do you usually wear cute skirts? A dress? Jeans? Can these be paired with something a little more exciting to form a costume, such as sticking a cloak over the top of jeans or a witch's hat on top of a dress?;
, If you wear black, you probably wouldn't want to be a fairy, although a dark fairy could be a good option. If you like bright colors, think of pumpkins, elves, fairies, ghosts, rainbows and similar costumes. If you like darker colors, think goth, vampires, skeletons, dark wizards, evil geniuses, etc. However, don't be afraid to mix and match, as it's Halloween and anything goes.

, Are they still something you'd like to build off, perhaps turning an existing old costume into a different costume? You don't have to be something that is exactly like you, but it would make more sense to dress up as someone or something that reflects your personality., What do you like to do? Make a list of the things you enjoy, be it sport, cosplay, cooking, playing games, dressing up, reading, etc. For example, if you like soccer, be a famous soccer player; if you're into a certain TV show, dress up as one of the characters you like most; if you like animals or food, dress up as your favorite pet or dessert. Match the list of options to the items you have available and be creative., Halloween costumes can range from cheap to very expensive, so it's important to have an idea on what you'd like to spend. When choosing, always check to see what's included in the costume, as some costumes will be better deals than others when add-ons are accounted for.


A costume containing, for example, a shirt, pants, hat, wig, and belt is a good deal if you get the lot for a single price. On the other hand, a single dress or costume item could cost the same amount as that deal, so you would need to balance up whether or not it's worth it to you and fits within your budget.
Generally, it's recommended that you be willing to spend around $20-$40 on your costume, as most decent costumes are within that price range.

, Stores have sales all the time for Halloween costumes, especially if it's very close to Halloween. Be sure to check the TV, internet, and newspaper ads for upcoming sales on Halloween costumes. By checking the sales, you could get a great costume for a small price. If there are no sales, try using coupons and gift cards, if you have any., Are you planning on making your Halloween costume? Make sure that you have enough time. You'll need an idea, first of all, so start thinking about a month before and try to allow yourself at least two weeks ahead to make and adjust the costume if you're making your own. Although it seems early, thinking ahead gives you the space to make something that fits well and gives you the chance to run down and buy more fabric or items if needed.

, Try not to buy costumes at the last minute as this will often mean the best costumes are already taken and out of what is left, they may not be in your size or to your liking. However, if you do manage leave the costume until late, read How to make a last minute Halloween costume to remedy things fast., It's important to be prepared to go out in any sort of weather, be it rain, hail or shine. Have a raincoat, poncho and rain boots option that can be thrown over your costume if needed.


Check the weather beforehand, both in the days leading up to Halloween, and on the day itself. This will help you make the right choices about what to wear and whether you can get away with not wearing an overcoat and tights or an umbrella.
If it's hot, don't wear thick leggings, a jacket, or a heavy costume. Avoid layers, and wear something fairly thin. Lighter colors are better than darker ones. Try putting your hair in a ponytail so you won't get extra hot. However, if you need to wear layers (if your outfit is inappropriate), just find another costume.
If it's cold, bundle up. Wear a coat, and wear a shirt under your costume so you won't be chilly. Try wearing boots as well.

, If you're trick-or-treating with some friends, one cool way to wriggle out of being original is to have matching costumes. This can be hilarious for onlookers who see a bunch of the same characters or similar ones coming to their door for trick-or-treating.

Either choose the same costumes or stick to a theme, such as Sesame Street characters. Consult your friends first to agree upon an idea that everyone likes.






Sometimes there are online sales for costumes that include three or four similar costumes.

Stick the decorations where they belong.,
If you feel you must make a decorative statement, find the smallest pumpkin the local market has.,
Remove the lightbulbs from the front porch.,
If, despite all your best efforts, the intrepid little trick and treaters make their way up your path, driveway or whatever excuse for a front yard you have, make merry with them.,
If teenagers (each one likely to demand more candy than the entire night's worth of kids) come trick or treating at your door, turn all the lights off, turn the TV down and pretend to snore and grunt loudly, as if asleep.,
Begrudgingly get into the spirit of Halloween by giving out treats.,
Shut your house up and go out for the evening.",How to Act Like a Grinch for Halloween," Absolutely nowhere. Don't go to the store and don't buy anything. Every good Grinch knows that planetary resources are finite and that misuse for frivolity is wasteful and wanton – Halloween decorations are some of the most pointless gimmicks humankind has ever invented. More importantly, every grinch knows a penny left in one's own coffers is a penny the stores won't ever see. You can award yourself with a badge of parsimony and open an account called ""My Halloween Savings"" and spend Halloween checking your bank statement online.;
, Select the tiniest one there and offer to take it off their hands for nothing; after all, what good will ever come to them from such a minute pumpkin? Then stick it out on your porch or mailbox. Do nothing else. No carving, no candle, no mention of why the puny pumpkin is there at all. It just is and it cost you nothing.


Fill the front yard with ""NO TRESPASSERS"" or ""GUARD DOG TRAINED TO BITE ON SIGHT"" signs. That's a decoration straight from the heart of a grinch.

, On Halloween night, keep all front room lights off. Make like you're not at home apart from ensuring that very festive sounds are emitting from the back of your house. Leave a sign posted to the front saying: ""No entry, lighting busted, danger, keep out, all treats went moldy.""

, You've a number of ways of playing havoc with their naive eagerness:


When they knock at your door, don't open it. You could leave a sign on it saying ""Out of order – use the servant's entrance three houses down"".
Open the door just a crack and shout out ""Who's there?"" Demand to see their ID or you won't open the door any further.
Act offended that they've entered your property. Tell them they're wasting your time and that time is money.
When the kids knock at your door, and they say TRICK OR TREAT!, just yawn ever so casually, select the most obvious costume and ask, ""And just what are you supposed to be?"" Or mock their costumes. If dressed as superman/woman, say, ""Oh, let me guess, batman/woman?"" If dressed as a ghost with a pillowcase over their heads, say, ""Let me guess. Weirdo in a rag? No?""
Pick the smallest kid and yell ""Boo!"" A good grinch is aware that this is character-building treatment; after all, it is Halloween and a good grinch scare is a story a kid can feed off for years to come.

, If they persist and start toilet papering your house, have alarms rigged to go off, all loud and flashing with lights to scare the living daylights out of them. A few strategically placed firecrackers will improve the atmosphere no end to see them off your property promptly.

, Of course, they're grinch treats and so they should involve the attachment of a vegetable to a toothbrush. Handy notes can be included such as ""sugar destroys brain cells"", ""candy rots your tooth enamel"", ""your second set of teeth is irreplaceable"" and ""there is a 100 percent probability that someone you trust will steal your candy stash tonight"".


Another great grinch treat involves making illusory candy. Make this using empty candy wrappers. Simply blow in one end, while holding the other end firmly shut, and a little bubble of air will appear in the middle of the wrapper, making it look like there is a sweet inside! Give away with great delight.

, Avoid the entire event and leave your neighbors to suffer the headache of an annual candy grabbing feast that fails to teach children anything about delayed gratification, dental hygiene or respect for their elders. A real grinch lets others discover for themselves the salutary lessons of indulging children.

Find a few dark shades of eyeshadow.,
Apply a little makeup to the end of the applicator brush.,
Apply the makeup to your skin smoothly.,
Add details.",How to Fake a Bruise1," A dark color of eyeshadow on your skin can look like a very realistic bruise, as if you were just given a nasty bump. See if you can swipe a parent's makeup pallet, or ask permission.


If you want it to look really real, try a combination of dark blue, dark purple and even black to make it look just right.
The makeup should be matte, not sparkly. If your bruise sparkles, it won't look real.;
, Wet the brush very lightly, and color the brush with a thin layer of eyeshadow.

, It's important to go slow and light on the makeup at first. You can always add more. Work the makeup into your skin in a circle, blending it as you go.


Smaller fake bruises usually look better. Go for a bruise about the size of two coins.
Use the brush on the edges of the bruise to smear out the makeup a little and make the bruise look realistic. Don't go too heavy, or it'll look fake.

, Depending on what kind of story you want to use to explain your fake bruise, you might want to add some extra details to the bruise to get it to look real. You can add little cuts, scrapes or extra coloration to the bruise.


Try rubbing some red blush around the edges for a raw, reddish look after you've achieved the level of darkness you want. This will look like you grazed yourself against something rough.
Add a little yellow around the outside if you want it to look like an old bruise.
Cuts are usually harder to pull off. Use a fine-tip red pen if you want to try.

Get a palette of grease paint or sweat-resistant costume paint.,
Use a makeup sponge.,
Get out something to blot with.,
Dab some bright red on the end of the sponge.,
Blot excess paint off.,
Dab the paint lightly onto your skin.,
Layer some blue over it.,
Add other colors for detail.",How to Fake a Bruise2," If you want to make a really real looking bruise, costume paint is the way to go. When you buy a simple palette of colors, you'll have lots of options for making bruises that look so real everyone will believe you.

, Most costume makeup palettes will come with makeup sponges, instead of applicators or other brushes. These are the best ways for applying makeup to look like a bruise.If you don't have one, you can use part of a large, soft, yellow sponge that you might use for washing the car or some other purpose. Ask your parents if one is available., When you have your palette, put it on some newspaper and have some paper towels or other rags that you can use to blot the makeup with while you're working. It's important to be really light with costume makeup so that your bruise doesn't look fake.

, Take one corner of the sponge and dab it in a lighter matte color of red. New bruises have the most blood in them, so this color is appropriate for a recent bruise, or a very severe one.


These makeups are ready to go out of the package, or might require a little amount of water to soften them up. Always follow the instructions that come with them.

, After getting some paint on your sponge, dab it once or twice on the paper towel, or on the rag that you've got with you. You don't want to apply too much, because it'll be difficult to get off if you do.


Some pros use a plastic mixing palette to help do this. If you have access to one, that'd be great to help you dab and mix colors.

, Use the sponge and blot very gently at the spot you want to look like a bruise, going in a circle. You'll only need to blot 2-4 times to get enough paint onto the area to look effective. Be careful not to overdo it.


The sponge helps to make the paint look uneven and spotty, like it came from under your skin.

, With another corner of the sponge, use a little light blue color and blot a very tiny amount over the top of the redness. Take some paint on the sponge, blot it on the paper, and apply it to your skin as before, but a little more lightly.


While this might seem strange, the little capillaries in your skin will sometimes show up blue in some bruises, which is why they turn dark eventually. A little blue helps it look real.

, If you want the sponge to look a little older, you can apply a small amount of greenish color, or yellow, around the outer edge of the bruise as you did the other colors.


Be extremely light. Sometimes, a little red and blue is enough to make the bruise look fine. Don't overdo it with the makeup.

Pick a variety of colors.,
Draw a circle on a piece of paper and start filling it in.,
Apply the dust onto your skin.,
Apply more layers until it looks real.",How to Fake a Bruise3," It will look a lot like an older, more healed bruise if you use a regular pencil, but you can use a variety of colors if you want to make it more exciting.


Use regular gray pencil lead, as well as dark blue and purple for your bruise.

, Using the flat side of the pencil lead, rub it on the paper rapidly, coloring it in quite darkly to create a small pile of colored dust that you can put on your skin. Even if you think you've got enough, keep going until you've got a good pile.


Repeat this process with each pencil, creating a separate pile for each. If you try to make one circle, it'll all blend into a kind of brown color which won't look real.
Instead of using regular paper, get a piece of sandpaper to rub the pencil on, so you can get dust without having to waste as much of the pencil.

, Get a little dust on the end of your finger and rub the dust in a circular pattern onto the spot you want to look bruised. Blend out the edges gently to make it look realistic.


If you only use a little, it'll flake off pretty easy. Keep rubbing it in to get it to stick. Make sure you use enough.

, It's usually best to start with the colors and then go over the top with the graphite pencil to make it look as blended and realistic as possible.


Start with the red colors, then start adding darker tints, such as purple and blue, to the bruise. Go over the top with the graphite when you're finished, blending out the edges.
This always will depend on your skin tone and a variety of factors. Use your judgment and play around until it looks like a real bruise.

"

Use basic colored markers.,
Start in the center with the reddest color.,
Add layers of other colors.,
Blend the colors together.",How to Fake a Bruise4," Pick a few non-permanent markers that look like a good bruise color. Dark reds, blues and purples are all good choices. Use a brownish yellow (or yellow and brown) marker for the outside edges, as well.


Make sure to not use metallic or glitter markers, which will look obviously fake when you get them onto your skin.
Highlighters give a great yellow-bruise look as well. Use a highlighter instead of a yellow marker, if you've got a highlighter on hand.

, Draw a small circular-shaped shape in red at the center where you want your bruises to be, using a very small amount of marker on your skin. It's easy for this to look like the least authentic of all the fake bruises, so go easy on the marker.


Use little dots of color and blend the colors together later. It's not important that it be bruise-shaped right now. Just get the colors on your skin.

, Real bruises aren't just one color, but a variety of weird little marks. Go over the red with darker colors to smooth it out, using little dabs of the other colors you're using over top of the red circular shaped area. Go around the outside of the shape with the yellow when you're finished, blending everything outward.

, Smear the colors to make it look more bruise-shaped and realistic. Get one of your fingers wet and immediately rinse the area a little, blending the colors in. This helps to make it look a lot more realistic.

Pick a good spot.,
Apply the bruise as realistically as possible.,
Cover the bruised area.,
Fake an injury.,
Reveal your fake bruise.,
Come clean eventually.",How to Fake a Bruise5," If you want your bruise to look real, you've got to pick a good spot for it. Some places don't actually bruise that much, so you've got to pick a good fleshy place on your body, or a place where you might be injured. The best places for fake bruises are usually:


Your forearm.
Anywhere on your leg.
Your forehead.
Your chest or shoulder.
Don't put a fake bruise near or around your eyes.

, It's fine to experiment and play around, but if you're really going to fake it, you've got to make it look real. Spend some time getting it right and playing around with different color combinations to get the best look possible for your skin tone.


Don't make the shape too circular. If it looks like a perfect circle, it'll be obviously fake. Real bruises are jagged and oddly shaped.

, If you want someone to really believe you've got a nasty bruise, you'll need to do a little acting and not spoil it too soon. To play your prank the right way, cover the bruise with your clothing or under a hat until you're ready to reveal it.


Pencil graphite bruises are difficult to cover up without them rubbing off. Those types of bruises are typically best for just showing off quickly as a goof. If you want to fake it, try using makeup or another technique.

, Real looking bruise in place? Check. Unsuspecting friend in sight? Check. Wait for a good moment, when you're both doing something physical or playing in some way, then fake an injury. Wait until your friend comes close and then grab the area with the fake bruise suddenly and start hollering.


Really play it up. Pretend that you're in pain and look angry. It's a good way to build some sympathy or freak out the victim of your prank.
If you don't want to go through all the acting trouble, you could always just whip out your bruise and say something like:

""You should see the other person.""
""I got this working on an oil rig.""
""I fell off my dad's motorcycle.""



, After faking it or coming up with your great excuse, it's time for the big reveal. Pull up your sleeve and groan loudly, saying, ""Ahh, look at that! It hurts!"" or you could play it tough and say, ""Doesn't even hurt.""


Show it quick and then tuck it back away so your friends don't have time to closely inspect it and see that it's not real.
If accused of using sparkly eyeshadow for your bruise, claim that you were embarrassed and tried to cover the bruise up with makeup that had sparkles in it.

, After you get your friends going, a good extra part of the joke is to take your finger and make the bruise ""disappear."" Wipe part of it off, then look at it like you're confused, then say, ""Gotcha.""


It's not usually good to keep up a joke like this for very long, especially if your excuse is about fighting or being hit by someone. Jokes are one thing, but tell the truth eventually.
Use warm water and soap to get the eye shadow off when you're done. Water won't do. You may also use eye make up remover.

Apply fake blood.,
Get your costume looking right.,
Act zombie-like.",How to Look Like a Zombie," You can use makeup to create the illusion of a deathly pallor. A white/grey, purple or green tint works well for most people. Go to the drugstore and look for under-eye concealer or foundation base in these colors. Also purchase some dark eye shadow, eyeliner and baby powder.


Apply the base over your entire face and down your neck to get that unhealthy pallor.
Get directly under a light source and start using eye shadow to accent sunken areas of your face, such as your eye sockets and around the mid-way of your cheeks. Find shadows and darken those a lot.
Black out your eyes completely, but keep it under control. Make it look like your eye sockets have shrunken in about an inch. Get darker towards the middle and inside corners of the eyes, making sure to accent natural shadows but a bit more darker. (you can even try a darker gray shade; this sometimes works better for a realistic effect than black).
Use baby powder on your face to make your skin look dull and dead. Put a lot on so it looks like you're pale and dead and use some colors like pale light green or grayish-green eye shadow and apply it in some parts of your face and around the areas you had darkened. Lighten the color of your eyebrows.If you want to be a zombie you have to look as realistic as possible.
Apply solid red lipstick on parts where later you will apply your 'fake blood' on your lips and apply some dabs of purple or grayish or maroon lipstick to make it look like as if the blood is a bit dried and look more realistic.
If you want or can afford you can purchase contact lenses with the scary eyeballs. Well, most people think it is unnecessary to have them and any ways you can look scary enough even without these lenses but it's up to you to decide. There are many people who didn't use these on Halloween so there's no need to worry if you are not buying.;
, Try to make your hair look like you just rolled out of a grave.You can also use a lot of hair oil to make your hair look greasy.


Backcomb it at the roots. You can also apply hairspray, then use a small teasing comb or brush to tease your hair (brush hair in the ""opposite"" direction toward the roots). Do this in small sections. Your hair will stay messed up (or in place) if you use hair oil and when you use other cosmetics on your hair (such as powder or your fake blood on your hair) it will come out easily in the end of the day when you take a shower.
Apply baby powder. Rub some baby powder into your hair to make it look grey and ashen.
If you have long hair, you can either leave it down or pull it into a messy up-do or even rub your head against your pillow. An extremely crooked ponytail, ratty braids or a falling-apart bun look appropriately disheveled.
Try starting with bedhead. If you're going to dress like a zombie first thing in the morning, try washing your hair right before you go to sleep the night before. Sleeping on wet hair will automatically make it look wild and mussed, and it might even get pushed far to one side like you've been lying in a grave. Or just not brush your hair when you wake up.

, For one fluid cup (probably more than you'll ever use), do this:


1 1/2 cups of corn syrup. Do not use pancake syrup, which can make the blood go a bit gold.
1-2 tbsp of red food coloring.
Some chocolate syrup, like the kind you put on ice cream (not a ""shell"" type).
A couple small drops of blue or green food coloring, for color preference. This will give your ""blood"" a deeper, more realistic red.
Mix well and add small amounts of water until desired consistency/smearing factor is achieved.
An alternative mix uses honey for thickness and stickiness instead of corn syrup, washing-up liquid (dish soap) (e.g. Fairy Liquid) and red and blue food coloring. The washing-up liquid helps the blood wash out of your clothes later. Play around with the ratio of honey to washing-up liquid to get the right consistency - different brands vary. Be warned, though - pine-scented dish soap isn't very tasty, so if you're putting this mix in your mouth, use a minimal amount!
To get a more paste-like or thicker consistency, petroleum jelly works very well. Just mix the food dyes in, or used a crushed maroon or red eyeshadow.

, Here's the fun part, unless you get sick easily. Go nuts.


Give yourself some wounds of some kind. Dribble blood into your hairline and let it run down your face, arms, legs and hands.
If you want bullet holes, get a really black marker and draw holes on your shirt. Then dribble down some fake blood around it.
For the ""I just got done munching on the neighbor"" look, pour a fair amount of blood into your hand, and then ""eat"" it, to get a nice mouth smear. Then, put some more in your mouth (this mix is non-toxic, unlike some others) and let it dribble down your chin and throat.
If you have time, allow some blood to dry a little (about 10 minutes) and then re-apply another layer differently, to get a nice effect.
Try to go for dark colored fake blood, as bright red blood will give you a cartoony appearance.

, Here are the basic steps for getting your clothes properly trashed.


Go outside and roll around in dirt. Try to find some mud and roll in it.
While applying fake blood, make sure you're messy, and get it on your clothes. This stuff runs and seeps in quite well and looks extremely convincing.
Use a knife or other pointed implement (carefully!) and rip holes into your costume.

, Zombies are slow, stiff, dim-witted, can't talk well, if at all, and crave human flesh.


Make moaning and gasping sounds when you breathe through your mouth. It adds great effect. Your jaw should hang slack at most times. If you must make other noises, talk in gibberish or moan louder/higher. Moaning always works.
Shamble, don't walk. Lean forward and almost fall with every step. Adding a limp or dragging one leg works great as well. Swing your arms limply, like you don't ever use them.
When passing people, growl or groan at them and wave your arms. Some higher-level zombies tend to moan for ""brains!!!"" as well. If you want to get some laughs, say ""Hi!"" to some people, and wave. You'll be hilarious. If you want to really freak someone out, go to a movie theater with a zombie movie out (if there is one). In the middle of the movie, where tension is highest, walk across the front of the screen. That will scare at least half the people in there.
Act stupid. The average zombie has an IQ barely above freezing temperature. They will run into walls, trip, fall, and can't work with their hands.

Gather all your supplies and keep them to one side. Allow enough room for your bag and some arm room so you won't knock anything over when you are fiddling with your craft objects.;
, Have it big enough to put your designs on later, but strong enough to carry around all your treats!

, We recommend the traditional Halloween colors - black and orange - but it's up to you. Orange makes a carved pumpkin, black makes a spider, white makes a scary ghost, red makes blood and lime makes slime!

, Let your imagination run wild with design possibilities - why stop at plain colored decorations?

, First, align your felt designs into the right position before attempting to glue them on. This can take away the messy hassle of having to reapply glue and removing an incorrectly positioned felt item. Then, apply a small amount of craft glue to the back of the felt. Make sure to stick down firmly so they won't fall off.

Depending on the effect you want to achieve, you can simply use adult makeup palettes, or you can go with a makeup designed for face painting.

For face painting, you can either use makeup sticks that are like large crayons designed for skin, or you can buy face and body painting palettes that are applied with a brush.
Kids usually have more sensitive skin than adults, so look for a hypoallergenic product or something designed for sensitive skin.
Try to choose makeup colors that complement the color of the costume. For instance, if the costume is pink, blue, or purple, any of those colors in makeup will look great with the outfit. If the costume is green or yellow, opt for one of those two in makeup shades.;
, Many craft stores and costume shops sell face painting stencils that make it easy to create intricate designs with makeup. You can also create your own stencil by drawing a design on paper and cutting out the spaces you want colored in.

To use a stencil, press the stencil against the face in the area you want to draw. Dampen a sponge with water and press it into your makeup palette color of choice.
Blot the sponge over top of the stencil to fill in the open spaces with makeup.
You can also do a base color underneath and put the stencil over top in a darker color., Instead of using a stencil, you can also create your own fairy makeup design. To achieve this, you can use either the brush and palette makeup or the makeup stick to draw butterfly or fairy wing shapes around each eye.Start with a darker color, such as blue or green. Begin drawing at the inner corner of one eyebrow.
Draw a rounded line up and out toward the hairline. Stop when you get there, and then connect a new rounded line going around the eye.
Come halfway under the eye, make a V, and continue the design down the cheek, stopping at the bottom of the ear. Now connect this with the original starting point at the inner eyebrow.
Now retrace the inside of this pattern with a coordinating color. Repeat for the other eye.

, A great makeup job always starts with a clean, dry face. If your face is dirty, sweaty, or oily, then the makeup won’t have a good base to stick to, so it won’t be as noticeable and won’t last as long.

Wet your face with some warm water.
Lather a small amount of facial soap in your hands and rub it on your face using circular motions with your fingers. Use a gentle cleanser that doesn’t contain alcohol.Use warm water to rinse the soap off your face.
Pat your face with a soft and absorbent towel. Don’t rub or scrub, as this can damage your skin.When your face is still slightly damp, apply your favorite moisturizer.

, To help your makeup really pop and last longer, apply a thin layer of primer to your eyelids. This can be a specific eye primer, foundation, or a layer of eyeshadow in a neutral color.

To apply primer or foundation, use your finger to rub a small dab of cream over your upper eyelid and just below your eye.To apply eyeshadow as a primer, choose a light neutral, such as a cream color, and apply the shadow all over your eyelid and below your eye with a brush.

, The colors you choose should match your dress. You can either use multiple shades of a single color, or you can blend multiple complementary colors for a subtle rainbow effect.

If you choose a single color, pick shimmery eyeshadows in a light, medium, and darker shade of the same color.
Good color combinations include pink, blue, and purple,or green and yellow.

, No matter what color scheme you're working with, apply a medium-shade eyeshadow to your eyelid below the crease. Use an eyeshadow brush to apply a thin layer.

For instance, if you're working with purples, apply a medium-purple.
If you're working with green and yellow, apply a medium green shade.
If you're working with blue, pink, and purple, apply a medium pink.

, With an angled brush, apply a darker shade to the crease of the eye, which is the semicircular area just above where your eyeball ends. At the outer corner, use this same darker color to make a V-shape in the corner of your eye.Swirl your brush around in the eyeshadow and tap the brush to remove excess. You can always add more later if necessary.

Use a dark purple if you're working with purples.
Use a dark green if you're working with green and yellow.
Use a dark blue or purple if you're working with blue, pink, and purple.

, To help make your eyes pop and look bigger, use a white eye liner pencil and trace a thin line following your lower lash line. Try to get as close to the lashes as possible.Take an angled brush and dip it into the lightest eyeshadow color you're using. Trace a thin line below the white eyeliner line. Follow the natural curve of your eye and extend this color toward your temple., Use either a liquid or pencil eyeliner in black or dark brown. Trace a thin line across your upper lid, as close to the lash line as possible.


When you get to the outer corner of your eye, extend the eyeliner at a slight upward angle toward your temple. Once you’ve extended the eyeliner by one-half to one inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) beyond your eye, you can experiment with different curls and swirls.Swirl the end of the eyeliner line into an upward swirl toward your eyebrow. You can simply curl the end to give it an elegant curve, or continue swirling to make the eyeliner into a spiral.
You can also make another branch off the eyeliner to make another downward facing curve or spiral. Branch off either from the corner of your eye, or closer to the end of the original eyeliner extension.

, Use black or dark brown mascara to give your lashes more volume. With the wand, start at the base of your top lash line and zig zag the wand back and forth as you pull it up toward the tip of the lashes. Repeat three or four times, or more for even fuller lashes.Repeat with your bottom lashes as well. Don’t apply more than two coats, because you don’t want to add too much volume to the bottom lashes.

, Use an eyeliner or brow pencil in a color that complements your fairy makeup (such as dark green, red, or blue). Trace the natural shape of your eyebrows with the pencil.

With a clean mascara wand or brow brush, brush the color through your eyebrows, sculpting them into their natural shape.Then, take a light eyeshadow or highlighter and brush on a small amount just below your eyebrows to highlight your brow bone. Use a brush to blend it in. # Apply glitter. Use a brush to apply glitter to your temple and along your hairline toward the center of your forehead. Repeat on the other side.You can also apply glitter to your shoulders, collar bones, and over top of your eyeshadow.
To help make the glitter stick and last longer, apply a light mist of hair spray to your skin before applying the glitter., Use a light pink blush with lots of shimmer or glitter. Use an angled blush brush and apply the blush along your cheekbones.

Blow off the excess and blend the brush into your skin.

, To finish off the glittery and sparkling makeup, apply a coat of light pink lip gloss.You can also use your favorite lipstick, and then add a thin dusting of glitter on top.


To make your lips match your eyes perfectly, put a small amount of lip gloss on your lips, then use a brush to apply one of the eyeshadow colors on top of the gloss. Use your finger to blend the eyeshadow into the lip gloss.

, There are a number of accessories you can use to enhance fairy makeup and add more glitter, shine, and definition to the look. These include rhinestones on your skin and false eyelashes, both of which can be applied with eyelash glue.

To apply jewels and rhinestones to your face, dip a cotton swab or small brush into the eyelash glue and dab a small amount onto the flat back of the rhinestone. Then, press the rhinestone against your skin for a few seconds, until the glue holds. Apply rhinestones around or under your eye, above your eyebrows, or on your cheeks.
To apply false eyelashes, apply a small amount of glue to the inner rim of the eyelashes. Then use your finger or tweezers to apply the eyelashes to your upper eyelid, as close to the lash line as possible.
You can also body stickers to enhance the look. For fairy-like stickers, look for swirls and designs that match the color scheme you’ve chosen.

Rinse with warm water, then pat (don't rub) your face dry with a towel. Avoid putting on moisturizer or sunscreen. These products might cause latex-based makeup to slide off.


Pull your hair back. If you have long hair or bangs, keep it out of your face while you work. Put it up into a ponytail, and clip stray hairs out of the way with bobby pins or a headband.
If you're a guy, you may want to shave before applying any make-up or prosthetic. Latex and gelatin can get stuck in the hair, making it them quite painful to remove.;
, Liquid latex and gelatin are two substances you can use to create really cool zombie effects - like open wounds, bloody gashes, bite marks and broken noses. Although they might sound intimidating or overly complicated to use, both liquid latex and gelatin are actually surprisingly easy to work with. An explanation of how both products work can be found in parts three and four of this article.


If you do decide to work with either liquid latex or gelatin, they will need to be applied at this point in the make-up process, that is, before you begin working with face paints.
However, if you decide these products are too much work or you don't have time to find them, just skip to the next step. You can still create a hideously decayed zombie look without them!

, Using a soft makeup or stippling sponge, dab the white all over your face. Then blend it in small, light motions until your whole face is covered in a thin layer of makeup. Allow it to dry completely.









Create a mottled effect by subtly applying a second color over the white. You can go with grey for an ashen, decayed effect, red or purple for a bruised effect or green and yellow for a gangrenous effect.
Use the best quality face paint you can find. Cheap, low-quality face paint will not blend well and is bad for your skin. Try to get your hands on some high-quality stage make up - it can usually be found in good costume stores.

, Dark, sunken eyes can help you look dead, violently injured, sleep-deprived, or all of the above!









Outline your lids with dark pencil eyeliner, then smudge it outward. Then use black or brown eyeshadow or face paint to fill in the dark circles beneath the eyes and around the eyelids.
Blend around the edges with purple and red paint or shadow to create the illusion of freshly-bruised skin, or with green and yellow for an older looking bruise.

, Zombies are often pretty emaciated looking - good brains can be hard to come by you know! You can achieve this sunken in effect by sucking in your cheeks and lightly blending some black powder or paint into the hollows. This will highlight your cheekbones.








, Apply black lipstick or face paint to your lips for a dried-out, dead look. Also emphasize the creases around your mouth with some dark, shadowy lines.








, Use a small paintbrush to paint thin, zig-zagged lines in blues and purples all over the face to create popping veins. Take a dry stippling sponge (or some other coarse sponge) and dip it in red face paint. Draw the sponge lightly over the skin to create a bloody-looking scratch.








, You can buy fake blood at most costume stores, or you can make your own non-toxic version simply by adding some red food coloring to corn syrup. For all the fake blood you'll ever need, mix one cup of corn syrup with one or two tablespoons of red food coloring. For darker, more realistic looking, you can also add one or two drops of blue food coloring.









Apply the blood to your hairline and let it drip down your face, or cup some blood in your hand and dip your mouth in to make it look like you just fed!
Use a toothbrush for blood spatter. Put some fake blood onto a toothbrush, aim the bristles at your face, and run your finger over the bristles from bottom to top.
Create a dripping blood effect. Dip a sponge into the fake blood and squeeze it over your skin. The blood should run into a natural-looking drizzle.

, Zombie contact lenses - which are typically very pale blue or white - can really up the scare-factor of your costume. Find such contact lenses online or at costume stores.

, The undead aren't particularly concerned with personal hygiene, so washing their hair isn't a priority. If you want your locks to look limp and lifeless, rub a generous amount of conditioner through them. You can do this before or after you apply your makeup.


You can also make your hair look messy and unkempt (for that ""just out-of-the-coffin"" look) by teasing or backcombing the hair using a small comb. Spritz with hairspray to hold in place.
Sprinkle baby powder into your roots to achieve a graying, ashen effect.

, Like the rest of their bodies, zombies' teeth are typically rotting and decayed. Of course, it's possible to buy fake teeth at the costume store, but these can be awkward or uncomfortable to wear and prevent you from talking or eating properly. Overcome this problem by (temporarily) staining your teeth using water mixed with a little brown food coloring.









Swish the the mixture around your mouth and between your teeth, then spit out. Alternatively, you could use red food coloring for a bloody effect!
When you're done, brush your teeth with a little baking soda to remove the stains and restore your teeth to their original color.

, Perfect zombie make-up should be complemented by an authentic-looking zombie costume. To create a classic zombie costume, get some old dress clothes (second-hand stores are great for this) and do whatever you can to rip and dirty them. Go at them with a scissors, roll them in the mud, give them to the dog to chew on - the scruffier they end up looking, the better.


Create bullet holes in your clothing by making circular marks with black permanent marker, then dribble or splatter fake blood around the edges.
The great thing about zombie make-up is that you can wear it with any costume to instantly zombify it. Use your creativity to come up with a zombie version of whatever boring Halloween costume you were originally thinking of -- become a zombie ballerina, a zombie tourist or a zombie pirate!

, Liquid latex is good for achieving a generally deathly look, as well as building up wounds or other facial deformities.


You should be able to find it at seasonal Halloween supply stores, or at beauty supply chains.
Choose a color that looks appropriately pale and decaying.

, Stretching out your skin as you apply latex ensures that you won't have any accidental blank patches. Additionally, it will leave you with some decidedly creepy wrinkling when the latex dries.









Gently spread or stretch the area of skin you're painting. It's best to do this technique one area at a time (i.e., forehead, one cheek, chin, etc.).
Using a clean paintbrush or makeup sponge, apply a thin layer of liquid latex to the area in small stippling motions. Keep your strokes light and short.

, You can use these techniques to make the face look misshapen, or lay the groundwork for a scabbing ""wound.""









Apply another layer of latex to ""build"" your make up. Creating light layers of latex, instead of smearing on thick amounts, creates even coverage with minimal clumping.
Mix a little bit of uncooked oatmeal with the latex, then apply in one or two small areas on the face. This is great for a gangrenous or scabby look.
Put single-ply tissue between latex layers. Get a piece of toilet paper, and separate the sheets so that you have a single ply. Rip the edges until you have the shape and size you want. Hold it over an area with a base latex layer already underneath it, and paint another layer over it. It will help disguise the smoothness of your skin with a rotting texture.

, By selectively ripping parts of the liquid latex, you can put wide gashes or small lacerations into your new skin.


Use scissors. You should carefully snip the latex until you create the wound you want. Be careful not to nick your skin!
Use a toothpick. Simply stick it into the liquid latex and drag it through for a gaping wound.

, Dip a clean paintbrush or makeup sponge into fake blood, and gently dab it into your gashes or over your oatmeal portions.








, For the right consistency, use about 1/3 cup (80mL) of water per packet of gelatin.


Color the gelatin. Use a few drops of food coloring for an unnatural tone, or add a bit of liquid foundation in a tone close to your skin for a flesh-like look.
Cut the gelatin into cubes. Store it in a bowl or resealable plastic bag.

, If you heat it to boiling, you'll break down the structure of the gelatin. Put it in a bowl in the microwave and heat in 10-second intervals, until the cubes have softened and become slightly gooey.

, Using a popsicle stick or tongue depressor, glop the gelatin onto the area. As it begins to dry and re-harden, use the stick to pull up small, stretchy threads — this will create more texture around the wound.








, If you're still using a makeup sponge on other parts of your face, be careful to steer clear of the gelatin areas.

, Start by taking a water-based green face paint and applying it to your face with a large brush. This paint should be a light green color and not too thick so you can add shades and textures to it. The paint should come out looking sheer -- it will thicken later.


After you've applied the paint with the brush, you can buff it with a second brush. Use a large brush to gently even out the paint by brushing it in small circular motions, helping to avoid any crease lines that may appear as the paint dries.
If you'd like to add fake warts or texture to your face, you should apply a prosthetic wart or puffed cereal to your face using spirit gum or special glue for applying warts.

, Use the same large brush to paint your neck just a bit further past the place where your neck will be covered by your wardrobe. This will keep your witch look consistent -- you don't want the authenticity to be ruined if your natural skin tone shows below your chin.

, Use a foundation brush to cover the insides of your ears with green paint. This may tickle a bit, but it will make you look more realistic. Even if your ears will be covered by your hair, making them green will be more authentic.

, Use the same foundation brush to gently apply the paint just below your hairline, so your natural skin tone doesn't peek through above your head. Just apply the paint around the outline of your hair, taking care not to cover your hair in green paint.

, Find a green cream stick with a slightly gold tint to cover the area below your eyes. You won't be able to reach the area with the thick brush you used to color the rest of your face. This will help offset your eyes. You can use a sponge to color down the gold tint to create a metallic, shiny tone. You can then dust off this color with a pound brush.

, Now take a sponge and color down the green paint by applying a light yellow tone all over your face. First, dab the area below your and above your eyes. Then, cover your entire face with the yellow tone and then dust it off with a powder brush to smooth it into the green base paint. This will make your face look more eerie and glowing and will add substance to the plain green color you began with.


Apply a thin brush with a yellow-green tint over your face to add more of a highlight to your skin.

, Line the outside of your lids with a dark purple shade that is almost black. Draw the line along your eyelid crease and connect it to the outside of your eyelid. Then, add a darker gold shade to your lids to make them pop out more. Line the bottoms and tops of your lids with black liner. For a more extreme and spooky look, you can use dark red liner instead.

, Apply the same purple shade to your cheeks and temple to create a hollowed look. Apply it in the same place where you would apply blush. You can also apply it along the jawline.

, Witches have dramatically arched brows, so find the natural arch of your brow and accentuate it with a black eyebrow pencil by raising it up a bit and extending your brow a fingernail's length past its natural length.

, Apply green lipstick to your lips and then cover it with green lip liner . After that, line your lips with black liner. You can even draw short vertical black lines on your lips to create creepy cracks.

, Even out your face by brushing out any uneven areas and apply eyeliner with a black brush again after the eye makeup has dried a bit. If you'd like to apply fake eyelashes, you can do so now, or you can just apply some thick lengthening mascara. Once the paint dries, you can let down your hair and prepare the rest of your wicked witch costume.

",How to Apply Witch Makeup2," Use a brush or sponge to apply foundation and concealer to your face. You can choose a color a few shades lighter than your actual skin to create a pale and haunting look. If you set your base makeup with powder, your makeup will stay longer.

, To create sexy eyes, apply a shimmery gold or silver shadow to your lids. Then, offset the color by applying black from your lid to your crease. For a more dramatic look, you can extend the shadow past the outer edges of your eyes and even make it arch up at the ends.


Apply black eyeliner to your top and bottom eyelids.
Either apply a thickening black mascara or just add fake eyelashes to your eyes.

, Use a black eyebrow pencil to exaggerate the arch of your brows and to extend them a bit past their natural length.

, Use bronze makeup to brush below your cheekbones, making your cheeks look sunken and spooky. For a more dramatic look, you can use a green shade instead. If you make a fish-face, it'll be easier for you to find the place where you should line your cheeks.

, First, line and fill in the lips with neutral lip liner. Then, apply a sexy shade of red lipstick that stands out against your skin tone. A darker red would work better than a lighter red. To make your lips look even more luscious, cover them with a shimmery clear gloss.


You can even line your lips with a black pencil for an added effect.

, Use a black eyeliner to create a black mole below your lips, to the right or left of your chin. Just draw a tiny point and then twist the pencil around it to make it rounder and larger.

Enjoy!

",How to Roast Pumpkin Seeds," You could use your hands, a large spoon, or some object from a carving kit.;
, It's not that easy. One way to do it is to put the combined seeds and flesh in a strainer and run water through it as you rub the seeds between your fingers, separating them from the flesh.

,, water You can choose to discard the pulp if you desire. See Tips for more info.

, The salt water deactivates enzyme inhibitors in the seeds; those enzyme inhibitors can irritate your stomach, and removing them allows the production of more vitamins in the seeds. Many traditional groups like the Aztecs soak pumpkin/squash seeds in salt water before dehydrating them. Many people also find that doing this dramatically improves the flavor of the seeds.Fill a large bowl about 2/3 with water.
Add salt to the water until it is saturated.
Place seeds in the salt-water solution and let soak for 8 to 48 hours.
Dump all of the water out of the bowl.

,, This is where you can get as creative as you want. Here are some ideas:

Sprinkle with additional salt

Toss every cup of seeds with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of vegetable, olive or canola oil until the seeds are coated; it will help additional seasonings stick
Substitute melted butter for the oil
Season with old bay/crab seasoning, chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, Cajun seasoning, and/or other strong flavors for a savory snack
Season with sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg for a sweet snack
Toss the seeds in sauce like hot sauce, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, etc.
Consider other powder seasonings like garlic powder, steak seasoning, pasta spice mix, etc...

, Make sure there is only one layer of seeds.

, There are several ways to do this:



Broil' - Preheat your oven to the ""Broil"" setting, so only the top element is activated. Place the sheet into the preheated oven. Watch carefully, as different ovens broil at a variety of temperatures. This should usually take no more than 10 minutes. When the top of the seeds has turned brown, you can do one of two things based on your texture preferences: (a) Remove the pan now for a slightly crispy and nutty texture, or (b) remove the pan and flip the seeds over. Replace back in the oven and toast another 10 minutes, or until brown. This yields a very crispy and salty seed.
Bake - Preheat the oven to 163º C or 325º F and leave the pumpkin seeds in there until browned (about 20-25 minutes total), shaking them around every 5-10 minutes to prevent burning.
Microwave - Put the seeds in the microwave for 2 minutes. Take them out, stir, and put them back in for 1 minute. Keep stirring them after every minute in the microwave until they're crispy enough.

Pan - Roast them in a pan, constantly shifting them around so that they roast evenly and don't stick to the pan.

, Hot pumpkin seeds can burn your skin.

Gather your materials.,
Trim off the excess fabric from the zipper.,
Trace the zipper.,
Pull apart a cotton square.,
Mix red lipstick with petroleum jelly.",How to Do Zipper Face Makeup1," Creating the zippered face makeup look is easy, but you do need some special items to do it. Before you get started, you will need:Zipper
Scissors
Liquid latex
Makeup sponges
Cotton balls, squares, or rounds
Red face paint
Red eye shadow and/or lipstick
Skin safe adhesive
Petroleum jelly;
, Cut off the fabric around the edges of the zipper. Otherwise, it may look quite obvious that you have a fabric zipper glued to your face. After you finish trimming of the fabric around the edges of the zipper, cut the bottom part off of the zipper.








If you will be placing the zipper at an angle on your face, then you may need to trim one side of the zipper to be shorter than another.

, When you have decided where to place your zipper, use your eyeliner pencil to trace the area within the zipper. You should trace a V-shape so that the zipper will look like it is really unzipping your face.Experiment with different placements of the zipper on your face to determine where you want it to go.

, You can use bits of cotton fluff to help you create texture on your skin. This will give your skin a lumpy, bumpy appearance that will be more realistic than smooth red skin.








Pull apart a cotton square, ball, or round and set the cotton pieces aside. You will use them when you apply the liquid latex to your skin.

, Petroleum jelly mixed with a bit of red lipstick will help you to create a shiny finish on your skin. This will make the red textured makeup appear more realistic, as if the wound is fresh.








You can also add in a little black or brown eyeliner or eyeshadow to darken the color.

"
"
Apply a layer of liquid latex to the area inside of the zipper.,
Add some chunks of cotton to create texture.,
Cover the liquid latex with red face paint.,
Use red eyeshadow on your eyelids.,
Glue the zipper onto the outside of the red area.,
Apply the red petroleum jelly over the red face paint.",How to Do Zipper Face Makeup2," When you are ready, apply a layer of liquid latex to the area in between the lines you have drawn. Use a makeup applicator to dab the liquid latex on your skin, while avoiding the areas around your eyes, nose, and mouth.








Do not put liquid latex on your eyelids! It is not okay to use on or near your eyes.

, After you finish applying the first layer of liquid latex, start adding some chunks of cotton to your skin and dab more liquid latex over them. This will give your skin lots of texture to create a more realistic look.








Keep adding cotton pieces and liquid latex until you are satisfied with the results.

, Next, you will need to cover up the lumpy white palette you have created. Use your red face makeup to cover up these areas. You can use multiple colors of red and even some brown or black to create dimension.








For example, you could do a layer of red, and then use some darker red to make some areas stand out more. You could also dab on and blend in some brown and black around clumps of cotton to give them the appearance of blood clots.

, Remember that you do not want to put the liquid latex on your eyes. However, if you have decided to place the zipper so that it is around your eyes, then you will need to make sure that your eyes blend in with the rest of your face.Apply some red eyeshadow to your eyelids and to the areas below your eyelids. You may have to use multiple layers, but this will be the safest way to color your eyelids.
If you are applying the zipper around your mouth, then try wearing some red lipstick that matches the other face makeup.

, When your makeup is complete, you can glue on the zipper. Use some skin safe adhesive to glue the zipper onto the area you traced. Make sure that you use enough glue to keep the zipper in place.







, To finish your look, you can apply some of the red petroleum jelly you created. Apply the jelly to the red areas of your skin to give it a shiny, wet blood appearance.








If the petroleum jelly is too shiny or if you accidentally apply too much, then just use a paper towel to gently dab some of it away.

"
"
Do a patch test.,
Apply a layer of lotion to your skin first.,
Keep it away from your eyes, nose, and mouth.,
Avoid getting the liquid latex in your hair.,
Practice the look.",How to Do Zipper Face Makeup3," If you are allergic to latex, then you should not use liquid latex at all. However, if you are not allergic, then it should be fine. Since the skin on your face is more sensitive than on other areas of your body, it is still a good idea to perform a patch test.To perform a patch test, apply a small amount of liquid latex to the skin on your face, such as on one of your cheeks. After 30 minutes, remove it. If your skin looks normal immediately after and does not develop redness or irritation over the next 24 hours, ten it should be okay to use.However, if you develop itchiness, redness, or any other signs of irritation, then do not use liquid latex.

, Coating the skin on your face with a layer of lotion will help to protect it and make it easier to remove the liquid latex when you are done. Use your usual face lotion to coat your face in a thin layer of lotion., Liquid latex is not safe to put on or near your eyes because of the danger of getting it into your eyes. It is also not safe to put on your lips or nostrils. Keep the liquid latex away from these areas., Liquid latex peels off of your skin easily when you are done, but it will not come out easily if it gets into your hair. You may even end up having to shave off some of your hair to get it out.To avoid having to cut or shave your hair, keep your hair away from the liquid latex.

, It might take a few times to get it just right, and working with liquid latex takes a little practice. Try it out, take photos or videos, and improve upon your design each time you try it.

Remove the seeds.",How to Clean a Pumpkin1," You should do this before purchasing a pumpkin in the store, and again when you get home. You want to buy a pumpkin that is the same color and texture throughout. Darker, mushier portions of the pumpkin indicate rotting.








If you notice some parts of the pumpkin have rotted after bringing it home, cut these parts off with a knife before cooking the pumpkin.;
, If you don't have a vegetable brush, a rough, clean cloth should work. This will help loosen up any dirt and debris, allowing you to easily rinse off any contaminants. You do not need to use water here. You will rinse the pumpkin off later.Pumpkins can be very big, so this takes some patience. Make sure to scrub down the entire surface of the pumpkin.
Make sure not to scrub too hard. You don't want to end up scraping off the skin of the pumpkin.

, You can just use tap water here. Simply run the pumpkin under the faucet in your sink. Make sure to turn the pumpkin as needed to rinse off all sides.If you see any dirt or debris sticking onto the pumpkin, gently rub it off using your fingers or a clean cloth.

, Once you've cleaned the surface of the pumpkin, you slice the pumpkin in half. Slice the pumpkin down the middle using a sharp knife that slices evenly. Be sure to go slow and keep your fingers away from the blade to avoid accidentally harming yourself., A serrated spoon, such as a grapefruit spoon, works great to remove pumpkin seeds. You can also use an ice cream scoop. Scrape the spoon along the inside of each half of the pumpkin. Remove all the seeds from inside.Once you have removed the seeds, your pumpkin is ready to cook.
When carving a pumpkin, you need to make sure the inside walls are very smooth. This is not necessary when cleaning out a pumpkin to cook. Do not worry too much if the sides are uneven or a little mushy. Just make sure to get out all the seeds.

Inspect and rinse your pumpkin.,
Let your pumpkin reach room temperature.,
Carve a hole out of the pumpkin.,
Dig the seeds out with a spoon or your hands.,
Smooth the inside wall.,
Put the bottom back in place and cut out a hole in the top.",How to Clean a Pumpkin2," Even if you're not eating a pumpkin, you should inspect and clean it before carving. You want your pumpkin to be clean before you handle it for carving.Remove any mushy or moldy spots on the pumpkin with a knife.
Rub the pumpkin down with a vegetable brush or a clean, rough cloth. Then, run the pumpkin under water to remove any dirt.

, If you brought your pumpkin from outside, it may be a little cold. Let the pumpkin sit until it's around room temperature. You can use your hand to gauge whether the temperature of the pumpkin matches the temperature of the room. Pumpkins are easiest to carve at room temperature., It's actually easier, and safer, to carve a hole at the bottom of the pumpkin to start, but carving the top is the traditional method. Using the bottom way, you can smooth out the bottom of the pumpkin's inside where you will later set down your candle. This reduces the risk of the candle toppling over, which could cause a fire.








Turn the pumpkin sideways and use a knife to trace a large hole at the bottom of the pumpkin. Your opening should be big enough that you can easily reach inside the pumpkin. Take a small knife and gently cut around the hole, and then use your knife to pry out the bottom.
Take your knife and use it to level out the bottom of the pumpkin. Cut off the excess seeds and strings from the bottom of the pumpkin, striving to cut a neat line. You're trying to create a level surface on which you will place a candle.

, You can now reach into the pumpkin and dig out the seeds. A spoon, particularly a serrated spoon, works best here. If you're using a pumpkin carving kit, you may have received a serrated spoon with the kit. You can also use an ice cream scoop. Some people prefer to use their fingers to dig out the seeds.








Dig out all the seeds using your hands or a spoon. Make sure there are no seeds left in the pumpkin when you're done.
If you're saving the seeds to roast later, make sure to set them in a safe place.

, Use a clay modeling tool, which typically comes with a pumpkin carving kit, to smooth out the inner walls. You can also buy a clay modeling tool at a craft store if you don't have one. Run the tool along the walls of the pumpkin, removing strings and making the walls smoother overall.








After the walls are smoothed out, there will be a lot of strings and goo stuck on the side of the pumpkin. Remove these with a spoon.

, Once you've cleaned out the pumpkin, place the bottom back in place. You should be able to simply press it back into place using your hands. You can then cut another, similar sized hole on the top, near the stem. Your pumpkin is now ready to carve for Halloween."
"
Make sure your work area is safe.,
Cut into the pumpkin slowly.,
Address injuries quickly.",How to Clean a Pumpkin3," When you're working with knives, take care. Make sure your work environment is safe so you avoid injury.Work in a well lit area. You need good lighting to see what you're doing and avoid accidentally cutting yourself.
The surface you're working on should be dry. You should also make sure all your carving tools are dry.

, There is no rush to prepare a pumpkin to cook or carve. Cutting too quickly can easily lead to slip ups and injuries. Have patience when carving a pumpkin and always opt to go slowly. You do not want to get injured while rushing through the carving process.







, Even when taking proper precautions, injuries do occur. If you are injured while cutting a pumpkin, act fast to prevent complications.Use a clean cloth or rag to apply pressure to the injured area. Usually, a cut will stop bleeding in 5 to 10 minutes.
If your cut does not stop bleeding, or if you notice signs like numbness, see a doctor right away. You may need stitches or other medical treatments.

Cut the pumpkin in half to one side of the stem.,
Alternatively, cut the pumpkin across the ""belly."",
Remove the seeds.,
Roast the pumpkin, or cook it according to your recipe.",How to Cut a Pumpkin1," If you want to bake with a pumpkin, learning to cut it properly for roasting or baking is the first step. Basically, you're just going to cut the pumpkin in half, and the easiest way to do this is usually by sitting the pumpkin upright on a steady surface, then cutting straight down the middle.Insert the knife and carefully cut straight down toward the blossom end, stabilizing the pumpkin on a towel. Push firmly, working the knife down through the flesh of the pumpkin. Cut it entirely in half.;
, It's also fine to cut a pumpkin across the middle, though it's a little more difficult to keep the pumpkin stable this way, making it a little more dangerous. Put out a towel, stabilize the pumpkin on it, then cut it carefully.

, Use a metal spoon to scoop out the seeds from the inside before you start baking the pumpkin. Most smaller baking pumpkins won't have a lot of seeds in them to remove, or they might be easier to remove after you've roasted. That's perfectly normal.

, Baking pumpkins can be placed cut-side down in a roasting pan greased with just a little olive oil, then roasted at 350 degree oven for about 40 minutes, or until you can pierce the flesh with a fork easily.


Let the roasted pumpkin cool slightly, then peel off the outside skin and puree the soft flesh inside if you want to make pumpkin pie ultimately.
Check out this article for more information about baking with pumpkins for pies, soups, and other dishes.

Add demon eyes.",How to Carve a Vampire Demon Baby Pumpkin," You will be carving the exact measurements into your pumpkin so you want precision.;
, The bottom third is a good area. Measure where you will place the teeth using the measurements you took.

, Although you have measurements you want the specific shape to fit snugly inside the pumpkin.

, You don’t need to remove the top first to extract seeds--smaller pumpkins like the mini’s don’t have an abundance of seeds so you should have a relatively hollow pumpkin.

, Simply wiping down the inside of the pumpkin should do the trick.

, Make sure the teeth fit snugly and there are no gaps between the teeth and the pumpkin.

, Push each red balled pin into the area above the mouth to give the effect of red, glowing eyes.

Use an appropriate knife.,
Stabilize the pumpkin on a flat surface.,
Insert the point of the knife at an angle.,
Continue cutting around the stem.,
Pull the lid off by the stem.,
Scoop out the pumpkin, then start carving.",How to Cut a Pumpkin2," To get started carving a pumpkin, you need to remove the ""lid"" and hollow it out. For this job, you can usually use any number of basic kitchen knives. A serrated bread knife, a small chef's knife, or any knife with a definite point.


Sharp knives are easier to work with and safer than dull knives. Use caution, move slowly, and stabilize the pumpkin before you get started. While carving can be done by kids, this first part should usually be done by adults.
To carve a pumpkin, you'll need a variety of other tools, which can usually be purchased at Halloween stores. Secret tip: Use a clean serrated dry-wall knife for the detail work.

, Spread out some paper towels or newspaper on the kitchen table, or another sturdy flat surface on which you can work at carving your pumpkin. Opening up the top of the pumpkin can be somewhat dangerous, if the knife slips, so make sure that you've got it stabilized.


Lay out a hand towel and double it over, then put the pumpkin on top of that. This should help to keep the pumpkin from rolling as you cut into it.

, Pick a point about 2-3 inches to one side of the stem, and insert your knife at about a 45 degree angle. Push your knife through until you've penetrated through the flesh of the pumpkin. You'll only need to push it in an inch or two.


In some pumpkins, you may be able to cut straight in from the top, instead of at an angle. Pay attention to the curve of the particular pumpkin that you're cutting into. Remember that you want the lid to sit comfortably on the top of the pumpkin, and not fall in.

, Pull the knife back out, shift it to one side and push it back through, continuing to slowly and carefully cut around the stem in a circle. You can cut several straight lines, cutting a kind of six-sided shape around the outside, or you can try to cut a smooth circle. Both ways work fine.


Sometimes, cutting straight lines will help the lid sit a little better. If you cut a smooth circle, try to carve a notch somewhere, in the back if you like, so that you can fit the lid back on easily.

, Once you've gone around the stem and gotten back to your starting place, grab the lid firmly by the stem and pull upward. With a little elbow-grease it should come loose.


If there's not enough stem to grab onto, use a butter knife or a regular table knife (something that's dull) to pry under the lid and pull it up.
There should be some strands of pumpkin fiber that might tug on the lid, but it should come up pretty easy. Run the knife around again a couple times if it's not coming off.

, Once you've gotten the lid off the pumpkin, you're ready to get your hands dirty. Use a metal serving spoon to scrape out the interior, saving the seeds for roasting pumpkin seeds, if you want. Then design your pumpkin and start carving.


Dab a little petroleum jelly on the inside edge of the pumpkin lid to help keep it from rotting more quickly.Read How to Carve a Pumpkin for some fun templates and more information about carving pumpkins.

Know the rules about costumes.,
Choose your Halloween vacation days wisely.,
Plan your trip well in advance to avoid last minute problems.,
Know beforehand which parks have which Halloween-based attractions.,
Plan on picking out the places you'd like to visit with Fast Pass tickets to avoid waiting in long lines.,
Plan to attend Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party.,
Enter the party the minute the gates open.,
Look for the famous Boo to You parade to be held nightly.,
Trick or treat between 7 PM to midnight.",How to Visit the Disney Parks During Halloween," Disney regulates that in general, adults can't wear Disney-related costumes to the park; the only exception to this during Halloween is if they're attending Mickey's Halloween Party.. If the guest is nine years or younger, they can go in a Disney costume.
, While Halloween only comes once a year on the calendar, Disney doesn't feel the same way. They set up their Halloween season from the middle of September to the first week of November.

, Book everything you'll need, including airline tickets, hotel and restaurant reservations, Fast Pass tickets, and special tickets to the different Disney Park events.

, At Walt Disney World, these attractions are primarily focused around the Magic Kingdom, although others have other smaller attractions. Epcot may have their own pumpkins exhibit, but this exhibit is less well known and so fewer people might look at these.


If you're visiting Disneyland in California, only the Disneyland Park has Halloween events. California Adventure doesn't have any Halloween-inspired events or attractions
Know which of the parks have their Halloween nighttime parades. The Magic Kingdom has their own special parade that differs from that shown during most of the remainder of the year, which Disney calls Boo to You Halloween Parade. But look out for a Disney-inspired ""spooky"" phantom visitor whos a main person to draw a crowd in at all parade times during these nights/season.
If you are a nocturnal person, realize that the fireworks to some of the parks change with this season. Wishes (Walt Disney World in FL) changes along with the fireworks in Disneyland, California.

, Queues tend to be a little long during certain times of the Halloween season, but are shorter when you compare them with the queues during the summer!

, This special ticket isn't included in the cost of your park ticket and must be purchased separately. You can purchase these at the Walt Disney World Ticketing and Guest Services locations, over the phone (at 407-939-5277) or from Disney's Website at disneyworld.disney.go.com/events-tours/magic-kingdom/mickeys-not-so-scary-halloween-party/. Tickets can be mailed to you, printed out on a printer or can be picked up later at the Magic Kingdom Will Call window.


This special Halloween party doesn't happen every day of the season. The event days are generally planned each year throughout September, October, and even early November. According to the 2013 and 2014 dates, there are about 20 dates that this party is generally planned each year, so plan accordingly.
Plan on leaving the park at 7pm Eastern Time (before this time) if you aren't ticketed for the event. For those guests, expect to see a few Disney employees holding up a sign with letters that spell out ""See Ya"" (or See Ya Soon) on items that look like candy corn. All other non-ticketed park guests have to leave before the fun begins. The employees do make a second trip around to escort any remaining guests who haven't paid the separate admission fee out of the park, or who didn't realize that this event was a separate ticket event about 15 minutes into the party., This will give you a head start on researching where you want to start first, so you don't end up wishing you hadn't gotten there first when the remainder of the visitors wander in.

, This Halloween-inspired parade is shown to anyone willing for a fun but spooky time. Although weather has an impact sometimes, most times this parade will happen at about 7 PM. There is an alternate viewing time for people who remain after the first version of Wishes. Look on your guide map for the parade route, however, often this parade will step off from a Frontierland gate and end in Main Street USA about 25 minutes later.


Be careful of Main Street USA. This is an extremely populated area in which spectators look for the Halloween parade, so don't be late! Also, try to avoid spots near Cinderella's Castle if you are planning to get there no earlier than 5 minutes before the parade begins (people start lining up at spots along the parade route well before the parade arrives, as if the parade can be in two places at once; but you can plan accordingly with this knowledge of the parade.)
Look for HalloWishes, Disney Parks' Halloween version of the Wishes Fireworks extravaganza. Although your events list will tell you when, the first airing of HalloWishes usually happens at about 9 PM. Since the fireworks can be seen over top of Cinderella Castle, look for a spot near the Castle. Be prepared to pay a price if seen from the bridge of the train station looking towards the Castle, as employees will push you away from sitting or standing anywhere close to it.

, Trick or treating can be done by both adults and children. Candy and other goodies can be found at multiple locations including at the turnstiles, which is the only place where you can find Halloween-colored Marshmallow Peeps and the Enchanted Tiki Room for ""Craisins,"" and Pinocchio's Village Haus is the only location for Werther's Caramels.




If you have specific dietary restrictions, candy can be switched at City Hall for dairy-free, egg-free, gluten free, nut-free or sugar-free candies including bat suckers, butterscotch buttons, chocolate pumpkins and Jelly Belly treats.An almost complete list of these places can be found on the specialty guide map you'll get when you ask a park employee at the time.
Disney's candy stations are constantly refilled throughout the party, so never expect to run into problems of not finding a certain candy at the station of your choice!


Watch the Disney Villains Mix and Mingle stage show near Cinderella Castle at 8:30 PM, but don't get your hopes up to have a villain sign their autographs..
There is a second showing of this later in the night, but most people will want to attend the first showing.
Dance or twerk with Mike and Sulley at the Monstrous Scream-O-Ween Ball on the Rockettower Plaza Stage in Tomorrowland.Dance at Woody's Happy Harvest Roundup inside Liberty Square's Diamond Horseshoe Saloon. It takes place between 7 PM and midnight on nights when there are no HalloWishes nighttime spectaculars.Look to spot and interact with the ghost-like storyteller who sits in front of The Haunted Mansion every evening.

Seek out healthier alternatives to candy.,
Buy small games, kits or novelty items.,
Purchase entry coupons for local zoos, water parks, movies etc.,
Avoid trick or treating by having a party.,
Give mini-toothbrush sets.,
Spend your time, energy and money on the decorations as the treat.,
Work out compromises.,
Teach your kids to practice moderation.",How to Give Healthy Treats for Halloween," There are many ideas to consider:


Different flavors of popcorn—tie in small cellophane bags with ribbon.
Individual packages of fruit or applesauce—even pudding is a better alternative than candy. These are usually sold in packs of six or four. Just break them up and give an individual pack to each child.
Little packets of organic raisins (sultanas)—but see dentist's concerns below.
Granola (muesli) bars (but watch their sugar content also).
Low-sugar, trans fat-free cookies from health food stores. If these are not wrapped individually, wrap large cookies in cellophane and tape together; make little cellophane bundles of smaller cookies.
Bundle little pretzels in cellophane.
Cheese sticks and wrapped cheese (like Babybel); try cheese cubes for parties.
Small apples and mandarin oranges are possible, but be aware that many parents are wary of fruit due to scares about pins etc. being inserted into them. You could investigate packaged sliced apples in clear wrapping as a compromise. Or make a fruit bowl at home just for your own kids and play games like apple bobbing.

Nuts ‘n bolts—vary seasoning to suit little palates.
Instant spiced apple mix or hot chocolate mix.
Fruit bars—there are many pure fruit bars available now. The thin ones are especially good value and will slip into many treat bags as a filler.
Individual homemade fruit sweetened cookies.
If it's a warm night, fruit juice ice treats might be a good choice, especially for a party.
Plain dark chocolate is better than candy. Make sure it has no cream filling or high sugar content. Some claim chocolate even helps to prevent tooth decay. It has certainly been proven that the antioxidants in dark chocolate are healthy. Purchase small pieces in little packets or package small pieces in cellophane.;
, Instead of candy, look in dollar stores, party stores, toy stores, etc., for cheap, fun playthings. Buy in bulk if possible and repackage into little treat bags. Look for small games that are given out as party treats, but beware giving out tiny toys to tiny tots. Here are some possibilities to look for:


Halloween pencils, pens, erasers
Stickers with Halloween themes
Magic tricks
Joke, puzzle or maze books
Plastic or rubber animals or figurines
Balloons, party whistles
Miniature cars and dolls
Comic books from the quarter-bin at your local comic shop
Cards (playing, baseball etc)
Miniature jigsaw puzzles

, If you have a set amount of children at a Halloween party, you might like to consider giving each child an entry coupon instead of candy. Unless you're bankrolling your neighborhood's Halloween though, you won't be able to use this idea for kids who come to the door!

, Kids can still have all the fun and haunting, but serve healthier food like pizza, dips and pita pieces, and fresh fruit. Focus on the games more than the food and give good non-food prizes. As an added bonus, you know where the kids are. If it's for older kids, expect a lot of loud and scary sounds, very corny jokes and unexpected ghostly antics. Put breakables away in a safe place.

, Maybe this sounds corny, but it is a healthy reminder to kids getting so much candy that brushing their teeth is really important. If you're lucky, you might find Halloween themed toothbrushes. You will probably have more luck with this idea if you give out a treat or toy in addition to the toothbrush. If not, be prepared for being ""tricked.""

, Turn your front yard or porch into a wonderland that kids will marvel at. Use light and sound to greatest effect. Tell visiting kids that the display is their treat. It had better be good though, or you’ll be in for a trick!


This idea can also backfire, as kids usually expect houses decorated for Halloween to give out treats and your big attractive display may have them anticipating a big candy reward. Best bet: decorate like crazy, and give out light treats.

, Instead of banning sugary snacks altogether, try allowing a limited amount or making rules beforehand about how many treats your kids can have each day.


If you're hosting a party, kids may feel deprived if they don't get to go trick-or-treating and you won't give them any candy at all. In addition to healthy treats, fun party games, and spooky decorations, make a small amount of traditional candy available. (It will probably still be less than they'd get if they actually went out.)
Give each child a goody bag with some small toys, a mix of healthy and sugary treats, and a fun toothbrush. For very young children, see if you can find a small book about brushing your teeth to make the toothbrush seem like a better gift.

, Try not to make too big a deal out of the candy. A little candy is better than a long, sad memory of being totally denied treats at Halloween. Talk sensibly with them about diet, health and good eating habits at all times, not just at Halloween, so that they grow to understand the relationship between eating and body health.


Help them to learn that some indulgence on special occasions is okay, as long as they don't consume too much and they accept that treats belong only to very special occasions. Kids are perfect at understanding and your continued support and good example are what they need the most.

, You can go to different stores to find decorations such as candlesticks, spider webs, or Halloween cups and plates. Before you go to Halloween stores, go visit your local grocery store or even the dollar store! They can sometimes have simple decorations that you don't need to spend much money on.

, Will it be Jack-o’-lantern cupcakes? Or just orange and black sprinkles on cookies? Decide what food you want to serve. For drinks, you could buy a red fruit punch, for example.

, You can go to a Halloween store, or even a party store to find Halloween music and sound effects. If you plan on having your party outside, be respectful of your neighbors, and don't blast the music. Also, you should decide on lighting. If you plan on having the party inside, you could turn the lights off and use fake candles or flashlights pointed at the ceiling to create a dim light. If you want the party to be outside, you could use lanterns or fake candles. Try to avoid real candles, because they can be dangerous, especially if children are going to be at the party.

, Some activities are for all ages, while others are for young children or teenagers. One activity for all ages is to try to guess what's in a bag. Have four or five different brown bags filled with foods like peeled grapes, or cold cooked spaghetti. Guests have to feel what is inside the bag without looking, and then guess what the item is inside. Peeled grapes are eyeballs, cold cooked spaghetti is brains, etc. Whoever is closest wins. Other childrens games are ""Mummy Wrap."" Split the guests into equal teams of 4 or 5. One of the team members is the mummy, and has to remain still while the other members wrap the mummy in toilet paper! Limit each team to 3 or 4 rolls. You can purchase bulk toilet paper rolls at Costco or Sam's Club. The winning team is the one who can complete their mummy first, and have no part of them showing.

, Before the party begins, blow balloons up with air, not helium, and then add a prize inside, like a plastic spider ring. Have at least 10 balloons. During the party, split the guests into two equal groups, each with their own bucket. Have the teams stand in two single-file lines, with the bucket next to the first person in each line. Have the balloons scattered in front of them. The first person in each line has to run to a balloon, sit on it until it pops, collect the prize, and then place it in the bucket. Keep going until all the balloons are popped. The winning team is the one with the most prizes in the bucket.

, Also, have glow sticks, vampire teeth, or spider rings available for each guest to have.

, Fill it with candies and prizes like spider rings, vampire teeth, glow sticks, and other spooky surprises!

Suggest that those failing to wear a costume with being covered in fake blood on arrival!

, If you are wanting to throw a killer Halloween Party, you're going to have to have around $200 set aside for all the essentials.

, You'll need decorations, food and drink, and disposable items for eating with. Think of such things as fake spiders, fake webs, pumpkins, lighting, spooky noises, gravestones, etc. for decorating and creating atmosphere.

Search thrift shops. Thrift shops are a great place to search for creepy old stuff at a cheap price.]
Search online stores. Purchasing Halloween supplies online is generally a cheaper way of doing it. Some sites offer special deals like free shipping or ""buy one get one free"", which is a big bonus.







, Fill every nook and cranny with something spooky to scare your guests with! Cover everything with fake spiderwebs. Change all of the light globes and light candles.

, Like Blood drink (fruit punch). Mummy fingers (hot dogs in croissants), Brains (mac+cheese), Fingernails and guts (chips and dip) eyeballs (meatballs or cheese balls) and lots of sweet things.


Some other food ideas: Graveyard cup cakes, mummy hot dogs, witch's finger cookies, red jelly (Jello) and gummy insects platter. If you don't want to do all the cooking yourself, ask some of your friends to help, or have a cooking day the day before. Decorate the food with plastic spiders and cockroaches for an extra spook.







, Make sure it is candy that everyone likes!

, The best party ever wouldn't be the best party without a huge punch bowl! Use an over sized food-safe cauldron to keep with the theme, or you could use a punch bowl picked up from the thrift store. Decorate the punch with pieces of floating fruit and gummy worms.

, A party is bound to get boring if you don't have something to do. Try bobbing for apples, and once everyone has theirs (without eating them or taking bites out of them just caramelize them. Many people would love making them. Other games are Manhunt (which is in-the-dark hide and go seek) Taste test (everyone is blind folded and handed either a candy or a simple food like an Oreo. Every round the food and candy gets harder to describe or recognize.

, For example: Costume, Dance, Fear Factor, and others.

, It would be cool if one of your family members or a friend could dress up and act like a scary character. Then, when your friends arrive, have this person come up to the door, and give them a good scare.


If you're handing out candies to trick-and-treaters while holding the party, have someone responsible in charge of answering the door to these little fiends, as well as for guests, so that the door is under control at all times.

, Try to jump out of a closet or a hiding spot and try to take a picture of their face. Also have scary music or make tapping sounds against the wall or footsteps to add to the creepiness.

, Use this time, before the guests start arriving, to make sure everything is ready and you have your costume in good shape. Turn the music on and wait for the guests to arrive., Use a music player which you can connect a phone or iPod to. This makes it easier if you want to change songs easily or switch devices. A good set of computer speakers should be enough otherwise you could play your music through your TV.

, Once the guests arrive, it's time to reap the benefits of all of your hard work and planning. Have a fantastic Halloween party because you deserve it!

Autumn-themed colors include oranges, yellows, reds, and browns. Using these colors will allow you to keep the pumpkin past Halloween for use as a generic fall decoration.

You can also use broken pieces of gold and silver leaf to create a more aged, visually interesting contrast., Use construction paper to cut out pictures or shapes and adhere those cutouts to the pumpkin with crafting glue.


Alternatively, you could print out Halloween pictures or autumn designs from your computer and adhere those to the pumpkin instead of making your own from construction paper.

, If you painted or otherwise created a face for your pumpkin, you could find a cheap Halloween wig or hat to decorate the top of the “head” with.


Many wigs are available in stores that sell Halloween costumes.

If you do use a printed pattern, trim the paper so that there is a 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) border around the design. Tape the pattern to the pumpkin before you begin tracing it.

, Trace along the pencil markings on your pumpkin with the point of the knife. Cut deep enough to pierce the skin but not deep enough to cut through the flesh of the pumpkin.

, Carefully continue to slide the knife beneath the skin until the portion of skin inside the outline is completely removed.

, To help prevent the pumpkin from rotting quicker, apply a thin coating of petroleum jelly or craft sealant to the exposed flesh. This will act as a barrier against harsh weather conditions.

, You could use this technique to create a traditional Jack-o-Lantern face. Instead of cutting through the entire pumpkin, merely design the face as normal and only cut away the skin.

Consider the style of Halloween party that interests you.,
Write down your ideas.,
Consider the people you'd like to invite.,
Prepare invitations.",How to Organize a Halloween Party1," There are so many to choose from, so start thinking now. Themes that you might like to make use of include:


Haunted theme
Ghostly theme
Horror theme
Fairytale theme
Pumpkin theme (everything orange!)
Graveyard theme
Costume theme (anything goes);
, Before you hit any store, create a list that sets out:


Decorations you'd like to have
Types of food
Music
Prizes and games (optional)
Movies (optional)
Other ideas

, This will give you an idea of numbers and the space and food needed. If you have a specific theme (like movies), you may want to limit your number so you don't end up with 12 Freddie Kruegers.


If the party is in your house, limit it to a number you can handle. After all, you're the host -- the party blunders (and successes) lie on your shoulders.

, Use your chosen theme to guide the invitation creation. Set the time, date, and give any details about what to wear, bring, etc. Send these out about two weeks prior to the party. For some invitation ideas:


Grab some black construction paper, a template off the internet, and design and cut out a witch's hat. To write in the necessary details, use a white or silver gel pen.

If a witch's hat isn't your cup o' tea, cut out pumpkins, ghosts, tombstones, or black cats out of construction paper instead. If you put it in an envelope, add in some Halloween-themed confetti for an extra touch.


Buy a bunch of small pumpkins or gourds from your local grocery store or farmer's market. In permanent marker, draw a funny face on the front and have the details on the back. Be sure to let it dry though! Otherwise you risk everything smearing.

"
Purchase or make your decorations for the party.,
Consider what food and drinks you will serve.,
Prepare a music mix.,
Plan Halloween games if you want to have them.",How to Organize a Halloween Party2," If you're holding a big party, you might want to put more effort into decorating for you party than for your yard; it all depends on how many hands are on deck to help out! Make the decorations well in advance so that you're not rushed.


For a haunted house:

If you have a walkway already lined with lights, replace them with lit-up skulls. Place glowing sculptures in your windows and make sure to take advantage of technology: Lots of decorations now have motion-activated sensors that will surely creep out your guests as they walk in.
For the inside, utilize cobwebs from corner to ceiling and a fog machine in the doorway. Hang spiders or bats in not-so-obvious areas and if the lights are dim, invest in a few bottles of glow-in-the-dark spray.



, There are many different ideas for Halloween food that you can find in magazines, books, and online. wikiHow has its own section too - check out Halloween Food & Treats. Make the food in advance when possible, especially if it's tricky (such as making hands, skulls, etc.)


Witches' fingers are fairly simple to make with cookies and almond slices. Think cheese for a brain and mozzarella eyeballs with black and green olives for eyes.
As for drinks, a cauldron of punch is pretty mandatory. And if you can get your hands on some dry ice to make it smokey, all the better. A glow-in-the-dark LED light at the bottom of the bowl would make for a nice added touch, too.
Coat the edge of drinking glasses using corn syrup dyed with red food coloring, turn right side up and allow mixture to drip down the glasses to serve your creepy concoctions in., Do this well in advance and set up the music where it can be heard easily. Music doesn't just have to be straight up music -- think of sound effects, too!


Play this outside to get your guests excited even before they walk in. The outside loop can be much shorter than the music you have playing inside. See what snippets you can download offline for free.

, These will need to take into account guest numbers, ages, and interests. Look online for Halloween party game ideas.


Costume parties are a tried and true favorite. You could even get narrower -- all guests must dress as a character from a horror film or even a specific movie (maybe your house is themed along that movie?) or as dead people.
Pumpkin decorating contest -- a great idea as long as your guests don't get too rowdy and turn it into a pumpkin throwing and mashing contest.

"

Put out the decorations on the day of the party.,
Set out the food just prior to the party.",How to Organize a Halloween Party3," Move furniture out of the way, make sure that there is plenty of free space for guests to mill around, dance, play games, etc. Put the food in an easily accessible place but not somewhere that impedes movement.


It's best to party proof your house beforehand, too. The food table should be away from anything that shouldn't get spilled on or ruined. If guests are drinking, have a place for coats, keys, and get the bathroom ready.

, It is always nice to decorate the table Halloween style, with an orange tablecloth, a witch's hat, a pumpkin, etc., whatever takes your fancy and is available. Provide plates, utensils, serviettes/napkins, drinking glasses. Serve the drinks nearby.


Wait to add ice to any drinks or to bring out any food that needs to be warm until numbers have accumulated.

"
"
Set up the decorations.,
Start a murder mystery.,
Have a Halloween lunch.",How to Organize a Halloween Party4," These can be your general orange, black and witch-y decorations, or you can go with a more specific theme. If your coworkers can get into it, go for it.


Design your workplace like the set of a movie. The staff can take a vote prior to Halloween. Then, on the actual day, members can dress up as characters.

Or certain sections of the work environment could be different movies. Then, you could pass around a bowl of movie titles and each person gets a movie title for the basis of their costume design. It could get turned into a contest or a guessing game on the day of.


A music theme works too...as long as you celebrate dead rockers of the past. For a twist on Halloween, choose this orientation, decorate your workspace like an abandoned music studio and get each of your peers into a dead but musical persona.

, Halloween doesn't have to be all about pumpkins, pretzels, and zombies. It can be old school and sophisticated, too. Have a murder mystery at work. This will take preparation in advance, but could be well worth it.


You'll have to write up a character outline for each guest, informing them how they knew ""the deceased"" and how they feel about other characters. Give one to each guest at the start of the game and reveal clues throughout the night, uncovering alibis, secrets, and interactions, etc. Before people start going home, have them all take a guess at the murderer (if they're the murderer, it should be indicated on their character outline). Of course, have the perp reveal themselves!, Unfortunately, there are no traditional foods or drinks that come with a Halloween party. Whatever your theme is, cater to that. Butterbeer, anyone?


Generally, finger foods are the way to go. Pumpkin cookies, lady fingers (can be decorated like a witch's finger), devil's egg eyeballs, and crab leg spiders are solid hits.

Have plain yogurt and let kids put in sprinkles, crumbled cookies, chocolate chips, and other yummy stuff. This is great for kids that like to experiment with different items.;
, The list here is just a few common carnival games.


Balloon popping. A great game for teens, blow up balloons, tie them off, and staple them to a backboard made from a heavy cardboard box, then let the kids throw darts to burst them. If you like, add a prize label behind the balloon, and when it is popped, the person wins the prize. This is for teenagers and older, not small kids.
Water Balloon Toss. Find a volunteer to stick their head out of a hole cut in a sheet of plywood, and let the kids throw water balloons at him/her. A popular (or not) teacher, or some other ""prime"" target makes it more fun!
Lawn Bowling. Buy a set of cheap, plastic lawn bowling pins and balls. Set up a cardboard lane with side rails to keep the balls from straying, and have a volunteer to set the pins between players.
Fishing for treats. Find, or build, a very large box, and have a volunteer hide in it. Let the children dangle lines from fishing poles with clothespins attached into the box, where the concealed volunteer attaches treats and tugs the line, indicating a ""bite"".
Ring toss, ball toss, or horseshoe toss. All are essentially the same, set up a target, and let the kids throw at it. You may have more than one ""score target"", for instance, a smaller hole would have more point value than a larger one.

, Set up your Karaoke machine and let the kids have fun singing with the music. For more fun, make a ""Gong Show"" parody out of it.

, Set up a course, usually a circle or oval, and lay out squares along the path with numbers. Turn music on, and as the walkers are following the path, turn the music off, signalling the people to stop. Call out a number picked randomly, and the person on that square wins the prize.

, These should be supervised and age limits should be established for the individual attractions.

, Get colored sand from a craft supply store, and empty, clear bottles, and allow participants to pour multicolored layers of sand in the bottles to make a unique craft.

, This is a fundamental attraction at many Halloween carnivals.

, This may not be appropriate if there is concern about the sanitary and hygienic issues, but this was the standard for many years at Halloween parties.

,, Tie the tissue to the lollipop and decorate with googly eyes, pom-poms, and other craft materials and remember to be creative.

, Let the kids choose from a wide selection of the tattoos. You may also have face painting and draw cute pumpkins and stuff.

Other parents find it to be all fun and games, while still others think Halloween in and of itself is inappropriate, and instead lean toward harvest themes. Figure out exactly what you deem appropriate for the age group you are serving.;
, Remember, parents love to see their young kids having a great time in their Halloween costumes. Parents also like to drag along the older kids to keep an eye on them. Make sure you'll have enough supplies for everyone who ends up coming.

, Nothing kills a party like bad food. Decide exactly what you plan on serving. Lunch? Dinner? Snacks? Cocktails? (for the adults, of course). Make sure that there is plenty of food for everyone to leave stuffed and smiling.

, If you aren't the creative type, stop by your local party store and see what Halloween/Harvest themed games they have laid out. Remember to get games that are age appropriate for the guests. For younger children, bean bag tosses are excellent. For older children, more challenging games would be more appropriate.

, Games are always more fun when there is something at stake.

, Perhaps candy can be your prize. Regardless, there must be candy available for the children as well as their parents.

, Once again, use your discretion. Severed hands and toddlers don't usually mix well.

, Lay out the food, put out the games where there's lots of space, double check your decorations and get ready for your guests to role in!

By inviting your neighbors to the party, you'll not only seem like a good neighbor, you'll also be giving them a warning that you'll be having a party soon.Generally, people respond better to bad news or difficult situations when warned beforehand. Even if you don't think your neighbors will come to your party, offering an invitation will prepare them for the noise of your party when you have it., Even if you have a large house, you should try to balance the number of people you invite with the amount of space you have available. Remember, some people will want to sit and eat, while others may want to eat while standing and socializing. Be sure you have:


Table seating available, if appropriate for your party.Social seating, like couches and easy chairs.

, In your daily life, you likely don't need wide walkways and uncluttered tables, but these can cause a mess or create a tripping hazard during your party if you're not careful. You may want to:Remove unneeded furniture to a spare room or storage space.
Clean all clutter and fragile knick-knacks.
Put away valuables normally on display.

, Parties tend to follow the same order, and you might make your party more memorable by switching up the order of events. Instead of having people socialize until the food is ready, why not have a small game with a prize? You might have:Guests throw cards into a hat to score points.
Guests vote on each other's costumes.
Guests play a game of skill, like darts.

, Some party planners define the four main elements of a party as the entrance, food, drink, and music. You should try to keep these four elements separated by some space. This will help you avoid causing congestion between people arriving to your party and people enjoying your party., Providing food and drink to a large group of people can be expensive, especially since you'll likely have to do some decorating to make your home Halloween appropriate. You can cut down on costs by having friends bring a dish to pass, potluck style. You might even include a theme, like:Goblins and ghosts
Food found in the dark forest
Food eaten by werewolves, witches, and the undead.

, Some people don't take the costuming aspect of Halloween quite so seriously, so if you expect your friends to arrive in costume, you should be sure this is clearly stated. You might consider choosing a Halloween theme yourself, or you might want leave costume ideas up to your guests.

, Halloween is a popular time of the year for parties, so if you're going to the time and effort to get everything ready, you might want to have a general idea of who to expect. You should ask your guests to RSVP, or to respond whether or not they can attend, on your invitation., Some classic Halloween tunes include Bobby Pickett's The Monster Mash or Michael Jackson's Thriller, but these songs on repeat can make for a dull atmosphere. You might download or purchase a collection of fun Halloween tunes, or you could find a spooky effects track at your local Halloween, costuming, or music store., There are many options available at your local Halloween, costume, or craft stores. You can spread wads of cotton, taping it into corners of your home with clear tape, to give the effect of spider webs. Fake blood can leave eerie hand prints on your windows, and a skeleton hanging in the corner can add a more frightening touch.You might also want to use dry ice for fog effects.
Use a fake arm to give your guests a fright.

, Your guests will surely appreciate any food you provide and drink you provide. However, Halloween based recipes that match the theme of your party, if you have a theme, will be sure to impress. Consider:Gummy worms
Candy in the shape of eye balls
Meatloaf in a thick, red sauce with a fake hand placed on top

, What fun would Halloween be without the added nostalgia of some goody bags? You can find affordable, mixed assortments of candy at your local grocery or a dollar store. Then, take a glove, plastic baggie, or Halloween themed container, and fill it with candy for you to send guests on their way with., Although not necessary, the visual effects of a movie playing in the background can add to the Halloween atmosphere of your party. For example, if you are having a Ghostbusters themed party, you might put that movie on mute, giving your guests a chance to compare their costumes to the real thing., Make your party more intimate as the night goes on by lowering your overhead lights. You can prepare for this beforehand by having candles lit strategically throughout your house. Then, when you are ready to turn the lights down, you already have softer mood lighting ready to glow., There are always unforeseen difficulties that leave at least one guest uncostumed. Even if you expressed a costume requirement from the start, you can save yourself some frustration and your guest some embarrassment by having a few cheap costumes on hand. You might:Purchase a few dollar store masks.
Have a cheap sheet for uncostumed guests to make ghost costumes.

, Especially when you are trying to make sure that everything goes right, it can be easy to forget that you are the host and that many people at your party only know you. At regular intervals you should take some time to float through your party, making proper introductions and comments, such as:""Oh Tara! I'm so glad you could make it. I noticed that you and John were talking. He and I have worked together at AcmeCorp for years!""
""Lauren, good to see you! I'm glad to see you talking with my childhood friend, Nicole. What have you two been talking about?""

, You can add a slight twist to normal Halloween games, like bobbing for apples, to make your party more lively. You might bob for shrunken heads, by peeling and carving faces in the apples.You might also play:


Halloween movie trivia
Mummy wrap, where teams wrap a member in toilet paper.,

You don't want to ruin the illusion of your magical Hallowing party by forgetting to keep the food and drink flowing. Check the food every ten minutes when people first start eating to gauge your guests' appetites, then check as often as you deem necessary., Guests will arrange and rearrange your furniture throughout the evening to make conversing with others easier, to make room for other guests, and to create space for games. While well intentioned, this may hurt the flow of your party. You should return furniture to its proper place when you are able."

You can cover your furniture with black sheets and sprinkle flour on them to make the room look old and dusty.;
, Put 1 or 2 CD players hidden behind the sheets, with creepy sound effect CDs in them—no one will know where the sound is coming from. Also, to kill two birds with one stone, get sound strobe lights.

, Hallways are best for extra effects, because you can split them up into 3 or more sections, such as the effects room, spider room, skeleton room, and just plain creepy room. Or you can mix it all up to be equally creepy.

, Hallways are also useful because they're normally at the front of the house. One person can lock the door at the end, and keep it closed for a while, then let them the guests in, where the party is just starting!

Decide what can fit in your entrance area before planning.,
Begin with some staple additions.,
Add something large and scary.,
Include a moving scare.,
Add some fangs for a monster mouth entrance.,
Mummify your door.,
Put graves and/or tombstones along the pathway.,
Make sure that all of your carved pumpkins have menacing faces.,
Wait for your first trick and treaters to arrive.",How to Make Your Entrance Spooky for Halloween," There's no use trying to put a headless mannequin on the front porch if it takes up all the standing room and nobody can reach the door. Be realistic about what will fit and whether you might need to extend the entrance way beyond the built area and onto the pathway as well.;
, There are a few standard items for the spooky entrance way, including:


Artificial spiderwebs. Drape these over the door, porch pillars, across the roof area, etc. They are even more effective if you can add fairy lights behind them in neon colors, to make the spiderwebs glow.
Fake spiders. A few large and not-so-friendly looking spiders sitting inside the webs makes for a good scary feel.
Add a sign hanging over the door or porch entrance. Have the sign say something spooky, such as ""Beware"", or ""Enter at own risk"", or ""A night to dismember"", etc.

, If you have the room in the entrance way, consider adding something which is large and realistic, such as a headless corpse, a skeleton or a floating ghoul. If you don't have the space under a porch or doorway, place it on the outside, perhaps on the pathway leading to the door or even at the gate.


If you have a mannequin, dress it in a cloak with a hood. Use face paint to give it a really scary face. A whole row of these hooded beings would be really effective.
Giant spiders or zombie black cats are another fun yet scary addition to the entrance way. You could make your own using papier mâché, or purchase ready-made ones from a party store.

, Make a mechanism which will spook people all of a sudden because it moves or descends as they walk in. For example, you could rig up a spider falling from the roof or have a motion-sensor creature that howls or screeches as people walk past.


Dangle items such as cut-out black cardboard bats. If you can make a lot of these, they can look very effective.

, Depending on how your entrance way is shaped, you could turn the whole entry area into a monster's mouth. To do this, measure the width of the entrance front and use this to determine the length of the fangs. Then draw a row of fangs template to this length, making the fangs in the middle the longest (but not so long that they'd hit someone's head) and decreasing the size of the teeth as they go along.


Attach the fangs along the top of the entrance way, hanging down.
For a complete finish, add a pair of monster eyes above the teeth, to give the impression that the entrance way is the monster's mouth.
This works best if your house has an archway entrance.

, Mummies are a great Halloween icon, so let your door become part of the fun. Use bandages from the dollar store to wrap around your entire door. Attach ends at the unseen side of the door, using knots and/or duct tape, so that visitors cannot see the messy side. Finish by adding two large round eyes cut from white cardboard with smaller black cardboard inserts for the pupils.


When wrapping, do not wrap the door handle or lock, as you still need to be able to use these; work around them.

, Use creepy messages on the headstones. You can also place skeleton figures, ghosts and other scary things around the headstones and graves.


If you can make mannequins, make the Grim Reaper, standing amid the graves.

, For the pumpkins to be spooky, steer clear of the happy, pretty carvings and instead, choose scary faces, with fangs, leers and mean grins. Use evil eyebrows and wicked eyes. Bandit masks can be placed over the eyes of the wicked pumpkins, to give them an even more sinister appearance.

, Enjoy scaring them but be sure to reassure any of the little ones who burst into tears.

Clean several plastic milk jugs.,
Draw a face on the jugs.,
Cut a small hole in the back of the jug.,
Stuff the jug with Christmas or fairy lights.",How to Make Your Own Decorations for Halloween1," You don't need to cut them out or in any way modify them -- they just need to be clean. Each one will be one ghost -- how many milk jugs do you need?;
, You can either use a black permanent marker, felt, or any material you have lying around the house. The permanent marker will be the easiest to make a detailed face with. While you do this, only work on the side without the handles and leave the caps on the jugs. The air forced to stay inside by the caps will make it easier to work with, keeping it sturdy.


You don't have to go Martha Stewart on this project. Just a circle for a mouth and circles for eyes (leave a little white for the pupils) can be cute, too.

, Use a craft knife to cut a hole the size of a half dollar or a bit bigger than a pound coin. Place the hole about 2/3 of the way up the jug.


This won't be seen. If it's not perfect, don't worry about it. Just don't leave any sharp edges!

, You can either use a whole string for one jug, or thread several jugs with a single string. Arrange the jugs together, plug in the cord, and voila!


These little buggers work great lining a walk or a patio or table edge. They dim the lighting just enough to glow in a very Halloween-y feel!

Cut a body, two wings, and the head of a bat (with ears!),
Trace your template onto black craft foam.,
Punch several holes into the bat to join the pieces together.,
Align the holes on the body and the wings together and fasten with a brad.,
Thread a string through the empty holes and tie in a loop.,
Attach a ribbon and red sequin eyes.",How to Make Your Own Decorations for Halloween2," out of a piece of paper. You can find a template online or you can freehand it.Make the body a little on the chubby side so you have room to attach the wings without drawing away from its size.

, Cut out the foam to match the template. This project looks best if you have about 6 or so bats. They need friends!

, Punch two holes on each wing, close to where the wings would attach to the body. Leave a little space around all sides so the holes don't turn into rips. Also punch a hole at the bottom of the body, to attach a string later (around where a tail would be).


The holes just have to be big enough to put a metal brad through. This is how the wings will flap.

, Since there are two holes on each side, use the one that's closest to the wing tip. Place a paper fastener or a brad through the hole and secure loosely (it's best to use a black fastener or color your gold brad).

, That's why you pierced two holes in each bat initially! You'll probably want at least 10 inches (25 cm) of string (or dental floss), so the string is easy to grab.


This is how you'll manipulate the wings. When you hang your bat up, you can just give the string a tug and away he'll go!

, Thread the ribbon through the bottom hole to hang the bat upside down from your wall or ledge. Tie it in a loop and knot. Then, make red eyes with sequins. Googly eyes work, too!

"
"
Purchase a few terra cotta pots.,
Cut the parts of a face out of yellow craft paper.,
Brush the surface of the pot with outdoor modge-podge.,
Apply the pieces of the face to the upside down pot.,
Insert a stick into the end for a stem.",How to Make Your Own Decorations for Halloween3," Having a variety of sizes will give you a pumpkin family! Make sure they're clean if you had them laying around the house. You want them very orange to simulate pumpkins.

, If you don't have craft paper, use scrapbook paper, card, or wrapping paper. Anything that's bendy and colorful will work. Make arched evil eyebrows, a handlebar mustache, surprised eyes, or any detail that you'd like your pumpkin pots to have.


The simpler your face, the more it will look like a jack-o-lantern. Give it a toothy grin, a triangular nose, and triangular eyes to make it look more pumpkin-esque.

, You only need a layer on the side you'll place the face for right now. Use a sponge brush or paint brush for best results. A thin, but even layer is ideal.

, Press them firmly into place. Then, apply a thin layer of the sticky stuff all over the pot, effectively weather-proofing it.

, When we say stick, we mean stick. Go outside under a tree and find a stick to fit through the bottom of your terra cotta pot. And there it is -- a pumpkin that won't rot in a week's time!

Cut off the spout of an empty, clean milk jug.,
Cover the jug with black tape.,
Get 4 6-foot (2 m) black foam pipe insulation tubes that are 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter.,
Cut a slit at a joint in the legs.,
Use two halves of a plastic Easter egg for eyes.",How to Make Your Own Decorations for Halloween4," Just below the lid is what you don't want. Use a craft knife to make this easy -- scissors will be difficult to work with.


Make sure your milk jug is clean! If there's still a milky residue it may end up smelling.

, This will form the body of your spider. Go as tightly around the handle as you can; but don't worry -- if it's still discernible, that's fine.

, These will be the legs. Tape each one in the center along the handle of the jug.


Then, tape the tubes along the sides of the jug too, to make it look as if the legs are going along the body. The tubes will bend into place.

, If you cut a slit in the tube, it will bend at your cut. If you hold it in the bend, you can tape it to stay permanently bent. This will form the joints in your spiders legs.


A 1"" (2.5 cm) triangle cut is good -- the tube won't unexpectedly break off. Just hold it at its bending point and wrap tape around the newly-formed joint.

, They'll bulge out and be adequately creepy -- especially if you cut a slit of black tape for pupils. If you don't have an egg lying around, puff balls (or anything circular, really) work as well. Just attach them to the jug with more tape or glue.

"
"
Create your ghost form with two small paper cups.,
Inflate a small balloon and put it in the top cup.,
Soak pieces of cheesecloth in fabric stiffener.,
Immediately drape over the balloon.,
Pop the balloon!,
Remove from the cup and rough up the edges.,
Attach felt eyes and fishing line to hang.",How to Make Your Own Decorations for Halloween5," Turn the first one upside down, then place the second one on top of that. To make it stable, tape or glue the bottoms together.


You won't actually be using the cups as part of the ghost -- it's just used for sizing in the initial stages. So if you don't want to fuss with tape, don't worry about it!

, But not too much! If it's too big it won't fit in the cup. Make it so it fills out the cup, like a round poof of whipped cream tops a mug of hot chocolate.

, You'll want to work with pieces that are about 8 inches (20 cm) square. Grab a bowl and fill it with fabric stiffener, soaking each piece thoroughly. About 10 seconds per piece will do the job nicely.

, After you've soaked a piece, drape it over the balloon and move onto the next piece. Center the pieces, evenly draped over the balloon, but not perfectly uniform.


Once you've finished with all your pieces, let it dry for about ten minutes. It will then harden and take shape.

, This will require a needle or other pointy object since you can't go smashing your creation on the floor (well, you could, if you get really frustrated -- but that'd defeat the purpose). After you do so, you should be left with a free-floating white ghost-like creation. Isn't Halloween the best?

, The ends should look tattered, as if they're wafting in some sort of unregisterable-to-humans breeze. Just bending them with your fingers should do the trick.

, Little tiny black dots for eyes are all these little guys need to be cute and not at all ominous. Black sequins or beads can work, too.


As for the fishing line, just thread it through the cheesecloth, loop, and tie in a knot! Hang your new buddies from lights, shelves, windows, or the ceiling.

Print out a picture of a head.,
Laminate the paper.,
Fill a large jar with water.,
Place the picture into the jar.,
Set the jar anywhere you want.",How to Make Scary Halloween Decorations1," If you have exceptional photoshop skills, you can use a front and side view of your face to create a 3D image. Or you can download a readymade one here: http://www.instructables.com/files/orig/F53/QS3Z/HSVGCE57/F53QS3ZHSVGCE57.pdf. The illusion may work best if you print onto legal size paper.Make sure you print in color for the best looking picture. It’s going to use a lot of ink, so make sure all of your ink cartridges are full enough.;
, You will be submerging the image in a jar of water, so laminating it is important or the paper will just dissolve. Once the image is laminated, you can carefully trim any excess lamination from the outside of the image. Don’t cut too close to the paper.


If you have access to a lamination machine, this is a good option, but if not you can get large laminating sheets at craft stores or stores that sell craft supplies.

, A gallon size jar is the best option since it will appear to be the right size for a head. Fill the jar mostly full with water. For added effect, put a few drops of yellow and green food coloring in the jar. It will give the water a rotting look.


Make sure to use a jar with a lid so that you don’t make a mess.
A glass jar with a hinged lid will give the illusion a look of being really old.

, Take the laminated picture and curl it up. Slide it into the jar so that it wraps around the inside, pressing against the jar. It doesn’t need to be pressed tightly, so it if floats more in the middle, that’s okay too.You may find that you need to adjust the size of the jar for the size of the picture that you printed out. You want the picture to fill most of the jar for the illusion to be convincing.

, One great thing about this decoration is that you can set it up in a lot of different places. You could put it in the fridge if people will be getting food or drinks from there. You can set it out on the counter or on an end table in your living room.

Gather some lifelike dolls.,
Paint on some wounds.,
Rough up the dolls.,
Place the dolls in the front yard.",How to Make Scary Halloween Decorations2," For this decoration to work best, you’ll want to use some dolls that stand up. If you have old ones you are okay with ruining, use those, or consider looking through some garage sales or thrift stores. You probably don’t want to buy new ones, but you can.


It’s totally fine if they are dirty or kind of broken already. This will add to the effect that you are going for anyway.
If you use some that aren’t meant to stand up, you’ll just have to position them differently or use a stake of some kind to stand them up.

, You can use red paint to make scratches or stitch marks. You can use brown or gray to give the skin a sickly look. How creative you want to be and exactly how you want the dolls to look is up to you.You can paint all of the flesh to give the dolls a deadly grayish look, or you can just paint some marks here and there that give the appearance of blood.
In a pinch, red fingernail polish works great for this!

, Rip the dolls’ clothes and put some more red paint on the clothes for blood. You can even cut out some of the hair to make it seem like it fell out. Don’t be afraid to detach an arm or leg here and there to enhance the zombie-like appearance.


You could step on the dolls to add a dented or crushed look.
If the eyes are at all detachable, taking an eye out is a great way to add creepiness to the effect. You could also paint over the eyes in such a way that makes it look like an empty socket.
If the dolls are stuffed, you could cut them open and pull some of the stuffing out to imitate guts coming out.

, You can make it look like some of them are coming out of the ground, or you can stand them all up like they are waiting in formation. Another option is to stash them at different points around your house, inside or outside, so that it seems like they are coming from all over the place.


If you have some dolls that you can’t make stand up, you could sit them in a corner or in a chair. You could also prop them up with a stake if you are putting them outside.

Smear a cheap shower curtain with red paint.,
Make the mirror a warning.,
Turn the floor into an escape trail.",How to Make Scary Halloween Decorations3," Buy a shower curtain at a dollar store that you can throw away after the holiday. Use red paint to make a few handprints on it. Let some of the paint drip down the curtain and make some other smudges.It is probably best to do this outside on the grass or in the garage.
You don’t want to smear the paint around too much or it will start to look like just a blob of red.
Let the curtain dry completely before you hang it up in your shower. Hang it so the painted side is facing inward.

, Using some washable red paint, or lipstick, scrawl a warning across your mirror. Writing “you’re next” or “redrum” are classic horror phrases. You can splatter some other paint onto the mirror or makes streaks around the words.


An added scare tactic that uses the mirror is to hang a creepy picture on the wall that faces the mirror. Position it in such a way that when people look in the mirror they can see the picture right behind them.

, You can throw a cheap rug down and make “bloody” footprints that lead out the door. If you don’t mind getting the floor messy, you can make footprints on the floor as well. Be sure that whatever you use to make the footprints is washable.Another option is to make handprints that look as if someone crawled away. You can smear some paint along with the handprints as if the person was dragging their body away.

Eat the pumpkin flesh.,
Pickle the peel.,
Hold a jack-o'-lantern smashing party.,
Make a home for an ant colony.,
Feed the jack-o'-lantern to the chickens or other poultry.,
Compost the jack-o'-lantern.,
Dispose of the jack-o'-lantern in the garbage if you don't have a garden or compost.",How to Use Your Old Jack O Lantern," Any flesh that has been cut from the pumpkin makes for fantastic cooking possibilities. Don't throw this flesh out when making your jack-o'-lantern. Instead, either use it immediately for baking or cooking, or refrigerate it and use it within a few days. Alternately, freeze it and use it within a few months. Pumpkin flesh can be used in a range of dishes, such as pumpkin soup, pumpkin pie, and pumpkin bread. See How to use pumpkins for more ideas of how to use the flesh removed during carving.


If you set whole (uncut, not carved) pumpkins out for display and want to use their flesh, rescue them at the end of Halloween night or early next morning before the squirrels, raccoons, or any other beasts start nibbling on it! Whole, uncut pumpkins will store well in a dry, cold place for a month or more.
To use the remaining flesh attached to a jack-o'-lantern, keep the following in mind: the jack-o'-lantern pumpkins are usually different from pumpkins used for cooking and tend to be watery, so you'll need to first squeeze out the water if pureeing. There should be no wax or other blemishes on the flesh. Finally, the jack-o'-lantern should be carved and cooked within 24 hours.;
, If your jack-o'-lantern is in good shape the morning after Halloween, consider pickling the rind. The jack-o'-lantern must be clean, free of rot, and not suffering from wax build-up or smoke burns (for pickling you should use a pumpkin light in place of candles). Pickling the rind is common in Northern Germany:Assemble the ingredients. You'll need 3/4 lb (340 g) sugar, 2 cups (16 fl. oz) of vinegar, and a small piece of fresh ginger per 1 pound (454 g) of pumpkin rind; one cinnamon stick for several pounds.
Peel the outer skin off the pumpkin. The rind is the white colored part under the skin. Cut the rind into 2 inch (5cm) squares.
Place the pumpkin into the vinegar. Leave it to soak overnight. Drain the next morning and discard the vinegar.
Lay the pumpkin on a towel or cloth to dry.
Pour fresh vinegar into a large pot. Add the sugar, ginger, and cinnamon stick. Add the pumpkin rind and simmer over a low heat.
Cook without stirring until the pumpkin rind becomes translucent and yellow. This will take about 3 hours. Shake the pot occasionally to move the rind around.
Store. The rind can be canned or refrigerated. If refrigerated, eat within a few weeks; if canned, follow normal canning instructions and storage times.

, This use allows you to keep the pumpkins a few days more (if needed) and provides an excuse for you and your friends to get rid of everyone's pumpkins at the same time, as well as have a party.


Choose whose place the party will be held at. It needs to be somewhere with a decent sized backyard.
Ask the guests to keep their jack-o'-lanterns after Halloween. Offer to collect pumpkins for friends who can't come.
Find things to damage the pumpkin with. Suitable items include slingshots, sports bats or rackets, sticks or broomsticks, et cetera. Or, you might prefer tossing the pumpkins against a wall or dropping them from on high. If children are involved, don't use anything that could result in injuries – simply throwing or dropping is best with kids around.

Plan a party. Get drinks, snacks, music, chairs, etc., organized. A barbecue is a good idea. Set out candies from Halloween as well.
Hold the party. Have a prize for the best smashing technique.
Sweep up the smashed pieces. These can be composted, buried, or thrown out, as detailed below.

, Place the jack-o'-lantern near an area you know that ants frequent. Allow the pumpkin to start rotting. When you see mold growing on the inside, this is a good time to start.


Microwave two small bars of chocolate in a bowl (or plate) for 30-45 seconds.
Sprinkle sugar on the chocolate and stir until you get a paste.
Apply the paste to the the pumpkin, on either the inside or outside.
Observe. You may see many types of ants in you new ant colony.

, Break down the pumpkins with your hands or a hammer and toss the pieces into the chicken's feeding tray. Once they've pecked off the remaining flesh, remove the pumpkin skin and compost or throw away.


If you have a farm, pumpkins make for good stock feed. Or call a local zoo or animal park to see if they can make use of clean pumpkins you don't need.
Don't feed a moldy pumpkin to animals. If you're going to use it as food, it must be fresh and in good condition.

, Pumpkins make great fertilizer when composted. Remove the seeds before composting unless you want pumpkins all over your garden next summer! Remove anything that won't compost like candle wax, decorations, and so forth. Place the jack-o'-lantern on a bed of leaves (maple leaves work well) or other plant trimmings inside the compost. Add more leaves over the top of the pumpkin. Cover with the usual compost materials and the pumpkin will break down.This can be done in a plastic container if you don't own a compost bin.
Pumpkin can be fed to worms for worm composting too. Break it down into small pieces first.
If you don't want to compost it, bury it in the soil. It will decay quickly and will still fertilize and enrich the soil.

, Leaving a pumpkin to decompose in your home or on patios will result in pumpkin stains and mold problems.

",How to Make a Death Star Pumpkin," Consider going for the larger sized pumpkin for a more dramatic effect.;
, Approach this step as you would when carving any other pumpkin.


Slice off the top using a sharp knife and remove the insides and seeds of the pumpkin.







, Pick up a store-bought pumpkin light bright kit that will allow you to illuminate the pumpkin with small colored (or clear) lights that illuminate off the candle or battery operated flashlight.

Get typical pumpkin carving tools including sharp knives in different sizes and a small shovel that you can use for scraping the insides of the pumpkin. Also, a clay loop tool (available at most craft stores) will be vital to creating the lines.
Find a sewing tape measure. The tape measure will be a very important part to making this design work so make sure you don't leave this supply out. You should also grab a pencil to trace lines on the pumpkin.







, Wrap your tape measure around the middle of the pumpkin and mark your lines.


Use the clay loop tool to gouge out the center circle around the middle of the pumpkin. Don’t cut all the way through the pumpkin skin, but make an impression around the center.

, Use your tape measure to mark lines along the pumpkin veins. You will need to create specific measurements all the way around the pumpkin.


Keep measurements in proportion to the size of the pumpkin. For example, a 77-pound pumpkin you could make a 2 ½ inch mark above and below the middle impression you just made around the pumpkin center.

, Choose a space between the veins and the upper part of the pumpkin for the laser circle/hole.


The circle should be at least an inch above the horizontal line.
Consider using a teacup bottom to trace the circle.

,


Place a hole in the middle of the circle with a pencil mark and then use a small knife to dig a larger hole (but not much bigger than a pen tip).

, You made pencil marks earlier to use as your guide. Use a thin clay loop tool or knife to gouge out the horizontal lines. Follow the pencil markings to keep lines symmetrical.


As you cut the lines, avoid cutting into the laser circle. You will need that circle to be surrounded with clean lines.

, Use the flat clay loop tool to go over the line, deepening and smoothing the line.

, Depending on the pumpkin size you may want to re-assess where to create this wider line. Don't make it as wide as the middle line, but wider than the rest.

, Make small vertical cuts every 2 inches (5.1 cm) around the pumpkin. Start at the top and work your way around and then downward. Make sure the vertical lines are parallel to the pumpkin veins too.


Avoid carving boxes over the laser circle.

, Again, you don’t want the box lines to be as thick as the midline but large enough to be seen from a distance.

, Use the clay loop tool as you will need to remove the pumpkin flesh to distinguish the rectangles from the rest of the pumpkin.

, If you have a round drill bit you can use that to create a smooth surface. Otherwise, carve the circle with the clay loop tool.


Hollow out the laser circle and create a smaller circle that goes all the way through the pumpkin. The center circle you created earlier will be your guide. Be careful not to make this circle too large, but large enough so light can shine through.

, These small touches will make all the difference in the world so don’t skip this step.


Pepper the exterior of the pumpkin with the pumpkin light brites. Once the candle or flashlight has been lit inside the light will illuminate the light brights so select places that you want to sparkle or shine.






Add a flashlight or candle inside the pumpkin. If you plan to leave the pumpkin unattended, opt for a battery operated flashlight or battery-powered candle for safety.

Carve a jack o' lantern.,
Make a Halloween wreath.,
Make tombstones.",How to Make Halloween Crafts1," Carving a scary or silly face on a pumpkin is probably the most popular Halloween craft there is. Cut off the top of the pumpkin, around the stem, and scoop and scrape out all the seeds and pulp. Once that's done, carve any picture you like on the side of the pumpkin, either freehand or using a pumpkin carving template taped to the pumpkin.


Kids should only carve under adult supervision.
You can find many carving templates online, or in books available at Halloween stores.;
, Decorate your door with a circle of branches, or strips of black and orange cloth tied around a circle of strong wire. Using glue, safety pins, or a drill with adult supervision, add any Halloween or autumn themed objects around the wreath. Try using autumn leaves, black and orange ribbons, or any small, store-bought Halloween decorations.


Glow in the dark pumpkins or eyeballs make the wreath extra-spooky for trick-or-treaters.

, You can make these out of any Styrofoam or posterboard, but they turn out best with rigid foam board or high density Styrofoam. Trace out a rounded tombstone shape using a circular object, or a marker tied to a string. Cut out the tombstone using any serrated bread knife, jigsaw, or hacksaw. Pencil on inscriptions, then use a utility knife to carve them out. Spray paint the tombstone grey, then use black spray paint to outline the stone, and black marker to fill in the lettering.Children should draw the shape and words, then let an adult cut them out.
You can carve the tombstone into many different shapes. Look at photographs of a cemetery online for inspiration.
To make the tombstones stand up in your yard, drill a wooden board to the front and back of the tombstone, and bury the boards.

Spook visitors with bleeding candles.,
Trap a ghost in a jar.,
Brew mysterious potions.,
Play with pipe cleaners.,
Make glitter webs.",How to Make Halloween Crafts2," Tall, white candles quickly take on a creepy appearance when you melt a red candle or crayon over the flame, leaving trails of red ""blood"" running down the side., Take a large glass jar and glue a thin circle of Styrofoam in the underside of the lid. Stick twigs in the Styrofoam to make trees, and decorate with moss, grass, or stones. To make the ghost head, draw a face on a cotton ball or ball of paper about the size of your thumbnail. Wrap the head in cheesecloth or gauze and fold a rubber band at the ghost's neck. Let the rest of the gauze dangle down to make a spooky, drifting body. Stick the ghost on a twig and add a green LED light for maximum effect, then put the jar upside-down over the entire scene and tighten the lid.


You can cut out the Styrofoam circle from a Styrofoam cup or food tray. It should be thin enough that the lid can still attach to the jar.

, Scrub the label off any glass jar with soap and water, and fill it with water and a few drops of food coloring in any color. Leave some space in the jar so you can drop in seed pods, pine cones, or other small plant parts to create a laboratory of preserved specimens., A few black and orange pipe cleaners are all you need to make easy decorations. Try covering the front steps with spiders and worms. A dab of white glue and a couple googly eyes makes these little creations cuter.

, Start with a black paper or plastic plate, or color a white one black with markers. Drizzle white glue in a spiderweb pattern over the plate, then sprinkle glitter over the glue to make the web stand out.

Create fake blood.,
Grow a pair of horns.,
Craft your own mask.",How to Make Halloween Crafts3," Raid your kitchen for corn syrup, golden syrup, or chocolate syrup, then whisk in sifted flour or cornstarch a teaspoon (5 mL) at a time until it is thick enough to stick to objects. Stir in several drops of red food coloring, then add blue or green a drop at a time to make it a more realistic color.


If the blood is too dark, mix in fruit punch. If it is too red, mix in cocoa powder.This fake blood is edible, but very sticky. If you want to make blood that's easier to wash off, use sugar-free syrup, and washable paint instead of the food coloring.

, Cut a large piece of corrugated cardboard into eight strips with a utility knife or scissors. Make the first strip about two inches (5 cm) wide and nine inches (23 cm) long, and make each subsequent strip ½ in (1.25 cm) and slightly shorter than the last. Roll each strip into a circle and glue it in place with a hot glue gun, then place each circle into the next largest one at an angle and glue together to finish the horn., You can make a custom-fit mask by molding foil onto your face, then using it as a base for papier maché. Once you've applied several layers and waited for them to dry, use a marker to draw on the mask, or a utility knife to alter the shape of the features.


Use white glue to attach glitter, craft store feathers, or any other decorations.

Finish carving your pumpkin.,
Use candles.,
Create a chimney hole to release the heat from the inside for either style of pumpkin.,
Use a battery powered light.,
Consider using other types of lights.,
Enjoy your lighted pumpkin display.",How to Light a Pumpkin for Halloween," When carving the pumpkin, consider where to place the access hole for adding lighting:


A bottom hole is ideal for windy, blustery nights. The surrounding pumpkin will protect the lighting from being blown out and the hole is placed on the ground or a solid surface.
A hole on the top of the pumpkin, which looks like a lid, using the dried stem as a handle. This is the old-fashioned way.;
, Candles are the traditional way of lighting a pumpkin and they're still much in use today.


For the pumpkin with a simple base hole: Light the candle first.
Place the pumpkin straight over the candle wherever you'd like the pumpkin sitting.
For the pumpkin with the top lid: don't try to light the candle first and then stick it down inside. You can burn your hand trying to do this. Place a non-lit candle in through the lid space. Make sure it's sitting firmly on the base of the pumpkin and will not fall over.
Light the candle. Don't try to reach from the lid. Instead, using a long fireplace match or a longer lighter, go through the front of the pumpkin, where it's carved.
You won't burn yourself using this easy method.

, The candle flame heat rises and will eventually burn a hole in the top of the pumpkin and start cooking the pumpkin from the inside out. To deal with this, light the pumpkin's candle and leave it to burn for a few minutes. You'll then see where the heated area is forming on the top of the pumpkin.


Use the lid-cutter saw and cut out a little edge at the top. Remove the piece.
There will be be a little chimney left to release the heat.

, If you're worried about the flames harming pets with their long tails or kids with their cloaks dangling around, a battery powered light can provide a safe alternative, and they're inexpensive. You don't have to worry about leaving these unattended, and they won't blow out with the wind.


There are several different types of battery powered lights on the market. Some have regular white glowing lights, while others have a red glow, which can mimic a candle flickering in the pumpkin.
Kids love the rainbow glow light. It's a good one for a monster pumpkin for a spooky effect.
Place them in the pumpkin through the available hole.

, Be creative and use other lights you have around the place, such as flashlights, lamp lights, ball lights, etc. Just be sure to tuck away any cords if you use a corded light. LED lights made for bikes, headlamps, etc., can make cool pumpkin lights.


Set up a ball light by turning the switch on and then placing it flat inside the pumpkin.

, If you can, remember to take photos as lit pumpkins make for memorable photos.

Find some silica gel packets.,
Remove silica beads from their packets.,
Embed the silica into the pumpkin.",How to Keep Halloween Pumpkins from Molding1," Silica is used as a desiccant, meaning that it wicks away excess moisture. What causes your pumpkin to start rotting and molding? Excess moisture. The two are a devilishly simple but effective combination.


Check your closet or dresser drawers, as you may have left some lying around from recent purchases. If you can't find any, packets of silica are available in bulk for very economical prices online. Silica packets are largely available with the following items:

Beef jerky
Shoes and shoe boxes
Cat litter

;
, Don't leave any lying around for your pets because, while silica gel itself is nontoxic, sometimes manufacturers add other toxic chemicals (for example, cobalt chloride) to the product.

, Remove the top of the pumpkin. Take a silica bead and embed it into the interior of the pumpkin. Don't stick the bead in so far that it changes the appearance of the pumpkin's exterior.


When applying the beads, use 3/4 grams of silica for every 100 cubic inches of pumpkin.

Make a pumpkin collage.,
Make a pumpkin wreath.,
Make mini-pumpkin candle holders.,
Make pumpkin-shaped candles.",How to Make Halloween Decorations1," No Halloween would be complete without the iconic Jack O'Lantern in its various forms. The classic Jack O’Lantern is made by carving a pumpkin and placing a candle inside it, but here are some other ideas:



Carve a disco ball pumpkin. This is a carved pumpkin with a twist and it throws light out from all over its many holes. It's a load of fun to make and people won't be able to resist making comments about it.
You can make Jack O’Lanterns out of various fruits and veggies, including oranges, pomegranates, and peppers.;
, If you don't want to go through the mess and stress of carving a pumpkin, there are many ways to decorate a pumpkin without carving it:


Paint or spray paint a pumpkin a single color. You might leave it one color (silver and gold are popular), or draw designs on the pumpkin with a sharpie after it’s been painted.
Use a stencil to help you draw or paint a face or other design on your pumpkin.
Use stickers or other surface embellishments to decorate a pumpkin. If you want to use something more natural, consider covering a pumpkin in lovely autumn leaves.
Dress your pumpkin up like a person. Use your pumpkin as the head of a mummy or zombie in your yard, put a wig on it, or add other embellishments that make it look more human (or monstrous, as the case may be).
Peel your pumpkin. Draw a design on your pumpkin and then use a knife to only cut deep enough to pierce the skin. You want to expose the pumpkin’s flesh without cutting the flesh. Draw an outline with your knife and then dig the knife beneath the pumpkin’s skin as you pull the skin back.

, Choose a large spot that will give the pumpkins ample space to grow and that will be easily seen by trick-or-treaters.


Make sure the spot will get lots of sun, and that the soil can get ample drainage, especially after heavy rain.
You’ll need to find out when to plant pumpkins in your region. Pumpkin seeds generally need to be planted in late spring or early summer if you want to harvest them in the fall.
There are different types of pumpkins to choose from: pie pumpkins for eating, decorative pumpkins for carving, and mini pumpkins.

, If you aren’t into growing pumpkins, just buy a bunch of pumpkins and arrange them in a way that mimics a pumpkin patch. Don’t forget to add vines and greenery to make it look more authentic.


You can even make a neat yard design with pumpkins, for example, having them line your path. In this case you could connect them with vines so that they look kind of like a pumpkin fence.

, There are quite a few ways that the pumpkin can grace your Halloween party or dinner table:


Make a still life arrangement using miniature pumpkins of various shapes and sizes. Pile them up beautifully, with a few fall leaves here and there.

Decorate a pumpkin with netting and ribbon, and then place it in the middle of your table as a centerpiece.

, Use construction paper or different types of card stock to make pumpkin-shaped cut-outs for decorating your home.


You can make big cut-outs to fix to your walls, or smaller ones for bunting, banners, and mobiles.
To make pumpkin bunting or garland, glue a row of paper cut-outs to yarn or a long strip of paper, and hang them up around your home. If you’re worried about the cut-outs falling off the yarn, poke holes in the top of them and run the yarn through instead of glueing them.

, These cardboard decorations can be placed along benches, on shelves or they can be strung along like bunting for a ceiling decoration:


Cut out a 3-inch circle from a piece of orange cardboard (one for each favor/guest). This will form the base of your pumpkin.
Cut out a 9-inch circle from orange crepe paper or tissue paper. This will form your pumpkin. You need one for each base that you cut.
Place the cardboard circle into the center of the crepe paper circle. If you want to, you can fasten it in the center so that it doesn’t move around while you finish making the favor.
Gather the edges of the crepe paper/tissue and pull them up so that it looks like a bag.
Stuff the “bag” tightly with cotton balls, shaping it as you go so that the bag is in the shape of a pumpkin. Tie a knot at the top of it.
Twist the paper at the top so that it looks like a stem. Add some glue to the “stem” so that it won’t unravel, then cover the stem with green paper.
Use a black felt pen or stickers to add a face to your pumpkin, and you’re done!

, A pumpkin collage can be an interesting piece of artwork for decorating a wall. Start with a cardboard cut-out of a pumpkin, and then fill it in with items of your choosing.


You might fill the collage with autumn leaves, photos of previous Halloweens, or images from your favorite scary movies.

, A simple wreath can be made using a wire wreath form and miniature pumpkins as follows:Place the miniature pumpkins in a circle to see how many you'll use to make a wreath. You may need around 14 to 20 pumpkins, depending on their size.
Drill a horizontal hole through each miniature pumpkin. Keep the holes as close to the bottom of the pumpkins as you can, as this will keep them hidden from view when the wreath is hanging.
String 20-gauge wire through the first pumpkin's holes. Place this pumpkin against the wire wreath form and twist the wire inside the pumpkin holes around the wire wreath form to keep in place.
Repeat for each pumpkin until all are attached to the wreath form.
Tuck dry moss into the gaps between the pumpkins. Keep this in place with more wiring.
Tie a large bow at the top of the wreath, leaving long tie lengths hanging below the wreath. Cut the ends diagonally to prevent fraying.
Hang a wire hook at the top of the wreath and hang the wreath in position on your front door.

, Pick out some mini-pumpkins at your local grocer or pumpkin patch. Cut off the tops and scoop out enough flesh to make room for a votive candle or tea light.


Push the candle or tea light into the emptied mini-pumpkin and you’re done.
Place the candle holder wherever you'd normally use a candle, using common sense to keep it away from flammable items.

, Purchase wax, wicks, and pumpkin moulds from your local craft shop. Place the wick in the mould, melt the wax down, and pour it into the mould too.


Once the wax cools, remove it from the mould and you’ve got a pumpkin candle.
You can add colors and/or scents to the wax to the candles as well.

",How to Carve a Disco Ball Pumpkin1," The pumpkin should be medium to large in size and as round as you can get it––think disco ball when selecting it!


Apply the usual pumpkin choosing requirements when selecting––choose a healthy, non-bruised pumpkin. Carve it just before your display date to avoid spoilage.;
, Scoop out the flesh using a strong spoon or other implements. Discard the flesh (or make something vaguely tasty out of it if you're brave––the seeds can be roasted if desired).

, The pumpkin should sit flat. This may necessitate removing some of the base but remember that if you do this, it'll affect where you can place the pumpkin for display or will require a surface for it to sit on (non-flammable surface if using real candles).

, Work around the pumpkin from top to bottom (or bottom to top) placing dots at evenly spaced intervals in rows around the pumpkin. These are your markers for drilling the holes next.

, If you want to be really fancy, there are drill bits designed to do this but really, any electric drill should do the job. The size of the holes is up to you––you can enlarge them by using a ""carving"" action with the drill as you make the initial hole and simply working at it until the hole is large enough.


The best look will come from trying to keep the holes the same shape all the way around. But don't despair if a few are lopsided––it'll still work.






Don't forget to also drill holes in the lid. It completes the look.







, If using live candles, make sure the surface it sits on is non-flammable.

, Either use tea light candles with real flame or use battery operated versions (LEDs). Make sure it is well lit, as this is a disco ball pumpkin after all!

, Many venues will sell carving pumpkins as Halloween approaches. Visit your local supermarket or pumpkin patch for a good offering. If you live near a farmer’s market, vendors there may also sell pumpkins.Find a location with a healthy selection of pumpkins and that have a range of sizes.


If you’re pumpkin hunting with young children, a pumpkin patch may be the most fun for them. You can find a local pumpkin patch by searching online or keeping an eye open for advertisements around the area where you live.

, When you’re choosing a pumpkin, try to pick one that’s free of nicks, bruises, and cuts. Look for a sturdy stem that doesn’t feel too bendable, and for mostly consistent color all the way around.Knock or thump on the skin like you would a melon; if you hear a hollow sound, the pumpkin is ripe.

Look for a pumpkin with a flat base. This will make it easier to display the carved pumpkin on Halloween night.
It’s not important if the pumpkin you like is clean or dirty. Remember you can always wash the pumpkin with an old cloth when you get home.

, If you’re planning on an elaborate pumpkin carving, note that a larger gourd will provide more surface space, but also takes more work to carve. Selecting a round, medium-sized pumpkin is a popular option.


If you have kids and simply plan on drawing faces on your pumpkins with a permanent marker, try picking up several small to medium samples for them to put different designs on.

, Before you start cutting, figure out what kind of design or face you want on your pumpkin: you can carve a typical “spooky” face with a toothed grin, a haunted house, or the silhouette of a cat or a bat.Many jack-o’-lantern designs are available online; try searching for more ideas. Alternatively, drop into your local library and borrow a book of carving ideas. A variety of images can be very inspirational for developing your own.

, While it’s conventional to hollow your pumpkin and then carve through the outer gourd into the hollow center, other methods of carving will allow your pumpkin to last longer, and involve less work with knives. A few popular carving options include:
/images/thumb/e/ed/Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-5-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/e/ed/Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-5-Version-2.jpg









Carve a traditional jack-o’-lantern. Plan to cut out eyes, a mouth, and perhaps a nose. This design is easiest for beginners.
Carve a silhouette. Pick a shape—for instance, a ghost—and carve out the “negative space” around the ghost’s shape, then carve out features like eyes or a mouth. You’ll end up with a circle of light around the dark shape, with lighted details.
Carve down to the pulp. For a daytime jack-o’-lantern that you don’t intend to light, use an x-acto knife to scratch away the pumpkin skin and reveal the pulp. Don’t carve all the way into the gourd.

, For traditional, silhouette and pulp carving, use a permanent marker or dry-erase marker to outline your design on the pumpkin.(Dry-erase markings can be wiped off if you mess up.) If you’d rather not draw your jack-o’-lantern design free-hand, you can find a pattern online and trace if onto your pumpkin.
/images/thumb/4/48/Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-6-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/4/48/Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-6-Version-2.jpg









If you’re decorating pumpkins with children, letting them draw the designs can be a fun way to include them, yet avoid having them handle sharp carving tools.

, Pumpkin carving can quickly become messy, and it’s best to keep that mess off the floor or kitchen table. Lay down some newspaper or a brown sack from your grocery store on a flat surface.Lay out your tools, as well as a bowl for discarded pumpkin innards.


Doing this protects the floor or table surface and makes for an easy clean-up when done. Once you’re finished carving, you can bundle up the newspapers and throw the whole mess away.

, For effective pumpkin carving, use a serrated bread knife, a jab saw (used to cut drywall), or a purpose-made serrated knife taken from a pumpkin-carving set. If you do not have a serrated knife, or if you prefer to use a straight-edged blade, opt for a paring knife or a filet knife., Measure a circle with about a 2-inch (5-cm) radius from the stem. You’ll cut around this circle to make the lid. Do not make the cut completely vertical; instead, angle the point of the knife in towards the center of the circle. The lid will then sit in a bowl-shaped indentation that prevents it from falling into the center of the pumpkin./images/thumb/6/62/Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-9-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/6/62/Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-9-Version-2.jpg









The lid doesn’t have to be cut in a circle. Try shaping the lid as a square, star or other shapes. Just make sure you keep the knife angled toward the center of the pumpkin as you carve the lid and opening.

, Use a large spoon, an ice-cream scoop, or your hands to pull all of the strands and seeds from the inside of your pumpkin. Place the seeds, pulp, and other scrapings into the large kitchen bowl that you set out earlier. Scrape the pumpkin as clean as you can, so that more light shines through your jack-o’-lantern./images/thumb/b/b7/Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-10-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/b/b7/Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-10-Version-2.jpg









This step can be skipped if you’re simply carving down to the pulp of the pumpkin, with no intention of hollowing it out.

, Use a gentle back and forth motion to cut into the pumpkin, and take your time. Make sure to cut precisely along the design that you’ve traced on the pumpkin’s surface. Draw the knife back and forth, while maintaining a steady downward pressure. Keep following your pattern until you’ve carved out the entire design./images/thumb/d/d5/Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-12.jpg/v4-550px-Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-12.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d5/Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-12.jpg/v4-300px-Carve-a-Pumpkin-Step-12.jpg









If a cut section of your design doesn’t remove easily the first time, run the blade around it again and then push on that section from the inside. You may also find that a toothpick stabbed into the section will help you to pull it out.
Use caution when wielding a knife. Cut away from yourself; never pull the knife up towards yourself through the pumpkin.

, Traditionally, jack-o’-lanterns are lit with candlesticks or tea lights. If you choose to illuminate your carved pumpkin with candles, do not leave them lit overnight or if you’re away from the house.]

Ventilate as needed. If you do choose to use a real candle, make sure your carving will provide the flame with enough oxygen to keep burning. If you’ve cut several large holes in your pumpkin, you should be fine. If not, consider cutting a small vent in the lid, or remove the lid entirely.

, If you’d prefer not to illuminate your jack-o’-lantern with a lit candle, you can substitute an artificial light source for the same effect. Flashlights and flickering LEDs are popular modern options.LED and other artificial lights are safer (less likely to start a fire) and can burn all night, unlike tea lights.

, If you’re using a candle in your pumpkin, place it in an area away from flammable items. For instance, don’t place it near a hay bale or scarecrow; those items could light on fire if your pumpkin gets jostled or knocked over. Additionally, take care that a trick-or-treaters’ dangling costume won’t get caught by the candle’s flame.


If you’re using a candle to light your pumpkin and placing it on anything wooden, place a dinner plate down first, to catch wax and avoid setting wooden porches, tables, or stairs on fire.

Mix 1 teaspoon bleach per gallon of water to create enough water to dunk the pumpkin into.,
Dunk the pumpkin into the bleach solution, covering completely.,
Remove the pumpkin from the bleach solution and pat dry with paper towels or sponges.

,
Every day, moisturize the pumpkin with the bleach solution.",How to Keep Halloween Pumpkins from Molding2," You'll need a vat and a good amount of bleach/water, depending on the size of the pumpkin.


The idea is that bleach is an antimicrobial, and that water will hydrate the skin of the pumpkin like a moisturizer would on human skin.

, Soak the pumpkin in the bleach solution for approximately 8 hours.

,, Spray the outside and inside with the bleach solution used to treat the pumpkin initially. Soak up any excess moisture after spraying. Moisture is the ally of mold.

"
"
Purchase a pumpkin preservative.,
Spray the pumpkin with the preservative or dunk the pumpkin into the preservative.,
Continue to spray the pumpkin with preservative every day.",How to Keep Halloween Pumpkins from Molding3," Pumpkin preservative, like Pumpkin Fresh, are available online and at Halloween specialty stores. Pumpkin preservatives may contain water, sodium tetraborate decahydrate (borax), and/or sodium benzoate (a preservative and fungicide). They act as fungicides.

, Spraying is more convenient, but dunking may be more long-lasting.


If choosing to dunk, be sure to pat the pumpkin dry. Remember that mold hits where moisture fits.

, Spray the outside and inside with the preservative and watch as it fights off mold and decay. Pumpkin preservatives help the pumpkin last relatively mold-free for up to 14 days.

"
"
Do not use white glue to preserve a pumpkin.,
Do not use petroleum jelly to preserve a pumpkin.,
Do not use acrylic spray to preserve a pumpkin.",How to Keep Halloween Pumpkins from Molding4," The idea is that white glue is supposed to create a seal around the inside of the pumpkin, preventing moisture from developing into mold. Sadly, white glue just hastens the demise of the pumpkin.

, The idea here is that the petroleum jelly is supposed to keep the pumpkin from dehydrating, thereby staving off decay. Unfortunately, this method also hastens the production of mold.

, Again, this method is supposed to seal a pumpkin's inner flesh, creating a barrier that keeps out mold. The idea is better than its execution: pumpkins sprayed with acrylic do not outlast pumpkins that aren't treated at all.

Make a witch hat decoration.,
Get creative with your witch hats.,
Make paper witch decorations.,
Make witch legs.Stuff a pair of stripy stockings with whatever you’ve got handy — batting or polyester filling will work nicely.,
Make dangling witch legs.Follow the instructions for making witches legs — stuffing tights and sewing witchy boots on to the ends of them.,
Make lollipop witch brooms.You’ll need lollipops (big round or oval ones work best), a brown felt pen, tissue paper (the fancy stuff you wrap presents with, not kleenex), scissors, twine, and name tags (optional).",How to Make Halloween Decorations2," You can do this using paper, felt, or if you’re comfortable sewing, you can use fabric. You’ll need a quarter-circle for the top and a circle with a hole in the middle for the brim.


If you’re short on time, you can buy plain black ready-made witch hats from the dollar store or anywhere else that sells Halloween costumes, and then decorate those.
Once you have your hat, decorate it with artificial gems, glitter, stickers, felt pieces, ribbon, sequins, or whatever else tickles your fancy.
You can even make a witch-hat collage by pasting various items onto a paper witch hat or a piece of cardboard that has been cut into the shape of a witch’s hat.
You can use the decorated hat as a centerpiece on your table or on other surfaces around your house.
You can also hang the hat from the ceiling — just make sure it’s low enough that people can see your decorations, but out of the way so that no one will accidentally bonk into it and knock it down.

, Use decorated witch hats or paper cut-outs of witch hats in varying sizes around your house. You can use small witch hats for bunting or garland, for instance, alternating the hats with cut-outs of black cats, brooms, and candy corn.


You could even make a witch hat in a candy corn theme by sewing or pasting together fabric that has orange at the base, yellow in the middle, and white at the tip.

, There are lots of ways to turn the silhouette of a witch into decorations, including witch garlands, streamers, collages, cards, signs, and cut-outs.


Witch silhouettes are especially effective decorations when placed against a window or white surface.
With the witch come some other traditional symbols that can be added into your artwork, including the black cat, the moon, and the broomstick.

, If you’ll be putting the legs outside, avoid filling them with paper products or anything else that is easily damaged by water.


Draw and cut out witchy-looking boots on a fabric of your choosing (black is recommended). Draw each boot on 2 pieces of fabric (or 1 piece folded in half), and make it extra large as it will shrink when sewn and stuffed.
Cut, sew, and stuff the boots, and attach them to the ends of the stockings.
Put some wire in the legs to make them bendy, then stick them in a prop cauldron to make it look like the witch fell in her own brew. You can also have the legs coming out from under a flower pot or anywhere else for that matter.
If you’re a film buff you could make it look like your house fell on a witch (like in The Wizard of Oz) by stuffing a pair of black and white striped stockings and putting sparkly red shoes on them, then fastening them to the ground near the foundation of your house.

, Once that’s done, make the witch a skirt:


Cut 20-inch-long strips of black tulle or another crunchy fabric that will mimic a fluffy crinoline.
Cut the handle off a cheap umbrella (be careful that you don’t hurt yourself doing this), then tuck and tie the legs and crinoline up into the spokes of the umbrella.
The crinoline should hide all of the metal in the umbrella so that it just looks like a large skirt with a witch’s legs sticking out. Fasten it to your ceiling (you can cut a hole int the top of the umbrella and pull the stockings through to use as a hanging device) and Voila!

,


Use the brown felt pen to color in the lollipop sticks brown. You can also use black or dark brown if you think this would look better.
Cut a bunch of squares in your tissue paper, all of the same size. Four inches by four inches is recommended.
Gently put the lollipop stick through the middle of the tissue square and then pull the tissue down until it rests on top of the lollipop.
Pull the tissue around the lollipop candy, and then scrunch the rest of the tissue up before tying it with twine to hold it in place. You may need to trim the edges of the tissue so that the broom can stand upright.
These can double as place settings at the dinner table as well as party favors. If you want to use them as place settings, tie a name tag around the section of the broom that’s tied with twine.

Make fabric ghosts.,
Make paper cut-out ghosts.,
Make use of your bedsheets.,
Make a ghost out of cheesecloth and fabric stiffener.This is just one of the many ways in which you can transform household objects into ghost decorations.,
Make a ghost out of a styrofoam head, a wire hanger, and some fabric.You can give the ghost broader shoulders by adding additional wire and extra fabric to the hanger.",How to Make Halloween Decorations3," White fabric scraps of all sorts can be easily transformed into ghosts. You don’t even need to sew them: you can just cut out squares of fabric and drape or tie them into your desired shapes.



One popular method is to scrunch up newspaper into your desired ghosty shape, drape a piece of felt or fabric overtop of it, tie the fabric with twine to form the ghost’s “head”, and then draw a ghosty face on it.
Use white fabric scraps to make ghost cut-outs to turn into pictures or bunting. You can also sew little white scraps of fabric into finger puppets, or stick them on to empty toilet rolls to make ghosts.

, Use card stock, construction paper, or simple white printer paper and transform it into ghosts of all sorts, including ghost pictures or cut-outs, ghost collages, and ghost bunting or garlands.


You can also cut out a large ghost shape from cardboard and use it as the base for a collage.

, Drape white or off-white bedsheets over objects around your house to give the impression of ghosts.


You can also make your room look like a room in an old haunted mansion by covering nearly all of your furniture in sheets and then putting spiderwebs in the corners.
You might even add a skull and/or a crystal ball to a table, and play some creepy Halloween sounds in the room.

,


Start by creating a frame for your ghost’s shape. Stack two cups vertically end to end (with the rims facing out), and place a small balloon on top. Lay down some newspaper or a plastic bag beneath this to catch any liquid that follows from the cloth as it dries.
Cut 8 inches of cheesecloth. If the ends are ragged, all the better, as this will make your ghost look more creepy and old. Off-white and beige cheesecloths are good choices.
Soak the cheesecloth in fabric stiffener. Use a bowl for this. Make sure the cheesecloth is well coated before you take it out.
Remove the cheesecloth from the bowl of fabric stiffener and immediately place it over the balloon-cup frame. It should take roughly 10 minutes to dry.
Once the cloth is dry, pop the balloon by poking a pin through the cheesecloth. This will leave you with a hardened ghost shape.
Now you can decorate your ghost in any way you want. When you’re happy with it, pull some fishing line, thread, or twine through the top of the ghost and hang it up.

,


Bend the hook of the hanger so that it’s straight, then gently push the styrofoam head down onto it. Now it’ll look like a head sitting on top of shoulders.
Drape white fabric over the head and hanger, and then adjust the fabric until you’re happy with how it looks, cutting it to make it look more ragged, or bulking it up in places to make it look more like a person’s figure.
If you want you can add long wire arms to the hanger and then put stuff white latex gloves at the ends of the “arms” to make it look more like a person.
Once you’re happy with how it looks, hang it up by tying fishing line around its neck and fastening it to your ceiling or anywhere else you like.
You can find styrofoam heads at most Halloween supply shops, but also some beauty supply and craft shops.

Make spider-shaped paper cut-outs.,
Make a spider from repurposed items.,
Make a spider web.",How to Make Halloween Decorations4," Draw spider shapes on construction paper or card stock and cut them out, then fix them to your walls or to string to make bunting or garland. You can also use the spider shape as the basis for a collage.


Paper spiders can be stuck all over the wall, among fake webs, and in bushes. Be careful about putting the paper spiders outside, as they might get wrecked if it rains.
Use cardboard for larger spiders that can be hung from ceilings or greater heights to dangle in people's faces. You might cut up garbage bags and glue them onto these so that they’re shiny black spiders.

, As an example, you could make a spider from an egg carton and pipe cleaners:Cut out an egg carton piece to form the spider’s body. Paint in the color you want the spider to be — black, neon, purple with red spots, etc. You might even use a glow-in-the-dark or black-light paint.
Pierce four holes down one side and another four down the other side of the egg carton piece, then slip pipe cleaners into the holes each side to form eight legs.
Reshape the legs so that the spider can stand properly and perhaps have two legs splayed in front.
Glue on a bunch of pre-made googly eyes or paint them on to make the spider’s face. You can also add fangs.
If you want the spider to be larger, you can use two egg carton pieces for the body, and then glue on a ping pong ball or something similar to form the spider’s head.

, If you want a web or two for all the spiders you’re making, you have many options:


A string web is made by weaving a web using string and a wire frame, and then gluing the cutting out the round part of the web. You then hang the web from the ceiling using another piece of string. (Paper or light plastic spiders go well on this web.)
A pipe cleaner web is made from twisting together 4 pipe cleaners and then working outward until you’ve reached the desired web size. (Pipe cleaner spiders go well with this web.)
A doily web is ideally made of crocheted doilies that have been sprayed black. Use string to attach the doilies to a transparent or loosely woven sheet, keeping space between them so that they look like different webs.
A cheesecloth web will look like an old abandoned cobweb. You cut it into the shapes you want, and then gently pull on it so that the strings come apart and look more web-like. Then you hang it from your ceiling/on your walls/in your windows.

Place the pumpkin on display.",How to Carve a Disco Ball Pumpkin2," Remove any dirt or marks from the surface and allow to dry before gluing.

, Wear eye protection and gloves when doing this, to avoid being cut by any potential shards.


Alternatively, if you have the time and patience, cut them more evenly to look like the real pieces of a disco ball but be aware that doing this will be time-consuming and potentially frustrating.







, Apply them all over the pumpkin, leaving small even gaps between the pieces but don't worry too much about making the pieces appear as if they fit together (unless you're doing the very finicky version).

,


If anywhere looks naked on the pumpkin, add a few squirts of liquid glitter to infill but this is optional.







, The CD pumpkin disco ball looks best when light is reflected off it, so place near other lit pumpkins or in the glare of some light, such as a lamp, room light or other light sources.

Planters Punch - This punch will capture the spirit of pirate grog with the rum and citrus flavors, add a few other ingredients make it much more interesting than that.",How to Have a Pirate Costume Party," If you send them too early, a lot of people will forget, send them too late, and they may have already agreed to be elsewhere. It is important that you do specify on the invitation, that it is a pirate party and you must be appropriately dressed to be allowed in! If you give your guests the chance, a lot will choose not to join in with the dressing up. Now, you can be as strict as you want to be about the dress code. You must remember that not everyone does like to dress up, so maybe you'll let them in wearing a pirate hat and eye patch, it is really up to you. To keep in the theme, you can always state on the invitation that if they do not dress up they will have to walk the plank, or some other forfeit that fits with the theme.;
, If this is not possible, give them the names and telephone numbers of local shops and a list of on-line shops that you have checked out for them. This will reduce the risk of some people not dressing up.

, Have categories, such as the funniest costume, the sexiest costume, the best pair or what ever you choose. Let your guests know that there is a competition. It is amazing how this can really get them trying to outdo each other!

, You need to make sure that you give a variety of ideas so that the people who are less keen can choose a more simple costume.


Some examples of ladies costumes:


Pirate Wench Ladies can wear a peasant style dress, or blouse and a long skirt. There are many versions that also have a lace up bodice and bandana. Although there are sexy, short versions on the market, there are also longer styles available.


Elizabeth Swann A character from Pirates of The Caribbean and governed by the Disney licensing laws. Elizabeth's costume changes many times throughout the three films. She wears Georgian dresses, long, off white shift dress and full shirt, long waistcoat and pantaloons when she is pretending to be a male crewman.

Pirate Crew These costumes tend to be similar to the men with a stripped top, pantaloons or skirt, sash tied at the waist and a bandana or hat.

Mary Read Mary Read was born in 1685 in England and was only 1 of 2 known women pirates. Ladies on board ship were considered to be unlucky and Mary had to dress as a man.

Anne Bonny Anne Bonny is probably the most famous female pirate. She was a ruthless plunderer, raider, and menace to the seafaring vessels in the Caribbean Sea. She is commonly referred to as ""Toothless Annie"". Although she dressed and fought as a man, she was soon discovered and instead of bowing down to the pressure from the crew, she killed all who opposed her. Not a lady to have a row with!


Some examples of male costumes & characters:


Captain Hook From Peter Pan. There have been a few interpretations of the villain Captain Hook. The character has starred in Disney's cartoon version of Peter Pan and in many films, including the film 'Hook' where he was played by Dustin Hoffman. Typically a long frock coat is worn with pantaloons and a frilly shirt. He wears long, black boots and a large hat. A long, curly wig, moustache and a hook finish off the costume.
Captain Jack Sparrow - From Pirates Of The Caribbean. This is a Disney production and therefore has strict licensing laws attached to it. A costume, unless licensed cannot be called Captain Jack Sparrow and you will probably see similar looking costumes called Pirate Captain etc. Typically a long, distressed frock coat or waistcoat is worn with a full shirt. Trousers are tucked into boots and he wears a bandana or a 3 pointed hat. Dark eyes and a goatee type beard finish off the costume.
Pirate Crew In most pirate films, the crew will play a part. They are normally dressed in stripped tops, cut away trousers, sashes tied around the waist and a bandana. They can be men or women.
Blackbeard Blackbeard's real name was Edward Teach. He was a ruthless pirate who was named after his long, black beard.

Long John Silver From Treasure Island. Ruthless pirate looking for treasure hidden by his old crew mate Billy Bones. Apart from the normal pirate attire, a peg leg is also required.



, Pirate cuisine generally fell into one of two categories - plentiful or starvation. While at sea for long periods of time, fresh food would be scarce. But once the ships docked in the Caribbean, then the pirates would have plenty of food on which to feast. For your theme party I recommend a combination of shipboard and island dishes.



Salmagundi - This pirate stew, based on a British recipes, was essentially a conglomeration of whatever they had on hand.

Hardtack - This type of non-perishable biscuit was a staple aboard pirate ships. I would find some plain biscuits down at your local store.

Fish Food - Seafood would most certainly be part of a pirate's diet.

Jerk Chicken - When pirates landed on an island in the Caribbean, the eating was good. Barbecue was a common method for preparing food.
Puerto Rican Rice with Pigeon Peas - This is a very hearty side dish, and if you leave out the salt pork, it would serve as a main dish for any vegetarians at your party.
Sweet Potato Bread - This dessert bread incorporates many of the ingredients the pirates would enjoy on the islands such as sweet potatoes, coconut and bananas.

Coconut Balls - You could rename these little sweets ""canon balls"" to tie in with your party theme.

, It is possible to buy inflatable & feather parrots quite cheaply. Also, checkout your local balloon shop as they will do a range of balloons that should include toucans, Parrots, cocktail drinks, palm trees and pirates that will help to create your atmosphere.

,


A treasure hunt could be arranged (works well for the children). It will take some time to organise but great fun. You can either give a starting clue and they have to find the next clue until they find the treasure, or draw out a map, split it into 4 and they have to find the pieces of the map before they can find the 'treasure'. What about getting your guests to wear hooks and they have to Try to pick items off the floor, or pass balloons to each other. The ideas are endless. Please add your own if you have ideas for this theme.

, Don't forget bottles of rum (probably mixed with coke)

Fruit Punch - Here's a punch for your friends who don't indulge in alcohol. Sadly, they'll probably win all the prizes for walking the plank without falling.

Make a Halloween wreath.,
Make glowing ping pong ball decorations.,
Make paper bats.",How to Make Halloween Decorations5," Add Halloween-themed items to a plain wreath to dress it up. You can purchase a pre-made wreath base, or you can make a wreath from scratch with Evergreen tree branches, twigs, or burlap.


To make the wreath look extra Halloweeny, spray paint it black, orange, purple, silver, grey — or any other color you’d like.
Use a hot glue gun (or have your parents help you) to glue black tulle, orange feathers, fake eyeballs, fake spiders, or other Halloween-y items into the wreath.

, For this you only need felt pens, ping pong balls, electric tea lights, and something sharp to poke holes into the ping pong balls with (scissors or a screwdriver will work).


Just draw on the ping pong balls and then pop them on top of an electric tea light and turn it on to see them glow and flicker. Creepy eyeballs and faces are good choices for this craft!
Another option is to attach pipecleaners to the sides of a ping pong ball and make it look like a spider — a glowing spider, that is!

, Bats, like spiders, are another popular creature featured in Halloween decorations. Use construction paper or card stock to make bat-shaped cut-outs that you can hang around your house.


You might even use a large bat-shaped cut-out as the base of a Halloween-themed collage.

Plan some Halloween games to play during the party.,
Buy or make a cool costume.",How to Celebrate Halloween as a Teenager1," Do you have a favorite scary movie, or a favorite spooky character? Do you like zombies, or ghosts, or ghouls? Create a theme around that!


Your theme can dictate the kinds of costumes your guests wear. For example, you might host a Dead Rock Star party, where everyone must come dressed as their favorite dead rock star.You can also theme your games and activities at your party. One idea is to have a pumpkin themed party—have your guests compete to carve the best pumpkin, and then serve as judges for the finished products.;
, There are countless fun recipes for Halloween treats that you can try out and serve at your party.


Try making some “Witches Fingers” by dyeing some honey with red food coloring, dipping pretzel rods in it, and rolling the honey-dipped pretzels in crushed peanuts.Craft special Halloween-themed drinks for your party guests. You could try the “Pugsley Adams Punch” which calls for equal parts orange juice, white grape juice, cranberry juice, pineapple juice, apple juice, and lemon-lime soda, then garnish the glasses with a gummy worm., Set aside a room in your house, or use your garage or backyard, and create a walk-through haunted house to scare your party guests with.


Use spooky sound effects and music to make the house even scarier. You can buy Halloween sound effects CDs or download them to play at the party.
Use red and black lights to create a spooky ambiance in your haunted house and at your party.Have friends volunteer to hide in the haunted house and jump out to scare other guests as they walk through.

, These can range from costume charades where your guests have to guess each other’s costumes, to playing hide-and-seek in the backyard once it gets dark.


One fun game to create for your guests is a DIY costume table. Use some leftover materials from school projects or crafts and allow your guests to make their own masks when they arrive.Another activity to try is to have your guests “guess the body part” in covered boxes. Use things like cooked noodles to feel like intestines, peeled grapes to feel like eyes, and a chunk of jello to feel like a liver. Challenge your guests to guess which body part they’ve felt!, Decide if you want to go more on the scary side, or if you want to dress up as something more subtle. If you themed your party, you can make a costume that matches that theme.


Many teenagers like to dress up as their favorite celebrities for Halloween. To do this, try to include things in your costume that make it more obvious who you are dressed up as. For example, if you are dressing up like Taylor Swift, you might draw a number 12 on your hand, and carry around a fake Grammy award.Zombies are a popular costume idea with many people in the last few years. Use Halloween make-up, fake blood, and special effects to make yourself look like the undead."

Pumpkin favors
Candy corn crispy treats
Squash displays
Carved apple people
Sweetcorn drawings.;
, Draw pumpkin shapes on orange cardstock. Use online pumpkin templates if you're not good at drawing the shape freehand. Use the cut-outs as follows:


Stick them on your front door, walls, mirrors, etc. using double -sided tape or poster tack, for decoration
Attach them to a long string or ribbon, spacing them at even intervals, to form a garland.

, Work from a wreath base, such as a foam/twig or metallic wreath ring.


Purchase artificial leaves in fall colors. These can often be found in bags in craft stores and dollar stores during the fall season. Also purchase some small artificial pumpkins and squash and find some small pine cones.
Arrange the artificial leaves all the way around the wreath, gluing them in place. Overlap them to ensure complete coverage.
Attach a small artificial pumpkin or squash here and there. Do the same with a few small pine cones. Leave the top of the wreath free for attaching the ribbon.
Attach a wide burlap ribbon to the top center of the wreath. Knot in place and leave a long piece intact for creating a hanging loop from.
Done. You can now hang the wreath from your front door.

, Work from a wreath base, such as a foam/twig or metallic wreath ring.


Find a selection of Halloween colored ribbons. Orange, black and white make a good color combination. Different patterns on the ribbons work best for this wreath, such as spots, stripes, designs, etc., so be sure to vary the ribbons used.
Wrap the whole wreath in a plain colored ribbon. This covers up the wreath base, so that the color shows through wherever there are any gaps in the wreath.
Cut out lengths from the ribbon. Each piece needs to be the same length, and it must be long enough to go around the wreath, be tied in a knot and have a decent length still sticking out of the edges.
Tie each piece onto the wreath. Use a square knot to tie the first piece to the wreath, adding each piece closely next to the last tied piece, until all of the wreath has been covered by ribbon pieces. The edges of the ribbons should be facing outward, away from the wreath.
Cut the ends of the ribbon pieces to neaten and prevent fraying. Either cut a diagonal edge or a V-edge.
Tie a hanging string to the top center of the wreath. It's now ready to hang up.

, There are plenty of delicious treats to be made that rely on pumpkins, apples, squash, nuts, sweetcorn, etc., that do not require spooky features.

, Use delicious candies. Add a label that brings positive messages, such as ""You picked a sweet treat from my bowl and here is a sweet treat for your soul."" This is in contrast to the more ghoulish and macabre candy bags out there.

, Use the usual shapes but use bright frosting and edible glitter to make them fun and quirky. When making the cookies, pierce a small hole in each one, then thread the cookies through a long piece of ribbon or string. Hang the completed cookies up as a cookie garland.

, You could also make candy corn crispy treats or use candy corn on a variety of toppings for cupcakes, cakes or cookies.

, A cupcake isn't scary, at least not these designs:


A ghost cupcake. This is such a simple cupcake and the kids will love it. Make basic cupcakes. Simply pipe a large amount of white buttercream frosting in a cone shape on top of each cupcake. Add two small chocolate chips for eyes on the ghost. That's it. You can add a third chocolate chip for the mouth, but it's not essential. Make as many as you want, they look great on display together.
A spider-in-the-web cupcake. Make basic cupcakes. Frost each one with a layer of basic orange frosting. Pipe black frosting onto the top of each cupcake to form a web over the whole top. Then add a large black candy jujube in the center for the spider's body. Add eight ""legs"" from licorice or similar candy lengths.
Make a candy corn cupcake. Make orange colored cupcakes (use food coloring or orange juice for the color). Frost with white buttercream frosting and top each cupcake with a candy corn. This looks even better if you can match the cupcake case with orange white and yellow colors.

, Purchase disposable gloves, the ones that are slightly see-through. Fill each glove with candies and tie off with a ribbon. Then slide a Halloween plastic ring onto one finger, such as a ghost, spider or witch ring. This is Halloween-themed rather than spooky.

, Focus on the light, happy, and positive elements of Halloween. Make your pumpkins smile and equally, make all crafts focused on smiling, carrying positive messages, and relying on bright colors.

, Bring lots of light into your Halloween with these lovely jars.


Choose some Mason jars. Clean them and allow to thoroughly dry.
Cut out templates for Halloween designs on the jars. These could include a pumpkin, a cat, a leaf, etc.
Attach the template to the Mason jar. Use double sided tape or poster tack to hold it in place, especially around the edges.
Spray paint the rest of the Mason jar. You can use a bright color or a transparent color, whatever you like.
Remove the template. Leave this portion of the jar paint-free.
Tie some raffia or ribbon around the mouth of the jar.
Place a tea light or votive candle in the base of the jar.
Light the candle with a long-stemmed match. Place it wherever you'd like a pretty glow.

, Some ideas include:


Decorate orange and/or white balloons. For orange balloons, use a black marker to draw on pumpkin face designs. For white balloons, draw round eyes and a round mouth, for ghost balloons.
Make paper chains from orange, white and black paper or gift wrapping. Hang them around the house for decoration.
Make a hanging sign using cardboard letters that spell out the words ""Boo"" or ""Happy Halloween"". Hang either vertically or horizontally, and jazz up with ribbon or sparkles.

Prepare your materials.,
Cut pieces of yarn and secure the frame.,
Add more framework strands.,
Weave the strands of the web.,
Clean up loose ends.,
Add spiders.",How to Make a Spider Web1," Determine and measure where you will be placing your spider web so you know what size yarn to cut. Remember the wider the point, the larger your web.Any color will do but white or silver are more traditional colors.;
, Cut two pieces to form one vertical length of yarn and one horizontal length which will meet in the center to become the frame of your web.The length of each piece of string will depend on where you will be hanging it, so measure the string based on the location.


For example, if you want to hang the web from one tree to another, the area between the trees will define the length of the frame of the web. Alternatively, if your web is being hung on the front door, the width of the door is your limit.
You can tape to the wall or tie off to nails in the wall to secure the framework., Tie a string from one corner of the frame to the middle of the circle. Complete this for each corner, then the web will have eight spokes (framework threads).


Eight spokes should be sufficient but you can always add more at a later time if needed.

, Start from the center (where the vertical and horizontal pieces criss-cross) and weave the yarn around in a spiral shape. Each time you come to a supporting string, tie your yarn into an overhand knot to secure the shape of the web.Leave plenty of space between each capture thread layer to give the effect of the space that you see on a real web.
If you run out of a length of string, simply tie it off, tie on a new piece, and keep weaving.
Make sure the strings are taut to avoid drooping.

, Cut off or tighten loose pieces and generally tidy up the web as needed. The web is complete when you've finished weaving enough of the spiral to reach the edge of the frame.


If you need to strengthen parts of the web that might be affected by cutting off loose ends or knots, use hot glue. Hot glue is not only fast but it works well on fabrics and woods., Use store-bought plastic or furry spider toys, or make your own from pipe cleaners or similar items.

Gather three white or black pipe cleaners for each web.,
Form the frame of your web.,
Create the strands of your web.,
Weave the pipe cleaner around the framework of the web.,
Finish the web.",How to Make a Spider Web2," Pipe cleaners are pliable wires that are covered in fluffy fabric.


You can try other colors if you're feeling adventurous.
Pipe cleaners can be found at local arts and crafts stores like Michael's or Hobby Lobby.

, Twist two pipe cleaners together at the exact center of each stick to form an ""X"". Twist the third pipe cleaner down the center of the ""X"", creating what looks like a snowflake shape.The sticks should be spread out in a circle, leaving even gaps between each stick. This forms the web framework.
If you are having trouble twisting the pipe cleaners together, you can use hot glue instead.

, Twist on a new pipe cleaner about an inch (2.5cm) from where the sticks all join. This starts the capture web which you'll be weaving around the framework.

, Each time you reach a framework thread, twist or loop the capture thread around it once to secure it.


Avoid pulling on the pipe cleaners as it can remove some of the tuft surrounding the wire.
Continue weaving in this manner to create the spiral. Each time a capture thread runs out, simply wind on a new thread in the spot where the last thread left off and keep weaving.

, After winding the last strand, trim loose ends using sharp scissors. There are two choices for finishing the web:


Leave a bit of the threads from the framework extending beyond the capture thread spiral––this looks jagged and is typical of the cartoon style caricature of spider webs.
Weave a capture thread as a border on the edge of the framework. This looks neat and finished, like a tidy spider worked there.

You can find doilies among old belongings, at your local thrift store, and at your local arts and crafts store.
Wash and dry the doilies if they are used or old.

, Lay the doilies flat and spray with the black paint, passing over several times for complete color. Allow to dry, then repeat on the other side. Hang to dry when complete.Choose a spot with open ventilation and cover the work surface with cardboard or newspaper to prevent staining the surface underneath.

,


Space the doilies at an acceptable distance from each other to give the impression of different spiders weaving their webs. Tack in place with black thread or hot glue. Apply as many as will fit nicely.

, Tie one end of black embroidery thread to the back of one doily. Thread this on the curtain from one web to the next. Don't overdo this--just a few strands here and there will give the effect of loose webs.

, Use some of the embroidery thread to hold the curtain in place as if spiders have tied up the curtain while they were weaving. Hang over a good light source, like a window or anyplace like a skylight or a screen with a light behind it.

Plan your haunted path.,
Enlist the help of your spooky friends.,
Come up with a theme.",How to Make a Haunted House1," Before you start preparing your home, you need to decide what the guests will see. Will you commit to decorating the outside of the house, or will you focus on the inside? Will you decorate all the rooms in the house, or just a few key rooms and the hallway that the guests will pass through? Here's what you should consider:


The haunted house can be as big or small as you want it to be. You can decorate every room in your house or just focus on one room, or even the garage. In fact, a series of condensed rooms can easily give anyone the creeps, because they will know that there could be a ghoul hiding just a few feet away!
Once you've planned the path, you can think more about the tone you want to set in the home. Will this house be aimed to make people laugh, or will it freak people out?
Think about who will be following your haunted path. Will the audience be filled with little kids, or older adults? This will also determine what you put in your house.;
, It will be nearly impossible to pull off making a haunted house on your own. Not only will your friends be able to decorate, but they will also be able to guide and spook your guests throughout the haunted house. Here are a few things your friends can do:


They can dress up as ghosts or goblins and grab your guests at random times when they least expect it.
They can randomly shout or make noise in the haunted house when it's eerily quiet.
They can help ""guide"" the guests through the different haunted rooms, and can be in charge of different activities or games.
If you don't have any friends who want to participate, consider hiring actors.

, The more specific your haunted house, the more scary it will be. Decide if you want a traditional haunted house, or if it's the house of a serial killer, or even an abandoned insane asylum or hospital. Your theme will determine how you decorate your haunted house. Another good idea for a theme is something really cute but with scary things hidden in the details. Your guests would not expect a scare from a seemingly cute and innocent house. If you want this can be just one room.


If you really want your haunted house to be authentic, come up with a story for why the house is haunted. Is it haunted by an old lady whose husband disappeared into thin air? Is it haunted by a family that was brutally murdered in the basement?
You can tell your guests the haunted story as they enter the haunted house.

Create an eerie effect through lighting.,
Use special effects.,
Create spooky noises.",How to Make a Haunted House2," Do not put a lot of lights in your haunted house, or people will be too relaxed. They will also be able to tell where your spooky friends are hiding. If it's dark, they will be tense and have a better time. Just make sure your guests have enough light to get through the house safely. Here are some ways to use the lighting to create a haunted effect:


Consider putting your guests in a very dark room and giving them flashlights to try to find the way out.
Replace your lamps with green bulbs and light then dimly around the house.
If you choose to use any traditional lamps, drape them with cobwebs and tape rubber bats to the insides.
Have a room or hallway where the guests have to wear blindfolds to make it through. Make sure the guests are comfortable with this.
Light a spotlight under a spiderweb or fake creepy insect to create a spooky shadow.
Drape black plastic bags around the furniture to catch a little bit of light in an eerie way.

, Try mirrors, black lights, and smoke to confuse the visitors. The special effects will make your visitors feel more shocked and spooked at every turn. Here are a few special effects you can add to your haunted home:


Fog machines are your friend! You can find fog machines for around $30, and they are a must-have for your haunted house. Fog makes it harder for the visitors of the haunted house to see and will make their hearts beat faster too.
Put strobe lights in one room to create a dramatic, slow-motion effect to the madness.
If you're using a black light in your haunted house, you can put scary things on the walls with neon spray paint, and the paint will glow like crazy. You can write ""HELP!"" or ""R.I.P."" or use a thick line of spray paint so it leaks and looks like blood!

Just make sure to spray paint cardboard or something that you can throw out.


Use spray bottles filled with water to create mists that your guests have to walk through.

, The sounds in the haunted house will scare your visitors and will keep them on their toes. The trick to having spooky noises is to time them perfectly and not use them too often, or your guests won't be surprised. Here are some tricks to creating some scary sounds:


Put a few coins in an empty soda can and tie it to a string. Have your volunteers shake the can from time to time.
Have a recording of a different spooky sound in every room. One room can have the sound of a chainsaw, while another can have the sound of a woman screaming.
Your volunteers can scamper from one side of an empty room to another to create a scary sound.
Use silence to your advantage. Pick some key moments to keep the house silent so your guests will be even more startled by the next sound.

"
"
Scare your guests with your volunteers.,
Have spooky activities for your guests.,
Scare your guests by tricking them.",How to Make a Haunted House3," There are a number of ways that your friends can step out and scare your guests. Here are a few things they can do:


After a bout of silence, a spooky ghost can jump out and scare your guests. Try having the ghost pop out of a closet.
Have a volunteer grip guest's shoulder. Have him do this slowly so the guest thinks it's just another guest at first.
Bring your guests in a dark room. Have your volunteer turn on a flashlight under his face and laugh maniacally.
Have one of your volunteers get in line behind a pack of guests, and wait for them to slowly realize that he is there.
Have one of your guests dress up like a famous horror film character, such as Jason, or Freddy.
Have a door that your guests have to go through that is difficult to open. The guest will try the doorknob again and again, and just when he gives up, a ghost will open the door and pop out.
Gory things do not scare people, while surprising things do. Gore is too overdone, and seeing some fake blood on the floor of your haunted house will provide no reaction from the guests other than a yawn. However, if you place a ""victim"" who is actually playing dead beside the blood, your guests will be scared out of their wits if he jumps out at them!

, If you want your haunted house to be a bit less terrifying and more fun for your guests, you can arrange to have a different spooky activity in different rooms. Here are some activities to try:


Have a tub of cold water with fake snakes slithering in them. Place some coins on the bottom. Tell your guests they can't move on until they reach down and find a coin.
Instead of bobbing for apples, carve apples to look like skulls and play bobbing for skulls!
Peel the skin off a bunch of grapes and put it in a bowl. Cover the bowl and tell your guests to put their hands inside and tell you what they feel. Correct answer: eyeballs!
Put cold spaghetti in another bowl and have your guests grab them without seeing what they're touching. This time, you've created a bowl of worms!

, Here are a few ways to scare your guests even more by tricking them when they least expect it:


Try the mirror trick. Have your guests open a room where there is nothing but a full length mirror covered in cobwebs. Give them a few seconds to stare at the mirror and then have a goblin or ghost jump out at them!
Have a room with a closed coffin in the center. Have a few activities or surprises to keep the guests busy in the room. Then, right before they leave the room, have a ""skeleton"" jump out of the casket!
Set up a few fake dummies throughout the haunted house. Have your friends blend in with the dummies, and then jump out at your guests when they least expect it. This will work especially well at the entrance or exit of the house.

",How to Have a Fun and Safe Halloween Party (for Kids)," Jot down people you are thinking of inviting. Then, cross out people. Cross out the people who are too crazy (or very hyper!). Those people can actually ruin the party. If you have a special amount of people who you are allowed to invite, stick to that. Usually, 8 or less people is a good amount.;
, If school is that day, choose a time after 5:00 so everyone can finish the homework they have and get ready. If not a school day, choose a time after 2:00. About 2 to 3 hours for the whole party is good.

, You can buy ones already made from the store or make your own. Write down what it is, what the time is, what day, your phone number, and when to R.S.V.P.

, The dollar store has nice things, for only a dollar each! Look for fun lights, fake spiderwebs, and anything that can scare someone. Some dollar stores or other places may have CDs that have spooky noises on them. Buy that. It always gets the crowd scared.

, Not too much though. Yes, Halloween is all about the candy, but it is also unhealthy. Make some healthy yet tasty creations. It please everyone's taste buds and their teeth!

, Don't let people see lots of clothes and dirty socks on the floor.

, Buy some flashlights and post them around in different places. That will be the source of light.

Select black and orange burlap or tulle.
Use 1 yard/90cm of each fabric for one standard wreath form.

, Cut strips of about 10cm/4 inches and 1.5cm/1/2 inch wide.

, Then tie a bunch of orange strips. Ensure that there is sufficient of each to allow the color to stand out.

, Be generous with the amount of strips added; the fluffier this is, the better it will look.

, What you add is really up to you but some suggestions include:


Wooden cut-outs with Halloween designs, tied on with ribbon or glued on
Ribbon bows in orange and black
Paper cut-outs with Halloween designs, glued in place
Black and orange artificial flowers.

Create a spiral.,
Roll up and secure the felt spiral.,
Repeat for the remaining roses.,
Attach the roses to the wreath form.,
Attach a large ribbon bow at the top or base of the wreath.,
Attach a piece of string or ribbon in a loop for hanging.

,
Hang on the wall or behind a glass door.",How to Make a Halloween Wreath3," Use large sheets, as you'll be cutting many circles from them. This is available from craft stores. For the wreath form, natural is nicest, such as grapevine wreaths. Check your craft store for natural branch-created wreath forms.


You could use fabric in place of felt. For a tutorial on making fabric roses, see How to make a fabric rose.

, Knowing the design in advance will help you to determine just how many roses you need to make. You have a choice to either bunch up the roses together or place them at evenly spaced positions around the wreath. Your choice will depend on the type of wreath form you have (ugly wreath forms will need total coverage, while prettier wreath forms can handle being part of the display). It will also depend on how much time and energy you have to make felt roses.


If you decide to space the felt roses evenly around the wreath, you may like to also add felt leaves in a golden color. This can help the design to keep ""flowing"".

, They don't need to be perfect, so either freehand cut them or trace around a circle if preferred.


The circle size depends on how large you want the roses to be on the wreath. It is recommended that anywhere between 10-25cm/4-10 inches is manageable.

, Cut each felt circle into a spiral shape; start at one edge and cut in a spiral fashion into the center of the circle. It should look like a snake in a spiral when done. You'll get better the more you cut.

, This step creates the first rose.


Begin at the outer edge of the spiral and roll inwards.
As you roll, pinch the base of the spiral; this forms the rose's base.
When done, the spiral looks like a rose. It now needs securing––turn the rose over and stitch the rose together at the back of it; use several stitches for certainty, then knot and tie off. Trim off any excess thread.

, You'll need to make a lot to cover a wreath, so it's recommended that you take breaks and come back to it. Or, get a whole lot of helping hands!

, There are two ways of doing this:


1. Hot glue the roses around the wreath. You'll need to hold each rose in position until it takes. It's a good idea to wiggle the flower base right in to give it something to hold onto.
2. Stitch the roses in place. This will only work with natural wreaths and takes a bit of patience, as you'll need to weave in and out of the wreath as well as through the base of the felt rose.

, Simply tie a big and bountiful bow from the orange ribbon around the wreath and over the top of the roses in that part of the wreath.

,, The felt won't weather well if it is rained on, so don't hang outdoors unless you know it will be safe from the rain.

Tie the string or twine to the top of the wreath for hanging on the front door.,
Done!",How to Make a Halloween Wreath4," Let dry.

, This weatherproofs the wreath for outdoor/front door use.

, Face the candy corn all the same way and don't leave gaps between the joins.

, Go all the way around the circle.


There will be gaps left in between rows; this is not to be worried about, as the black paint will show through nicely.

, Alternate the row direction for the candy corn until you gradually reach the center of the wreath form.

, Let dry.

, This part is optional but adds an extra touch. Ideas for this include:


Black ribbon bows.
Black artificial or paper flowers with a rhinestone for the flower centers.
Black cat, witch or broomstick.
Anything else you like.

, A double sided loop will help it to hang evenly.

, Hang the wreath on the door.

Draw up plans of the rooms based on the scripts, characters, space and props.,
Make the most of the available space.,
Have people hiding behind walls, in empty picture frames, under tables etc.,
Tell your actors NEVER to grab people since this could cause injuries.,
Don't tell people what's inside.",How to Make a London Dungeons Themed Haunted House," You will have a much clearer idea of things you are going to do in your house if you've experienced the real thing for yourself. Make sure to take note of the costumes and ways the actors scare you (jumping out, standing exactly still and staring etc.);
, It doesn't have to be big (you'll see how to make the most of a small space later). Whether it is in a hall or at your house, you must decide on this before planning, since the whole point of the London Dungeons is having different rooms to go into.

, At the London Dungeons they start with an entrance corridor with exhibits, then there's a mirror maze (there will be more on this later), then the plague, the judge, the torture chamber, the boat ride (not the easiest thing to accomplish), Sweeney Todd, jack the ripper and much more.

, This script should also explain what the room looks like, from lighting to sound effects to mangled bodies on the table. You can change this later, so don't worry about being too realistic.

, Ask the ones who are really good at acting to play the big parts with the scripts (the judge, the torture woman, the woman who has the plague etc.) And ask the ones who are not such good actors to play the non speaking parts (all the way through the dungeons there are people jumping out at you, staring at you, following you etc.)

, Believe me, you won't get anywhere without lists. Try to figure out which props you can make rather than buying (coffins etc.) This will save money.

, I would suggest getting them online a few months before Halloween, since everything is so expensive when it's closer to the actual date.

, This will help you when you come to put your house together. You don't have to be a great drawer. Just rough drawings will do.

, Cut up a load of bin bags. Tape them over the rails so that they make a black wall. These walls could then be moved around to create a maze. It also had a really cool affect with strobe lights since the walls reflected the light and made it really disorientating.

, Have them jump out at passers by to really scare them. Also, if you've ever been in the Asylum at Thorpe Park, you'll know how scary it is when people it good make-up and costumes just stand very still and occasionally reach out and touch you.

, If there is going to be contact, make it light strokes of the face like in the Asylum, and warn your visitors before hand that they may get touched.

, It will be much scarier if it's a surprise.

Consider whether it needs something extra.,
Add a hanger to the top of the wreath.

,
Done.",How to Make a Halloween Wreath5," You can use either black or orange, or a mixture of both (alternating the pompoms on the wreath).

, Large pompoms will make a large wreath, while small pompoms will make a smaller wreath. This depends on how much yarn you have and your space requirements.

,, Use a hot glue gun to stick the pompoms to a vine or other wreath form. Keep close together but don't squash the pompoms up.

, The wreath can be hung as it is or you might choose to add a Halloween decoration such as a witch or black cat cut-out or perhaps a big ribbon bow.

,, Hang on the front door or elsewhere.


Suitability for getting wet depends on the yarn make and how soggy it gets. Bear this in mind when hanging outdoors.

Press a hole at the back of the first eyeball rubber ball.,
Push the sharp end of the pin into the foam wreath form.,
Before doing the ""top"" of the wreath, tie a hanger.,
Hang in place on the front door.",How to Make a Halloween Wreath6," Wind the black streamer around and around the entire wreath until covered. Glue in place.


Alternatively, paint the wreath black or even a glow-in-the-dark color.

, This craft can end up being quite painful without it!

, Push the flat head end of the pin into the hole you've just created. Push the pin about halfway in.


Do this for all of the balls. Take plenty of breaks, it's difficult work.

, Repeat, adding each eyeball rubber ball next to the last one, going all the way around the wreath form.

, Use the black ribbon or similar hanging material to make a solid loop. Then add the remaining eyeballs over this part of the wreath.

, Place a black light nearby to help it glow for the trick and treaters.

,  It's fun to re-purpose something sitting around unused at your home--decorative napkins, tissue paper, newsprint, book pages, gauze, or fabric..  Attach the covering to your pumpkin using Mod Podge Water base Sealer, Glue & Finish.  You can apply a little Mod Podge directly to the plastic surface, lay a piece of your covering over the glue, then paint Mod Podge over the top of the covering.  Continue until the entire pumpkin is covered.  Overlap sections of the material being used for your covering.  Apply approximately three coats of Mod Podge over the entire surface, letting each coat dry before the next application.   Let your jack-o-lantern sit and dry for about 24 hours before moving on to step 3. 

,  There's a good chance you will have assorted craft supplies or unused junk at your home that can be used.  Anything can look work, depending on whether you want to create a sophisticated, fun or kooky design.  Some items to consider are felt pieces, trim, rope, raffia, dried beans, beads, natural materials such as pine cones and gourds, hardware, and ribbon.  You will think of many more elements on your own once you start looking around.  Paint and glitter also add a nice touch, either as an embellishment or on their own. 

,  If your covering is not too thick, you can vaguely see the outlines of the eyes, nose and mouth where the covering dips into their contours.  Once you have decided on which objects you will use for the facial features, start attaching them with a glue gun.  Keep in mind that the final piece can be more interesting if you layer various objects or add embellishments.  Just have fun with it.  The simplicity of a simple painted face can also be a successful object d'art.  

,  Ribbon, wire, rafia all work well.  Use your imagination, anything goes.  Try to coordinate all your pieces to complement each other.     

,  Or, stack up three of them to make a pumpkin totem pole that makes a nice centerpiece on your table or kitchen island. 

,  Rather than get pulled into the mayhem and cost of acquiring more stuff for yet another ""holiday,"" get rid of some of the stuff you already have and don't need.  At the same time, you will find an outlet for your pent up creativity.

,
Once dried, start drawing the pupil on the eyeballs.,
Display.",How to Make a Fuzzy Monster Eyeball Wreath for Halloween," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"".;
, You'll be drawing lines to create the template for cutting:


Place the wreath roughly in the middle of the fun fur square.






Outline the outside of the wreath using the marker pen and mark another circle about 3 inches (7.5cm) outside of this outer circle.






Mark a big evenly spaced ""X"" in the middle.






It should now look like a large ""bulls eye"" shape.

, Once the lines are drawn in place, you can begin cutting as follows:


Start with the outer circle.






Return to the inner circle and cut down each line of the cross to the inner circle edge. This will create four ""flaps"".







, Cut each hole about an inch and a half (2cm) but not too much more than that or the balls risk slipping through and won't appear like an eyeball. Place the holes evenly around the whole circle.

, Pinch the fabric where the line is and cut the slit. Repeat this all the way around. Be aware that the fun fur is hard to work with and the fabric pieces will end up everywhere!

,


If the ping pong balls have labels on them, have the label facing away from the outside of the fabric (you should be working on the non-furry side or inside of the fabric).






Push one ball through each hole. Adjust as needed.







, This will seal it up but will take lots of glue, so be prepared to use a lot. Repeat until all the eyeballs have been inserted.

, Ensure that it has dried or you risk burning yourself.

, Be sure to sit it over them neatly.

, Continue until all pieces have been pinned onto the wreath.

, Make small cuts in the outer edge of the fabric to make a smoother finish to the pinned wreath. Cut to a depth of about an inch to an inch and a half (2.5-3cm) every 10 inches (25cm) or so. Then start pinning the cut outer pieces onto the wreath. As you pin, be careful not to pull too much on one side, otherwise the other side will be too short and you'll have to pin it all over again.

, Pull out the pin and glue that piece to the wreath (add glue to both the wreath and the fabric piece). Continue to do this all the way around until all the pinned pieces are glued instead of pinned. This will consume a lot of glue.

,, Do this all the way around. A small black dot is all that's needed.

, Once the eyes are done, the wreath is ready to display. Add some invisible thread for a holder and hang on the door in time for Halloween.
